Like if if Brady needs a first down, he's gonna go to Edelman and that's just gonna like keep the offense moving, whereas Gronk is the guy that finishes drive, so they'll still be okay if he's there and then he got hurt and they weren't the same after that.

And it was ruled a catch and it was obviously a catch, but they decided to look at it anyway because it was under two minutes. He came back and he said, after reviewing the play, it was a good catch. And that was the end of his call. And then he also pantomimed uh Patton making the catch and tapping his getting one foot in and tapping the other one. And he made the the actual tap with his foot and then put his hands up for a touchdown. So that was great. Oh yeah. No, he pulled it off. Uh and he didn't even have to say anything.

Um And of course Patriots were not spoiling anything saying that they win this game because everybody knows at this point how this goes. But the Dolphins would actually finish 11 and 5 and also still make the playoffs along with the the Jets from the AC East. So all three of those guys will make the the playoffs this year.

Uh head coach was Dave Wansted we talked about the man the myth the mustache. Uh let's see. He actually played the pages tough again. Uh this is just recap.

So that focus, I think, has skewed the interception numbers, but I also think that offenses have gotten more creative with the short passing game is what it seems like to me. So they're they're throwing, I mean just look at Drew Breeze and his 70-something percent completion percentage every year now And he's throwing these really accurate short passing games that uh kind of Brady and the the Patriots offense kind of it felt like they started. Yeah I mean I suppose you could probably go back to like the Joe Montana West Coast offense days as well a little bit. But I think with all these like wide receiver bubble screens and those quick short passes that almost replace the running game, the Patriots kind of took to heart and and ran with. Um but going back to your point, Mike, Brady, even in this year, you know, the the guy who you don't think of as throwing exceptions was 18 touchdowns, 12 interceptions on the season. Right. So he was almost like one to one as well. And this was considered a good year for a quarterback the way he he played."

But then they all started to kind of land. Every kickoff was landing at the thirty or forty. And I was like, what the hell is going on?

But it felt like every time they were kicking from right to left is when the Patriots were doing the short kickoffs and the punts were were failing. is when the the two bad punts were. And then as soon as the Patriots scored was in the second quarter, and that's when they started doing the kickoffs, which we hadn't you know, maybe only ever seen the first one, but Yeah, they were doing these like like you said, really high kickoffs that would land at the like the Jets or the excuse me, the Jets, the Dolphins like 30, 35 yard line. Uh And one of those I think you might be right that that maybe the sun did play into it because you could tell that the guys were having trouble fielding it. Because one, they're they're supposed to be blocking anyway, so they're not used to fielding kicks. But then two, it also looked like they were struggling with either the wind or the sun.

And it was one on one and it was like literally on like the one or two yard line. And he he hit Tabucky Jones and it looked like he hit a parked car. Because he just he hit him and he just stopped. Like all his momentum stopped except for the football. And he just like he just went flat as a board and fell the fuck over. And it was such a like old school Patriots hit.

A. KISS Arena Football League team mismanaged and diverted funds from the Florida team he previously owned. The suit filed blah blah blah contends that Brett Bushi committed fraud by profiting from tickets sold by scalpers to Orlando Predator Games. And it said it also said didn't Bushi didn't disclose all of the Florida team's debts when selling his majority share last year. So basically he would um Take like three thousand tickets per game, give them to this group of scalpers, and then they would also put the profits outside of like the actual like ticket sales stuff.",

And McGuinness had uh, I don't know if I wrote the quote down or if I grabbed it, um, talking about the like how he played that play. Where basically he's like, I know I'm coming in. I I'm just like, I'm selling out on the run, but I don't want Man to know that. So he turned and like turned outside to the wide receiver. So it looked like he was gonna hit him before he came. And then he turned back and and manning like just assumed he was going to be in coverage. And so when William McGuinness came back, he he saw that Manning had like, I don't know, tapped his butt or some sort of like signal to know to to say that he was running the ball. And so that's what keyed off William McGuinness to just come like screaming off the edge. And caught Edward James, what, two, three yards in the backfield?

Tom Brady started off hot as hell. He was 11 for 11 uh before he finally missed in the second quarter. Ken Walter already talked about who's garbage. Tony Denji is dumb, which talked about. Uh Peyton Manning, this is the first fumble in the first quarter that he lost in over a year, which I thought was fucking ridiculous. And I think my worst was remembering. about the Colts Peyton Manning no huddle offense where they used to just like not huddle, but Manning would just. like call audibles all the time at the line of scrimmage for like 30 seconds and they put that in Madden and it was the fucking worst Because they'd run no huddle the entire time, but then they would sit there and just like drain the clock down with paint and man just calling audible, audible, audible, audible. And then eventually he'd snap the ball. Omaha! Omaha! Just constantly. Yeah, it was brutal to play against. Games took so long. Um and I've thought this before, I don't think I've said it yet, but Marvin Harrison looks like somebody put the head of a 50-year-old dude on the body of a football player.

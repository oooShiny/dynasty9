# Views Jump Menu

Views Jump Menu offers a Views display style which lets you choose which
field to use as both the label and the destination for each item, and then
generates a <select> list that automatically redirects to whichever
destination is selected.

There are similar modules but they are complex and not available for Drupal 8.
If your needs are simple, and involve D8, this might just be the ticket.

For a full description of the module, visit the

00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:16,000;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:16,000;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:19,640;"I am not your mother."
00:19,640;00:31,280;"Welcome back to yet another playoff podcast, special playoff episode, I guess you could"
00:31,280;00:39,800;"say, the Patriots Dinesley podcast. This week is the 2001 AFC Championship game, which we"
00:39,800;00:46,640;"are subtitling the Drew Bledso Renaissance. I don't know if we are, I made that up literally"
00:46,640;00:52,840;"right now. So nice. Yeah. Glad you like it. With us today, we have the brothers"
00:52,840;00:58,520;"against Stephen Greg. And we also have another special guest who I guess for"

01:03,560;01:15,120;"Steve. Oh, yes. Other one works. Less in the tea. Wow. Off to a rousing start."
01:15,120;01:22,760;"And so yes, last shitty Steve is a Steelers fan."
01:22,760;01:26,480;"So we'll let you call him what you will as listeners."
01:26,480;01:29,000;"So Steve, thanks for joining us."
01:29,000;01:31,280;">> No problem."
01:31,280;01:35,720;">> And you are, as we said, a Steelers fan."
01:35,720;01:36,520;"That is correct, right?"
01:36,520;01:38,440;"You haven't been lying to everybody?"
01:38,440;01:39,560;">> Yeah, 100%."
01:39,560;01:42,640;">> No, he's not going to steal his name."
01:42,640;01:43,120;"His dog is named Heinz."
01:44,240;01:45,240;"No, that's true."
01:45,240;01:46,240;"Indeed."
01:46,240;01:47,600;"After Heinz Ward, not after the stadium."
01:47,600;01:49,760;"Dude, that was what I was wondering actually."
01:49,760;01:51,160;"Not after the catch up."
01:51,160;01:53,360;"Yeah, that's the catch up."
01:53,360;01:54,360;"That's not the catch up."
01:54,360;01:56,840;"The dog does love food, Steve."
01:56,840;01:57,840;"He does love food."
01:57,840;01:58,840;"That's true."
01:58,840;01:59,840;"But what dog doesn't?"
01:59,840;02:02,240;"Oh, he's named after Ben Roth is burger."
02:02,240;02:04,880;"No, that's the next dog."
02:04,880;02:05,880;"Oh, geez."
02:05,880;02:09,680;"Are you going to name your next dog Big Ben or something like that?"
02:09,680;02:12,880;"I mean, if I, my way, yeah, but probably not going to happen."
02:12,880;02:13,880;"God, you got to."
02:13,880;02:16,280;"It carries a negative connotation these days."
02:16,280;02:19,240;"Stop pumping my leg with Big Ben."
02:19,240;02:23,400;"It makes it even worse because I'm an FSU fan."
02:23,400;02:25,600;"So I had to deal with Big Ben and James Winston."
02:25,600;02:30,120;"So how did you get that combination?"
02:30,120;02:32,840;"So where are you from, the Pittsburgh area?"
02:32,840;02:35,320;"My family's from Pittsburgh."
02:35,320;02:39,480;"So I was born there and then we moved to Jacksonville, Florida when I was like two"
02:39,480;02:40,720;"years old or something like that."
02:41,920;02:44,960;"So I just grew up watching all Pittsburgh sports with my grandpa."
02:44,960;02:49,720;"None of them were college fans and I just kind of adopted Florida state growing up in Florida."
02:49,720;02:50,760;"Wow."
02:50,760;02:54,280;"That's a tough one for the draw for like a semester too."
02:54,280;02:57,160;"Yeah, I did go there for a semester. Yeah."
02:57,160;03:00,280;"I know how that goes. I went to Penn State semester."
03:00,280;03:03,240;"That didn't last long."
03:03,240;03:09,800;"All right. So that's I'd say that's reasonable."
03:10,520;03:12,160;"We've had some other fans on here."
03:12,160;03:17,120;"We had a last week we had a Raiders fan on who became a Raiders fan because of hip hop."
03:17,120;03:18,680;"Yeah."
03:18,680;03:20,160;"Whoa."
03:20,160;03:20,640;"Okay."
03:20,640;03:23,240;"Yeah, we don't, we don't fan base judge around here."
03:23,240;03:23,640;"Okay."
03:23,640;03:24,720;"No, that's what I'm saying."
03:24,720;03:29,160;"It was just, I'm always curious to know how people got into this, like, got into"
03:29,160;03:31,600;"following a certain team, especially if they're not living in that area."
03:31,600;03:33,000;"So it's kind of cool."
03:33,000;03:36,240;"So all right."
03:36,240;03:39,160;"So we're talking about the 2001 sealers."
03:39,520;03:41,520;"And before this, before we start recording,"
03:41,520;03:46,360;"not Shady Steve was saying that you were, what,"
03:46,360;03:48,040;"like nine years old at the time?"
03:48,040;03:50,200;"- Yeah, I mean, that's probably,"
03:50,200;03:51,640;"I think I was like 11 or 12."
03:51,640;03:53,540;"I was still pretty young."
03:53,540;03:56,440;"You know, and I, that was like only my second"
03:56,440;03:59,520;"or third year really following football."
03:59,520;04:00,720;"I remember like a couple of years before that,"
04:00,720;04:02,440;"we weren't very good."
04:02,440;04:06,240;"And that was the first year in Heinz Field, actually."
04:06,240;04:07,080;"- Oh, that's right."
04:07,080;04:08,680;"- Was that 2000 one season?"
04:08,680;04:13,680;"Yeah. Yeah, because everybody had trouble kicking in that, uh, that one end zone,"
04:13,680;04:14,960;"kicking field goals."
04:14,960;04:17,280;"We had to open in that open to the river there."
04:17,280;04:18,360;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
04:18,360;04:21,200;"Including Chris Brown this, this season."
04:21,200;04:23,040;"Our cousin. Yeah."
04:23,040;04:27,120;"He's here every time a Brown is mentioned."
04:27,120;04:28,480;"All Browns are cousins."
04:28,480;04:34,000;"That's weird. But all right. Um, we're not cousins, Steve. You and me."
04:34,000;04:36,360;"That's true. I wish."
04:36,360;04:37,560;"A loophole."
04:37,560;04:42,560;"Yeah, because I like it up in Chris Brown."
04:42,560;04:44,080;"I was wondering what was going on"
04:44,080;04:47,960;"'cause he made 68% of his field goals this season,"
04:47,960;04:51,120;"which was not great."
04:51,120;04:51,960;"Yeah."
04:51,960;04:54,480;"- Nope."
04:54,480;04:55,960;"- It's like bot is kick-re-level."
04:55,960;04:59,080;"- Yeah, it's definitely on that level,"
04:59,080;05:00,840;"but he still played the whole season."
05:00,840;05:04,720;"And I think this is his only season."
05:04,720;05:06,880;"Not for the Steelers, he didn't know."
05:06,880;05:10,880;"Okay. I think you went out to play for the Texans for a few years."
05:10,880;05:13,080;"It did okay because he was in the."
05:13,080;05:17,240;"Yeah, I don't remember if there was a kicker between him and Jeff Reed,"
05:17,240;05:19,600;"but I want to say Jeff Reed years were shortly after."
05:19,600;05:20,160;"That could be."
05:20,160;05:23,680;"Yeah, he did not last long."
05:23,680;05:26,280;"So do you remember watching this game live, Steve?"
05:26,280;05:29,240;"Yeah, I do actually."
05:29,240;05:34,560;"I remember watching that whole playoffs live like the week before we had beaten"
05:34,560;05:40,320;"Ravens they were the only loss we had had in high and field that year and that was actually Tony Sarah Gusev's last game"
05:40,320;05:47,400;"For the Ravens and it or fall time actually period he retired after that season and then so we were the number one seed"
05:47,400;05:49,640;"I remember thinking for sure we were gonna"
05:49,640;05:57,040;"You know go to the Super Bowl. Obviously that did not happen. So yeah, I don't think you're alone in that everybody thought the"
05:57,040;06:03,680;"The page is gonna get stomped in this game and the Ravens the week before they were the defending Super Bowl champions too"
06:04,000;06:10,440;"Yep, yeah, that was a big crush. I think like 27 to 10 the week before yeah, yeah absolutely annihilated"
06:10,440;06:14,720;"And I still remember"
06:14,720;06:20,040;"Cuz I this was the one game I didn't watch of the playoffs because I was working at the time"
06:20,040;06:25,000;"Yeah, I was working at that"
06:25,000;06:30,060;"That retirement home like in the kitchen cleaning dishes"
06:30,240;06:36,080;"So I had a little like portable FM radio with me and would only pick up the game in one spot in the kitchen"
06:36,080;06:41,880;"So I'd like run to that spot in the kitchen and stand there in a certain position to make sure I got the"
06:41,880;06:45,320;"Reception and then run back and clean some dishes and keep going back and forth"
06:45,320;06:48,280;"So"
06:48,280;06:51,720;"Radio sports"
06:51,720;06:56,080;"Yeah, it is so I would clean dishes between like in current commercial breaks"
06:57,280;07:00,100;"So this is actually the first time I watched this full game"
07:00,100;07:06,260;"Really? Yeah, I didn't realize but I'm like, I don't remember any of this like I've seen the highlights and stuff obviously a bunch"
07:06,260;07:08,260;"Right, I don't remember like half of these plays"
07:08,260;07:14,280;"Yeah, cuz that was a thing too. You couldn't really look up games after the fact there like now we can just you know"
07:14,280;07:20,240;"They'll show it on NFL replay you find it online. We're back then you missed the game. You fucked you watch"
07:20,240;07:25,120;"Prime time on Sunday night, but I'll give you like a four-minute clip. Yeah, exactly. Yeah"
07:25,800;07:30,420;"Just highlights. Yeah, this game on YouTube the beginning of the game"
07:30,420;07:37,380;"Gil and Gino the radio announcer said something along lines of I'm happy to report that despite all the prognostications of doom"
07:37,380;07:41,940;"The Patriots have shown up here today and will take the field against the Steelers"
07:41,940;07:48,560;"And that was like how he led into this because I love it heavily favored the Steelers were yeah"
07:48,560;07:51,060;"I mean, that's a pretty that's a pretty good"
07:52,420;07:59,380;"Steelers team though like you look at that roster. Oh, yeah, there's a shitload of names that jump out. Do you have any favorite Steve?"
07:59,380;08:03,620;"Yeah, I remember well you didn't turn out to be my favorites"
08:03,620;08:06,600;"But it was actually the first jersey I ever bought and that was Ken drill Bell"
08:06,600;08:10,580;"Linebacker for the really really I think yeah"
08:10,580;08:17,340;"You've been to rookie of the year. Yeah, I think yeah, I heard them mention that yeah, yeah"
08:18,620;08:23,980;"Yeah, so he's like the defensive rookie of the year that year and I was like a huge fan and then he had that great season"
08:23,980;08:30,980;"Kind of filled out ended up in Kansas City and didn't really pan out there. I think only played like four or five years in the league actually"
08:30,980;08:33,580;"What other players on my TV have jerseys of I?"
08:33,580;08:37,020;"Had a Cordell Stewart jersey"
08:37,020;08:39,340;"Had a Heinz Ward jersey"
08:39,340;08:41,340;"Which I still have actually"
08:41,340;08:45,440;"Seeing that I think that's it from that from those years actually"
08:47,660;08:50,760;"Oh and drone bet is actually oh really I was"
08:50,760;08:56,460;"Yeah, I was looking at the roster. I'm like oh good. He didn't have a bet is and then you said that"
08:56,460;09:03,460;"Don't anymore like I was when I was way smaller, but yeah, he's have a bet is Jersey"
09:03,460;09:09,060;"What it what is your like general like memories of Jerome bet is because he's a he's a"
09:09,060;09:12,700;"He's a vintage type player, you know. Oh, yeah"
09:13,140;09:19,940;"Yeah, oh, yeah, I mean I actually got to meet him once at a Steelers jagwires game. I think it might have been this year that year actually"
09:19,940;09:22,820;"It was like so the Steelers were in Jacksonville"
09:22,820;09:25,100;"we hung out near the buses after the game and"
09:25,100;09:28,060;"Got the shake of hand and got his autograph on a football"
09:28,060;09:30,740;"But I remember I was pretty young at the time"
09:30,740;09:35,940;"But I just remember how massive he frickin looked like his legs look like tree trunks and just like I"
09:35,940;09:39,300;"Mean he definitely wasn't like the prettiest running back"
09:39,300;09:43,820;"But he was good to get you, you know, three and a half or four yards a carry just straight up the gut"
09:43,820;09:47,980;"One of my favorite memories. I remember when he just absolutely trucked Brian Erlacher"
09:47,980;09:54,520;"In a game in Chicago. So yeah, I was used that as man. Stat check that Greg"
09:54,520;09:58,380;"Stat check what"
09:58,380;10:01,220;"I don't know Steve's memory"
10:01,220;10:06,860;"Did he ever yeah, we're 3.9 yards a carry over his career. Yeah, okay Steve. I"
10:07,460;10:10,900;"Think it's the only hall of fame running back that average less than four yards of carry"
10:10,900;10:17,740;"Oh, remember his stats were always like four carries three yards two touchdowns sort of thing"
10:17,740;10:24,660;"Yeah, like that was he definitely had a few games like that towards the end of his career. Yeah"
10:24,660;10:29,620;"Well, you know, I'm gonna give you a play-by-play of the stat check"
10:29,620;10:35,460;"Sure sure we're in the snow here from the five yard line"
10:35,660;10:37,300;"Roth is burger, hands it off the bed."
10:37,300;10:41,540;"Erlachor fills the gap and he just gets"
10:41,540;10:42,540;"trucked."
10:42,540;10:48,140;"That is just like stood him up and then just kept churning"
10:48,140;10:50,940;"until he like it was like a looked like a meat grinder."
10:50,940;10:54,980;"You just got caught underneath the bus."
10:54,980;10:57,220;"That's what happens."
10:57,220;10:59,100;"Yeah, what a great nickname."
10:59,100;11:01,460;"One of the all-time great football nicknames."
11:01,460;11:05,060;"Do one of my like memories of this game actually was like,"
11:05,380;11:13,660;"I was like 10 years old and like the bus was the big nickname going around and I remember thinking like"
11:13,660;11:22,180;"Oh, the school bus doesn't run on Sundays. I think I was like the cleverest little shit. I was like,"
11:22,180;11:23,940;"""Man, I'm gonna make a poster board."""
11:23,940;11:29,220;"Did you? I don't think I ever did it, but"
11:29,220;11:29,700;"That's a lot."
11:29,700;11:30,620;"That's what I would do."
11:30,620;11:31,420;"Yeah."
11:31,420;11:33,940;"I mean, he was wearing yellow, so"
11:34,500;11:37,420;"And it was going to be like a picture of like a broken down bus."
11:37,420;11:39,700;"I don't all thing that I was going to do."
11:39,700;11:43,140;"So, uh,"
11:43,140;11:43,580;"Steve,"
11:43,580;11:45,980;"not even the Steelers all time leading Russia."
11:45,980;11:48,980;"Wait, all right, let's trivia this."
11:48,980;11:50,580;"Let's trivia this. We can get this guys."
11:50,580;11:53,420;"Uh, Frank Harris,"
11:53,420;11:54,820;"Frank Harris would be my guess."
11:54,820;11:56,500;"Yeah. Yeah. It's Franco Harris."
11:56,500;11:57,220;"Oh, it is. Okay."
11:57,220;12:01,620;"Because yeah, the bus played his first three seasons with the Rams."
12:01,620;12:03,500;"Oh, that's right. He did."
12:03,500;12:18,500;"I forgot about those years. I had no idea about that. The only Rams. Yeah, that's when he was called the battering ram. Oh, wow, what also a great name. Yeah. Yeah."
12:18,500;12:28,500;"Yeah, he was a he was a round mound of rushing yards. It didn't rhyme. Yeah, round mound of touchdown. Geez, Andy."
12:28,500;12:30,500;"That doesn't rhyme either, you fucking idiot."
12:30,500;12:31,820;"This is dumb."
12:31,820;12:36,380;"You mean it doesn't doesn't end with a D."
12:36,380;12:39,180;"OK, and it's how rhyming works."
12:39,180;12:41,260;"It is you fucking God."
12:41,260;12:41,780;"Damn it."
12:41,780;12:42,900;"Godly."
12:42,900;12:44,100;"I'm not even going to look up the way."
12:44,100;12:45,140;"But fuck it."
12:45,140;12:46,900;"Oh, you want to static check?"
12:46,900;12:48,540;"No, it's just that check."
12:48,540;12:51,780;"Does mountain down rhyme."
12:51,780;12:55,220;"All right."
12:55,220;12:55,980;"Good, Steve."
12:57,220;12:59,140;"And that is less shitty Steve."
12:59,140;13:01,380;"He was until you guys are shooting on me."
13:01,380;13:02,420;"Now he's good Steve."
13:02,420;13:05,420;"I like him better the more I talk to you."
13:05,420;13:14,060;"As a as a Steelers fan, what's your view of the Patriots?"
13:14,060;13:16,780;"Because we've got we've got a bunch of answers when we ask this question."
13:16,780;13:21,580;"Yeah, I mean, like, I think it's obvious."
13:21,580;13:24,220;"I have like a lot of respect for them and what they've been able to do."
13:25,220;13:30,420;"just kind of ridiculous the success they've had. But also like, I'd be lying if I wouldn't say it's a"
13:30,420;13:33,700;"little bitter towards them as well because I just think of all the Super Bowls that"
13:33,700;13:39,620;"stewards would have the looking for fellow check and Brady. So yeah, I feel as if in particular"
13:39,620;13:46,580;"have been whipping boys. Yeah, I was gonna say you're saying more than anybody else in the playoffs,"
13:46,580;13:53,380;"but yeah, yeah, for sure. We have had a great record against Pittsburgh, especially in the big"
13:53,380;13:53,880;"Oh yeah."
13:53,880;13:56,180;"In the playoffs, especially."
13:56,180;13:56,480;"Yeah."
13:56,480;14:00,480;"Yeah, I mean, you even look at the two years that the Steelers won the Super Bowl"
14:00,480;14:01,680;"with Raupusberger."
14:01,680;14:04,380;"We didn't play the Patriots because they got knocked out."
14:04,380;14:07,280;"I think one year by the Ravens."
14:07,280;14:08,480;"I'm not sure of the other year."
14:08,480;14:09,280;"The other."
14:09,280;14:10,280;"But yeah."
14:10,280;14:11,480;"Yeah."
14:11,480;14:16,480;"How has knowing me change your opinion of the Patriots?"
14:16,480;14:17,880;"Not for the better."
14:17,880;14:18,880;"Oh, it made it worse."
14:21,880;14:23,280;"That's 100% real."
14:23,280;14:24,760;"Wow."
14:24,760;14:29,760;"The pankers have only ever played the Steelers like since like the"
14:29,760;14:34,480;"Belichick Brady era in the AFC conference game in the AFC"
14:34,480;14:35,080;"championship game."
14:35,080;14:39,920;"No, I can't believe it even bended two games in Pittsburgh."
14:39,920;14:45,600;"Yeah, and they're both those 2001, 2004 and 2016."
14:45,600;14:48,400;"And you can tell how to play back to the playoffs."
14:48,400;14:49,480;"Yeah, in the playoffs."
14:50,120;14:54,480;"They only playoff games the pages of played against Steelers have been in the AFC"
14:54,480;15:03,000;"championships, which is probably why for Steve it hurts that much more because it's that last game to get in the Super Bowl. Yeah, can't get up."
15:03,000;15:09,440;"I think two of those games were in Pittsburgh, maybe they were. I know the first one."
15:09,440;15:11,280;"Yeah. Yeah."
15:11,280;15:12,200;"Four was as well."
15:12,200;15:18,040;"Because that was that cold game when you guys had is Rothwesberger's rookie year, I think."
15:18,480;15:27,960;"Rookie year. Yeah, one 15 and one. Yeah. Yep. 15 and one and I mean, I'm not gonna complain too much because they came back and one at the next year, but yeah, that's right."
15:27,960;15:28,800;"Would have been nice though."
15:28,800;15:39,000;"Get that one. That because that year we beat we beat the Patriots and the Eagles and I think it was like within three weeks of each other."
15:39,000;15:40,880;"That we are not over."
15:40,880;15:46,840;"The Steelers victory or the Patriots was the one that broke their 21 game win streak."
15:47,200;15:49,500;"Oh, yeah, remember that game on Halloween."
15:49,500;15:51,160;"Yes."
15:51,160;15:52,160;"Yep."
15:52,160;15:55,260;"How much candy did you eat, Greg, to get over that?"
15:55,260;15:56,620;"I don't know."
15:56,620;15:58,360;"I remember that it was Halloween, but I don't."
15:58,360;16:02,100;"But you said that more than once, I think."
16:02,100;16:05,760;"Oh boy."
16:05,760;16:06,600;"All right."
16:06,600;16:08,920;"So I got a question for good, Steve."
16:08,920;16:11,920;"I thought he was less shitty."
16:11,920;16:13,760;"Steve was."
16:13,760;16:15,760;"He's growing on us."
16:15,760;16:19,000;"So, uh, Bill Cowar or Mike Tomlin?"
16:19,000;16:20,080;"Were you taking?"
16:20,080;16:22,640;"Oh, that's tough."
16:22,640;16:25,840;"Um, honestly, I'm a big Mike Tomlin fan."
16:25,840;16:31,360;"I mean, I love Cowar, but, you know, I think it's, I, I, especially after everything"
16:31,360;16:33,280;"that came out with Antonio Brown this year."
16:33,280;16:33,640;"Yeah."
16:33,640;16:38,080;"I have a lot of from Mike Tomlin and like, I'm just keeping that under wraps for as"
16:38,080;16:38,880;"long as he did."
16:38,880;16:39,560;"That's fair."
16:39,560;16:43,000;"So yeah, I still think he's pretty young."
16:43,000;16:44,600;"I think it's got more Super Bowls ahead of them."
16:44,600;16:52,120;"Yeah, I mean, as far as like keeping a culture together outside of the pads."
16:52,120;16:53,120;"Yeah."
16:53,120;16:59,560;"It's, you know, you talk about like spanning more than 10 years with having like consistently"
16:59,560;17:00,960;"winning seasons."
17:00,960;17:01,960;"Yeah."
17:01,960;17:05,400;"Steve, I mean, Patriots Steelers called Steve."
17:05,400;17:06,400;"Called Steve."
17:06,400;17:08,440;"But Tomlin or Chuck."
17:08,440;17:11,240;"Yeah, and obviously what's that?"
17:11,240;17:12,800;"Tomlin or Chuck Knoll."
17:12,800;17:17,560;"Well I wasn't alive during the 70s so I mean I mean obviously goal had a lot"
17:17,560;17:22,900;"more success than Collins had but I can't even yeah I can't even really comment"
17:22,900;17:27,560;"on that I really claim that Lance all worth"
17:27,560;17:35,200;"well underneath my dog after I'm gonna go with my work like best blocking wide"
17:35,200;17:40,400;"receiver in NFL history yeah I have to say after watching this game I remember"
17:40,400;17:42,700;"the fury that he would instill in me."
17:42,700;17:46,940;"Oh, he was one of those guys that I think kind of like the"
17:46,940;17:50,040;"Rodney Harrison of the team where you fucking love him if he's"
17:50,040;17:50,680;"on your team."
17:50,680;17:53,960;"Yeah, it's gonna be like that fucking dirty fuck."
17:53,960;17:54,240;"Yeah."
17:54,240;17:55,760;"I hope he stays in battle."
17:55,760;17:56,040;"Yeah."
17:56,040;18:05,960;"I think he broke Keith Rivers jaw like you're talking a"
18:05,960;18:06,960;"line back up at the bank."
18:06,960;18:07,400;"Right."
18:07,400;18:07,720;"Yeah."
18:07,920;18:10,720;"I mean, he was vicious."
18:10,720;18:14,120;"Didn't that kind of start the whole like Steelers,"
18:14,120;18:15,420;"Bengals, few too?"
18:15,420;18:18,580;"I mean, I think it was."
18:18,580;18:20,340;"The Bengals still sucks for a few more years."
18:20,340;18:23,480;"Yeah, but the game for always like super chippy after that, though."
18:23,480;18:24,880;"Like I said, oh, yeah."
18:24,880;18:25,820;"That's the play."
18:25,820;18:28,380;"And I mean, they actually, the NFL changed the rules because of"
18:28,380;18:30,140;"Hines Ward with a lot of those blocks."
18:30,140;18:33,780;"So you couldn't get away today with like what you used to do."
18:33,780;18:37,500;"So I mean, jujoo Smith, she was just still doing it."
18:37,500;18:41,900;"to what the fuck yeah and you got a suspension for it but I'm okay with that"
18:41,900;18:46,500;"because I'm perfect so piece of shit that was yes and then he stood over him I"
18:46,500;18:51,260;"think that's what got on the yeah yes I mean perfect probably had that coming"
18:51,260;18:56,540;"oh he's oh yeah I was watching that game with you Steve that playoff game"
18:56,540;19:01,700;"against the Bengals and perfect oh yeah we were in a game that I'll be muggle"
19:01,700;19:11,740;"whatever it was. Yeah. You're super hot that too. You know, the pop culture rep, the equivalent"
19:11,740;19:18,900;"of that is is of the, the Vontes perfect thing is, uh, Weinstein getting coronavirus."
19:18,900;19:24,660;"Where you're like, yeah, I don't want to see it happen to anybody, but if it was going to happen"
19:24,660;19:27,660;"someone that's the guy that asshole"
19:27,660;19:36,100;"that's a good one. I like that. It's a deep"
19:36,100;19:39,360;"that when you got there, I was worried. That's why I had to"
19:39,360;19:44,580;"interrupt whoever interrupted. I appreciate it."
19:44,580;19:52,620;"All right, so here's a here's a good question for you. We"
19:52,620;19:58,620;"haven't had great luck. Well, I haven't had great luck asking this question to other people because we've been asking Panthers and Raiders fans."
19:58,620;20:02,620;"They there weren't any, but do you have a favorite Patriots stealer game?"
20:02,620;20:12,620;"Yeah, I mean, actually, I mean, unfortunately, it didn't turn out that great for us for the season, but the game two years ago on a Heinz"
20:12,620;20:17,620;"field where the Steelers wanted with an interception by Joe Hayden at the end of the game. Oh, right."
20:17,620;20:22,420;"That was actually at that game. So I don't know the blast. It's a good game to be a"
20:22,420;20:25,140;"Yeah, me and Shitty Steve were there. So"
20:25,140;20:32,500;"Steve, you might have a new name. We were also at the year before when"
20:32,500;20:38,260;"Walthus Burger fakes we were picked it. Oh, that is probably my like other than the AFC"
20:38,260;20:42,980;"championship game. That is definitely like my least favorite. I was red hot. I came with"
20:42,980;20:44,840;"which AFC championship game."
20:44,840;20:49,880;"This was another was in the championship game where I said other than the"
20:49,880;20:50,880;"AFC championship game."
20:50,880;20:51,680;"Yeah, but which one?"
20:51,680;20:53,480;"So the past there was three where we beat you."
20:53,480;20:55,180;"Yeah. Three times."
20:55,180;20:55,980;"Yeah, probably."
20:55,980;20:56,980;"Yeah."
20:56,980;20:58,280;"Hey, you were a game away."
20:58,280;20:59,780;"This was like number four."
20:59,780;21:00,280;"Watch it."
21:00,280;21:02,180;"What's that?"
21:02,180;21:05,580;"Is this like the that was that fake spike one, the fourth one or"
21:05,580;21:08,680;"your fourth least favorite?"
21:08,680;21:10,180;"Like my fourth least favorite."
21:10,180;21:10,480;"Right."
21:10,480;21:13,880;"right or does one of the AC championships really stick out as like, uh,"
21:13,880;21:18,360;"Oh, I mean definitely 2004 really sticks out."
21:18,360;21:20,920;"Like, yeah, I mean, we're 15 and one."
21:20,920;21:21,880;"I thought we were going all the way."
21:21,880;21:22,520;"Yeah."
21:22,520;21:26,560;"I mean, even, even in 2001, these, this steel team was a fucking wagon."
21:26,560;21:27,400;"Yeah."
21:27,400;21:28,360;"Yeah."
21:28,360;21:28,880;"Yeah."
21:28,880;21:30,640;"Yeah."
21:30,640;21:31,200;"I had it here."
21:31,200;21:40,240;"They, they were first in, uh, rushing yards and yard and like rushing"
21:40,240;21:44,040;"defense in both yards and touchdowns."
21:44,040;21:47,300;"Like they weren't fucking unstoppable on the ground."
21:47,300;21:51,440;"And yet in this game, it felt like they just didn't even run it for whatever."
21:51,440;21:51,680;"Yeah."
21:51,680;21:54,120;"Like they came out swinging the ball."
21:54,120;21:54,640;"Yeah, I don't."
21:54,640;21:56,080;"Yeah."
21:56,080;21:59,120;"I mean, Cordell, through three, three interceptions, I think in that game."
21:59,120;22:00,040;"Yeah."
22:00,040;22:00,560;"We'll get there."
22:00,560;22:03,280;"He went by and he went by and he went by and he went by and he went by."
22:03,280;22:06,400;"You want to know my favorite Patriots Steelers game?"
22:06,400;22:07,380;"Yes."
22:07,840;22:15,520;"1996 fog bowl. Oh, remember that? No, barely. I do not know."
22:15,520;22:20,320;"It was the Patriots first ever home playoff game. True blood so"
22:20,320;22:24,960;"entire Glenn. Yes. Versus Neil O'Donnell and the Steelers."
22:24,960;22:26,640;"Holy shit, Neil O'Donnell. The guys in the"
22:26,640;22:30,640;"having a lift. Yeah. Greg Lloyd. Remember Greg Lloyd, the"
22:30,640;22:34,240;"linebacker for the Steelers? I was a linebacker. Yeah."
22:34,960;22:42,960;"Dude, Steelers linebackers, there are different breed, I feel like, because they always have that like cool, like predator face mask."
22:42,960;22:43,600;"They all do."
22:43,600;22:46,480;"The lack helmets."
22:46,480;22:47,320;"Yeah."
22:47,320;22:50,720;"And they're just like fucking terrifying looking people."
22:50,720;22:53,160;"They could wait so we could J."
22:53,160;22:54,960;"Day Wat next year on the other side of T."
22:54,960;22:55,520;"Jay Wat."
22:55,520;22:56,560;"Oh, Jesus Christ."
22:56,560;23:00,440;"Oh, I saw that article, but I didn't read it because it looked shitty."
23:00,440;23:04,840;"Well, what is the rumor going around, though?"
23:04,840;23:10,840;"I don't think there's real any legs to it, but there is."
23:10,840;23:12,840;"I mean, we got his brother."
23:12,840;23:16,840;"We got two of the brothers now and I think JJ would love to play for the Steelers."
23:16,840;23:20,840;"Just kind of what we hear, you know, a message boards or whatever, but I just don't really think it'll happen."
23:20,840;23:21,840;"I don't know."
23:21,840;23:24,840;"Second we did the trade him for a bag of practice balls or something like that."
23:24,840;23:25,840;"This is true."
23:25,840;23:27,840;"I mean, you already didn't want to love Brian here."
23:27,840;23:31,840;"So like maybe we could just offer them like, you know, shoot."
23:31,840;23:36,840;"I know, yes, like it's just around say Brown's expiring contract."
23:36,840;23:37,840;"Yeah."
23:37,840;23:43,200;"Speaking of which, like thank God for the Raiders."
23:43,200;23:49,040;"Like we absolutely cooked into town with both Brown and frickin Marchavus Bryant the last"
23:49,040;23:50,040;"three years."
23:50,040;23:51,040;"Oh shit."
23:51,040;23:52,040;"That's right."
23:52,040;23:53,840;"I don't know what the Marchavus Bryant thing."
23:53,840;23:54,840;"Man."
23:54,840;24:00,240;"So basically the Raiders are where wide receivers go to die basically, right?"
24:00,240;24:01,240;"Yep."
24:01,240;24:03,120;"- You're Brady Moss as well, yeah."
24:03,120;24:06,760;"And Jerry Rice to a certain extent."
24:06,760;24:09,560;"- Yeah, he was good in there."
24:09,560;24:11,760;"- Yeah, but I think he had like still a thousand yards"
24:11,760;24:13,040;"season while there, I'm pretty sure."
24:13,040;24:13,880;"- He did, yeah."
24:13,880;24:15,920;"This is 2001 season actually, yeah."
24:15,920;24:19,880;"So."
24:19,880;24:24,360;"- All right, you boys have any more questions for good Steve?"
24:24,360;24:26,640;"- No, I'm just gonna make Steve relive that moment"
24:26,640;24:28,960;"when we were at that fake spike game together."
24:30,160;24:30,660;"Did I?"
24:30,660;24:31,860;"I was really cool."
24:31,860;24:35,820;"I talked to you after that game, Steve, and you were shit faced."
24:35,820;24:37,420;"What do you have?"
24:37,420;24:38,540;"What's Steve?"
24:38,540;24:40,180;"Shitty Steve."
24:40,180;24:41,980;"Shitty Steve."
24:41,980;24:42,660;"Yeah."
24:42,660;24:44,420;"Like I'm a I'm a trooper."
24:44,420;24:47,960;"Like I love going to games and away games and interpreting at them."
24:47,960;24:50,700;"I didn't say anything after that game."
24:50,700;24:56,580;"Cause everyone there was just like there was so shell shock, angry."
24:57,420;24:59,700;"And I was like, yeah, you know, the rest fucked you, but"
24:59,700;25:01,540;"Roblesberger fucked you harder."
25:01,540;25:02,580;"And they're like, yeah."
25:02,580;25:05,260;"So good."
25:05,260;25:06,620;"Steve, is this story true?"
25:06,620;25:09,780;"Oh, yeah, that's definitely true."
25:09,780;25:10,140;"He didn't."
25:10,140;25:14,020;"That's the one time that, you know, shitty"
25:14,020;25:17,380;"Steve has not talked shit after a game when the Steelers are another Pittsburgh"
25:17,380;25:18,020;"team lost."
25:18,020;25:19,460;"Ah, Greg, you owe me five bucks."
25:19,460;25:20,300;"He can read a room."
25:20,300;25:22,180;"Yeah, right."
25:25,580;25:27,900;"It that was a tough one."
25:27,900;25:29,140;"Yeah, it was."
25:29,140;25:31,580;"Yeah, because it was like the rest."
25:31,580;25:35,340;"Yeah, the rest really, I mean, I think they got that call wrong."
25:35,340;25:39,340;"And then it was compounded by just like a dreadful decision by big"
25:39,340;25:40,740;"just, you know, all of it."
25:40,740;25:42,580;"But yeah, just the factor."
25:42,580;25:44,420;"Like how much time to go to."
25:44,420;25:48,420;"Just anything else, literally anything else would have worked."
25:48,420;25:49,060;"Yeah."
25:49,060;25:50,220;"But like that game was so bad."
25:50,220;25:53,540;"What else like the pages shy before that where he just goes to"
25:53,540;25:57,540;"the Gronk over and over again, just storms down the field, just"
25:57,540;25:59,240;"sling it to Gronk for the touchdown."
25:59,240;26:03,140;"And then that drag round, where he ran everybody."
26:03,140;26:04,500;"But that"
26:04,500;26:06,140;"was all within like two minutes."
26:06,140;26:06,740;"It was crazy."
26:06,740;26:10,640;"Yeah, the Gronk touchdown spike where he like he caught the touchdown,"
26:10,640;26:13,420;"pointed at the guy who was covering, who was laying on the ground, laughed at him,"
26:13,420;26:17,040;"and then spiked it is is seared in my memory."
26:17,040;26:20,140;"Like that to me is is Rob Gronkowski."
26:21,140;26:23,060;"That was our end of the stadium to where"
26:23,060;26:24,140;"Broncos are piking that."
26:24,140;26:24,640;"Yeah."
26:24,640;26:30,140;"Fucking hell."
26:30,140;26:33,780;"I thought you would strip up to, you know, Boston next time"
26:33,780;26:35,060;"the dealer trip there."
26:35,060;26:37,820;"Yeah, we're going to do it this past year, but it was opening."
26:37,820;26:38,860;"No, super."
26:38,860;26:40,380;"Yeah, I'm not."
26:40,380;26:42,780;"Yeah, I'm not paying one drop in a grand to go to that."
26:42,780;26:44,780;"Yeah."
26:44,780;26:47,900;"Probably a good decision, especially after the result of that,"
26:47,900;26:50,940;"too, that would not have been worth it for you."
26:50,940;26:53,220;"No. Oh yeah, that'd have been, that would have been shitty."
26:53,220;26:54,780;"And that was a shit show."
26:54,780;26:56,820;"That's a bad game."
26:56,820;26:58,700;"Well, for you."
26:58,700;27:01,060;"So many for me."
27:01,060;27:04,300;"Yeah, well, I don't know."
27:04,300;27:06,620;"Maybe the, I got nothing."
27:06,620;27:07,740;"Yes, I may be able to tell you."
27:07,740;27:09,620;"I got the penguins the last five years."
27:09,620;27:12,460;"So it's cool. That's true."
27:12,460;27:15,540;"And FSU, I guess, maybe."
27:15,540;27:17,460;"Yeah, they've been pretty bad the last few years."
27:17,460;27:18,660;"Yeah."
27:18,660;27:20,380;"Oh, you sure know how to pick them?"
27:20,580;27:26,820;"They had their 41 straight seasons of a bowl game snap or winning record snaps a couple years ago"
27:26,820;27:30,020;"Yeah"
27:30,020;27:35,220;"Willy tagger was awful. Don't even get started on college football. You're so high on them, too. Oh my god. It was hilarious"
27:35,220;27:38,260;"Yeah"
27:38,260;27:44,740;"All right, Steve well, I guess if nobody else has any questions I think we will"
27:44,740;27:48,140;"Mercifully let you go"
27:48,340;27:51,940;"Appreciate you being a good sport about this and"
27:51,940;27:59,220;"Listen to the yeah, no problem. Enjoy the uh reliving that glorious game for you all and I'm going on to win it"
27:59,220;28:00,420;"So"
28:00,420;28:03,780;"Thanks for coming on Steve. Good Steve. I brought have a good one guys"
28:03,780;28:08,180;"All right, see you later. Bye"
28:08,180;28:13,380;"I gotta say it doesn't sound like a Steelers fan does he?"
28:14,820;28:20,120;"He's a hardcore Steelers fan for sure. Yeah, he just doesn't sound like it doesn't he doesn't talk like a Steelers fan"
28:20,120;28:27,580;"Whoa, yeah, I don't know I think you didn't say yes once I like Pittsburgh like I like the people there"
28:27,580;28:37,920;"Games there they're just like yes, yeah, that's very it's like a hilly boss and people are very like way into their sports"
28:37,920;28:42,680;"You know you drive around New England you see a Patriots stickers and Bruins stickers and sock stickers everywhere"
28:43,260;28:47,720;"Everyone's wearing stuff. It's like that in Pittsburgh too. Yeah, where's this their sports everywhere?"
28:47,720;28:52,400;"Yeah, because Pittsburgh isn't really a huge college sports. How is it now?"
28:52,400;28:55,100;"basketball there either"
28:55,100;28:56,860;"But yeah, it's not it's not a huge"
28:56,860;29:02,340;"But they're like a big sports and saw kind of blue-collary people are like yeah"
29:02,340;29:06,580;"They'll be like assholes, but like they're not gonna beat you up either, right?"
29:06,580;29:08,580;"You can yeah shit the people"
29:08,700;29:14,040;"Holy shit now that you say that I actually just had a memory because this was I"
29:14,040;29:18,320;"Don't know why but oh, I think I"
29:18,320;29:22,440;"Think we had to go back and get on my shit from Penn State"
29:22,440;29:27,080;"So we drove down there packed up the van and we're driving back"
29:27,080;29:30,960;"We stopped it like the fucking steakhouse or something like that on the way and it must have been"
29:30,960;29:34,680;"I don't even think it was in the Pittsburgh area because Pittsburgh's West"
29:34,680;29:38,480;"Western pathway all right cuz yeah fillies East and Pittsburgh"
29:38,480;29:40,800;"It's only 45 minutes from Ohio."
29:40,800;29:43,180;"Yeah, so we were in this steak house,"
29:43,180;29:45,040;"now I was wearing my Troy Brown jersey,"
29:45,040;29:47,960;"and I was in the bathroom at the urinal"
29:47,960;29:50,120;"and some guy walks in and sees it."
29:50,120;29:52,800;"And starts like giving me shit while I'm taking a piss."
29:52,800;29:55,640;"I'm like, oh, oh, this page doesn't even have a chance."
29:55,640;29:57,520;"Huh, I can't believe you're wearing that here."
29:57,520;29:58,400;"Like going on and on."
29:58,400;30:00,920;"All I can say is like, yeah, we'll see, we'll see."
30:00,920;30:03,840;"Because, you know, I was fucking 18 years old"
30:03,840;30:06,360;"and this dude was like 40, twice my size."
30:07,280;30:08,360;"And you're dicking your hand."
30:08,360;30:09,040;"Yeah."
30:09,040;30:11,920;"I was really a little, a little exposed."
30:11,920;30:17,080;"So, uh, what is more of my, my first thought was to go back to that guy."
30:17,080;30:19,440;"I'm like, Oh yeah, I bet you feel like a shithead."
30:19,440;30:23,800;"So I could talk and shit to a, I can college kid in a, in a urinal."
30:23,800;30:26,560;"I bet he doesn't, I bet he doesn't even remember it."
30:26,560;30:26,840;"Yeah."
30:26,840;30:32,480;"Uh, but I, I felt vindicated, which is all the first game that we went to."
30:32,480;30:34,800;"Uh, we met these guys staying in line behind us."
30:35,640;30:36,240;"When was this deal?"
30:36,240;30:37,240;"This fan was a Patriots fan."
30:37,240;30:37,880;"We were waiting for a"
30:37,880;30:38,720;"Permani brothers like the"
30:38,720;30:39,440;"sandwich place."
30:39,440;30:40,920;"They quicker."
30:40,920;30:41,880;"We all sat together eight"
30:41,880;30:43,160;"lunch and then like we ended up"
30:43,160;30:44,780;"like tailgating with them and"
30:44,780;30:45,720;"drinking a bunch of beers"
30:45,720;30:46,620;"throughout the whole weekend."
30:46,620;30:48,120;"And the next year we got the"
30:48,120;30:49,240;"Airbnb with them as well."
30:49,240;30:51,400;"So like everyone's like super"
30:51,400;30:51,920;"chill air."
30:51,920;30:52,720;"Yeah."
30:52,720;30:54,040;"And then they all fucked each"
30:54,040;30:55,040;"other."
30:55,040;30:57,120;"Just one big gay orgy."
30:57,120;30:58,920;"He loves it in Pittsburgh."
30:58,920;31:02,520;"Yeah, I can imagine why."
31:02,520;31:05,080;"So friendly."
31:05,080;31:14,840;"Yeah. Yeah. So I think this is probably the perfect time to explain why this is the the the"
31:14,840;31:22,600;"Drew Bled so what did I call it? Renaissance game. So for those that maybe don't remember we"
31:22,600;31:30,360;"concocted this plan weeks ago and actually at this point it's probably like months ago."
31:31,080;31:31,580;"Yeah."
31:31,580;31:45,960;"About we found out that Drew Bloodsohn's a winery and we tried to get his wine and we're going to do this episode as a tribute to Drew Bloodsohn because this was his Renaissance."
31:45,960;31:51,800;"So, um, as true brown plans tend to go."
31:51,800;31:58,880;"I'm the only one that actually found Drew Bloodsohn wine because it is very prevalent in New Hampshire liquor stores."
31:59,360;32:02,280;"You can find it in almost all of them actually, believe it or not."
32:02,280;32:08,960;"And for anybody who doesn't live in New Hampshire, the liquor stores are"
32:08,960;32:10,000;"directly off the highway."
32:10,000;32:12,400;"So they're very easy to get to and to leave."
32:12,400;32:14,160;"And we say we can."
32:14,160;32:15,680;"Yeah, exactly."
32:15,680;32:17,480;"We say we don't promote drunk driving yet."
32:17,480;32:19,960;"We put all the liquor stores directly off of highways."
32:19,960;32:22,880;"So live for your fucking die."
32:22,880;32:23,240;"Yeah."
32:23,240;32:24,440;"So I was able to find it."
32:24,440;32:29,200;"And this is quite literally the most money I've ever spent on a bottle of"
32:29,200;32:35,240;"wine. It is flying B, not V, but B for blood. So the cabernet"
32:35,240;32:39,560;"so when you're on 2016. Oh, and for those that you advantage."
32:39,560;32:45,400;"Yeah, it's it is delicious. And I know nothing about wine, but I"
32:45,400;32:51,520;"decided to prime my palate over the past week with a bottle of wine"
32:51,520;32:54,160;"that my boss gave me that was supposed to be super fancy and I drank"
32:54,160;32:57,920;"it. It was pretty good. This one's better. So true blood."
32:58,480;33:00,200;"That's not you just asking a blood."
33:00,200;33:02,040;"So that's that's a legitimate take."
33:02,040;33:02,760;"Yeah."
33:02,760;33:03,440;"No, Drew blood."
33:03,440;33:06,840;"So not great on third and long, great."
33:06,840;33:09,280;"It squishing grapes and making them ferment."
33:09,280;33:12,600;"How dare you?"
33:12,600;33:14,000;"Oh, we'll get to it."
33:14,000;33:14,600;"Don't you worry."
33:14,600;33:15,600;"I will get to it."
33:15,600;33:19,360;"So I found Drew blood."
33:19,360;33:20,360;"So why?"
33:20,360;33:22,960;"And so I have been drinking that steadily throughout this."
33:22,960;33:25,160;"How about you boys?"
33:25,160;33:26,760;"I have a"
33:27,840;33:30,040;"Um, it doesn't have a year on it."
33:30,040;33:32,040;"Good start."
33:32,040;33:32,800;"Good side."
33:32,800;33:34,640;"Um, it does."
33:34,640;33:37,400;"That pregnant women shouldn't drink it though."
33:37,400;33:38,400;"Okay."
33:38,400;33:46,760;"A 25th anniversary California Cabernet Savignon with a massive panther is logo on it."
33:46,760;33:51,480;"From the Durham, North Carolina Harris, Peter."
33:54,160;34:01,040;"that I ran to this afternoon with a backpack on ran two miles there,"
34:01,040;34:06,800;"stuffed it in my backpack from ran home. So it's well shaken. Yes."
34:06,800;34:08,960;"And which is what you're supposed to do with all wine, I believe."
34:08,960;34:14,480;"That's how you aerate it. Yeah, I'm I'm wafting the aromas into the microphone right now. So take a deep."
34:14,480;34:22,560;"Oh, yep. Yes. That's that's a nice nose it has."
34:22,560;34:24,880;"Is the lightful is that is that elderberry?"
34:24,880;34:31,680;"Um, no, that's black current. Oh, okay. That you're smelling. Yep. It's a nice earthy aroma, you know,"
34:31,680;34:34,240;"Yeah, it's yeah"
34:34,240;34:40,880;"Is that mocha? I think I think there's a layer of mocha in there now that i'm"
34:40,880;34:43,600;"Yep"
34:43,600;34:47,520;"So for reference, I took Greg Brown to beer festival once"
34:49,040;34:55,680;"And only once I'll never do it again because you spent the entire time every time I got a beer like yeah, nope"
34:55,680;35:02,080;"Mm. Yeah those those malts in this one. Oh the hops. Oh, this no this one tastes like beer"
35:02,080;35:07,120;"Literally every single time he drags something guys guys mind. T's like"
35:07,120;35:13,760;"Fucking beer nerds"
35:14,000;35:20,480;"So that I leave Steve. Steve, what did you end up finding in fucking Virginia of all places?"
35:20,480;35:31,040;"I have a bottle of Jan Stevenson's Merlot from 2010. I hear the older the wine, the better it is."
35:31,040;35:33,840;"Oh, definitely. This has been sitting in my"
35:33,840;35:42,640;"Flickr cabinet for many, many moons. Probably good six years. So how did you obtain it? Well,"
35:42,640;35:45,120;"Well, that's what you're supposed to do with why you're supposed to let it sit right?"
35:45,120;35:46,040;"Yeah. So for those,"
35:46,040;35:49,240;"you don't know who Jan Stevenson is."
35:49,240;35:50,360;"How dare you?"
35:50,360;35:55,160;"She's an Australian LPGA golfer who's in the world golf hall of fame."
35:55,160;35:55,680;"Dummy."
35:55,680;35:56,120;"Yeah."
35:56,120;35:57,840;"Uh,"
35:57,840;36:01,920;"we're going to golf company and like there was like some stupid team building"
36:01,920;36:06,120;"event and one of the prizes was wine and I had a question, got a bottle of wine."
36:06,120;36:08,320;"I'm never a question."
36:08,320;36:10,320;"And here we are."
36:10,320;36:10,960;"Yeah."
36:10,960;36:14,520;"was a question. Give us the"
36:14,520;36:16,640;"J. S. Even bowls of Tom Brady"
36:16,640;36:17,920;"have. So of course I knew it."
36:17,920;36:22,000;"It was three Gregory getting"
36:22,000;36:24,160;"three back. The Gregory getting"
36:24,160;36:25,600;"booted is Christmas party for"
36:25,600;36:27,160;"wearing a Pats Christmas Santa"
36:27,160;36:29,200;"hat by the I got booed by the"
36:29,200;36:31,320;"entire company. How many people"
36:31,320;36:33,040;"in that company? There was like"
36:33,040;36:34,560;"160 people."
36:34,560;36:40,720;"I'm sure you handled it well."
36:40,720;36:46,920;"Oh yeah, of course. Yeah. I feed off the heat, you know. I agree. I didn't say my"
36:46,920;36:55,920;"the hate nourishes me. I think it's a brown family thing. I drink it up. Like wine."
36:55,920;37:02,080;"Like Drew blood so wine. So to Drew blood so everybody for those drinking at home. Hopefully"
37:02,080;37:09,320;"not in the car. See if we can hold. Can you hear that? Yes. Can you tell that I'm spinning"
37:09,320;37:11,520;"the bottle as I pour it. Yes."
37:11,520;37:13,920;"It is very"
37:13,920;37:15,640;"ridiculous. Ooh."
37:15,640;37:16,160;"And I'm not"
37:16,160;37:16,720;"and I'm really"
37:16,720;37:18,400;"palatable though."
37:18,400;37:20,000;"Could you fucking smell it first?"
37:20,000;37:21,720;"Overall an amusing fire water."
37:21,720;37:27,040;"Ooh."
37:27,040;37:30,120;"Ooh, this is quite fragrant."
37:30,120;37:31,800;"Have you actually tried it yet Greg?"
37:31,800;37:33,000;"No, dude, come on."
37:33,000;37:34,560;"Are you an amateur?"
37:34,560;37:36,200;"You're gonna smell that shit for like 10 minutes"
37:36,200;37:38,520;"before you do anything."
37:38,520;37:40,080;"I've already had like two glasses though."
37:40,080;37:41,080;"Yeah, me too."
37:41,080;37:43,480;"Yeah, you got to look at the color, you know?"
37:43,480;37:45,120;"Yeah, you got to see how like the legs of it."
37:45,120;37:45,960;"What are the legs like?"
37:45,960;37:47,400;"I'm in my car. I can't see the color."
37:47,400;37:48,760;"It just looks dark."
37:48,760;37:51,560;"And then you got to like spin your glasses,"
37:51,560;37:53,400;"see how it ripples off shit, you know?"
37:53,400;37:54,560;"It's called the legs."
37:54,560;37:55,640;"I was just saying that."
37:55,640;37:56,480;"Jesus Christ."
37:56,480;37:57,400;"I don't want to."
37:57,400;37:58,400;"Yeah."
37:58,400;38:00,000;"All right. So I got some ripple."
38:00,000;38:02,640;"I have to say this is actually a really good way."
38:02,640;38:04,960;"Steve probably couldn't even tell the difference"
38:04,960;38:07,240;"between a mall back and a cabernet."
38:07,240;38:14,440;"It's pronounced Cabernet. Do you guys remember that Thai we were in that French"
38:14,440;38:17,240;"restaurant in Brooklyn with Ellie when she first moved there?"
38:17,240;38:19,040;"I do."
38:19,040;38:24,920;"Hey, Greg was ordering. I've never seen her that that embarrassed and like Ellie"
38:24,920;38:29,240;"doesn't get embarrassed but she was embarrassed that one night."
38:29,240;38:33,240;"And Greg was just taking it all the way to them."
38:33,240;38:36,240;"He ordered a peanut Griggyot, I remember."
38:36,240;38:37,240;"Yes."
38:37,240;38:40,040;"Your find is peanut Griggyot."
38:40,040;38:42,040;"And the chicken parmigana."
38:42,040;38:43,040;"[laughter]"
38:43,040;38:47,040;"The waiter was like, ""Look, look, look at those Brooklyn hipsters."
38:47,040;38:49,240;"He was taking his job super serious."
38:49,240;38:51,040;"He hated you."""
38:51,040;38:52,240;"Well, they were the worst."
38:52,240;38:53,240;"He hated all of us."
38:53,240;38:57,440;"There's that picture of the clown in the booth that you were making out with."
38:57,440;38:58,440;"Oh, yeah."
38:58,440;39:00,440;"I have that photo still."
39:00,440;39:01,440;"You do?"
39:01,440;39:02,440;"Yes."
39:02,440;39:04,360;"Can you post that online so we can put it in the show notes?"
39:04,360;39:04,860;"Yep."
39:04,860;39:05,360;"Oh, yeah."
39:05,360;39:06,160;"All right."
39:06,160;39:07,360;"Thanks to you now."
39:07,360;39:07,860;"Love it."
39:07,860;39:09,360;"Thank you."
39:09,360;39:13,560;"So speaking of clowns, how about we talk about this football game?"
39:13,560;39:15,600;"How about Cornell Stewart?"
39:15,600;39:17,800;"I have more to talk about my wine."
39:17,800;39:20,800;"You haven't even tried it yet."
39:20,800;39:21,800;"Shut up."
39:21,800;39:23,800;"Well, of course not, Andy."
39:23,800;39:30,040;"So we'll do a halftime wine review of Greg Brown's Panther Wine."
39:30,040;39:31,040;"Okay."
39:31,040;39:33,200;"All right, because let's get into this game."
39:33,200;39:40,000;"2001 AFC Championship game, even Gill and Gino are joking about how the"
39:40,000;39:43,280;"Patriots actually finally showed up, even though nobody expected them to."
39:43,280;39:50,640;"And it starts off as expected, I would say."
39:50,640;39:53,040;"I don't know."
39:53,040;39:56,040;"What was the best or playing awesome?"
39:56,040;39:58,200;"D you know, actually, yeah, no, I take that back."
39:58,280;40:02,880;"I think they're getting it was expected was that the Steelers would run down the"
40:02,880;40:09,200;"Patriots so because that's if there's one criticism of this, this Patriots defense"
40:09,200;40:12,800;"that we've seen is that fucking no names are running down there."
40:12,800;40:15,680;"What was the Panthers guys named either of you remember?"
40:15,680;40:19,200;"Oh, let me think like two seconds."
40:19,200;40:20,000;"Who is that?"
40:20,000;40:20,920;"Hunt Lee."
40:20,920;40:21,720;"Yeah, hunt."
40:21,720;40:26,400;"I'll take your word because I don't remember it."
40:26,400;40:33,700;"Yeah, I think it's timely, but just some random ass dude and then the week last week was Charlie Garner who"
40:33,700;40:38,480;"Mediocre are you good after this year, but not this year?"
40:38,480;40:47,240;"Drum Venice hurt though, right? He would miss like previous six or seven games. So yeah, that was my question too is that the"
40:47,240;40:52,160;"Commenters kept talking about they made this comment. I wrote it down because it"
40:52,800;41:00,200;"Freak me a little bit you this is first game back in seven weeks and they mentioned something about a botched painkiller injection"
41:00,200;41:06,360;"Oh, I miss and growing bad if it's like oh it's the best thing is happening because I was able to take all this time off"
41:06,360;41:11,800;"And go back and rewatch every single one of my runs to see what I was doing right when I was doing wrong and all this shit"
41:11,800;41:15,440;"Yeah, that's that's what someone on painkillers does"
41:15,440;41:21,800;"Yeah, I'm gonna sit on this couch and watch shit or smoke is ball of math and then"
41:21,800;41:25,760;"and I can watch every single goddamn every single run."
41:25,760;41:29,480;"- I don't think that's necessarily prescribed painkillers,"
41:29,480;41:32,040;"Steve, unless you're going to a doctor I don't know about."
41:32,040;41:34,920;"- Well, I was in one."
41:34,920;41:36,480;"- Yeah, you're gonna combine drugs."
41:36,480;41:38,880;"- Is that right, Greg?"
41:38,880;41:39,720;"- It's football."
41:39,720;41:42,120;"- You know, you're not just doing one."
41:42,120;41:42,960;"- I mean, that's fair, yeah."
41:42,960;41:45,000;"I mean, HGA, I'm sure, right?"
41:45,000;41:46,320;"I want this shit to fuck you up."
41:46,320;41:47,640;"This has pain in my head."
41:47,640;41:49,520;"- I do remember though,"
41:49,520;41:56,860;"The first couple of like the first dealers possession, we bottled up the bus and I was like, yeah, I knew that stopping the run was huge for the past then."
41:56,860;41:58,600;"Yeah, I see."
41:58,600;42:00,080;"No, no one on Sunday."
42:00,080;42:01,520;"That's right."
42:01,520;42:06,920;"School bus is now run on Sundays and he was he he was awful in this game."
42:06,920;42:17,460;"They kept trying to do that like a pitch kind of sweep forum and whoever the defensive end was on that side almost always will in the Guinness."
42:17,460;42:22,060;"I felt like was almost behind him by the time he caught the ball."
42:22,060;42:24,980;"Like they just couldn't block the sweep for whatever reason."
42:24,980;42:26,620;"Well, you got to get an edge."
42:26,620;42:28,820;"That's what I want."
42:28,820;42:29,980;"So that is exactly."
42:29,980;42:30,260;"Yeah."
42:30,260;42:34,260;"But William again, it's like trying to do his paycheck in this game."
42:34,260;42:36,620;"Yeah, well, it was everywhere."
42:36,620;42:37,660;"Yeah."
42:37,660;42:44,020;"He it's so like odd to watch baddest play though, because it's just like you"
42:44,020;42:46,420;"don't see players of that shape."
42:47,060;42:49,380;"It's true. He almost looks playing running back."
42:49,380;42:50,740;"He's so heavy."
42:50,740;42:54,540;"He's so he's so round like he is."
42:54,540;42:57,260;"There's players that are like heavy, right?"
42:57,260;42:59,940;"Like the Derek Henry's of the world, even the Mike Allstott."
42:59,940;43:01,620;"We like that guys."
43:01,620;43:06,220;"He's a big boy, but yeah, that is kind of fat, you know, but yeah."
43:06,220;43:10,900;"Like that's that was the guy I I was trying to compare him to was Mike"
43:10,900;43:15,100;"Allstott because Allstott, you kind of had the similar running style"
43:15,100;43:16,720;"where he's going to run through people."
43:16,720;43:18,940;"And even if he breaks it past lives,"
43:18,940;43:20,680;"he means you're going to look for somebody to hit sort of thing."
43:20,680;43:23,420;"But also I just look like a tree trunk."
43:23,420;43:25,100;"Like he's just a thick boy."
43:25,100;43:26,860;"Yeah, but drove that is."
43:26,860;43:27,940;"He was kind of like brown."
43:27,940;43:29,180;"He had like legs and then those."
43:29,180;43:32,620;"It was like a slim down Vince Wilf or."
43:32,620;43:35,780;"Oh, that's not bad."
43:35,780;43:36,100;"Yeah."
43:36,100;43:38,380;"It's very same kind of body shape where Vince was."
43:38,380;43:39,940;"He was also very round."
43:39,940;43:41,180;"Yeah."
43:41,180;43:43,340;"But moved quicker than you expect him to."
43:43,340;43:43,940;"Exactly."
43:43,940;43:44,260;"-"
43:44,260;43:45,780;"- Girl Bettuce is making people miss."
43:45,780;43:46,340;"- Yeah, yeah."
43:46,340;43:47,860;"- Like he's actually a huge people."
43:47,860;43:48,900;"- Yeah."
43:48,900;43:51,740;"When they throw him a screen at one point,"
43:51,740;43:52,180;"- Yeah."
43:52,180;43:54,500;"- I was like, oh my goodness, throw it to the line."
43:54,500;43:56,780;"And they started running."
43:56,780;43:57,460;"I was like, I never mind."
43:57,460;43:58,180;"That's just Bettuce."
43:58,180;44:03,100;"- So, but I and I mentioned it before when we were talking to Good Steve,"
44:03,100;44:06,100;"but the stat lines for Jerome Bettuce are fantastic."
44:06,100;44:07,900;"And this one was no exception."
44:07,900;44:08,460;"He had."
44:08,460;44:11,700;"Anybody want to guess this stat line?"
44:12,380;44:15,180;"like 15 carries 40 yards in the touchdown."
44:15,180;44:17,780;"Oh, it's so much better than that."
44:17,780;44:20,440;"Nine carries."
44:20,440;44:23,840;"Eight yards, one touchdown."
44:23,840;44:25,580;"Wow. Longest run."
44:25,580;44:27,180;"Four yards."
44:27,180;44:31,580;"Yeah."
44:31,580;44:33,380;"Don't run on Sundays."
44:33,380;44:36,060;"We're on the poster board."
44:36,060;44:37,100;"Really does it."
44:37,100;44:41,980;"I think we should, uh, well, let's not gloss over like, uh,"
44:41,980;44:45,680;"the lightning of that thunder and lightning backfields."
44:45,680;44:46,980;"- Amis Zeroa?"
44:46,980;44:49,480;"- Amis Amis Zeroa."
44:49,480;44:53,980;"- He's got to be up there in the football name Hall of Fame, right?"
44:53,980;44:54,980;"- It's a great name."
44:54,980;44:55,980;"- Zeroa?"
44:55,980;44:59,480;"- Zeroa itself, I mean, it's basically 90% vowels,"
44:59,480;45:00,480;"which is fantastic."
45:00,480;45:00,980;"- Yeah."
45:00,980;45:03,980;"- But the fact that his first name is Amis is amazing."
45:03,980;45:06,980;"- There's five vowels and two non-vowels."
45:06,980;45:09,480;"And one of those non-vowels is Z,"
45:09,480;45:16,280;"Which is like almost a a vowel in itself because you never see used and one of the vowels has one of those little accent marks"
45:16,280;45:21,200;"Does it really yeah and the last he has that a you know that and yay? Oh"
45:21,200;45:27,920;"I like it. That's why it's not zero e it's zero a oh all right"
45:27,920;45:33,720;"I'll take your word for it from the I reference can't handle those so yeah from the Ivory Coast oh"
45:33,720;45:36,480;"No kidding. That's pretty cool like"
45:37,680;45:42,680;"It's a sock like is it drugba did your drugba that that's one dark Chilean"
45:42,680;45:46,520;"Ever told you that story no"
45:46,520;45:50,400;"We were the quote this is from"
45:50,400;45:54,200;"College we had a buddy that was like a surfer guy and"
45:54,200;46:02,720;"He was just like he was like your typical stoner like always zoned out like they really knows going on like oh man"
46:04,720;46:08,320;"- Yeah, and we were playing FIFA,"
46:08,320;46:11,480;"and someone was playing with Chelsea,"
46:11,480;46:14,520;"so in the scoreboard it had CHL,"
46:14,520;46:16,560;"and it zoomed in and had like,"
46:16,560;46:19,400;"drugged with scoring a goal, and he just goes,"
46:19,400;46:21,720;"that's one dark Chilean."
46:21,720;46:24,320;"(laughing)"
46:24,320;46:27,400;"And we were like, what the fuck?"
46:27,400;46:32,460;"So then from then on, that's been a part of our vernacular."
46:32,460;46:33,960;"- I've heard you say it multiple times,"
46:33,960;46:35,560;"They're actually not back story."
46:35,560;46:36,600;"That's fantastic."
46:36,600;46:38,800;"Oh, good Lord."
46:38,800;46:43,280;"I'm pretty sure Chelsea would kick the shit out of Chile, by the way."
46:43,280;46:44,680;"That's true."
46:44,680;46:46,000;"Quite easily."
46:46,000;46:48,440;"So yeah."
46:48,440;46:51,840;"So speaking of Chileans, the first quarter of this football game"
46:51,840;46:55,840;"was pretty chilly for both offenses."
46:55,840;46:59,160;"Yeah, we're going to do a best and worst reach quarter again."
46:59,160;47:00,840;"Oh, Jesus Christ."
47:00,840;47:03,760;"I was wondering if you had given that up, but apparently not."
47:03,800;47:04,640;"All right."
47:04,640;47:05,640;"- Nope."
47:05,640;47:06,460;"All right."
47:06,460;47:09,960;"Sure, Steve, you go first."
47:09,960;47:11,640;"- You son of a bitch."
47:11,640;47:12,480;"- Oh."
47:12,480;47:17,640;"Well, I mean, I think the overall worst is watching"
47:17,640;47:20,200;"Cordell Stewart play quarterback,"
47:20,200;47:21,560;"especially when he had high-end's ward"
47:21,560;47:25,240;"and box-scale burris as his receivers."
47:25,240;47:26,920;"Is that a throwing a short or he's trying to end"
47:26,920;47:29,320;"the coverage and they're making a play."
47:29,320;47:31,880;"- The dude can bounce a football into somebody"
47:31,880;47:34,480;"into a wider wide receiver like no other."
47:34,480;47:36,080;"- You look nervous."
47:36,080;47:37,000;"- He did look nervous."
47:37,000;47:39,720;"- He did, but you say that,"
47:39,720;47:44,000;"but both of those wide receivers were over 1,000 yards."
47:44,000;47:45,240;"- And I'll get into the best,"
47:45,240;47:48,640;"which I think is pretty obvious."
47:48,640;47:50,800;"- No one. - So I shouldn't"
47:50,800;47:52,880;"let you go first, you son of a bitch."
47:52,880;47:56,440;"All right, the Troy Brown punter term."
47:56,440;47:59,320;"- Yes, but I mean, I think everyone has seen that,"
47:59,320;48:01,280;"and there's actually a bill of check breakdown on it,"
48:01,280;48:03,240;"If you haven't watched that, you definitely should."
48:03,240;48:04,400;"Oh, that's right."
48:04,400;48:05,600;"I forgot about that."
48:05,600;48:07,960;"The effort that they do on the gunner."
48:07,960;48:10,800;"Remember they bought the gunner to the end zone,"
48:10,800;48:14,480;"but which you don't really get unless you rewatch this game"
48:14,480;48:19,960;"in full is the punt before that had a penalty on it."
48:19,960;48:23,000;"So they punted it and Troy Brown kind of messed it up"
48:23,000;48:24,720;"where he probably should have feared caught it"
48:24,720;48:26,120;"and instead thought of bounds or something like that"
48:26,120;48:27,400;"and he just let it go and it bounced"
48:27,400;48:29,000;"and it kept going down the sideline"
48:29,000;48:31,160;"and it was on the Patriots 25."
48:31,160;48:32,800;"There's a 16 something yard punt."
48:32,800;48:33,280;"Yeah."
48:33,280;48:36,680;"There was a booming punt with a flip field position, but yeah, because"
48:36,680;48:40,960;"the guy had the end zone ran out of bounds, didn't try and get back in."
48:40,960;48:45,160;"So if you were flag and made him repunt it, Troy took it right out the gut to the house."
48:45,160;48:45,560;"Yeah."
48:45,560;48:49,320;"And then on the next play, he got he actually didn't get off the line."
48:49,320;48:54,240;"And when you watch the replay, the guy that's that's being blocked by two guys"
48:54,240;48:57,400;"and falling over in his own end zone, that's the same guy."
48:57,400;48:58,040;"Yeah."
48:58,040;48:59,360;"I didn't remember his name."
48:59,360;49:00,720;"Troy Edwards is his name."
49:01,040;49:06,400;"But this whole game made me start hating him like I just I just have a no way in the fourth quarter"
49:06,400;49:11,900;"Like I love seeing Troy Edwards fail. Why and I don't a lot because he was the kicker chair or two"
49:11,900;49:17,280;"Yeah, I just like I just like seeing him fail. We'll get to that. That's harsh, dude"
49:17,280;49:20,120;"I thought for him"
49:20,120;49:25,040;"Yeah, he's he's a human being he's got a thing with being he made a tough play"
49:25,040;49:30,000;"He probably regrets that play every day of his life think of how his mother feels"
49:30,280;49:33,360;"Yeah, we should start calling them shitty Troy Edwards"
49:33,360;49:42,440;"Tell me"
49:42,440;49:48,520;"The Troy Edwards all right, I don't think what I think of the receiver from Browns"
49:48,520;49:51,800;"Braylon Edwards Braylon Edwards"
49:51,800;49:55,080;"You wish I was looking the same thing too"
49:55,080;49:59,680;"Didn't he play for the Steelers to at one point"
49:59,680;50:01,960;"I know. Oh, fuck. I know."
50:01,960;50:02,960;"Stat check."
50:02,960;50:05,920;"Now I'm already looking up Troy Edwards."
50:05,920;50:09,880;"Yeah, fuck it. All right. Um, all right. Then I'll, I'll do my best and worst."
50:09,880;50:10,880;"Who?"
50:10,880;50:11,880;"Um, what?"
50:11,880;50:18,480;"All right. He finished his career at a Graham Rapids rampage of the arena football league."
50:18,480;50:19,480;"Oh, right."
50:19,480;50:20,980;"Football league was the dude."
50:20,980;50:21,980;"Yeah."
50:21,980;50:26,660;"Edwards, uh, rapids arena football jersey would be sick."
50:26,660;50:29,860;"Oh, yeah."
50:29,860;50:30,740;"You got to be on an eBay."
50:30,740;50:33,420;"It's actually, there, there's definitely not one on eBay."
50:33,420;50:35,420;"But let me tell, though."
50:35,420;50:40,260;"If, if I saw somebody wearing that, I mean, you'd have to buy a drink, right?"
50:40,260;50:41,700;"You wouldn't even know who it is."
50:41,700;50:43,820;"Like who the hell's Edwards and what is this jersey?"
50:43,820;50:45,620;"Well, we would know the three of us."
50:45,620;50:49,860;"So if any, if any of us see that or any of our listeners see that, send us a"
50:49,860;50:51,780;"picture and we will buy that man a drink."
50:51,780;50:53,880;"Or we'll just us who knows."
50:53,880;50:54,860;"He's always listening to this."
50:54,860;50:55,580;"Let's be honest."
50:55,580;50:58,140;"Hey, we get some listens."
50:58,140;51:04,100;"Nobody from our family, though, apparently we found out recently."
51:04,100;51:07,940;"Literally none of our our family members listened to this podcast."
51:07,940;51:10,540;"They're smart enough on like you idiots."
51:10,540;51:13,900;"I'll keep them around."
51:13,900;51:14,260;"Great."
51:14,260;51:19,260;"So yeah, well, fucking shut up and I will."
51:19,260;51:24,260;"My best was actually Troy Brown's first punt return."
51:24,260;51:27,580;"- I forgot original Andy."
51:27,580;51:30,100;"- Dude, that, it was better than the second one."
51:30,100;51:31,460;"I mean, yeah, I didn't want it for a touchdown,"
51:31,460;51:32,900;"but his first punt return,"
51:32,900;51:35,780;"he was making guys look fucking foolish."
51:35,780;51:37,020;"- 25 yards?"
51:37,020;51:41,700;"- He broke some dude's ankles and he caught the ball."
51:41,700;51:42,940;"I don't even know what he did."
51:42,940;51:44,060;"It didn't look like he did a move,"
51:44,060;51:46,380;"but the guy just kind of like fell over in front of him"
51:46,380;51:47,980;"and Troy Brown's got like skipped around him."
51:47,980;51:49,780;"It was fantastic."
51:49,780;51:51,640;"So I'm gonna have to find that highlight"
51:51,640;51:55,100;"and put it on the website because that was great."
51:55,100;52:00,100;"And the worst was kind of every other Patriots offensive player"
52:00,100;52:06,380;"in this first quarter, because the only person"
52:06,380;52:09,580;"that had any, I think, positive offensive yard"
52:09,580;52:10,520;"was Troy Brown."
52:10,520;52:14,380;"Like the Patriots had a bunch of like false starts and shit."
52:14,380;52:17,300;"And like the first driver, they had the false start."
52:17,300;52:20,180;"And then second play, Brady got sacked."
52:20,180;52:22,220;"And it's not like 13."
52:22,220;52:24,020;"Yeah, that was 13 18."
52:24,020;52:24,520;"Yeah."
52:24,520;52:29,940;"And the throws wide receiver screen of Troy Brown, he picks up like 15 or 16 yards on"
52:29,940;52:30,940;"the road."
52:30,940;52:31,940;"Yeah."
52:31,940;52:32,940;"But he's still three and out."
52:32,940;52:36,340;"So he was like the only good thing in this first half."
52:36,340;52:39,260;"So that was my."
52:39,260;52:41,740;"I mean, this game is Pete Troy Brown."
52:41,740;52:43,060;"Well, yeah."
52:43,060;52:46,060;"And actually, you boys were talking about,"
52:46,060;52:47,620;"and you were patting yourselves on the back"
52:47,620;52:50,060;"for having the same thought, which good for you."
52:50,060;52:54,820;"But you were talking about how last week"
52:54,820;52:58,380;"in the Snowball was like a perfect example"
52:58,380;53:02,060;"of Bill Belichick's ""All Three phases of the game."""
53:02,060;53:05,800;"And I will argue this game tops that in those three phases."
53:05,800;53:08,980;"- I don't know."
53:08,980;53:10,540;"Your offense was meh."
53:10,540;53:11,540;"But you're right that part."
53:11,540;53:17,940;"it but it's set up by a great punt. Yeah and also we'll get to the other."
53:17,940;53:26,420;"Yeah I mean the defense was phenomenal I thought for stopping the run on the best running team"
53:26,420;53:34,900;"in the league and I think the offense was the perfect example of next man up with the Drew"
53:34,900;53:43,860;"blood cell situation. Sure. And there was some executing in crunch time, if you will,"
53:43,860;53:50,420;"like executing when exactly they needed it to happen. Like it wasn't a huge offensive production"
53:50,420;53:57,620;"day, but when they needed to have a play, they got it. And so this was to me the perfect execution"
53:57,620;53:58,620;"of the Belichick system."
53:58,620;54:02,540;"All right, what was your worst?"
54:02,540;54:05,840;"Every other player besides Troy Brown"
54:05,840;54:07,260;"was the offense."
54:07,260;54:09,060;"Having said all that."
54:09,060;54:11,660;"Yeah, I guess I guess you should try"
54:11,660;54:12,500;"mannesia."
54:12,500;54:15,220;"I guess I Greg, what about you?"
54:15,220;54:16,460;"That's something left."
54:16,460;54:17,020;"Everything left."
54:17,020;54:20,580;"My best was Troy Brown's screen pass,"
54:20,580;54:25,100;"which was better than both of his kick"
54:25,100;54:27,020;"returns. So it was great."
54:27,140;54:28,160;"Correct."
54:28,160;54:31,420;"Now my best is..."
54:31,420;54:37,620;"Oh, it was erotic."
54:37,620;54:41,580;"Samair Samar again, it's back to that"
54:41,580;54:44,380;"My best is the Christian"
54:44,380;54:46,940;"cause >>> Yeah."
54:46,940;54:48,780;"Mm. Sorry."
54:48,780;54:51,460;"I love that you nailed that first time too."
54:51,460;54:52,660;"Dude, I love him."
54:52,660;54:54,220;"He's an all time name,"
54:55,820;55:00,180;"That's my worst on names is Matt Stevens."
55:00,180;55:02,180;"Like brutal name."
55:02,180;55:07,220;"And for some reason I don't I've seen him show up a lot this year and yeah."
55:07,220;55:09,300;"I don't even think I remembered him at all."
55:09,300;55:11,180;"Me. I thought the same thing."
55:11,180;55:14,220;"I remember like he started week one and I had a note there and I was like,"
55:14,220;55:15,580;"who the fuck is Matt Stevens?"
55:15,580;55:19,540;"No, I think my favorite player name is Stephen Gregory."
55:19,540;55:21,060;"The Patriots."
55:21,060;55:22,020;"Oh, yeah."
55:22,020;55:23,020;"My brothers."
55:23,020;55:25,060;"Mine is Chris Brown because I love my mom."
55:25,060;55:27,860;"Oh, hey, nicey done."
55:27,860;55:31,380;"I'm Vincent Brisby, just because that's an awesome name."
55:31,380;55:33,860;"Vincent Brisby was the man."
55:33,860;55:37,540;"He was my first favorite patriot."
55:37,540;55:38,540;"I was really determined."
55:38,540;55:41,820;"Because his name rhymed with Frisby."
55:41,820;55:42,740;"And I was like seven."
55:42,740;55:47,220;"Mine was Mozy Tatupu."
55:47,220;55:48,060;"No, yeah."
55:48,060;55:49,780;"That's that's it."
55:49,780;55:51,340;"Yeah, it is."
55:51,340;55:52,860;"You suck up."
55:52,860;55:53,380;"All right."
55:53,380;55:58,820;"your worst thing, Greg. I just said Matt Stevens. Oh, that's your worst. It's just the name."
55:58,820;56:04,460;"It is going on. I'm making these up on the fly. You know this. We are. I'm going to look"
56:04,460;56:09,260;"at the rosters and making up my best and worst. Okay. All right. Well, let's get to"
56:09,260;56:13,500;"the next. We're best. And that Stevens even play in this game. I don't think you do."
56:13,500;56:18,600;"Yeah. He made a tackle with nine 54 in the first quarter. All right. We're going to get"
56:18,600;56:20,560;"on Jerome Betts 12 year again."
56:20,560;56:22,020;"Oof."
56:22,020;56:23,520;"Was that the screenplay?"
56:23,520;56:27,320;"I think the low key worst was right at the end of the first quarter."
56:27,320;56:30,080;"Court else do it ripped off that super long run."
56:30,080;56:31,280;"40 plus yard run."
56:31,280;56:31,800;"Yeah."
56:31,800;56:33,880;"Dude, they hadn't done anything up to that point."
56:33,880;56:34,400;"Yeah."
56:34,400;56:37,880;"And now they're inside the the paths 10 to start second quarter."
56:37,880;56:39,440;"There's like no paths in game."
56:39,440;56:41,560;"They can't run the ball, but somehow they're inside the 10."
56:41,560;56:44,200;"Yeah, which and he escaped a sack on that play."
56:44,200;56:45,360;"It was one of those."
56:45,360;56:48,080;"It reminded me of when the Patriots would play Cam Newton."
56:48,080;56:57,520;"And they'd have them like dead to rights for like a 20 yard sack or even this most recent season and"
56:57,520;57:05,120;"How was the name for the Texans? God damn it. Well, it's wine wine does give you immediate"
57:05,120;57:08,320;"Yeah, so yeah, Deshawn Watson where they had him for that sack"
57:08,320;57:12,000;"Yeah, he broke her for a big run and that kept the drive alive and they yeah"
57:12,560;57:19,080;"So it was it was that sort of play where they couldn't quite contain the mobile quarterback. He runs for like 40 fucking yards"
57:19,080;57:23,280;"But on the plus side"
57:23,280;57:29,160;"So they're they're inside the patch 10 the quarter ends and so to start the second quarter"
57:29,160;57:32,700;"Yes, seven other Patriots on Troy Brown's part return"
57:32,700;57:35,520;"second quarter starts and"
57:35,520;57:36,720;"the"
57:36,720;57:39,560;"Steel is basically three and out and they show this step"
57:41,040;57:45,700;"Which I kind of want to get into a little bit because it's it's baffling to me"
57:45,700;57:47,620;"oh"
57:47,620;57:49,900;"and it's basically this is"
57:49,900;57:55,980;"the number one rushing offense in the league right with 2,000 yard"
57:55,980;57:59,060;"receivers as well on top of it all and"
57:59,060;58:07,340;"the stat was they showed the Patriots defense in the red zone was third in the NFL in"
58:08,380;58:16,280;"Like touchdowns allowed the seals offense the best running offense in the league was 29th in the NFL"
58:16,280;58:24,580;"Yeah, I saw it too. I didn't really put that all the fuck does that work I think a lot of their Russian guys came from Stewart though"
58:24,580;58:28,200;"Maybe I mean he wasn't"
58:28,200;58:30,480;"He had like yeah like"
58:30,480;58:32,760;"That is only at a thousand yards in the year"
58:33,560;58:41,660;"Stewart had like almost 600. So I think it was like a combination running game more so than like a ground and pound running game."
58:41,660;58:44,860;"They try a bunch of design quarterback runs in this game."
58:44,860;58:47,260;"And they did not work."
58:47,260;58:50,760;"No, that one worked the early one works, but nothing else after that did."
58:50,760;58:55,060;"Richard Seymour sniffed out almost every time it seemed like."
58:55,060;58:59,460;"Like he's drinking a fine wine, right?"
58:59,460;59:02,660;"He's just getting those aromas up in there."
59:02,660;59:08,340;"So yeah, the play went, Jerome bet his run for no gain, like right up the middle."
59:08,340;59:12,100;"And then it was, it wasn't a design run."
59:12,100;59:17,220;"It was actually a pass play that Cornel Stewart took a sack and they threw an incomplete pass"
59:17,220;59:19,140;"when he tried to like scramble again."
59:19,140;59:23,260;"And there was like an offensive holding on the play and it was a shitty mess."
59:23,260;59:25,020;"So they kicked his field goal."
59:25,020;59:28,580;"Now it's seven three."
59:28,580;59:37,580;"And then not much happens in the second quarter other than the Pats actually started to get"
59:37,580;59:40,220;"into a bit of a rhythm."
59:40,220;59:47,540;"They had a completion overturned on third and long to Troy Brown where Phil Sims almost"
59:47,540;59:49,940;"guaranteed that it was a completion."
59:49,940;59:57,380;"Dude, fuck Phil Sims and his replay like guesses in this goddamn game."
59:57,380;01:00:01,160;"Well, he was the darkness Stephen fucking time every time"
01:00:01,160;01:00:03,800;"Well"
01:00:03,800;01:00:10,420;"He was and he was like a great gumbles like home. I mean not to take you to Vegas next time I go because he was"
01:00:10,420;01:00:15,280;"But he was so adamant about his stance to"
01:00:15,280;01:00:20,440;"At the end of the game whenever there was a challenge. You'd be like I'm not even gonna say anything"
01:00:20,440;01:00:25,060;"You could be wrong there are so many challenges to like no one knew what the fucking catch was"
01:00:25,820;01:00:31,660;"It was great to see that no one gave in 2001 what a freaking catch is the referees in this game where"
01:00:31,660;01:00:39,580;"I'm gonna say they were hot garbage and not just like against the pages, but just in general like they made some shitty calls"
01:00:39,580;01:00:42,220;"You want to hear a hot take?"
01:00:42,220;01:00:48,340;"Everybody complains about the catch thing. I think it's legitimately a hard thing to"
01:00:48,340;01:00:54,700;"Put a rule around I agree. There's so many nuances to catches that it's"
01:00:55,100;01:00:57,100;"You know, they're doing their best. I"
01:00:57,100;01:01:02,540;"Also like people complain all they want but there's no if there was an easy answer is to like this is a catch in this"
01:01:02,540;01:01:04,540;"Isn't we go to figure it out by now?"
01:01:04,540;01:01:07,340;"There's no easy"
01:01:07,340;01:01:12,740;"Agree that but I don't know you can show it say seven of them say that's a catch right"
01:01:12,740;01:01:15,580;"Yeah, we're short in real time sort of thing. I"
01:01:15,580;01:01:20,100;"Yeah, but then there's the other three people that raise hell and say it wasn't you know"
01:01:20,580;01:01:25,700;"Yeah, there's a majority of people like if you look at it in real time on a bigger sample"
01:01:25,700;01:01:27,200;"Then yeah as a catch. That's not a catch"
01:01:27,200;01:01:29,900;"So I have two answers to this"
01:01:29,900;01:01:32,340;"two two solutions one is"
01:01:32,340;01:01:36,460;"Simplify a catch to the most basic thing you can possibly be and"
01:01:36,460;01:01:40,640;"Like you know like bobs don't matter whatever as long as the guy"
01:01:40,640;01:01:45,860;"Makes the catch at some point it has two hands on the football to catch and that's it"
01:01:45,860;01:01:48,020;"or"
01:01:48,020;01:01:53,140;"We go back to we had to talk about this back. I think the Saints game was ages ago"
01:01:53,140;01:02:01,340;"Whenever there was a challenge this year early on some of the the stations would"
01:02:01,340;01:02:04,180;"Would you were allowed to vote?"
01:02:04,180;01:02:07,260;"So you could I don't know if you like text in almost like voting for"
01:02:07,260;01:02:09,980;"What's that singer show?"
01:02:09,980;01:02:12,340;"Yeah, it's almost like American Idol"
01:02:12,340;01:02:13,580;"So you can actually vote."
01:02:13,580;01:02:15,300;"And as they were reviewing the play,"
01:02:15,300;01:02:18,860;"they would show the voting of America."
01:02:18,860;01:02:22,420;"And like, oh, those 7,000 votes and 62% say"
01:02:22,420;01:02:24,060;"this call should stand."
01:02:24,060;01:02:26,580;"And I think it was, I think it made it great"
01:02:26,580;01:02:28,980;"who said that they should just use that"
01:02:28,980;01:02:33,820;"and whatever the population votes is what the call is."
01:02:33,820;01:02:36,420;"- Well, I want them to do that, but not with fans."
01:02:36,420;01:02:39,020;"I want them to have like a room full of reps."
01:02:39,020;01:02:39,940;"- Careful, too many."
01:02:39,940;01:02:41,980;"- Yeah, so we ended up with Donald Trump."
01:02:41,980;01:02:42,820;"but Donald Trump."
01:02:42,820;01:02:47,820;"- See, it doesn't matter."
01:02:47,820;01:02:48,740;"Solutions don't matter"
01:02:48,740;01:02:50,780;"'cause someone will always complain."
01:02:50,780;01:02:51,820;"- That's true."
01:02:51,820;01:02:56,820;"- Even if they got voted in by a democracy, we go,"
01:02:56,820;01:02:59,660;"oh, it was a popular vote."
01:02:59,660;01:03:01,180;"It's never been popular vote."
01:03:01,180;01:03:02,020;"So if I could talk."
01:03:02,020;01:03:10,100;"- Yeah, there were a lot of replays in this,"
01:03:10,100;01:03:14,620;"lot of overturned calls. Yeah, it was slow. Because there was that"
01:03:14,620;01:03:17,500;"there was that Troy Brown call that got overturned, which probably legit."
01:03:17,500;01:03:22,580;"It was borderline, but Troy Brown was still like you hit the ground and"
01:03:22,580;01:03:26,660;"it kind of moved a little bit, whatever, great. So page to punt. And"
01:03:26,660;01:03:32,020;"then the pass to Heinz Ward, where he caught it was just over the"
01:03:32,020;01:03:34,580;"fingertips of Troy Brown, Troy, Ty law."
01:03:35,620;01:03:37,620;"And it was a snag."
01:03:37,620;01:03:40,820;"It was a sick catch, but as he caught the ball,"
01:03:40,820;01:03:43,020;"like his back hit the ground and it bobbled."
01:03:43,020;01:03:45,580;"And by the time he grabbed it again, he would slid out of bounds already."
01:03:45,580;01:03:49,220;"So, you know, so they're basically even at this point."
01:03:49,220;01:03:53,220;"There was the Heinz word fumble, which they ruled a fumble on the field."
01:03:53,220;01:03:56,180;"He came to the ball, come out at all, and then reversed it."
01:03:56,180;01:03:59,420;"Because his helmet hit the ground first, which I didn't realize."
01:03:59,420;01:04:01,900;"No idea when the ball is coming out at all."
01:04:01,900;01:04:02,620;"It's true."
01:04:02,620;01:04:09,900;"I didn't realize that the helmet was was considered like a part of you that was down like I knew the knee and the elbow and like whatever"
01:04:09,900;01:04:13,620;"But I didn't know the helmet was part of that"
01:04:13,620;01:04:14,740;"cuz"
01:04:14,740;01:04:16,380;"after fucking"
01:04:16,380;01:04:19,340;"Terrible I mean it was ad hoc you he had some fucking"
01:04:19,340;01:04:24,560;"He was making it all about himself, too. I wrote down a call and I can find it"
01:04:24,560;01:04:26,820;"I"
01:04:26,820;01:04:30,760;"Reviewed the play and I can't tell whether the tip hit the ground"
01:04:31,420;01:04:34,500;"Football or not football so as an incomplete pass"
01:04:34,500;01:04:44,140;"Appreciate every time the rest would get on the stadium Mike there was that feedback loop which made it like awful to listen to it"
01:04:44,140;01:04:51,780;"So it's even that that hits even closer to home now that like I'm zooming or skyping every"
01:04:51,780;01:04:56,460;"Work where it's like dude. Just figure out your microphone situation"
01:04:57,140;01:05:03,620;"Mute everybody mute right now. Yeah, and there's like the one guy who's not paying attention is the one guy who's got the feedback"
01:05:03,620;01:05:12,080;"Yeah, dude today this morning is this guy in Ireland that was like having a fight with his siblings"
01:05:12,080;01:05:16,020;"Mike was on"
01:05:16,020;01:05:19,500;"Like trash in his sister. It was so funny"
01:05:19,500;01:05:23,820;"Like I don't know what she's doing. I don't know why she keeps doing so that"
01:05:26,140;01:05:28,140;"Still funny"
01:05:28,140;01:05:34,000;"So yeah, so the really the only speaking of hurtful things the only real"
01:05:34,000;01:05:37,740;"news of the second quarter this game was"
01:05:37,740;01:05:44,900;"Brady taking some low hits which I'm gonna come out and say it. They were fucking cheap shots. That's"
01:05:44,900;01:05:51,700;"Mm-hmm. That's the only news of the quarter. Yeah, like you're glossing over it"
01:05:52,140;01:05:59,140;"Well, hang on we're getting there Jesus fucking crazy is it the only lose or is there more news later? Yeah"
01:05:59,140;01:06:05,100;"Listen you got you got to let it breathe you're all drinking wine. You're letting that breathe. You know, let me breathe"
01:06:05,100;01:06:09,840;"Yeah, you either. It's only for fucking sentence. Oh my god"
01:06:09,840;01:06:15,580;"So Brady takes a couple of cheap shots. I'm gonna say well as you one of them"
01:06:15,580;01:06:20,780;"Wasn't but he got his ankle rolled up on second one was definitely a cheap shot by"
01:06:21,660;01:06:26,800;"I wrote his name down because I wanted to call his ass out leave flowers crawled into Brady's legs"
01:06:26,800;01:06:29,420;"rolled over him and"
01:06:29,420;01:06:32,180;"So we could just like that"
01:06:32,180;01:06:39,780;"Maybe like well to the side, but very similar hit. Yeah very similar to the the hit again against him from Pollard"
01:06:39,780;01:06:42,820;"Tore his ACL, but he like got him from behind"
01:06:42,820;01:06:47,380;"So rolled up his legs from the back and Brady came up limping hard and"
01:06:47,380;01:06:50,660;"on the play he'd actually"
01:06:50,660;01:06:58,160;"completed a fucking laser to Troy Brown. Yeah, they were moving the ball. They're starting to get in a rhythm"
01:06:58,160;01:07:06,020;"like all of a sudden the page is often so it's actually moving. It was great. Oh fuck here we go. And then break its heart and"
01:07:06,020;01:07:08,120;"incomes"
01:07:08,120;01:07:10,280;"our Savior drew blood so"
01:07:10,280;01:07:15,600;"Who I am to the rescue in my car to the rescue literally to the rescue"
01:07:17,120;01:07:20,940;"Thank you very much. Yes, that's exactly I was like I was looking for somebody who cheers me. Thanks and"
01:07:20,940;01:07:24,340;"bloods are comes in and"
01:07:24,340;01:07:31,880;"Here's so fast - of like did it felt it feels like, you know, looking back. I was like, oh man"
01:07:31,880;01:07:36,040;"I must have been like such a dramatic thing, but they were just like, oh Brady's down and"
01:07:36,040;01:07:39,880;"Blood so is in yep, and then like all right second and six"
01:07:39,880;01:07:44,760;"Yeah, and so this is with I wrote a what a minute forty left and a half so"
01:07:45,720;01:07:47,040;"Well, get to this later."
01:07:47,040;01:07:51,320;"I found this article of some guy who was a huge blood so stand"
01:07:51,320;01:07:54,800;"and hated Brady and wrote a bunch of ESPN articles about him."
01:07:54,800;01:07:58,640;"And like this was his vindication apparently."
01:07:58,640;01:08:01,480;"But so it comes over the minute 40 left and a half."
01:08:01,480;01:08:04,560;"And the play was a laser completion"
01:08:04,560;01:08:06,680;"to David Patton on the first play."
01:08:06,680;01:08:08,840;"Like split him five wide and just started"
01:08:08,840;01:08:09,520;"chucking the balls."
01:08:09,520;01:08:10,020;"Great."
01:08:10,020;01:08:11,520;"He's zapping it."
01:08:11,520;01:08:12,320;"Yeah."
01:08:12,320;01:08:16,120;"The second play was he got flush out of the pocket"
01:08:16,120;01:08:18,440;"and ran towards the sideline and got lit the fuck up,"
01:08:18,440;01:08:21,520;"almost exactly the same as he did against the Jets"
01:08:21,520;01:08:22,360;"and Maloos."
01:08:22,360;01:08:23,200;"- Oh, that's weird."
01:08:23,200;01:08:25,560;"How a late shot out of bounds,"
01:08:25,560;01:08:27,800;"which I think there was a flag thrown,"
01:08:27,800;01:08:28,640;"but they picked it up."
01:08:28,640;01:08:31,080;"Like the video that we watched kind of like,"
01:08:31,080;01:08:32,240;"skipped that part."
01:08:32,240;01:08:33,240;"So I don't know what happened."
01:08:33,240;01:08:36,280;"'Cause I saw them like throw a flag and they were conferring"
01:08:36,280;01:08:38,880;"and then all of a sudden it's still second and six."
01:08:38,880;01:08:41,160;"And I was, I was bullshit."
01:08:41,160;01:08:43,120;"Again, I like this happened fucking 20 years ago."
01:08:43,120;01:08:44,400;"I was bullsh*t for him."
01:08:44,400;01:08:49,440;"And then the next play came back and he popped the fuck up too."
01:08:49,440;01:08:51,880;"He was, Bloodsoil was excited to get in."
01:08:51,880;01:08:55,760;"- And Brady was walking by there on the sidelines"
01:08:55,760;01:08:57,600;"on his way to the locker room."
01:08:57,600;01:08:59,480;"- That'll give you my best."
01:08:59,480;01:09:00,680;"- And like, - Don't give me my best"
01:09:00,680;01:09:02,480;"of the game, yeah."
01:09:02,480;01:09:04,480;"- He starts to, - John."
01:09:04,480;01:09:06,440;"- He's whipping to the, - He's whipping to the, yeah."
01:09:06,440;01:09:07,440;"- Who's fucking gone?"
01:09:07,440;01:09:09,480;"- No, he starts drawing at the referee"
01:09:09,480;01:09:13,200;"'cause he wouldn't throw a flag and he was fucking livid."
01:09:13,200;01:09:15,720;"He was literally bouncing on his one good leg."
01:09:15,720;01:09:17,160;"It was amazing."
01:09:17,160;01:09:20,320;"- That's what you want from like your two quarterbacks, right?"
01:09:20,320;01:09:21,160;"- Yeah."
01:09:21,160;01:09:22,200;"- Like these two couldn't have handled"
01:09:22,200;01:09:24,160;"this whole situation any better."
01:09:24,160;01:09:25,720;"- They had each other's backs."
01:09:25,720;01:09:26,800;"It was amazing."
01:09:26,800;01:09:27,760;"- And like think about blood."
01:09:27,760;01:09:32,440;"So like he's literally like holding the play sheet"
01:09:32,440;01:09:37,080;"and then like 35 seconds later, he's in there zipping it."
01:09:37,080;01:09:37,920;"- Yeah."
01:09:37,920;01:09:41,960;"I imagine like that you're just from a mental preparation standpoint, right?"
01:09:41,960;01:09:44,520;"You just stand there like, yeah, I'm like, I'm playing this game."
01:09:44,520;01:09:48,040;"And then 35 seconds later in a huddle, leaving up like that."
01:09:48,040;01:09:51,880;"They haven't played since week two against the best defense in the league."
01:09:51,880;01:09:54,360;"And you're stepping into the AFC Championship game."
01:09:54,360;01:09:56,120;"That's too many of a girl."
01:09:56,120;01:09:57,880;"It's just kind of like it."
01:09:57,880;01:10:00,480;"It's just like a weird like movie moment, you know?"
01:10:00,480;01:10:01,680;"Yeah."
01:10:01,680;01:10:02,120;"Yeah."
01:10:02,120;01:10:05,600;"If you had written this as like part of, remember the Titans, I would be like,"
01:10:05,600;01:10:07,200;"Nah, that's too far fetched."
01:10:07,200;01:10:09,000;"You got to kind of tone that down a bit."
01:10:09,000;01:10:10,840;"- Yeah, they would have taken a time out."
01:10:10,840;01:10:11,680;"- Yeah."
01:10:11,680;01:10:12,880;"- But no, it's fucking real or something."
01:10:12,880;01:10:13,720;"- Yeah."
01:10:13,720;01:10:15,000;"- Yeah, truck to men, no big deal."
01:10:15,000;01:10:16,760;"The true blood, so it's fine."
01:10:16,760;01:10:19,880;"- I mean, it's my indulgent, coaching philosophy, right?"
01:10:19,880;01:10:21,360;"- Yeah, next man up, that's what I'm saying."
01:10:21,360;01:10:23,680;"This is the bell check game."
01:10:23,680;01:10:26,240;"This is the game of the bell check philosophy."
01:10:26,240;01:10:27,240;"- The whole game."
01:10:27,240;01:10:29,080;"- It's that too."
01:10:29,080;01:10:30,880;"(laughing)"
01:10:30,880;01:10:31,760;"It's everything."
01:10:33,160;01:10:38,720;"But I think the best recipient for this happening was David Patton,"
01:10:38,720;01:10:40,600;"because he hadn't caught a pass yet this game."
01:10:40,600;01:10:44,960;"And all of a sudden, this is the David Patton drive because he caught all three"
01:10:44,960;01:10:49,480;"passes, including the touchdown with 58 seconds left, which look vaguely"
01:10:49,480;01:10:55,040;"familiar to a play we'll see next week in the Super Bowl and that back"
01:10:55,040;01:10:56,320;"corner of the end zone."
01:10:56,320;01:10:57,040;"Yeah."
01:10:57,040;01:11:03,120;"So, so blood so comes in with a minute 40 left and it's zip 15 yards."
01:11:03,120;01:11:07,200;"It's cranked out of bounds, zip, 10 yards, zip touchdown, four"
01:11:07,200;01:11:09,080;"plays, seven points."
01:11:09,080;01:11:11,160;"Like what the fuck just happened?"
01:11:11,160;01:11:13,760;"No, it wasn't his yet a 30 seconds."
01:11:13,760;01:11:17,560;"It was a third down where he had that nice touch pass before."
01:11:17,560;01:11:20,520;"No, no, that comes later."
01:11:20,520;01:11:21,800;"I know what you're talking about, but that comes later."
01:11:21,800;01:11:22,120;"Yeah."
01:11:22,120;01:11:22,480;"Yeah."
01:11:22,480;01:11:25,600;"This is four plays, 35 seconds and a touchdown."
01:11:25,600;01:11:29,640;"And then they're showing him on the sideline and there's some guy that has"
01:11:29,640;01:11:31,920;"like a towel up to his chin,"
01:11:31,920;01:11:34,560;"'cause I think it was the first pass of the,"
01:11:34,560;01:11:37,120;"the first completion that he had to patent,"
01:11:37,120;01:11:40,280;"he got clocked right in the chin."
01:11:40,280;01:11:41,120;"- Yeah, he's like, yeah."
01:11:41,120;01:11:41,960;"- And split his chin open."
01:11:41,960;01:11:43,600;"Now he's got like a band-aid on his chin,"
01:11:43,600;01:11:45,420;"and he's just like fucking badass."
01:11:45,420;01:11:50,520;"- And his reaction to throwing the touchdown was sick too."
01:11:50,520;01:11:52,840;"He just stares out at the sidelines and he gives it a,"
01:11:52,840;01:11:53,680;"- Who me?"
01:11:53,680;01:11:55,480;"(laughing)"
01:11:55,480;01:11:56,640;"- It was just like,"
01:11:56,640;01:11:58,200;"- I was like, ""Claring around him."""
01:11:58,200;01:12:00,360;"That was so fucking cool."
01:12:00,360;01:12:01,040;"Hey, Lucian."
01:12:01,040;01:12:02,760;"You're like, what else did you expect?"
01:12:02,760;01:12:04,320;"Yeah, of course we're on for a touchdown."
01:12:04,320;01:12:05,320;"What are you like?"
01:12:05,320;01:12:07,040;"Just so cool."
01:12:07,040;01:12:10,160;"So then the student will go back."
01:12:10,160;01:12:12,400;"Well, do you remember mom's reaction to that?"
01:12:12,400;01:12:15,400;"No, because mom was working."
01:12:15,400;01:12:16,400;"Remember?"
01:12:16,400;01:12:18,360;"Yeah, she was a hard blood so fan."
01:12:18,360;01:12:19,880;"He was a huge blood so fan."
01:12:19,880;01:12:22,960;"So like this whole season, she was like kind of like torn, like."
01:12:22,960;01:12:24,720;"Yeah, I remember doing blood."
01:12:24,720;01:12:28,640;"So but and as soon as Brady got hurt, she was like"
01:12:28,640;01:12:34,280;"immediately panicked and was like, but you know, she like hides in the background."
01:12:34,280;01:12:38,320;"She was hiding behind the couch, like peering over and watching the game."
01:12:38,320;01:12:42,400;"So funny."
01:12:42,400;01:12:43,760;"How did you feel about that?"
01:12:43,760;01:12:44,520;"Blas O'Touchdown?"
01:12:44,520;01:12:46,200;"Oh, exactly what you'd expect."
01:12:46,200;01:12:46,720;"She was hyped."
01:12:46,720;01:12:49,440;"She was whooping up a storm, I'm sure."
01:12:49,440;01:12:50,840;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:52,800;01:12:57,480;"So I thought the end of the half was actually pretty interesting because I'd forgotten about the end of half as well."
01:12:57,480;01:13:02,400;"Yeah, the Steelers actually, you know, they had what 58 seconds left, I think, something like that."
01:13:02,400;01:13:05,400;"So under a minute and they actually moved that they had all three time out."
01:13:05,400;01:13:12,160;"So they moved the ball down almost within field goal range and then they took a shot in the end zone and you boy."
01:13:12,160;01:13:13,200;"Or Boris."
01:13:13,200;01:13:17,440;"Like they had an OPI that pulled them back on Boris."
01:13:17,440;01:13:20,040;"Yeah, it's exactly what I was about to say."
01:13:21,760;01:13:26,160;"And now is on the shot that they took to Boris and Otis Smith played it perfectly."
01:13:26,160;01:13:32,200;"Otis Smith in this game, I thought, had one of the best games on defense."
01:13:32,200;01:13:37,480;"Because I mean, if he was a paxxial, Boris, that dude is a fucking."
01:13:37,480;01:13:39,480;"He's a he's a beast."
01:13:39,480;01:13:41,640;"He's a question, my quarter."
01:13:41,640;01:13:43,440;"I hate just hearing that name."
01:13:43,440;01:13:44,880;"And I hate him to."
01:13:44,880;01:13:48,360;"Yeah, I mean, I don't hate him, but that name just brings back memories."
01:13:48,360;01:13:49,640;"I'd rather not remember."
01:13:49,640;01:13:50,520;"Yeah."
01:13:50,680;01:13:55,640;"But he was like, it almost looked like he was a foot taller than Otis Smith."
01:13:55,640;01:13:59,800;"Or a foot taller than anybody else out there, but could run past them."
01:13:59,800;01:14:01,720;"It almost had like a."
01:14:01,720;01:14:06,680;"He had that same kind of gate as Randy Moss did, or it didn't look like he was"
01:14:06,680;01:14:08,800;"trying much, but he was still just running past people."
01:14:08,800;01:14:13,360;"But he just didn't have the awareness, I think, that Randy Moss had."
01:14:13,360;01:14:16,600;"And Otis Smith played him like a goddamn fiddle in this game."
01:14:16,600;01:14:20,240;"So they took a deep shot and Otis Smith was just in the perfect"
01:14:20,240;01:14:21,200;"position. So"
01:14:21,200;01:14:26,000;"plaques, you burn, just kind of grab them, pull them so it"
01:14:26,000;01:14:28,760;"wasn't an exception. So that was an office pass fringe to push"
01:14:28,760;01:14:34,280;"them outside of field goal range. And so they had to settle for"
01:14:34,280;01:14:37,000;"a Hail Mary, which got intercepted instead of an actual field"
01:14:37,000;01:14:37,280;"goal."
01:14:37,280;01:14:41,080;"Dude, the Hoardel Stewart didn't even make the end zone on his"
01:14:41,080;01:14:43,280;"Hail Mary from the 45 yard line."
01:14:43,280;01:14:48,200;"This is true quarterback crunch mercy. He couldn't even"
01:14:48,200;01:14:48,600;"Okay."
01:14:48,600;01:14:52,000;"With the drill, bet is on the back, I'm quarterback."
01:14:52,000;01:14:56,020;"You know, the positive side of the field is like, he made like the fight"
01:14:56,020;01:14:57,480;"through 40 yards in the air."
01:14:57,480;01:14:59,400;"Yeah, it's not great."
01:14:59,400;01:15:01,960;"He was under pressure, though, right?"
01:15:01,960;01:15:03,960;"I don't remember."
01:15:03,960;01:15:04,680;"I don't think so."
01:15:04,680;01:15:09,040;"Yeah, I remember still the Hail Mary."
01:15:09,040;01:15:12,280;"The like, the one thing you got to do is throw in the fucking end zone."
01:15:12,280;01:15:13,760;"Probably not."
01:15:13,760;01:15:16,600;"I, I remember hating court else to it."
01:15:17,760;01:15:24,400;"And rewatching this game really maybe realize why I hate him because he's so bad in this game."
01:15:24,400;01:15:26,080;"I never hated him."
01:15:26,080;01:15:27,880;"I was so bad for him for some reason."
01:15:27,880;01:15:28,080;"I don't know."
01:15:28,080;01:15:31,320;"It's like the quarterback you're waiting for the other shoe to drop, right?"
01:15:31,320;01:15:32,360;"Like, oh, they're due."
01:15:32,360;01:15:33,280;"Yeah."
01:15:33,280;01:15:37,080;"I guess."
01:15:37,080;01:15:39,120;"Are we doing best and worse?"
01:15:39,120;01:15:47,000;"My best was the offensive pass interference that Otis Smith managed to to pull."
01:15:47,000;01:15:55,680;"And my worst was the dirty hit on Drew Blum, Tom Brady, the cause of me get injured."
01:15:55,680;01:15:58,080;"Fuck you guys."
01:15:58,080;01:16:02,160;"My worst was Jason Gildian, Gildon."
01:16:02,160;01:16:04,160;"Gildon, yeah."
01:16:04,160;01:16:06,200;"He was a wrecking ball in this game."
01:16:06,200;01:16:07,440;"He was a monster, yeah."
01:16:07,440;01:16:09,360;"He killed the drive, the sack."
01:16:09,360;01:16:13,280;"He almost had a pick six, especially in that first half."
01:16:13,280;01:16:17,120;"actually the whole game he was in the backfield. We had no"
01:16:17,120;01:16:23,120;"answer. Yeah. And then my best is out here. I think like when"
01:16:23,120;01:16:27,200;"Brady came in and he see like all the players around him that"
01:16:27,200;01:16:29,680;"were like excited right? Like they were ready to go there"
01:16:29,680;01:16:35,360;"amped up. I think if he'd been in the Diva situation the whole"
01:16:35,360;01:16:39,520;"year and had been trying to create a divide and point not"
01:16:39,520;01:16:41,440;"taking the path he would I don't think he would have been"
01:16:41,440;01:16:43,680;"successful in that drive. I agree."
01:16:43,680;01:16:47,760;"Yeah, just to go back to Jason Gilden thing. He was first"
01:16:47,760;01:16:51,400;"team all bro to the only one on the team. The 12 sacks on the"
01:16:51,400;01:16:51,880;"season."
01:16:51,880;01:16:57,280;"Two in this game like Lydia pick six in his hand. He was a"
01:16:57,280;01:17:02,080;"fucking monster. Yeah. Greg, what about you? I mean, obviously"
01:17:02,080;01:17:06,840;"my best is the entire blood so situation. Oh, God. Yeah."
01:17:07,040;01:17:12,340;"very tail. You know, my worst is, I think this is in the second"
01:17:12,340;01:17:17,180;"quarter when they were showing Brady going back to the locker"
01:17:17,180;01:17:20,300;"room. And he was like kind of limping and one of the commentators"
01:17:20,300;01:17:24,260;"was like, he actually looks like he's walking better than he was"
01:17:24,260;01:17:27,020;"before it. And they started hopping on his good life."
01:17:27,020;01:17:29,780;"Nevermind."
01:17:29,780;01:17:34,380;"Phil Sims being wrong again. What a surprise. Yeah."
01:17:34,380;01:17:40,980;"And like, what a pretty such a fucking goofball to."
01:17:40,980;01:17:41,980;"Yeah."
01:17:41,980;01:17:47,580;"Like, he just looked like a child that's been hurt, but doesn't want to admit it."
01:17:47,580;01:17:48,580;"Yep."
01:17:48,580;01:17:51,180;"You know, I walk on this and then like, Oh, no, this ain't working."
01:17:51,180;01:17:52,980;"We're trying to walk on it again."
01:17:52,980;01:17:54,380;"Cause he saw like, Cam was on him."
01:17:54,380;01:17:56,180;"And it's like, why do you need to hop?"
01:17:56,180;01:17:57,580;"Like just walk slowly."
01:17:57,580;01:17:58,580;"Yeah."
01:17:58,580;01:18:00,980;"He's like speed walking to the locker room."
01:18:00,980;01:18:01,980;"Yeah."
01:18:01,980;01:18:06,980;"All right, so we're at halftime Greg. Do you want to do your wine review?"
01:18:06,980;01:18:09,980;"I sure do."
01:18:09,980;01:18:11,980;"Give it to me."
01:18:11,980;01:18:13,980;"All right."
01:18:13,980;01:18:15,980;"How is the Carolina Panthers wine?"
01:18:15,980;01:18:19,980;"Well, it's got a nice syrupy texture."
01:18:19,980;01:18:24,980;"It's got a great nose. Definitely some earthy oak."
01:18:24,980;01:18:26,980;"Nutty tones."
01:18:26,980;01:18:28,980;"Does it hurt to drink?"
01:18:28,980;01:18:31,100;"- I'm gonna drink it."
01:18:31,100;01:18:32,180;"- No."
01:18:32,180;01:18:33,020;"- Okay."
01:18:33,020;01:18:34,020;"- That's a good time."
01:18:34,020;01:18:37,980;"- It slides down the throat very smoothly."
01:18:37,980;01:18:38,820;"(laughs)"
01:18:38,820;01:18:40,120;"That's what she said."
01:18:40,120;01:18:42,580;"- Oh, we're gonna isolate that."
01:18:42,580;01:18:45,620;"That's gonna be the quote from this game."
01:18:45,620;01:18:48,220;"- It certainly,"
01:18:48,220;01:18:53,020;"it's certainly less underwhelming"
01:18:53,020;01:18:54,580;"than the Carolina Panthers."
01:18:54,580;01:18:57,420;"I'll say that. - I'll try to praise."
01:18:57,420;01:19:05,940;"how how would the cam Newton rate this is cam Newton I bet he is a wine guy right"
01:19:05,940;01:19:23,980;"because that's like a like a like and like you know by the way that's the worst if we can like if we can talk about how she Lebron is oh I always done to that yeah yeah it's a"
01:19:23,980;01:19:28,420;"Boston podcast. Sorry."
01:19:28,420;01:19:32,820;"I think Greg has finally drank the wine."
01:19:32,820;01:19:39,020;"So smoothly. There's so much pollen here."
01:19:39,020;01:19:42,860;"It's ridiculous. I feel like I'm eating pollen every day."
01:19:42,860;01:19:46,260;"Oh my God. Spring came early. It must happen."
01:19:46,260;01:19:48,980;"It happens like three times a day where I get this fucking."
01:19:48,980;01:19:52,540;"Great radio."
01:19:52,540;01:19:57,820;"Yeah, but LeBron fuck LeBron and is like thinking he's cool. You know what my"
01:19:57,820;01:20:04,220;"the thing that LeBron did that I hate the most was this."
01:20:04,220;01:20:11,660;"There was like, I don't know if you've ever seen how he like pretends to be a reader."
01:20:11,660;01:20:19,580;"And he's like always reading the godfather. The book. There was a situation one time where he was"
01:20:21,180;01:20:25,740;"You know they like when they do like the pregame stuff they show the players come in from the bus."
01:20:25,740;01:20:31,180;"Yeah well there's one time he was walking and reading the godfather right."
01:20:31,180;01:20:47,280;"Which first of all on his face is just ridiculous yeah that is no reason walks no good camera and flip the book open exactly he knew he's getting film so he flipped his book open to to be cool book reading guy which is a douche bag move."
01:20:48,380;01:20:55,040;"Because anybody that's tried to walk and read knows that it's like damn near impossible you had shaking you can't can't focus on work doesn't work"
01:20:55,040;01:20:58,420;"But then to make it worse there was"
01:20:58,420;01:21:04,920;"There was video of him earlier in the day at a practice session and after the practice session"
01:21:04,920;01:21:08,400;"he was reading the book on the sidelines and"
01:21:08,400;01:21:14,920;"Some internet sleuths look into it and when he was reading it on the sidelines fake reading it obviously"
01:21:14,920;01:21:18,480;"He was further along in the book than when he was reading it getting"
01:21:18,480;01:21:23,960;"Cuz he just opened a random page fucking typical"
01:21:23,960;01:21:28,000;"Who the fuck brings a book to practice? Oh my god"
01:21:28,000;01:21:32,220;"Like if that isn't a look at me move then oh, how'd a hundred percent is"
01:21:32,220;01:21:36,860;"How do we get here again? I don't know who the fuck is this great?"
01:21:42,400;01:21:47,400;"people we hate. How about this, uh, page of sealers game? Should we get in the third,"
01:21:47,400;01:21:51,200;"if we're getting the second half here. Yeah, this third quarter was tough to watch."
01:21:51,200;01:21:55,480;"It was a little bit. This, this was the, uh, this was the, uh, the,"
01:21:55,480;01:22:01,200;"it was come back a little bit. So 14, three going into the, I will say the,"
01:22:01,200;01:22:08,200;"uh, the first drive is yours was fun to watch the opening kickoff."
01:22:08,280;01:22:09,920;"Matt Shaddam's tackle on that one."
01:22:09,920;01:22:11,640;"I hope you guys spotted that."
01:22:11,640;01:22:19,720;"He is probably the best tackle I've seen of him so far, but he hit the guy"
01:22:19,720;01:22:24,880;"at a full speed run and it hit him so hard it bounced him back three yards,"
01:22:24,880;01:22:27,720;"but he still managed to hold on and dragged him down at the same time."
01:22:27,720;01:22:31,200;"Like that it was embarrassing."
01:22:31,200;01:22:34,720;"It was I think it was the same guy, Steve, that you were talking about the gunner on the"
01:22:34,720;01:22:34,960;"punt."
01:22:34,960;01:22:37,040;"Troy, I was I ate him again."
01:22:37,200;01:22:39,840;"Yeah, every time he touched the ball, I rooted for him to fail."
01:22:39,840;01:22:42,300;"And that was, and he felt like that was great."
01:22:42,300;01:22:43,000;"Yeah."
01:22:43,000;01:22:45,240;"Yeah, he couldn't get it past the whole game."
01:22:45,240;01:22:47,100;"No, he was not a great kicker."
01:22:47,100;01:22:48,000;"Turny."
01:22:48,000;01:22:51,040;"I mean, it was the Patriots special teams were much better than the."
01:22:51,040;01:22:53,780;"That was definitely an advantage for us in this game without a doubt."
01:22:53,780;01:22:54,340;"It definitely was."
01:22:54,340;01:22:55,340;"Yeah."
01:22:55,340;01:23:02,820;"But the CEO has also had a high award fumble overturned."
01:23:02,820;01:23:05,120;"Yeah, but had touching one."
01:23:05,120;01:23:06,420;"Yeah, exactly."
01:23:06,420;01:23:08,520;"And then Lewish and Neckdinks as well."
01:23:08,520;01:23:09,520;"Of course you did."
01:23:09,520;01:23:11,420;"So I guess definitely a fumble."
01:23:11,420;01:23:12,420;"It has to be overturned."
01:23:12,420;01:23:13,820;"No way you could not overturn."
01:23:13,820;01:23:15,120;"And then it got in his defense."
01:23:15,120;01:23:16,220;"They ruled it a fumble in the field."
01:23:16,220;01:23:17,320;"There's nothing to overturn it."
01:23:17,320;01:23:22,520;"I agree with him on that one, but still fuck Phil Sims and his shitty"
01:23:22,520;01:23:23,820;"commentation."
01:23:23,820;01:23:24,920;"Do you like his son?"
01:23:24,920;01:23:27,320;"You heard him at all?"
01:23:27,320;01:23:28,820;"I've honored him."
01:23:28,820;01:23:29,320;"No."
01:23:29,320;01:23:33,020;"What's his name?"
01:23:33,020;01:23:34,520;"Chris Sims."
01:23:34,920;01:23:39,120;"He played you play quarterback for a little bit. He does like commentary stuff or"
01:23:39,120;01:23:44,140;"PFT"
01:23:44,140;01:23:52,680;"Really? Pro football talk? Yeah with florio. He's one of my favorite football commentators going right now. Really? Okay?"
01:23:52,680;01:23:55,520;"Yeah, he's kind of like he's a bit of a prick, but"
01:23:55,520;01:24:02,720;"That's why you like him. I really like him a lot. You had to do you identify with him Greg? No"
01:24:04,160;01:24:06,160;"Well like the good"
01:24:06,160;01:24:15,220;"Fourth with Florio who's like a lawyer so he was always like shit not him for being a nerd so I can I can associate with that"
01:24:15,220;01:24:21,460;"Yeah, be a bit of a prank. Yeah, so some nerds I feel that"
01:24:21,460;01:24:27,700;"commentator going right now"
01:24:27,700;01:24:33,260;"Yeah, well, I mean like an analysis guy like postgame analysis guy"
01:24:33,260;01:24:48,260;"- Oh yeah, Bobby. I love Bobby. - I love Bobby. - I love Bobby. - He's so good. He just loves him some good blocking. And that's a major. He just warms my heart."
01:24:48,260;01:24:58,260;"- He's got an amazing like gravel voice too, which like makes it, he loves even better. - Yeah, he always sounds hyped up when he's like doing his breakdowns."
01:24:58,260;01:25:00,760;"He's like getting really cracking himself up for like"
01:25:00,760;01:25:07,580;"Like I gotta show you guys this he's been edging himself for yeah a good half hour"
01:25:07,580;01:25:11,020;"Like I'm right on the edge here. I'm just oh"
01:25:11,020;01:25:14,540;"This this block. Oh wait. He's there's block"
01:25:14,540;01:25:19,220;"Look at number 54 look at how his hands are extended. Oh"
01:25:19,220;01:25:26,980;"I love so yeah Baldi's break down if you if you haven't seen him definitely look him up. Yeah worth it"
01:25:26,980;01:25:36,460;"Speaking of hands extended or lack thereof, after the fumble was overturned from Heinz Ward,"
01:25:36,460;01:25:41,980;"the literal next play, chord else duet, fumbles a snap in perfect karma because the play shouldn't"
01:25:41,980;01:25:42,980;"have been overturned."
01:25:42,980;01:25:44,980;"Yeah, I have a note."
01:25:44,980;01:25:45,980;"Recover."
01:25:45,980;01:25:46,980;"Karma, bitch."
01:25:46,980;01:25:50,020;"Of course you did."
01:25:50,020;01:25:57,880;"That's a third quarter was not blood. So's best. He struggles on his first drive because"
01:25:57,880;01:26:05,280;"the page got the ball like deep inside steel's territory and not deep in psycho. It kind of"
01:26:05,280;01:26:14,260;"quotes 50 30 45. Maybe outside of field range. And I'm pretty sure this is the drive where"
01:26:14,260;01:26:17,620;"blood. So does his patented over the shoulder throw?"
01:26:17,620;01:26:19,500;"Yes."
01:26:19,500;01:26:24,540;"And he started four or five for 39 yards and touchdown. And then he does that"
01:26:24,540;01:26:29,460;"literally getting sacked and throws it at ball over shoulder. And I thought,"
01:26:29,460;01:26:34,020;"I mean, it's typical to go so, but I thought the intentional grounding call"
01:26:34,020;01:26:35,620;"was bullshit. It was."
01:26:35,620;01:26:40,100;"It was actually a guy that was running back in the vicinity."
01:26:40,100;01:26:43,460;"And like the only reason was attention grounded is because they hadn't seen"
01:26:43,460;01:26:47,100;"play for so many weeks. Like he'd been playing all year. But yeah, I just"
01:26:47,100;01:26:51,780;"blood so you knew there was a guy there. Yeah, but it just it didn't"
01:26:51,780;01:26:59,060;"happen. So so they go three and out and it's fourth and seven from like,"
01:26:59,060;01:27:05,140;"yeah, just outside fogorants, the patient had to go for it. And blood so I"
01:27:05,140;01:27:09,220;"think maybe still hyped up or maybe it's just typical drew blood. So"
01:27:09,500;01:27:14,540;"trying to throw wide receiver screen and basically just guns it into Troy Brown's face mask."
01:27:14,540;01:27:17,180;"Yeah, Troy Brown can't catch the ball and drops it."
01:27:17,180;01:27:19,540;"And so that's that's how fourth down goes."
01:27:19,540;01:27:23,780;"I remember mom being shook at this point, too."
01:27:23,780;01:27:28,500;"I was watching re-watching this game for the first time in 20 years."
01:27:28,500;01:27:30,060;"I was like, oh, fuck."
01:27:30,060;01:27:31,500;"I was like, the commentators."
01:27:31,500;01:27:35,140;"The commentators started talking about how, oh, you better remember this play"
01:27:35,140;01:27:38,180;"because, you know, the steals have momentum and it's."
01:27:38,940;01:27:45,180;"Well, I just came from like a purely blood so loving standpoint where she was like,"
01:27:45,180;01:27:47,660;"Oh, it couldn't have been better at the end of the first half."
01:27:47,660;01:27:49,980;"But now he's got to play the whole second."
01:27:49,980;01:27:54,900;"You're just probably secretly hoping that like Brady would come back and start the second half."
01:27:54,900;01:27:58,260;"And then I got to know he did his part."
01:27:58,260;01:28:00,540;"Yeah, he had his time in the sun."
01:28:00,540;01:28:02,020;"And now we can go back into this."
01:28:02,020;01:28:03,740;"Don't have any honest question."
01:28:04,620;01:28:12,200;"Honest question. If Brady says he wants to give it a go, start of the third quarter near the coach. What do you do?"
01:28:12,200;01:28:18,800;"You put that. That's my question here. Like, was the third quarterback even dressed?"
01:28:18,800;01:28:23,500;"Because Damon Heward, I saw him on the side. I don't know if he was active or not for the game."
01:28:23,500;01:28:27,740;"I believe. And like, if what's so got hurt, would they put Brady back in?"
01:28:27,740;01:28:29,820;"Because he looked OK in that second half-ish."
01:28:29,820;01:28:33,500;"Like, you say, he was throwing passes on the sideline."
01:28:33,500;01:28:37,340;"But with a bad ankle, you can do that."
01:28:37,340;01:28:40,100;"That's true. Yeah. Yeah."
01:28:40,100;01:28:43,220;"You can play on a bad ankle. You just can't do it."
01:28:43,220;01:28:44,820;"He could stay in there and throw it."
01:28:44,820;01:28:46,500;"Yeah, you don't scramble."
01:28:46,500;01:28:48,460;"Everything you just doing shotgun."
01:28:48,460;01:28:50,260;"Yeah, it's got to limit your playbook, right?"
01:28:50,260;01:28:52,940;"Oh, absolutely. Yeah."
01:28:52,940;01:28:56,580;"But just from like right in the momentum of the end of the first half,"
01:28:56,580;01:28:59,580;"even if he's like, yeah, I can give it a go."
01:28:59,580;01:29:01,780;"If I was a coach, I'd be like, you know what?"
01:29:01,780;01:29:08,040;"Like let's just see how this plays out and I'd be like, I Brady, we don't want to push you. We're gonna need you"
01:29:08,040;01:29:11,480;"Yeah, Super Bowl. Hey, that's a great point. Let's"
01:29:11,480;01:29:14,880;"Because literally the next drive"
01:29:14,880;01:29:19,320;"The steel is drive down at the field goal range"
01:29:19,320;01:29:24,900;"And the pair actually had an interception was brought back by"
01:29:24,900;01:29:27,360;"defensive off-sides"
01:29:27,360;01:29:30,960;"Yeah, and the acid interference was a whole bunch of like defensive penalties on the drive"
01:29:30,960;01:29:34,680;"You get in a field goal range and this is the field goal that gets blocked"
01:29:34,680;01:29:40,040;"Where Troy Brown scoops it up laddles it to Antoine Harris and he returns it for a touchdown"
01:29:40,040;01:29:43,440;"So I'm wondering I added this to Steve"
01:29:43,440;01:29:48,160;"Watching this game the other day right for it where Willie drops the pick"
01:29:48,160;01:29:52,680;"They try to play a little quick out route and William again is right there"
01:29:52,680;01:29:55,340;"It's right in the hands and he almost has a second chance at it"
01:29:56,240;01:30:01,120;"And that's even later in this game though. No, this is right before the field goal"
01:30:01,120;01:30:05,860;"That was that third down fuck you right? Yeah, because you're set to go and that same drive"
01:30:05,860;01:30:12,880;"We had that was negated by the off sides. Yep, and then william again is like had a shore pick in his hands"
01:30:12,880;01:30:16,840;"It's them right in the hands that he drops. Yeah, it's him in the hands"
01:30:16,840;01:30:18,840;"He he knocked it down to his knees"
01:30:18,840;01:30:25,000;"Bounces up and he still doesn't catch it. Yeah, cuz I'll send one snapchat of him dropping the pick and then the"
01:30:25,560;01:30:32,160;"the field goal block. Yeah. And he's still great to come on this podcast. What a guy."
01:30:32,160;01:30:39,180;"We're best. But let's get into that blocked field because it's it's an absolutely"
01:30:39,180;01:30:45,800;"incredible play by Troy Brown. Is it a best Troy Brown player ever? You did this game."
01:30:45,800;01:30:52,440;"The partner turn. The only thing we had going in the first quarter and then obviously this"
01:30:52,440;01:30:55,020;"play is just peak, peak, Troy Brown."
01:30:55,020;01:31:01,260;"And I encourage listeners to go back and look at the video again, because I like"
01:31:01,260;01:31:08,940;"my memory wasn't what it was like he, like that, the kicker is like a yard away"
01:31:08,940;01:31:10,240;"from him when he goes to scoops."
01:31:10,240;01:31:14,640;"Like anything, anything outside of an absolutely perfect scoop."
01:31:14,640;01:31:15,700;"He's fucked."
01:31:15,700;01:31:16,540;"He's getting tackled."
01:31:16,540;01:31:20,180;"And I know like scoops it doesn't even break stride."
01:31:20,460;01:31:25,380;"And then laterals it like without a thought in the next second like a perfectly"
01:31:25,380;01:31:26,780;"I know how"
01:31:26,780;01:31:28,620;"That's a thing though like"
01:31:28,620;01:31:31,620;"It only Troy Brown would have lateraled that because"
01:31:31,620;01:31:36,780;"Everybody else would be like I can break the the tackle of a kicker and I'm gonna keep going and it gets dragged down"
01:31:36,780;01:31:40,300;"Yeah, Troy Brown's like how do I make this work?"
01:31:40,300;01:31:46,300;"I think that guy's something to tackle just laterals will follow on the ball just jump on that ball too. Yeah"
01:31:46,300;01:31:48,620;"I think that's a bell to eat is my just jump on it"
01:31:48,620;01:31:55,420;"But Troy probably has enough experience like returning puns and catching him off the bounce and stuff true that he read it"
01:31:55,420;01:31:58,460;"grabbed it by a time he's like a"
01:31:58,460;01:32:02,220;"New that it didn't matter because the ball was backwards"
01:32:02,220;01:32:06,340;"It didn't matter if he jumped on her or if he like muffed that and he didn't pick it up"
01:32:06,340;01:32:14,620;"He gets the ball there anyway true. Yeah, I had a question on this said I don't know the answer to so he scoops it right"
01:32:15,660;01:32:17,860;"if he"
01:32:17,860;01:32:23,420;"Then like he took a few steps and then lateral that he made like 10 yards if he's if he"
01:32:23,420;01:32:27,980;"Lattles it and that gets dropped and the Steelers recover"
01:32:27,980;01:32:32,880;"Are they first down from there? Is that considered like change of possession?"
01:32:32,880;01:32:37,780;"Yeah, if the Madden video game is not anything then yes"
01:32:37,780;01:32:45,340;"Okay, but I think to Greg's point of like you I don't even know Ben like that because it was so close between"
01:32:45,340;01:32:47,980;"between him picking it and laterallying it."
01:32:47,980;01:32:48,820;"- True."
01:32:48,820;01:32:49,980;"- It wasn't like he ran 10 yards."
01:32:49,980;01:32:52,920;"It was like he took one or two steps if that."
01:32:52,920;01:32:53,760;"- Yep."
01:32:53,760;01:32:54,920;"- And he was gonna tackle one down."
01:32:54,920;01:32:57,640;"- I'm just chucked into the guy and white nice on him."
01:32:57,640;01:33:00,120;"- I don't even know how he saw him either."
01:33:00,120;01:33:01,760;"- It was perfect."
01:33:01,760;01:33:03,100;"- It was that bang bang."
01:33:03,100;01:33:05,060;"It was like scoop it, take a step or two"
01:33:05,060;01:33:07,960;"and then pitch it perfectly to the page."
01:33:07,960;01:33:10,420;"- Whenever somebody mentions the name Troy Brown,"
01:33:10,420;01:33:12,980;"that's the first one that comes to my mind."
01:33:12,980;01:33:19,380;"mine is the the interception against the charges where you stripped it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's"
01:33:19,380;01:33:25,780;"number two. That one's better to me or the or the interception of Drew blood. So as a defensive"
01:33:25,780;01:33:32,820;"back. Yeah. I mean, that was cool for like posterity reasons, but the like in the meeting,"
01:33:32,820;01:33:38,180;"meaningfulness of the game that's that's fumble against the charges was just"
01:33:39,380;01:33:46,080;"This game itself though. He's got 14 points on the board here."
01:33:46,080;01:33:48,080;"Yeah. All by himself."
01:33:48,080;01:33:49,780;"By himself and not an offense."
01:33:49,780;01:33:50,780;"Yeah."
01:33:50,780;01:33:56,380;"You also shout out Antoine Harris, local Raleigh, North Carolina legend."
01:33:56,380;01:33:57,380;"Yeah."
01:33:57,380;01:34:02,580;"Yeah. If we can find a way, I'd love to have him on the podcast because I think he's one of those."
01:34:02,580;01:34:19,580;"he's like that same kind of mold of that middle class of Patriots players that's kind of the foundation of that Belichick system, you know."
01:34:19,580;01:34:23,580;"Yeah, he's got like a semi following around here."
01:34:23,580;01:34:24,580;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:24,580;01:34:29,640;"Yeah, because he's like, he's a Raleigh born and bred and there's tons of New Englanders"
01:34:29,640;01:34:30,740;"living in Raleigh."
01:34:30,740;01:34:36,220;"And there's like a Patriots bar downtown where they all watch the games and he shows"
01:34:36,220;01:34:39,500;"up all the time and like does autographs and pictures and shit like that."
01:34:39,500;01:34:42,220;"Brown, you got to get, you got to go talk to him when he does."
01:34:42,220;01:34:47,180;"Dude, I get weird about like that kind of stuff."
01:34:47,180;01:34:48,380;"So do I, and I'm still doing it."
01:34:48,380;01:34:49,380;"So fucking."
01:34:49,380;01:34:51,460;"Yeah, well, why don't you fucking mama, Mandy?"
01:34:51,460;01:34:52,460;"Huh?"
01:34:52,460;01:34:56,460;"If I get some of the podcasts, let's fucking do this."
01:34:56,460;01:34:58,020;"Because I don't know."
01:34:58,020;01:35:03,700;"If I was famous, I'd be like, uh, sick of people trying to, you know, but that's the"
01:35:03,700;01:35:04,700;"thing though."
01:35:04,700;01:35:10,420;"I feel like he's that classic guys who probably appreciated the attention because he doesn't"
01:35:10,420;01:35:15,700;"get it a lot because he's not famous famous, you know, oh, he's famous boy."
01:35:15,700;01:35:19,700;"I bet he's not like going out to the grocery store and be like, Oh my God, that's Antoine Harris."
01:35:19,700;01:35:20,380;"That's true."
01:35:20,380;01:35:23,180;"Like he can still live his life."
01:35:23,180;01:35:26,900;"But when people recognize him, that's, that's kind of feel good when people recognize."
01:35:26,900;01:35:27,300;"Yeah."
01:35:27,300;01:35:29,340;"She was like, I deal with him on a famous."
01:35:29,340;01:35:30,380;"Yeah."
01:35:30,380;01:35:31,140;"That's what I'm saying."
01:35:31,140;01:35:33,700;"I wish I was Antoine Harris."
01:35:33,700;01:35:40,260;"I want, I wish I want to be like, like a investment banker."
01:35:40,260;01:35:44,580;"Rich, where you're not famous at all, but you just have a fuckload of money."
01:35:45,020;01:35:46,780;"See, you know, so here's my thing."
01:35:46,780;01:35:47,900;"I said this for a while."
01:35:47,900;01:35:52,860;"I want to be famous for something I've made, but I don't want people to recognize me."
01:35:52,860;01:35:55,420;"I can go to a party and be like, Oh, so what do you do?"
01:35:55,420;01:35:57,340;"I'm like, Oh, I made this thing that everybody uses."
01:35:57,340;01:35:59,020;"You're like, I mean, podcast."
01:35:59,020;01:36:00,660;"Right."
01:36:00,660;01:36:01,180;"Yeah, exactly."
01:36:01,180;01:36:03,260;"Like, I wrote a podcast that's super fucking famous."
01:36:03,260;01:36:04,060;"You may have heard of me."
01:36:04,060;01:36:05,460;"You're like, that's what you want."
01:36:05,460;01:36:06,380;"Podcast, Sandy."
01:36:06,380;01:36:07,260;"Exactly."
01:36:07,260;01:36:07,500;"Yeah."
01:36:07,500;01:36:11,500;"Nobody knows what I look like, except way less talented."
01:36:11,500;01:36:13,500;"Hey, go fuck yourself."
01:36:14,620;01:36:16,220;"And significantly uglier."
01:36:16,220;01:36:18,820;"How many times will we boot a great from this podcast?"
01:36:18,820;01:36:21,740;"Cause a lot of these times it's going to be fucking and we've never seen"
01:36:21,740;01:36:24,300;"people we know Andy's ugly or just by like"
01:36:24,300;01:36:28,140;"listen, you prick."
01:36:28,140;01:36:31,900;"I have to put up with it."
01:36:31,900;01:36:34,180;"It's statistically almost guaranteed."
01:36:34,180;01:36:40,540;"Just because your mom says you look like Tom Brady doesn't mean you actually do."
01:36:40,540;01:36:44,140;"I love wine episode."
01:36:44,140;01:36:57,140;"I have never heard Heinz Field so quiet, which is fucking phenomenal."
01:36:57,140;01:37:04,140;"I have after that blown touchdown by a Rothace burger when he fakes spiked it into a pick."
01:37:04,140;01:37:08,140;"But that was what 14 years later, 13 years later."
01:37:08,140;01:37:18,040;"Yeah. Yeah. But it didn't last because the steel score two touchdowns in this, this quarter, a Jerome"
01:37:18,040;01:37:21,220;"bettous touchdown, which actually should have been a"
01:37:21,220;01:37:23,020;"fuck."
01:37:23,020;01:37:24,620;"Zero away. Yeah."
01:37:24,620;01:37:26,480;"He had zero way."
01:37:26,480;01:37:26,980;"There it is."
01:37:26,980;01:37:28,220;"Easy. Yeah."
01:37:28,220;01:37:28,900;"It was no."
01:37:28,900;01:37:29,460;"No, no, no."
01:37:29,460;01:37:31,220;"These referees were garbage."
01:37:31,220;01:37:37,220;"And this is actually when I wrote down the referees, these referees are garbage was because it was"
01:37:37,220;01:37:39,940;"clearly a touchdown, but like, oh, no, he stepped out at the two."
01:37:39,940;01:37:44,180;"And it was blatantly obviously it didn't almost similar to the, um,"
01:37:44,180;01:37:46,340;"Nikila Harry touchdown against the Chiefs."
01:37:46,340;01:37:50,740;"It was more blatant than that that he didn't step out of bounds."
01:37:50,740;01:37:51,420;"Yeah."
01:37:51,420;01:37:52,100;"It was fun."
01:37:52,100;01:37:56,940;"Because of how many bad calls are a bit in this game or even close calls, if you"
01:37:56,940;01:38:00,860;"will, uh, the Steelers didn't have any more challenges."
01:38:00,860;01:38:04,220;"They couldn't challenge that to run a play, but they were at the two year"
01:38:04,220;01:38:04,380;"line."
01:38:04,380;01:38:06,340;"And when the bus ran in for touchdown."
01:38:06,780;01:38:12,940;"So the buses like actual legitimate step line was what minus one carry minus two yards minus one touchdown."
01:38:12,940;01:38:15,120;"Yeah, this is notable."
01:38:15,120;01:38:16,740;"And that he gained positive yards."
01:38:16,740;01:38:17,560;"Right."
01:38:17,560;01:38:17,860;"Yeah."
01:38:17,860;01:38:19,320;"And score touchdown on it."
01:38:19,320;01:38:20,020;"Yeah."
01:38:20,020;01:38:21,360;"I didn't even know if he got in either."
01:38:21,360;01:38:22,380;"Like look, I guess that up."
01:38:22,380;01:38:23,520;"It was borderline."
01:38:23,520;01:38:24,620;"You probably could challenge that."
01:38:24,620;01:38:26,460;"But at this point, everybody's so fucking."
01:38:26,460;01:38:27,820;"Boy, challenging."
01:38:27,820;01:38:29,220;"It's like, it's like, yeah, fuck it."
01:38:29,220;01:38:30,500;"That let's just let it ride."
01:38:30,500;01:38:31,900;"Um."
01:38:33,540;01:38:37,440;"And then the ensuing pages drive was more of the same."
01:38:37,440;01:38:39,080;"It was a false start penalty started."
01:38:39,080;01:38:44,960;"Bloodsauce sacked again, which brought back a whole flood of memories of blood."
01:38:44,960;01:38:47,680;"So it was one of those ones where you just held the ball too long."
01:38:47,680;01:38:48,260;"Yeah."
01:38:48,260;01:38:49,440;"Like Patty cake with it."
01:38:49,440;01:38:51,360;"Throw it, throw it, throw it."
01:38:51,360;01:38:51,800;"Fuck."
01:38:51,800;01:38:53,000;"That's actually kind of that."
01:38:53,000;01:38:53,640;"God damn it."
01:38:53,640;01:38:54,840;"Happy food."
01:38:54,840;01:38:55,440;"Bloodsauce."
01:38:55,440;01:38:56,200;"Bloodsauce."
01:38:56,200;01:38:59,880;"Patty cake then shitty punt coverage because it returned that punt to like the 35."
01:38:59,880;01:39:01,320;"That's when they got that second touchdown."
01:39:01,320;01:39:02,020;"Yep."
01:39:02,200;01:39:08,200;"So they returned the punt and actually I will shout out the punter."
01:39:08,200;01:39:12,120;"Lee. Well, no, not Lee Johnson."
01:39:12,120;01:39:14,240;"It was Ken and Walter."
01:39:14,240;01:39:15,000;"Yes. Thank you."
01:39:15,000;01:39:16,560;"Such a punter name, Ken."
01:39:16,560;01:39:18,320;"Yeah."
01:39:18,320;01:39:19,320;"There he is."
01:39:19,320;01:39:23,880;"Everybody's a single father just doing his best to my friends call me Kenny."
01:39:23,880;01:39:28,760;"Well, in professional circumstances, I go by Ken."
01:39:28,760;01:39:29,800;"Yeah. I go by Kenneth."
01:39:29,800;01:39:31,680;"Yeah. I just feels more professional."
01:39:31,680;01:39:37,920;"Yeah. So Ken Wald, but he was fucking hustling. He's the one that actually ran the partner"
01:39:37,920;01:39:45,160;"turn out of bounds, but for a minute, about a balance at the New England 32. So if you"
01:39:45,160;01:39:51,040;"play later, Amos famous Amos scores a touchdown. This game is a get a little close."
01:39:51,040;01:39:55,320;"Cookies for everybody. That's a good like, Steve, you want to hear some marketing shit"

01:40:06,860;01:40:12,000;"What about maybe if they missed two extra points in the fourth quarter, free"
01:40:12,000;01:40:12,820;"cookies for everybody?"
01:40:12,820;01:40:14,940;"What?"
01:40:14,940;01:40:17,820;"What the fuck are you talking about?"
01:40:17,820;01:40:21,420;"You're in a basketball game with a if you miss both free throws, like everyone"

01:42:19,380;01:42:25,960;"Belichick was like I don't give a fuck about that penalty. That was worth it. He barely touched him"
01:42:25,960;01:42:30,400;"It was a swap. I keep I have I have on here this note over and over again"
01:42:30,400;01:42:33,720;"And it keeps getting like in bigger and bigger caps of like so many home calls"
01:42:36,340;01:42:40,380;"No, they weren't home calls. There's bad calls on both sides of the ball"
01:42:40,380;01:42:47,300;"Yeah, I don't believe in home calls. I do but not in this game in professional sports, dude"
01:42:47,300;01:42:53,460;"These guys they know they don't do home calls. I just agree. I had a worse"
01:42:53,460;01:42:56,720;"We're right after the turnover the karma turnover"
01:42:56,720;01:43:03,060;"Let's all take the shot to the end zone the same one there. They got the touchdown on oh, yeah and just"

01:43:21,280;01:43:26,520;"Where you got strip sacked and it's that kind of like right on the edge strip sack or might have been"
01:43:26,520;01:43:33,740;"Strip sack and you watch that Patriots player just like come flying in from nowhere and jump on the ball"
01:43:33,740;01:43:37,000;"I don't know who it was, but I wrote down his toy brown because it felt now"
01:43:37,000;01:43:42,140;"I looked at I had to like rewind it and pause it. It was John's in one. Here's he is Charles Johnson"
01:43:42,140;01:43:45,700;"Yeah, oh shit. All right, and I thought he was Bethel Johnson the whole game"
01:43:45,700;01:43:53,820;"Charles Johnson who used to play for the steals which I think is why he put so much fucking effort in this game and he's on the"
01:43:53,820;01:43:59,820;"List of touchdown catches from Brady with one he is yeah, we saw it. I think it was in the"
01:44:00,940;01:44:02,540;"- The Saints game. - The Saints game, yeah."
01:44:02,540;01:44:04,860;"And it was a fucking laser vibrating."
01:44:04,860;01:44:07,180;"- Yeah, we should do a live"
01:44:07,180;01:44:09,820;"sporkle for Brady,"
01:44:09,820;01:44:13,220;"like TD recipients."
01:44:13,220;01:44:15,420;"- All right, you've already done it once."
01:44:15,420;01:44:16,780;"I've seen you-- - I've done it, yeah, yeah."
01:44:16,780;01:44:18,620;"It's actually one pun."
01:44:18,620;01:44:21,700;"- Yeah, it's super hard 'cause there's fucking 70 something"
01:44:21,700;01:44:22,800;"of them. - Yeah."
01:44:22,800;01:44:27,900;"And it's just interesting like going through 20,"
01:44:27,900;01:44:31,540;"your whole sports fandom of players and being like,"
01:44:31,540;01:44:34,180;"all right, how many receivers can you remember"
01:44:34,180;01:44:35,380;"of your sports fandom?"
01:44:35,380;01:44:37,020;"- Yeah, that's basically what it is."
01:44:37,020;01:44:38,620;"- Is there so many obscure people too?"
01:44:38,620;01:44:39,780;"And then you'd be like, ""Johnson,"""
01:44:39,780;01:44:41,020;"and it'll bring up like three Johnsons,"
01:44:41,020;01:44:42,020;"and they're like, ""Oh yeah."""
01:44:42,020;01:44:43,620;"- Oh, well, that was great."
01:44:43,620;01:44:45,700;"(laughs)"
01:44:45,700;01:44:48,060;"- All right, so you guys,"
01:44:48,060;01:44:48,900;"- I think that's the other one."
01:44:48,900;01:44:53,900;"- Our best best is after Troy Lattles"
01:44:53,900;01:44:57,140;"for the field go return."
01:44:57,140;01:44:58,620;"Yeah, they had a shot."
01:44:58,620;01:45:03,700;"The great work by seeing the S of Tom Brady celebrating jumping on one leg."
01:45:03,700;01:45:05,700;"I didn't see you."
01:45:05,700;01:45:06,700;"Oh, yeah."
01:45:06,700;01:45:08,580;"No, that was my other best for the game."
01:45:08,580;01:45:09,540;"God."
01:45:09,540;01:45:12,260;"Screaming like a girl like in Seattle Super Bowl."
01:45:12,260;01:45:16,140;"Yeah, but literally, but on one leg, it was exactly the same, like"
01:45:16,140;01:45:19,220;"jumping up and down with his hands on his head, but on one leg, this"
01:45:19,220;01:45:19,820;"phenomenal."
01:45:19,820;01:45:21,140;"I love Brady."
01:45:21,140;01:45:23,820;"He was so pumped up for this game."
01:45:23,820;01:45:25,820;"I'm so pumped up for like Drew Bladto."
01:45:26,180;01:45:27,540;"Everything that was happening."
01:45:27,540;01:45:28,940;"He was so pissed he wasn't in there,"
01:45:28,940;01:45:31,180;"but he was like in a good way."
01:45:31,180;01:45:32,340;"It was amazing."
01:45:32,340;01:45:36,140;"- I got a worse that I missed from earlier in the game."
01:45:36,140;01:45:41,820;"I think it was in the first quarter."
01:45:41,820;01:45:45,820;"The fourth in one situations where they bring the people"
01:45:45,820;01:45:49,620;"out the offense out and do the hard count."
01:45:49,620;01:45:50,460;"- Right."
01:45:50,460;01:45:54,060;"- And call time out, I fucking cannot stand that."
01:45:54,060;01:45:55,060;"- Why not?"
01:45:55,060;01:45:57,840;"'cause it never works."
01:45:57,840;01:45:59,980;"And it said, ""Tees, you're like, all right,"
01:45:59,980;01:46:01,600;"you're going for something, you get hyped up"
01:46:01,600;01:46:04,140;"and then you're like, that was lame."""
01:46:04,140;01:46:05,420;"- Oh, and it was a success."
01:46:05,420;01:46:08,740;"- As a defense, you're so relieved though, right?"
01:46:08,740;01:46:10,940;"Like if it's the pages on defense and they do that,"
01:46:10,940;01:46:12,340;"you're like, ""Oh fuck, nobody's gonna fall for that."
01:46:12,340;01:46:13,180;"Fuck off."""
01:46:13,180;01:46:14,380;"- I guess, yeah."
01:46:14,380;01:46:17,140;"But I just like, have you ever seen a work?"
01:46:17,140;01:46:19,380;"I can't even think of an instance where I saw it work."
01:46:19,380;01:46:21,500;"- It must have worked at some point."
01:46:21,500;01:46:23,420;"- It just feels like one of those coach things"
01:46:23,420;01:46:25,100;"where they're like, oh yeah."
01:46:25,100;01:46:27,220;"- I think it's worked before, but yeah."
01:46:27,220;01:46:28,700;"- It probably worked like twice."
01:46:28,700;01:46:31,140;"And then ever since then, every coach in the world"
01:46:31,140;01:46:33,100;"has been like, oh, fourth in one,"
01:46:33,100;01:46:34,860;"they're coming out there and they do a motion"
01:46:34,860;01:46:37,220;"or a shift to start the set."
01:46:37,220;01:46:39,500;"- Oh, they just did like four or five motions on this plane."
01:46:39,500;01:46:41,220;"- Yeah, it's always so up."
01:46:41,220;01:46:43,260;"Yeah, 'cause they're like, oh, shift, up motion."
01:46:43,260;01:46:45,180;"You're like, there's no fucking changes."
01:46:45,180;01:46:46,020;"- They snap this wall."
01:46:46,020;01:46:49,140;"- Well, what's, has it ever been where like everyone"
01:46:49,140;01:46:52,300;"in the stadium thinks that they're not gonna go for it?"
01:46:52,300;01:46:55,420;"And then all of a sudden with like two seconds left in the play clock, they snap it."
01:46:55,420;01:46:56,940;"Yeah, that's a fucking good call."
01:46:56,940;01:46:58,180;"They should do that."
01:46:58,180;01:47:02,980;"They should do a shift emotion and then like hard count and then"
01:47:02,980;01:47:06,420;"then the quarterback walks off the field and they direct snap it to the fucking"
01:47:06,420;01:47:07,020;"running back."
01:47:07,020;01:47:08,780;"Yes, that's genius."
01:47:08,780;01:47:10,500;"Oh, no, Bella check."
01:47:10,500;01:47:12,340;"Now, we should email."
01:47:12,340;01:47:14,300;"Uh, what does the pink stripes guy?"
01:47:14,300;01:47:15,060;"Oh, yeah."
01:47:15,060;01:47:18,620;"Fucks this name, Ernie, Ernie Adams."
01:47:18,620;01:47:19,380;"Yes."
01:47:19,940;01:47:25,040;"We should send him if anybody who's listening knows Ernie Adams email"
01:47:25,040;01:47:29,160;"Seeing if you can get like an advanced scouting"
01:47:29,160;01:47:32,920;"If you're listening this up at"
01:47:32,920;01:47:39,760;"Patriots dynasty 2001 on Twitter. Yeah, and let's just send him any of us it won't have any words"
01:47:39,760;01:47:45,740;"It'll just be like play sheets. Yeah, oh hundreds. Oh, yeah. No, we've got plenty of plays that we can write up for you"
01:47:45,740;01:47:47,220;"Yeah"
01:47:47,220;01:47:51,740;"All right, fourth quarter fourth quarter, baby. This is crunch time"
01:47:51,740;01:47:54,980;"Patre's clinging to a lead 21 17"
01:47:54,980;01:47:59,340;"They have the ball they're driving if they actually finally get a first down"
01:47:59,340;01:48:05,720;"This is literally the first down in the first half is on the last drive in third quarter sneaky big grab by Johnson"
01:48:05,720;01:48:08,840;"Yep, and then they get another which was"
01:48:08,840;01:48:13,220;"Drew blood so on third and short"
01:48:13,980;01:48:17,860;"getting lit the fuck up like he does like a jump pass and"
01:48:17,860;01:48:24,000;"It takes a shot it would have been to the chest but now it's to the groin"
01:48:24,000;01:48:27,440;"Yeah, you jumped up but completes it to the"
01:48:27,440;01:48:34,660;"To mark Edwards on there actually a couple of nice runs by Antoine in there right before that - though"
01:48:34,660;01:48:35,740;"No was yet"
01:48:35,740;01:48:42,300;"And so like a tiny little grip on the run game there which I think set up that pass to the fullback"
01:48:42,660;01:48:45,980;"It is it's that typical Patriots, you know"
01:48:45,980;01:48:50,900;"Run a few times get to third and short and then convert it with with the pass"
01:48:50,900;01:48:54,420;"Did it a couple times and got into"
01:48:54,420;01:48:56,820;"Philgoal range enough that"
01:48:56,820;01:49:01,980;"Out of a tarry kicked along Philgo. It's like 45 is yards give or take"
01:49:01,980;01:49:04,980;"hit that"
01:49:04,980;01:49:07,900;"I'm gonna pass her up 24 17 and"
01:49:07,900;01:49:11,540;"the"
01:49:11,660;01:49:17,660;"Steel is get the ball back. Another plexico burris offensive pass interference that's two in the game"
01:49:17,660;01:49:23,900;"Which I don't think has ever happened before that I can remember two offensive pass interference on the same wide receiver"
01:49:23,900;01:49:28,700;"But this was a gang going back to oda smith just kind of owning shit"
01:49:28,700;01:49:36,220;"And he was he was lined up on plexico burris and tyla was lined up on high and swatch just the entire game"
01:49:36,220;01:49:40,540;"Wherever they went there was just shadowing them the news of those wide receivers had a good game"
01:49:41,500;01:49:45,900;"No, especially Heinz. I think Tyler did an amazing job on him."
01:49:45,900;01:49:46,780;"Yeah."
01:49:46,780;01:49:47,460;"I think it's good."
01:49:47,460;01:49:51,220;"No, and there was a there's actually one play."
01:49:51,220;01:49:52,660;"I don't even remember what the play was."
01:49:52,660;01:49:55,500;"I think it was like a run play or maybe it was."
01:49:55,500;01:50:00,420;"Cornell Stewart, like running for a couple yards, but you could."
01:50:00,420;01:50:03,660;"It showed in the foreground."
01:50:03,660;01:50:09,180;"Otis Smith just kind of punching Plaxo burst in the chest as you"
01:50:09,180;01:50:12,180;"tried to get off the line and Plaxo-Burs did know to deal with it."
01:50:12,180;01:50:14,580;"And the comment is actually called it out at one point."
01:50:14,580;01:50:15,180;"Yeah."
01:50:15,180;01:50:18,640;"And it was it was kind of how the whole game went."
01:50:18,640;01:50:19,840;"You just you just."
01:50:19,840;01:50:25,380;"Hoda Smith just kind of was too physical for Plaxo-Burs in this entire game."
01:50:25,380;01:50:26,740;"And Plaxo just didn't know what to do."
01:50:26,740;01:50:29,700;"He didn't have a gun in his sweatpants, so he couldn't."
01:50:29,700;01:50:31,460;"He couldn't handle this shit."
01:50:31,460;01:50:35,460;"That's a that reminds me one year on Halloween, I had a friend who had a"
01:50:35,460;01:50:41,480;"Plaskood burst giant's jersey and I was him for Halloween. I got a pair of sweatpants put a shit"
01:50:41,480;01:50:43,480;"Let it catch up all in the dick area"
01:50:43,480;01:50:47,180;"I'm like a BB gun in my pants and I want this"
01:50:47,180;01:50:51,680;"Steve Brad you never feel disappointed"
01:50:51,680;01:50:55,400;"It's in all time"
01:50:55,400;01:51:02,100;"That's an all-time bone head move. Oh, it's not great a gun without a safety in sweatpants"
01:51:02,100;01:51:04,600;"I don't even put my cell phone in my sweatpants"
01:51:04,600;01:51:05,600;"Yeah, right."
01:51:05,600;01:51:10,720;"That's a club that falls out every time you go through a club in sweatpants, by the way."
01:51:10,720;01:51:12,480;"Like, I don't go to many clubs."
01:51:12,480;01:51:15,640;"The one I do, it ain't sweatpants because they don't fucking let you in."
01:51:15,640;01:51:19,800;"Yeah, that's like a, he just had like a contract."
01:51:19,800;01:51:22,720;"I feel like that feels right."
01:51:22,720;01:51:23,720;"Yeah."
01:51:23,720;01:51:25,600;"Cause everyone's like, what's going to happen with this contract?"
01:51:25,600;01:51:27,040;"Cause he's going to jail."
01:51:27,040;01:51:28,040;"Exactly."
01:51:28,040;01:51:30,440;"I can't believe he did go to jail for that, right?"
01:51:30,440;01:51:31,440;"Yes."
01:51:31,440;01:51:32,440;"That's outrageous."
01:51:32,440;01:51:40,040;"He shot himself, but still, this is American."
01:51:40,040;01:51:43,880;"He discharged a firearm in a building, with lots of..."
01:51:43,880;01:51:45,980;"Yeah, but Adam's self."
01:51:45,980;01:51:46,880;"I mean true."
01:51:46,880;01:51:55,080;"I think Marvin Arison has shot people, I ain't going to jail."
01:51:55,080;01:51:57,340;"Really, I suppose I'm in good jail."
01:51:57,340;01:52:01,960;"You know, and then this guy shoots himself and they're like jail time."
01:52:01,960;01:52:05,400;"That's because New York I bet if he did that in Indiana like"
01:52:05,400;01:52:11,960;"Marvin Harrison did he wouldn't have got jail time. Oh for sure not but he's not just big enough for New York"
01:52:11,960;01:52:17,000;"They're building it off. I mean, Tyree kill brokers girlfriends orbital bone eating that Joe"
01:52:17,000;01:52:20,320;"Allegedly"
01:52:20,320;01:52:22,760;"Bring that right the fuck down good. You"
01:52:22,760;01:52:28,920;"So speaking of orbital bones, I guess fourth quarter I"
01:52:29,520;01:52:32,360;"I thought the the myth of the game"
01:52:32,360;01:52:40,460;"Was you bloods are going deep in his own territory to David Patton and Patton was half a step short?"
01:52:40,460;01:52:43,760;"touchdown yeah"
01:52:43,760;01:52:47,400;"Actually wasn't even short but Bledso actually under through him and"
01:52:47,400;01:52:54,320;"Whoever the defensive back was just barely got like a fingertip on it and made Patton bobble it and if Patton caught that"
01:52:54,320;01:52:59,340;"He's walking in for a touchdown in this game. It caught it. That's it. Yeah. You should have caught it"
01:52:59,340;01:53:04,180;"That's like, that's the classic Bledsoe upside though, right?"
01:53:04,180;01:53:05,880;"That was such a beautiful ball."
01:53:05,880;01:53:07,440;"Off his back foot."
01:53:07,440;01:53:07,540;"Yeah."
01:53:07,540;01:53:12,820;"Bloods are tucked in like 60 yards off his back foot because that's all he knows how to do."
01:53:12,820;01:53:13,860;"You just spun it."
01:53:13,860;01:53:14,660;"Yeah."
01:53:14,660;01:53:21,740;"It just locked it for every, every throw over his head on third and seven that he gets"
01:53:21,740;01:53:23,040;"attention to grounding for."
01:53:23,040;01:53:25,740;"He then uncorks a while like that."
01:53:25,740;01:53:28,540;"Yeah."
01:53:28,540;01:53:29,180;"Exactly."
01:53:29,180;01:53:35,060;"Yeah. But they, they convert a couple of third downs and eventually punt the ball just running off clock at this point."
01:53:35,060;01:53:42,580;"And now we get into the Cordell Stewart interception section of the podcast."
01:53:42,580;01:53:43,100;"Brigade."
01:53:43,100;01:53:58,460;"I had known a note right before this because I, again, like Andy, I'd watched a lot of the highlights and I had watched that Troy Brown, like, kick, return, all that a bunch and feel go block."
01:53:58,740;01:54:03,380;"I hadn't watched the whole game and my whole perception was like we kind of hung on at the end."
01:54:03,380;01:54:04,420;"Yeah."
01:54:04,420;01:54:06,100;"Which I don't know."
01:54:06,100;01:54:07,380;"But it's what made some plays."
01:54:07,380;01:54:10,300;"But we'll get to know."
01:54:10,300;01:54:15,780;"So remember like hating Cordell Stewart out of this and I have a note on here has Cordell put on the past more than 14 yards."
01:54:15,780;01:54:17,940;"And I'm like, I'm me to the accurate."
01:54:17,940;01:54:20,180;"Try is it dot dot dot throws a pic."
01:54:20,180;01:54:24,060;"And then he was another one and the both of the pics are just."
01:54:24,060;01:54:24,900;"So."
01:54:24,900;01:54:26,500;"Yeah, both of them."
01:54:26,500;01:54:28,340;"He just overthrew his wide receiver."
01:54:28,460;01:54:29,980;"Neither of the wide receivers were open."
01:54:29,980;01:54:33,940;"No, the first one, I feel like this guy was so open."
01:54:33,940;01:54:36,140;"Well, the first one he was actually right."
01:54:36,140;01:54:36,460;"Yeah."
01:54:36,460;01:54:39,220;"Hines Ward had like nobody within five yards of him."
01:54:39,220;01:54:41,620;"And he shook like five yards over his head."
01:54:41,620;01:54:43,180;"And he was like, and yards deep."
01:54:43,180;01:54:46,660;"And he threw it so far over the Hines Ward's head."
01:54:46,660;01:54:50,980;"That the safety hit that where I was to bucket you right in the chest."
01:54:50,980;01:54:51,940;"And he like bobbled it."
01:54:51,940;01:54:54,180;"Like why is this ball in my chest right now?"
01:54:54,180;01:54:55,500;"Yeah, it was a can of corn."
01:54:55,500;01:54:57,700;"Can of corn."
01:54:57,700;01:54:59,260;"Do you know that phrase comes from?"
01:54:59,260;01:55:00,940;"I do, whatever."
01:55:00,940;01:55:06,260;"There's some about not getting the corn off the off the top shelf."
01:55:06,260;01:55:12,980;"Yes, old grocers used used to use a stick to get things off the corn and they'd"
01:55:12,980;01:55:16,620;"knock it into their waistband pocket things."
01:55:16,620;01:55:17,140;"Yeah."
01:55:17,140;01:55:21,100;"And they just knock it off the shelf and catch it in their little hip pocket."
01:55:21,100;01:55:22,660;"And make it look so easy."
01:55:22,660;01:55:23,700;"Can of corn."
01:55:23,700;01:55:24,420;"Yeah."
01:55:24,420;01:55:27,060;"Remember that video game used to play?"
01:55:27,380;01:55:28,620;"And they were like, what was it?"
01:55:28,620;01:55:29,420;"It was a computer game."
01:55:29,420;01:55:29,940;"Yeah."
01:55:29,940;01:55:30,540;"Yeah."
01:55:30,540;01:55:34,820;"And every single day that every fucking time, like at least once a game."
01:55:34,820;01:55:36,820;"Cause we're so no, because we're so bad."
01:55:36,820;01:55:38,500;"And all we do is swing it every pitch."
01:55:38,500;01:55:41,580;"There's either a home run or a fly off up."
01:55:41,580;01:55:41,980;"Yeah."
01:55:41,980;01:55:42,380;"Yeah."
01:55:42,380;01:55:43,340;"And every pop of it."
01:55:43,340;01:55:44,900;"It's not a card."
01:55:44,900;01:55:47,060;"Hey, you know where that phrase came from?"
01:55:47,060;01:55:48,180;"Exactly."
01:55:48,180;01:55:49,700;"That's all I learned from the video game."
01:55:49,700;01:55:53,580;"And they'll be 2004 or some shit like that."
01:55:53,580;01:55:53,580;"Yeah."
01:55:53,580;01:55:53,780;"Yeah."
01:55:53,780;01:55:53,780;"Yeah."
01:55:53,780;01:55:54,260;"Yeah."
01:55:54,260;01:55:57,340;"I still I still dish out that fact all the time."
01:55:57,340;01:56:04,140;"Oh, me too. Yeah. So, yeah. So, Carl Stewart throws a new session to Bucky Jones overthrows"
01:56:04,140;01:56:09,540;"it. I can't. I corn. Yep. Pasco three and out. Because, you know, Drew Bless is at the"
01:56:09,540;01:56:15,220;"home and that's what happened right now. And Adam Minnitary misses his first field goal"
01:56:15,220;01:56:21,580;"since Connor decided to tell us that he didn't miss a field goal threst in season. Well,"
01:56:21,580;01:56:25,580;"Well, well, this was the one what do we have here?"
01:56:25,580;01:56:33,580;"To be fair, it was a 50 yard field goal at high field and a chance to make it a two score game with two and a half minutes left."
01:56:33,580;01:56:35,580;"What do I see championship game?"
01:56:35,580;01:56:37,580;"Right. So this would have been clutch."
01:56:37,580;01:56:38,580;"Yeah."
01:56:38,580;01:56:43,580;"Push it just left and he missed by like what a foot."
01:56:43,580;01:56:45,580;"If that had to know."
01:56:45,580;01:56:48,580;"It was very much horseshoe and hand."
01:56:48,580;01:56:55,140;"on the touchdown. We just like got five yards or so. Probably would have made that. Oh yeah."
01:56:55,140;01:57:00,420;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Cause blood though took a shot. The end zone and like threw it like"
01:57:00,420;01:57:04,660;"fucking way over everybody said. Yeah. Yeah. That's where I'm saying is these perceptions"
01:57:04,660;01:57:08,980;"on kickers are just built on circumstances. Right. So it's true. The Steelers come back"
01:57:08,980;01:57:14,520;"and get a touchdown here. People are talking about that miss kick. Yeah. They're like,"
01:57:14,520;01:57:21,120;"Yeah, he made a and that like invalidates the kick against the Steelers because they don't are the Raiders because they don't make the Super Bowl"
01:57:21,120;01:57:25,120;"True. Yeah, right and then and then this whole like lore of Adam"
01:57:25,120;01:57:30,280;"Vinitari being the best clock clutch kicker in the history of the game is like kind of throwing out the window"
01:57:30,280;01:57:35,360;"It's it's very true. So it's just like a little bit. It's just highly built on circumstances"
01:57:35,360;01:57:38,600;"So like that that's the argument. I was trying to make it's not that"
01:57:39,240;01:57:44,040;"military sucks. It's just like, yeah, he's like an average kicker, but great"
01:57:44,040;01:57:51,480;"in the circumstances he got and, you know, he made some big kicks. Yeah, and but give me one"
01:57:51,480;01:58:00,120;"field goal that Stephen Gauskowski has even had the opportunity to make to win a game."
01:58:00,120;01:58:02,040;"The Ramserbo."
01:58:02,040;01:58:07,240;"And that was the win the game. That was just go up a couple. Yeah, the Giants game, that's it. Like,"
01:58:07,240;01:58:12,240;"like he hasn't had one where he's like a tough. Yeah."
01:58:12,240;01:58:14,360;"I mean, he's got, he's had a few of it. Like a,"
01:58:14,360;01:58:17,920;"you're talking about like a tough kick in like a really important game."
01:58:17,920;01:58:21,560;"Yeah. To win it. Like you just hasn't had that opportunity. So I agree."
01:58:21,560;01:58:25,080;"So they miss field goal."
01:58:25,080;01:58:28,960;"The Steelers get the ball back in pretty good position."
01:58:28,960;01:58:32,000;"And I think it was maybe one or two plays later."
01:58:32,000;01:58:34,360;"Cordell Stewart does an overthrow again."
01:58:35,040;01:58:37,920;"Thanks to Otis Smith undercutting the route."
01:58:37,920;01:58:39,780;"And it's picked off by Laura Maloy."
01:58:39,780;01:58:43,180;"And this game is just about over."
01:58:43,180;01:58:46,360;"But it's officially over when Antoine Smith,"
01:58:46,360;01:58:49,540;"who has averaged maybe one,"
01:58:49,540;01:58:52,160;"less than two yards of carry so far."
01:58:52,160;01:58:54,800;"On second, like eight runs for 12 yards,"
01:58:54,800;01:58:57,480;"gets the first down game over."
01:58:57,480;01:58:59,080;"- Dude, do you know what hype everyone was"
01:58:59,080;01:59:00,600;"when he got that first down?"
01:59:00,600;01:59:02,000;"- Oh, God."
01:59:02,000;01:59:03,360;"- Like all the money everybody."
01:59:03,360;01:59:04,200;"- Our average is there."
01:59:04,200;01:59:05,520;"They were just like they knew it."
01:59:05,520;01:59:06,360;"It was awesome."
01:59:06,360;01:59:10,920;"The entire page of defense went and stood up on there on the bench and"
01:59:10,920;01:59:13,160;"started to wait in the white towels at the crowd."
01:59:13,160;01:59:17,240;"Yeah, I saw that, which was my favorite moment of this entire game."
01:59:17,240;01:59:18,600;"Yeah, that's amazing."
01:59:18,600;01:59:22,680;"Drew and that final huddle and the kneel down."
01:59:22,680;01:59:23,640;"Look like he was with a cry."
01:59:23,640;01:59:25,720;"He was like blinking like every second."
01:59:25,720;01:59:27,480;"Oh, it was so good."
01:59:27,480;01:59:28,160;"Yeah."
01:59:28,160;01:59:29,720;"That was awesome."
01:59:29,720;01:59:30,240;"Yeah."
01:59:30,240;01:59:32,320;"I mean, they were 10 point dogs in this game."
01:59:32,800;01:59:34,640;"They were and they and they want it."
01:59:34,640;01:59:35,680;"I'm surprised."
01:59:35,680;01:59:38,480;"No, I always do actually."
01:59:38,480;01:59:39,880;"Like the skills are a wagon."
01:59:39,880;01:59:40,600;"I'm playing at home."
01:59:40,600;01:59:44,200;"So my 10 points is a lot of points for playoff game."
01:59:44,200;01:59:48,520;"It's for an AFC championship game, especially in a low scoring league."
01:59:48,520;01:59:49,280;"Like this place."
01:59:49,280;01:59:50,440;"Yeah, it's true."
01:59:50,440;01:59:53,640;"So give me your best and worst for this game now."
01:59:53,640;01:59:55,880;"Oh, we got to quarter."
01:59:55,880;01:59:58,320;"That was no."
01:59:58,320;01:59:58,800;"No, it's not."
01:59:58,800;02:00:00,280;"Let's go."
02:00:00,280;02:00:03,080;"whole game baby. Whole game baby. See, Brian."
02:00:03,080;02:00:09,840;"All right, my best. I mean, there's is absolutely no argument you can make against the best"
02:00:09,840;02:00:12,400;"not being the blood so story."
02:00:12,400;02:00:13,400;"Fair."
02:00:13,400;02:00:19,360;"You know, just the way he handled himself all year and then to step in with like 30 seconds"
02:00:19,360;02:00:23,920;"of notice and win the AFC Championship game."
02:00:23,920;02:00:28,280;"But not only that, but the way he did it, the way he took that hit on the sideline and"
02:00:28,280;02:00:33,120;"bounce back up and now went through touchdown, which was basically the game"
02:00:33,120;02:00:33,880;"winning touchdown."
02:00:33,880;02:00:34,440;"Yeah."
02:00:34,440;02:00:36,120;"I had the replacement."
02:00:36,120;02:00:36,760;"You do this."
02:00:36,760;02:00:42,480;"I thought he was like terrible in second half, but like rewatching it."
02:00:42,480;02:00:43,840;"He had some clutch florals."
02:00:43,840;02:00:45,800;"He had like that awesome touch pass."
02:00:45,800;02:00:48,480;"Was it like in the fourth quarter round?"
02:00:48,480;02:00:50,040;"Yeah, that was pretty sick."
02:00:50,040;02:00:55,440;"Like huge third down to keep that kind of drive churning and eating up the clock."
02:00:55,440;02:00:58,880;"like he actually had some bigger plays than I remembered."
02:00:58,880;02:01:00,120;"Yeah."
02:01:00,120;02:01:04,920;"Yeah, I remember just like kind of hanging on in spite of blood."
02:01:04,920;02:01:06,640;"So, but that's definitely not the case."
02:01:06,640;02:01:08,440;"Yeah, it was because of blood."
02:01:08,440;02:01:13,720;"All right."
02:01:13,720;02:01:15,160;"So my worst is this wine."
02:01:15,160;02:01:20,640;"What do you expect from the calendar?"
02:01:20,640;02:01:22,320;"I was bullshitting at the beginning."
02:01:22,320;02:01:24,280;"I don't like red wine to begin with."
02:01:24,280;02:01:26,280;"So how much how much did it cost?"
02:01:26,280;02:01:30,960;"You know, I was I was think I didn't even look at the price. No big"
02:01:30,960;02:01:38,520;"I want to say it was like more expensive than I thought I think it was like 35 bucks or something. Whoo"
02:01:38,520;02:01:40,480;"Yeah, I"
02:01:40,480;02:01:45,360;"Probably should have checked the price, but I was like oh big NFL logo that things gonna be like $12"
02:01:45,360;02:01:49,560;"Like this thing looks gaudy as shit"
02:01:50,560;02:01:54,900;"You know it likes to panthers so that that's gonna lead into my best which is"
02:01:54,900;02:01:57,360;"Jubludso knows how"
02:01:57,360;02:02:05,560;"To make a bottle of wine. He knows how to crush grapes. Let's say that this man has created a fantastic bottle of wine"
02:02:05,560;02:02:09,240;"and"
02:02:09,240;02:02:15,760;"You want it you want to know something funny is like I didn't I didn't realize until very recently that"
02:02:15,760;02:02:19,520;"Raisins were just like dehydrated grapes"
02:02:20,160;02:02:24,620;"What yeah, oh man dude pickles"
02:02:24,620;02:02:31,360;"Yes"
02:02:31,360;02:02:35,440;"Yo, the thing is I love I love pickles. I don't like cucumbers"
02:02:35,440;02:02:42,720;"I've always thought that though like why are pickles called pickles and like is pickled onions pickled radishes pick"
02:02:42,720;02:02:47,760;"When I call a number"
02:02:48,640;02:02:52,720;"I'm not call a raisin dehydrated grape"
02:02:52,720;02:02:58,320;"Well, it's like 100 you know, I mean it's fine. I get that"
02:02:58,320;02:03:02,880;"Hydrated cranberries"
02:03:02,880;02:03:05,120;"For what I call cranberries"
02:03:05,120;02:03:07,120;"They call crazies"
02:03:07,120;02:03:09,120;"for that"
02:03:09,120;02:03:13,920;"I'm just saying you know, I I feel like"
02:03:13,920;02:03:17,120;"It's not my fault. It's society's fault"
02:03:18,000;02:03:22,200;"Not just for this but for everything I'm out of music every all my flaws"
02:03:22,200;02:03:27,240;"You know my worst is Greg Brown's flaws and also the referees in this game. Yeah"
02:03:27,240;02:03:32,920;"I don't I don't beat my wife because I'm an asshole. It's because society raids me this way"
02:03:32,920;02:03:44,780;"Just kidding cut that I'm out now Steve Brown with you best of all"
02:03:44,780;02:03:50,160;"the worst is that last comment"
02:03:50,160;02:03:53,000;"fair"
02:03:53,000;02:03:56,160;"uh... best was definitely"
02:03:56,160;02:04:00,600;"peak troy brown well that that i'd regret that i'd do that so redemption story and"
02:04:00,600;02:04:01,440;"all that"
02:04:01,440;02:04:02,840;"and i had to try out"
02:04:02,840;02:04:04,000;"up there though"
02:04:04,000;02:04:05,160;"this is peak"
02:04:05,160;02:04:09,720;"troy brown i mean there's another place you can pull out right of like"
02:04:09,720;02:04:13,440;"for brown business always my favorite patriot but that this game that's"
02:04:13,440;02:04:16,480;"Yeah, yeah, we want to run through his contributions real quick"
02:04:16,480;02:04:19,520;"Yeah, what was a step on?"
02:04:19,520;02:04:22,580;"Okay, so he had eight catches for 120 yards"
02:04:22,580;02:04:27,920;"He had the scoop and toss"
02:04:27,920;02:04:32,200;"Yeah for the touchdown. Yep, and he had"
02:04:32,200;02:04:40,120;"Three returns 80 yards and a touchdown. Yeah for 26 and a half yards average"
02:04:40,120;02:04:42,480;"so"
02:04:42,480;02:04:48,520;"I touched that I touched down 200 yards and I touched down pass"
02:04:48,520;02:04:51,280;"essentially"
02:04:51,280;02:04:55,720;"Lateral is that that's that's a fucking Troy Brown staff line"
02:04:55,720;02:05:02,040;"Yeah, that is the prototypical Troy Ralph's outline and he didn't make the initial bro ball"
02:05:02,040;02:05:06,720;"Yeah, and like they're talking about for it setting the Steelers"
02:05:06,720;02:05:11,760;"Single season record with like 90 something catches and I was like wait. Yeah, didn't over 100"
02:05:11,760;02:05:13,760;"Yeah, he had more than that."
02:05:13,760;02:05:15,300;"Yeah."
02:05:15,300;02:05:19,360;"So see, how is your worst then?"
02:05:19,360;02:05:22,640;"Troy Edwards got to be right."
02:05:22,640;02:05:24,260;"No, I think watching"
02:05:24,260;02:05:27,000;"try to play quarterback, man."
02:05:27,000;02:05:30,160;"Yeah, it's like a ball of peace to juggle."
02:05:30,160;02:05:30,920;"Yeah."
02:05:30,920;02:05:35,160;"Is he, um, what's the bills guy right now?"
02:05:35,160;02:05:37,120;"Tyrod Taylor."
02:05:37,120;02:05:41,480;"No, I'm not used for the Saints now, but, uh, uh,"
02:05:41,480;02:05:43,480;"Chargers now, but Alan Josh out"
02:05:43,480;02:05:51,400;"You know, we're like you're just waiting for that other shoe to drop with them or even certain Sam Donald, you know like you're just waiting for them or"
02:05:51,400;02:05:58,600;"Sanchez you can go through the list of quarterbacks for you. Just like yeah, he's gonna fuck up pretty I think Cornell will get better than them"
02:05:58,600;02:06:00,920;"No"
02:06:00,920;02:06:04,800;"Yeah"
02:06:04,800;02:06:07,240;"he was"
02:06:07,520;02:06:11,680;"He was dangerous in other ways like his passing wasn't his"
02:06:11,680;02:06:17,840;"Danger I guess that's and like he couldn't I mean he could run the ball"
02:06:17,840;02:06:22,600;"We didn't against us so Bell check took away what he did well made him beat him with his arm and then just watching Cordell"
02:06:22,600;02:06:24,920;"Try to beat us with his arm"
02:06:24,920;02:06:27,320;"Yeah"
02:06:27,320;02:06:31,840;"There was brutal watch I'll give you that he was and that's why he threw two picks in the last"
02:06:31,840;02:06:36,880;"Minute because like the only thing they had is Cordell trying to throw it down the field"
02:06:36,880;02:06:42,120;"Yeah, I mean ran for 41 yards and as long as with 34"
02:06:42,120;02:06:45,280;"Yeah, two fumbles one which you lost"
02:06:45,280;02:06:49,000;"24 for 42 for 255"
02:06:49,000;02:06:53,680;"Passing with three interceptions three sacks and"
02:06:53,680;02:07:03,200;"Long as the 24 yards is ready was 45 point two. Yeah as long as it's 24 yards and that's probably a screen pass"
02:07:04,600;02:07:09,640;"Actually pretty sure it was the zero way. Yeah, it was it was too. I'm trail bet is"
02:07:09,640;02:07:12,400;"famous famous"
02:07:12,400;02:07:18,400;"So like the dude came out dropped the ball down the field. So when it came to that he had to boom"
02:07:18,400;02:07:21,280;"pick pick"
02:07:21,280;02:07:24,800;"Yeah, it wasn't great"
02:07:24,800;02:07:29,800;"Although that's actually probably a best just because he sucks maybe the other worst"
02:07:31,000;02:07:35,440;"a specific ref call where they had a huge block in the back and"
02:07:35,440;02:07:38,360;"They called it back because the"
02:07:38,360;02:07:42,260;"Bullshit"
02:07:42,260;02:07:48,200;"Heartbeat before the block in the backs. I guess that doesn't count but it didn't though. I"
02:07:48,200;02:07:50,840;"Don't think it did. I think if you"
02:07:50,840;02:07:57,320;"And fucking plexigal burst high steps away from that whole situation like a fucking goon"
02:07:57,320;02:08:00,680;"Yeah"
02:08:00,680;02:08:10,680;"Fucking dirty. That refs dirty. I don't mean idiot. The only thing could have been if I try ads come up and chest bump them or something."
02:08:10,680;02:08:14,680;"I love it."
02:08:14,680;02:08:26,680;"All right. Well, I think we've done this game justice. And next week we have what I'm doing. We're doing spirits."
02:08:26,680;02:08:28,680;"- That's a huge difference. (laughs)"
02:08:28,680;02:08:31,760;"- Jesus Christ. - Imagine."

02:08:33,440;02:08:36,420;"I'm hoping we have a special guest."
02:08:36,420;02:08:40,000;"So we will see you for that one."
02:08:40,000;02:08:43,060;"The Patriots have made the Super Bowl"
02:08:43,060;02:08:44,920;"for their third time ever."
02:08:44,920;02:08:48,000;"Going for their first ever Super Bowl win"
02:08:48,000;02:08:49,800;"against the greatest show on turf."
02:08:49,800;02:08:52,040;"So we will see you next week for that."
02:08:52,040;02:08:55,620;"Gentlemen, have a good evening."

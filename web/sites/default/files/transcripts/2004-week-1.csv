00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,800;"I am not your mother."
00:18,800;00:28,120;"Welcome back to the Page of St"
00:28,120;00:32,120;"We've done 01, 02, and 03 all the way through."
00:32,120;00:35,220;"And we are now doing 2004."
00:35,220;00:38,720;"And to celebrate, we decided to bring,"
00:38,720;00:41,080;"well, I decided to bring both the brothers back."
00:41,080;00:43,440;"Steve Brown, middle brother, how's it going?"
00:43,440;00:46,280;"- Andy, I appreciate you paying me to do this,"
00:46,280;00:50,720;"2014, that money hit my bank account, so let's go."
00:50,720;00:53,400;"- Yeah, I'm glad you didn't cost more."
00:53,400;00:56,240;"'Cause I don't think I can afford it."
00:56,240;01:00,200;"And also Greg Brown, baby, but I was like, oh, Greg, I didn't get a paycheck."
01:00,200;01:02,200;"You know, it was all this."
01:02,200;01:02,840;"Yeah."
01:02,840;01:05,880;"You pay some hugs and love Greg."
01:05,880;01:08,000;"I pay Stephen dog treats for his new dogs."
01:08,000;01:08,520;"Don't worry about it."
01:08,520;01:09,040;"There you go."
01:09,040;01:14,560;"Um, but to really celebrate, we thought, um, we would actually get somebody"
01:14,560;01:16,840;"who knows what they're talking about on the podcast."
01:16,840;01:24,040;"And so this episode we have on, uh, I don't know if infamous is the right word."
01:24,400;01:26,800;"Give me a good descriptor voice."
01:26,800;01:28,320;"Ah, the boy's gonna use this."
01:28,320;01:29,320;"All right, cool."
01:29,320;01:33,320;"The more famous than us,"
01:33,320;01:34,160;"Patience Writer."
01:34,160;01:34,980;"- This is the worst descriptor of all."
01:34,980;01:36,960;"Everybody's never famous than us."
01:36,960;01:38,480;"Only mom listens to this."
01:38,480;01:42,080;"- Patience writer, Jeff Howe from The Athletic."
01:42,080;01:44,240;"So Jeff, thanks for coming on."
01:44,240;01:45,600;"- Yeah, not famous at all though."
01:45,600;01:48,080;"So thanks for having me in the very nice words."
01:48,080;01:49,240;"(laughs)"
01:49,240;01:52,040;"- Yeah, no, actually I tried to do my research"
01:52,040;01:56,120;"and introduce you with all the stuff that you've done"
01:56,120;01:57,080;"and all the stuff that you're doing."
01:57,080;01:59,840;"But for somebody who writes articles online,"
01:59,840;02:02,280;"there's not much out there about you."
02:02,280;02:03,360;"- Just how I like it."
02:03,360;02:04,200;"- Yeah."
02:04,200;02:09,200;"So I asked a whole bunch of people"
02:09,200;02:11,320;"if they would give us some questions."
02:11,320;02:15,800;"So the first question I told them that I would ask,"
02:15,800;02:18,460;"and this only really works on paper,"
02:18,460;02:19,280;"but we're gonna do it anyway,"
02:19,280;02:21,040;"'cause that's kind of podcast we are."
02:21,040;02:24,040;"And it is Jeff, how's it going?"
02:24,040;02:26,840;"- I've never heard that one before."
02:26,840;02:28,360;"That's good."
02:28,360;02:29,200;"It's going great."
02:29,200;02:30,640;"It's fantastic."
02:30,640;02:32,320;"- Oh, I didn't say it was a good question."
02:32,320;02:33,680;"I just said these are the questions we got."
02:33,680;02:35,960;"So when he says he asked people,"
02:35,960;02:37,080;"he just thought of him in his head."
02:37,080;02:39,000;"Like the other voices that I didn't know."
02:39,000;02:40,800;"- Oh, no, I would say credit for that"
02:40,800;02:42,400;"if I came up with it."
02:42,400;02:43,440;"I ain't that quick."
02:43,440;02:46,360;"- Nice Andy."
02:46,360;02:50,920;"- Well, yeah, so tell us a bit about yourself then."
02:50,920;02:54,460;"because I know you've been covering the patients since 2009,"
02:54,460;02:58,060;"but how did you kind of get into that?"
02:58,060;03:01,180;"- Well, I failed out of business school"
03:01,180;03:04,700;"and my father told me I had to make something to myself."
03:04,700;03:07,460;"So I somehow figured it out from there."
03:07,460;03:09,660;"I mean, I grew up in Lowell."
03:09,660;03:12,700;"I did fail out of business school at UNH."
03:12,700;03:17,180;"That took us three semesters for us to realize"
03:17,180;03:19,500;"that we should mutually agree to part ways."
03:20,500;03:22,420;"I went back to Middlesex Community College,"
03:22,420;03:25,860;"got into some journalism classes."
03:25,860;03:28,260;"I mean, I had like a little bit of a media background"
03:28,260;03:30,220;"just from low high, and it was something"
03:30,220;03:31,380;"that I kind of wanted to get into."
03:31,380;03:35,500;"So to make a very long story as short as possible,"
03:35,500;03:36,820;"then I went to UMass."
03:36,820;03:39,860;"I did the student paper there, the Daily Collegian,"
03:39,860;03:43,140;"and graduated from UMass in '06."
03:43,140;03:47,020;"Works a bunch of different jobs in and around Boston"
03:47,020;03:49,700;"for about three years."
03:49,700;03:54,700;"And I reached out to Nesson in 2009."
03:54,700;03:56,140;"I was working at the Boston Metro,"
03:56,140;03:57,460;"which no longer exists."
03:57,460;03:59,300;"It was for people who don't know,"
03:59,300;04:01,980;"that was the free paper that was passed out on the trains."
04:01,980;04:02,820;"- Oh yeah."
04:02,820;04:06,340;"- And I was so desperate to get out of there."
04:06,340;04:09,260;"I was just bypassed for a job that I deserved,"
04:09,260;04:12,100;"but I'm glad I didn't get."
04:12,100;04:15,380;"And so I reached out to Nesson and I was like,"
04:15,380;04:19,700;"Hey, this was like when WEI and Comcast"
04:19,700;04:22,780;"and we're just sort of like doing up their websites."
04:22,780;04:25,500;"Nessin.com's website was basically like,"
04:25,500;04:28,420;"hey, the Red Sox are playing tonight at 7.05"
04:28,420;04:30,340;"on our station, like tune in."
04:30,340;04:32,220;"Like that was the extent of it."
04:32,220;04:34,500;"I was like, do you need somebody to cover the Celtics"
04:34,500;04:35,460;"or the Red Sox?"
04:35,460;04:38,260;"Like I've handled those things a couple of times."
04:38,260;04:40,940;"I kind of know my way around both buildings"
04:40,940;04:44,580;"and I've been to Gillette like a handful of times"
04:44,580;04:47,940;"on like Wednesdays and covered a couple of Tom Brady press conferences."
04:47,940;04:51,420;"And the guy running the site was like, yeah, you know what?"
04:51,420;04:54,700;"Why don't you do a Patriot story a week and we'll give you 25 bucks."
04:54,700;04:56,740;"And I was like, sure, whatever."
04:56,740;05:02,500;"I remember the first story I wrote was after they traded Matt Castle and Mike"
05:02,500;05:04,340;"Vrable to the Chiefs for a second."
05:04,340;05:10,620;"And I wrote a $25 column and I'm telling you, it probably wasn't even worth that."
05:11,460;05:20,780;"So it was a, I joke that Bill Belichick got his start in the NFL in 1975 making $25 a"
05:20,780;05:21,780;"week."
05:21,780;05:26,220;"I got my start in the NFL in 2009 making $25 a week."
05:26,220;05:30,140;"So just two birds of a feather there."
05:30,140;05:32,420;"But you know, worked in Nessin, it was great."
05:32,420;05:34,820;"I learned a lot in Nessin."
05:34,820;05:39,100;"They started putting me on TV for who knows what reason."
05:39,100;05:43,940;"to the Herald in 2012 when Ian Rappaport got hired by NFL Network."
05:43,940;05:46,100;"I was at the Herald for six awesome years."
05:46,100;05:47,100;"I mean, loved it."
05:47,100;05:48,500;"Absolutely loved my time at the Herald."
05:48,500;05:50,580;"Had no intentions in leaving."
05:50,580;05:55,420;"But the reaper started to come for everyone there."
05:55,420;06:00,100;"And at the same time, the athletic was toying with the idea of coming to Boston."
06:00,100;06:05,900;"So I got very fortunate because this is the best job I've ever had."
06:05,900;06:08,200;"other than like scooping ice cream in high school,"
06:08,200;06:09,500;"which is awesome."
06:09,500;06:13,180;"This, working for the athletic has been just amazing."
06:13,180;06:17,420;"They just, they prioritize like the things that,"
06:17,420;06:19,260;"that are great about journalism and, you know,"
06:19,260;06:22,260;"taking your time to write a good story rather than"
06:22,260;06:25,620;"rushing out something and then blogging three more things"
06:25,620;06:29,180;"and then getting to, you know, start working on a notebook"
06:29,180;06:30,020;"for something else."
06:30,020;06:32,260;"I mean, it's just like, hey, take all the time you need"
06:32,260;06:34,260;"to write something that you think is the best version"
06:34,260;06:40,820;"story that you can put out there. And it's just been great. So that's my long-winded story."
06:40,820;06:46,900;"Yeah, I mean, I think that's how I got hooked on the athletic was. I was missing all that long form"
06:46,900;06:54,500;"like deep dive writing about sports. You don't really get it many other places because it's"
06:54,500;07:00,180;"now it just seems to be who's getting there first as opposed to like who's actually getting it right"
07:00,180;07:08,300;"getting the details. Yeah and and that's that's fine. I mean I I enjoy doing that"
07:08,300;07:12,420;"and when I was at the Herald and again I loved my time at the Herald. You won't"
07:12,420;07:16,420;"hear me say a bad word about that place. Working with Karen was amazing it was"
07:16,420;07:21,700;"just every it was just such a good group people and I loved it. I can't stress"
07:21,700;07:24,980;"that enough but you know working on a main story every day a notebook every"
07:24,980;07:27,660;"single day and then blogging everything that's happening. I mean there's just"
07:27,660;07:34,300;"there's so much going on compared to now when basically, you know, right now I'm going through"
07:34,300;07:40,300;"feature stories of the rookie draft class. And there are other things going on with the team."
07:40,300;07:44,860;"There's a transaction or two every day. And for the most part, they haven't been major"
07:44,860;07:49,500;"transactions. So my bosses aren't sitting here saying, Hey, write 300 words on this or put up"
07:49,500;07:54,220;"something on that or whatever. I mean, yeah, there's, you know, every now and then there's player"
07:54,220;07:57,820;"availability through a virtual press conference."
07:57,820;08:00,720;"But my boss is like, look, you got features to write."
08:00,720;08:01,980;"Just worry about those."
08:01,980;08:03,380;"Do the best job you can with those."
08:03,380;08:06,360;"And that's why I take a lot of pride"
08:06,360;08:10,500;"in writing these features and telling these players stories"
08:10,500;08:12,020;"the best way I possibly can."
08:12,020;08:13,700;"Because they're getting introduced to a new fan base"
08:13,700;08:14,540;"and a new readership."
08:14,540;08:17,380;"And I want the people who are reading these stories"
08:17,380;08:20,820;"to realize to know that when they come away from that,"
08:20,820;08:22,700;"they're going to know just about everything possible"
08:22,700;08:24,140;"about this player."
08:24,140;08:26,220;"- Probably we took pride in this podcast."
08:26,220;08:28,220;"- I do a lot of work on this."
08:28,220;08:29,300;"- This is long for."
08:29,300;08:32,100;"- Maybe if me and Greg took pride in this."
08:32,100;08:33,980;"- I was like, ""You don't do shit, but I put out"
08:33,980;08:34,820;"""of this."""
08:34,820;08:40,900;"So do you, it sounds like you actually have a lot of,"
08:40,900;08:44,300;"unlike us, a lot of actors to these players over the years."
08:44,300;08:50,140;"I guess two part question, one, how?"
08:50,140;08:52,340;"And is there a way for us to do that?"
08:52,340;08:56,180;"And more seriously, do you have any like good,"
08:56,180;08:58,120;"like favorite players, favorite stories,"
08:58,120;08:58,960;"that's the other stuff?"
08:58,960;09:00,220;"- This is a three-part question Andy."
09:00,220;09:01,860;"- Oh, three-part question."
09:01,860;09:02,700;"- What's the third?"
09:02,700;09:05,380;"- Part three, do you know Troy Brown?"
09:05,380;09:09,700;"And he's as awesome as we all know and love, right?"
09:09,700;09:11,900;"- I was told to bring a Troy Brown story."
09:11,900;09:13,020;"- Yeah, okay."
09:13,020;09:13,860;"- Because of Steve--"
09:13,860;09:16,320;"- Look at that first, Troy Brown story."
09:18,260;09:25,620;"I was doing a story on Julian Edelman a few years ago during the post season,"
09:25,620;09:28,580;"probably like a playoff preview type of story."
09:28,580;09:32,060;"I was talking to Troy Brown,"
09:32,060;09:36,580;"and Troy was telling me it's 2009 training camp,"
09:36,580;09:38,740;"so they had just drafted Edelman in the seventh round."
09:38,740;09:40,060;"At that point, everybody,"
09:40,060;09:41,340;"it's not the cliche,"
09:41,340;09:45,540;"this guy was a college quarterback and now he's like a punt returner/slot receiver,"
09:45,540;09:51,300;"everybody thought he was going to be the next coming of West Welker, best case scenario."
09:51,300;09:52,900;"So Troy Brown is sitting there."
09:52,900;09:58,860;"He just retired and he's a practice and he's not even close to getting into the coaching"
09:58,860;09:59,860;"capacity yet."
09:59,860;10:04,340;"So we watches it and Edelman's running around with his hair on fire."
10:04,340;10:07,820;"He usually does and Edelman was way, way, way more raw."
10:07,820;10:09,820;"I mean, he was a legitimate project."
10:09,820;10:15,140;"A guy who needed to go through a lot of bumps and bruises and really fine tune his game"
10:15,140;10:19,700;"for a number of years before he became the outstanding player that he was for his career."
10:19,700;10:25,380;"Troy Brown goes down to the field and seeks out Belichick or she seeks out. That was probably,"
10:25,380;10:29,620;"you know, that's an extreme way to put it. When Troy Brown walks out of the field,"
10:29,620;10:33,380;"he doesn't need to like go looking for Bill Belichick to naturally come together."
10:33,380;10:38,340;"But Troy says to Bill, hey, it looks like you found the next Welker. And Belichick goes,"
10:38,340;10:39,940;"No, I found the next you."
10:39,940;10:40,940;"Oh, yeah."
10:40,940;10:46,540;"And it was, it's amazing because I want to say that it was like 2015 when Troy Brown,"
10:46,540;10:51,220;"so maybe 2016 because it was probably like, I'm thinking it was a playoff story."
10:51,220;10:56,780;"It was probably after he like really made a name for himself and the Super Bowl run against"
10:56,780;10:57,780;"the Seahawks and all that."
10:57,780;11:02,540;"It was probably like a returning to the playoffs type of deal."
11:02,540;11:08,100;"And he's, he was so much more of a Troy Brown type of player than he ever was a West"
11:08,100;11:13,060;"Walker type of player, not that's a bad thing or whatever, but just and Belichick knew it right"
11:13,060;11:17,940;"away before Julian Edelman was anywhere close to becoming the Julian Edelman that we've all gotten"
11:17,940;11:24,180;"in. To get to the first couple parts of the question, I don't know how you guys can get access. I mean,"
11:24,180;11:30,820;"you can freak out to the pain. You don't hear about the other players. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don't"
11:30,820;11:35,940;"know. There was there was the story of that guy who kind of held the sign out on Route 1 saying,"
11:35,940;11:39,900;"and every single day seeing if he can get some access"
11:39,900;11:42,220;"to the team, and I don't think that worked out."
11:42,220;11:44,940;"So maybe you're gonna need to do that."
11:44,940;11:46,940;"Maybe you don't wanna do that one either."
11:46,940;11:51,740;"Yeah, the access, I mean, it's over the course of the years."
11:51,740;11:53,980;"I mean, I've been in the locker room since 2009,"
11:53,980;11:58,980;"and during the season, it's three to five times a week,"
11:58,980;12:04,260;"45 minutes every day, made a lot of relationships."
12:04,260;12:08,420;"The thing I really enjoy about covering this team is"
12:08,420;12:10,220;"the quality of human beings"
12:10,220;12:11,740;"that Belichick brings into the locker room."
12:11,740;12:14,100;"I mean, these guys more often than not,"
12:14,100;12:17,300;"I mean, there's a lot of really good people who,"
12:17,300;12:20,700;"for, I'm not sitting here saying like,"
12:20,700;12:22,780;"you know, they know everything about me,"
12:22,780;12:24,060;"I know everything about them,"
12:24,060;12:25,580;"but they will take the time to talk to you"
12:25,580;12:26,940;"and they're not gonna blow you off"
12:26,940;12:28,620;"and I've got friends who cover all their teams"
12:28,620;12:29,700;"and they'll be like, yeah, you know,"
12:29,700;12:32,140;"there are 20 good guys in the locker room"
12:32,140;12:33,300;"and the rest of them, you know,"
12:33,300;12:35,180;"They get angry every time they see me."
12:35,180;12:38,540;"Whereas in Atullet, you know,"
12:38,540;12:43,220;"with very, very few exceptions over the last 12 plus years,"
12:43,220;12:46,500;"I mean, it's like 52, 53 guys on that roster"
12:46,500;12:49,240;"who were just really good people to talk to."
12:49,240;12:53,420;"I've had a good run with the linebackers."
12:53,420;12:55,020;"I mean, I've always had a good rapport"
12:55,020;12:57,020;"with guys like High Tower, you know,"
12:57,020;13:01,140;"even Brandon Spikes and Gerard Mayo and, you know, guys who,"
13:01,140;13:09,140;"I mean, there's just, Gronk was always great to deal with Edelman."
13:09,140;13:14,700;"I mean Brady to an extent, even though he's just in a different caliber as to how available"
13:14,700;13:15,700;"he always is."
13:15,700;13:16,700;"He was always very cordial."
13:16,700;13:20,980;"I mean, just a lot of good interactions with him."
13:20,980;13:22,480;"What about the staff?"
13:22,480;13:23,480;"What's that?"
13:23,480;13:24,540;"What about the staff and coaches?"
13:24,540;13:26,060;"A little bit different."
13:26,060;13:28,900;"I mean, they're much more reserved."
13:28,900;13:33,020;"The thing with the players is it's in their contracts"
13:33,020;13:35,140;"that they have to be in the locker room"
13:35,140;13:37,140;"every day during media acts."
13:37,140;13:39,620;"And sometimes, it's for 10 seconds."
13:39,620;13:43,420;"Sometimes those guys will hang around for a half hour"
13:43,420;13:44,420;"or whatever."
13:44,420;13:46,620;"- The coaches don't have that same."
13:46,620;13:47,860;"- No, the coaches don't have that."
13:47,860;13:50,220;"Basically the coaches have to be available,"
13:50,220;13:53,220;"like Belichick has to be available every day,"
13:53,220;13:55,500;"not every day, but like most days of the week."
13:55,500;13:59,780;"The coordinators have to be available once a week."
13:59,780;14:02,020;"The assistant coaches wants them up."
14:02,020;14:06,140;"And it's because it's so rare to get that access."
14:06,140;14:09,820;"You're very rarely talking to these guys one on one."
14:09,820;14:12,060;"There have been some good ones who have come by"
14:12,060;14:13,700;"and have taken the time and stuff like that."
14:13,700;14:16,420;"And I don't really want to get into names,"
14:16,420;14:19,620;"but I've gotten to know some of them on a personal level."
14:19,620;14:22,420;"But it's harder because you just don't have that face-to-face"
14:22,420;14:24,420;"time with them as often."
14:24,420;14:27,820;"So like Bella Check has that media reputation"
14:27,820;14:30,940;"of being like ornery and just dry,"
14:30,940;14:32,340;"but everyone here is the other side of it"
14:32,340;14:35,820;"where he's super funny and witty."
14:35,820;14:38,220;"I don't know, where do you fall in that?"
14:38,220;14:40,580;"- We still don't get the witty funny side of it"
14:40,580;14:41,420;"all that often."
14:41,420;14:42,420;"I mean, it's still different."
14:42,420;14:44,540;"I mean, he's, but I get it."
14:44,540;14:48,260;"What he is, what his approach to the media"
14:48,260;14:50,740;"is everything he says to us,"
14:50,740;14:53,460;"he expects is gonna filter into the locker room"
14:53,460;14:55,060;"in some capacity."
14:55,060;14:58,860;"So when he's relaying these dry messages,"
14:58,860;15:02,060;"I mean, it's not too far from the things"
15:02,060;15:03,820;"that he's saying to the team."
15:03,820;15:08,020;"And like for example, the unpopular trades"
15:08,020;15:09,420;"that he's made in the middle of the season,"
15:09,420;15:13,060;"I mean, the Jamie Collins trade in 2016,"
15:13,060;15:18,540;"you know, that was not a popular move in that locker room."
15:18,540;15:21,100;"I mean, really, really not a popular move."
15:21,100;15:22,260;"- Shades of Lord Maloy."
15:22,260;15:24,860;"even that and Mike Raible trade."
15:24,860;15:30,780;"- So he got to the photo or the front of the meeting room,"
15:30,780;15:33,940;"the morning of that trade or whenever it happened to go down"
15:33,940;15:35,940;"and he got in front of the locker room and he said,"
15:35,940;15:38,780;"""We made a transaction, it was my decision,"
15:38,780;15:41,420;"""it's final and it's time to move on."""
15:41,420;15:43,700;"And then an hour later, whatever it is,"
15:43,700;15:45,140;"he steps in front of the podium"
15:45,140;15:47,260;"and he has his news conference with us."
15:47,260;15:49,060;"And everyone's asking questions"
15:49,060;15:51,500;"and he's basically saying the same thing."
15:51,500;15:55,220;"because he's not going to tell us anything that he's not going to tell the team."
15:55,220;15:59,420;"And there's obviously he's, he's going to tell the team how they're going to game"
15:59,420;16:02,140;"plan for the bills. He's going to tell us, let's,"
16:02,140;16:05,020;"he's got an O and 16 team coming to town."
16:05,020;16:07,220;"He's going to tell the team they're the greatest team ever."
16:07,220;16:09,020;"He's going to tell us they're the greatest team ever."
16:09,020;16:14,620;"You know, it's not the same rule, the same standard for every single story."
16:14,620;16:18,980;"But I think I wanted to get across like the point with like the Collins thing"
16:18,980;16:22,020;"to sort of give you a glimpse into how and why"
16:22,020;16:23,980;"he handles certain situations."
16:23,980;16:27,100;"- Yeah, were you there in person for the,"
16:27,100;16:28,980;"we're on to Cincinnati?"
16:28,980;16:31,260;"- Oh yeah, absolutely, yep."
16:31,260;16:33,700;"- How was that received by like the press?"
16:33,700;16:34,620;"'Cause like you said that stuff."
16:34,620;16:35,700;"- People in the room, yeah."
16:35,700;16:40,580;"- Yeah, I mean, it's, again, this,"
16:40,580;16:44,340;"it's so different because I'm just used to it."
16:44,340;16:47,620;"Like I've been doing this for years at this over a decade."
16:47,620;16:50,420;"And at that point, that was 2014."
16:50,420;16:52,780;"So I'd been doing that for five years."
16:52,780;16:55,020;"I guess that was my sixth season."
16:55,020;16:59,300;"So he just, he didn't want to deal with,"
16:59,300;17:01,780;"this was just after drafting Garoppolo,"
17:01,780;17:03,020;"Brady didn't play well."
17:03,020;17:05,620;"Garoppolo came in, the team showed some life."
17:05,620;17:06,900;"I think he threw a touchdown past"
17:06,900;17:09,100;"a Gronk at the end of the Dakians, a City game,"
17:09,100;17:10,240;"or whatever it was."
17:10,240;17:16,500;"And he wasn't gonna hear the quarterback controversy"
17:16,500;17:20,060;"types of questions. And that was how he wanted to handle it. So"
17:20,060;17:23,580;"clearly, what do you do in that situation as as somebody who"
17:23,580;17:26,620;"has to ask him questions to find something right about?"
17:26,620;17:30,340;"Yeah, I mean, it's situation in a situation. I mean, there are"
17:30,340;17:32,900;"sometimes when you're you got to put yourself out there, you"
17:32,900;17:35,060;"could ask a certain question. There are other times when"
17:35,060;17:39,300;"you know, somebody else is going to do it, you know, sometimes."
17:39,300;17:44,660;"So do you know before you ask the question, whether or not he's"
17:44,660;17:45,580;"going to bite your head off?"
17:45,580;17:55,580;"I mean part of that, but it's like do I want to ask like some if you have a well thought"
17:55,580;18:02,340;"out question and this isn't like an off the cuff thing."
18:02,340;18:07,340;"It like if you bring a question to the table that you've thought about and you've you know"
18:07,340;18:11,380;"whatever he's going to give you more often than not a well thought out answer."
18:11,380;18:18,660;"Now if you're if you want to get into the hot take stuff if you want to ask I mean if you want to just outright piss him off"
18:18,660;18:20,880;"like he's he's not gonna take to that and"
18:20,880;18:28,400;"You know different coaches handle things differently and there are certain certainly there are times when you wish that he was more"
18:28,400;18:30,740;"Fourth right or fourth coming with his answers"
18:30,740;18:33,300;"but at the other side of it, it's like if"
18:33,300;18:36,700;"Somebody's asked the same question three different times"
18:38,140;18:39,340;"What are you gonna do?"
18:39,340;18:43,740;"Like, you want to sit there and ask it a fourth time knowing that he's not gonna like it,"
18:43,740;18:47,380;"he's not gonna give you a better answer, and then you're just starting to waste everybody's time."
18:47,380;18:52,620;"And then the other thing is like, if you just keep pissing him off with quite like,"
18:52,620;18:56,700;"if you guys ask me the same question five times in a row here, I'd be like,"
18:56,700;19:00,940;"""All right guys, you know, we've had a good night. I'm gonna go take care of."""
19:00,940;19:05,500;"Like, there are just, there's gotta be some tact to it from both sides."
19:05,500;19:09,740;"So you got to be professionally respectful of each other's times."
19:09,740;19:17,260;"The situations are hilarious when like a third person asking the same question and like hearing"
19:17,260;19:22,380;"them try and rephrase the same question a different way is always peak comedy."
19:22,380;19:27,740;"Yeah, I mean, look, I've sat there trying not to laugh in the middle of something."
19:32,140;19:35,020;"to quote an old saying that I've heard once or twice, it is what it is."
19:35,020;19:44,220;"We're on it next week. So I got a question speaking of like other media members in New England. So"
19:44,220;19:53,180;"I grew up in New Hampshire listening to 98.5 we and then I moved to North Carolina and it was like"
19:53,180;19:59,180;"shocking how differently the media here treats local sports teams"
19:59,900;20:07,260;"then back into winglin'. So I think it's fair to say that the Boston sports talk media is like"
20:07,260;20:16,140;"relatively tough on their teams as far as being critical. So specifically, Felger and"
20:16,140;20:21,100;"Maz is a good example where it seems like they're almost at a point where they're trolling you as far"
20:21,100;20:29,100;"as hating on the Patriots. Do you think that that's kind of like a tactic that they use as far as"
20:29,100;20:33,380;"like, yeah, we get a lot of listeners because we know we rile them up, or do you think those"
20:33,380;20:36,100;"are their legitimate opinions?"
20:36,100;20:43,420;"That's a tough question for me to answer."
20:43,420;20:48,180;"Because I don't want to do what the thing that pisses me off about those guys."
20:48,180;20:50,140;"I don't want to talk about their jobs."
20:50,140;20:51,140;"Yeah."
20:51,140;20:54,580;"Like the way that they talk about my job, that pisses me off."
20:54,580;20:58,820;"So I'm not going to answer like why, I mean, they've the number one rate shown in the"
20:58,820;21:00,980;"the world in the country, whatever."
21:00,980;21:02,740;"They're good at what they do."
21:02,740;21:04,740;"The ratings say they are."
21:04,740;21:06,300;"There are things that I wish they didn't do."
21:06,300;21:08,340;"I don't want them, you know,"
21:08,340;21:10,940;"they don't need to be talking shit about what I do"
21:10,940;21:12,360;"and the way I do my job."
21:12,360;21:17,660;"But I'm not gonna be a hypocrite and sit here and say,"
21:17,660;21:20,940;"you know, I'm not gonna flip this and do that"
21:20,940;21:23,780;"about them when they don't have a chance to sit here"
21:23,780;21:24,620;"and defend themselves."
21:24,620;21:27,580;"So I'm gonna respectfully pass on the rest of the day."
21:27,580;21:29,940;"- I mean, do you know why you said enough?"
21:29,940;21:31,780;"- You're only talking to a mom."
21:31,780;21:32,820;"- Yeah, right."
21:32,820;21:33,660;"- It's only mom listening."
21:33,660;21:35,100;"Do you feel like there's,"
21:35,100;21:38,700;"'cause from like an outsider's point of view people,"
21:38,700;21:43,260;"some, the type of person who like takes in all this media,"
21:43,260;21:45,260;"it feels like there's been for a long time"
21:45,260;21:46,660;"an undercurrent of,"
21:46,660;21:49,740;"I don't know if negativity is the right word,"
21:49,740;21:54,100;"but just kind of like waiting for the teams to do badly."
21:54,100;21:55,780;"And kind of like for us growing up,"
21:55,780;22:01,300;"It was always like, eventually the sports media would be proven correctly eventually."
22:01,300;22:04,660;"You know, you got your bill of buckeners or your whatever."
22:04,660;22:12,220;"Basically, you're red socks of every year up until 2004."
22:12,220;22:13,580;"And the pages were also lumped into that."
22:13,580;22:19,740;"So it felt like from the outside, there was this waiting for the other shooter drop in"
22:19,740;22:23,220;"a lot of the content that was written."
22:23,220;22:30,660;"And even when the team started getting success, it felt like a lot of the, maybe the older"
22:30,660;22:34,420;"media members were kind of like hanging onto that a bit."
22:34,420;22:41,860;"I don't know if you've seen that in your interactions with other media members or players"
22:41,860;22:50,060;"kind of recognizing that and not necessarily opening up to you as quickly maybe."
22:50,060;22:59,180;"I have such a different job because those guys, they have to have an opinion."
22:59,180;23:02,940;"If you're on talk radio, you have to have an opinion."
23:02,940;23:06,140;"Whereas it's my job to just relay information."
23:06,140;23:10,620;"Sometimes I do it differently, sometimes I'll do it in an entertaining way, sometimes I'll"
23:10,620;23:12,620;"do it in a column fashion."
23:12,620;23:16,300;"But ultimately, my goal is to just relay information."
23:16,300;23:27,340;"So I just pride myself on being accurate, being credible, having my reputation is just"
23:27,340;23:31,820;"somebody that I want people to appreciate and respect my work."
23:31,820;23:36,780;"And I'm not ever going to put something out there just to get attention."
23:36,780;23:44,500;"Whereas it's just totally an old school columnist for any of the big papers in the city."
23:44,500;23:47,220;"And I'm not going to mention any names because I don't want anybody to think I'm talking about them."
23:47,220;23:47,860;"- Honestly."
23:47,860;23:50,060;"- Rubble shots."
23:50,060;23:50,700;"- We'll do it."
23:50,700;23:51,220;"- We'll do it."
23:51,220;23:52,460;"- I'll do it for you."
23:52,460;23:55,700;"- But you know what their job is or was."
23:55,700;23:59,540;"And it's very similar to what it is on TalkRady."
23:59,540;24:00,780;"I mean, that's just..."
24:00,780;24:04,180;"I've got great friends on radio in town."
24:04,180;24:06,660;"I mean, I went to college with Mark Bertrand."
24:06,660;24:08,100;"I wrote a book with Zolac."
24:08,100;24:11,380;"So I've got that show monopolized there."
24:11,380;24:12,220;"I'm good there."
24:13,660;24:16,260;"But like, they just their job is just so different."
24:16,260;24:21,900;"And sometimes when I come out and I bore them with just middle"
24:21,900;24:25,420;"of the road facts with objects, you know, just being objective"
24:25,420;24:27,460;"because that's what I can do anything with, right?"
24:27,460;24:28,540;"Yeah, exactly."
24:28,540;24:29,060;"Right."
24:29,060;24:32,580;"But you know, sometimes I bore those guys and sometimes they take shots"
24:32,580;24:33,140;"and before it."
24:33,140;24:37,060;"And as long as it's playful, then or like, I'm there to defend myself,"
24:37,060;24:37,900;"I'm full of that."
24:37,900;24:39,300;"Like that's that's totally fine."
24:39,300;24:43,380;"It's just, but as opposed to it's just we just have such different jobs."
24:43,380;24:46,860;"So like, who are they rooting for negativity?"
24:46,860;24:48,100;"I'm not going to speak for them."
24:48,100;24:51,300;"All I can say is I just try to tell you what's happening"
24:51,300;24:53,140;"and why it's happening."
24:53,140;24:54,860;"You know, if something's not working,"
24:54,860;24:56,820;"like the quarterback situation last year,"
24:56,820;24:58,780;"I'm going to tell you why it's not happening"
24:58,780;25:00,140;"or what they need to do from here."
25:00,140;25:01,980;"Like there was a time last year"
25:01,980;25:04,100;"when I wrote that through three games,"
25:04,100;25:05,940;"Cam Newton was playing so well,"
25:05,940;25:08,060;"what is he looking at for a contract extension?"
25:08,060;25:09,060;"And I started comparing it."
25:09,060;25:12,500;"Like this guy was looking at a deal worth like 25 million annually"
25:12,500;25:16,620;"after week three, and they became so unconventional"
25:16,620;25:19,540;"and so easy to defend after that Rams game,"
25:19,540;25:22,500;"I was like, all right, and now it's time to put in stid them."
25:22,500;25:24,380;"But like neither of those things were me just saying,"
25:24,380;25:26,580;"""Hey, you know what, I gotta get myself some attention."""
25:26,580;25:31,140;"It's just like, all right, the quarterback topic"
25:31,140;25:33,980;"is the topic with this team right now."
25:33,980;25:36,540;"And so they find somebody to handle this thing"
25:36,540;25:38,220;"for a long time."
25:38,220;25:41,180;"So how can you at least extrapolate on that"
25:41,180;25:44,980;"and to push it forward after certain situations."
25:44,980;25:47,140;"- So who's starting, we won then?"
25:47,140;25:48,540;"- I think it's gonna be Cam."
25:48,540;25:49,380;"- Yeah, me too."
25:49,380;25:52,020;"- I think, I mean, Belichick,"
25:52,020;25:54,820;"with how strongly he said Cam was their quarterback"
25:54,820;25:56,860;"the night that they drafted Mac Jones,"
25:56,860;25:59,340;"I mean, I have to believe it will be."
25:59,340;26:02,980;"I'm not saying Mac Jones has zero percent chance or whatever."
26:02,980;26:06,140;"I mean, I know that they do believe,"
26:06,140;26:09,080;"the team does believe that,"
26:09,080;26:11,240;"like he had his shortcomings last season."
26:11,240;26:13,280;"I mean, just look at the contract they gave them."
26:13,280;26:15,360;"Just judge them by their actions."
26:15,360;26:19,280;"Am Newton had accuracy issues, he had mechanical issues."
26:19,280;26:22,160;"They were very predictable in the red zone."
26:22,160;26:26,040;"Now, they went on a shopping spree this off season."
26:26,040;26:29,120;"They are well-built to handle,"
26:29,120;26:32,320;"or they are much more, much better equipped"
26:32,320;26:34,280;"to throw the ball now just with the talent around them."
26:34,280;26:37,640;"And they want to see if adding John and Smith"
26:37,640;26:40,220;"and Hunter Henry and Nelson Agalure and Kendrick Bourne"
26:40,220;26:43,960;"is gonna have an impact on cam Newton."
26:43,960;26:46,680;"And if, who knows how much of that the COVID,"
26:46,680;26:50,080;"how much of that truly impact you?"
26:50,080;26:51,520;"We don't know yet."
26:51,520;26:54,280;"We'll see if all of these things help cam Newton"
26:54,280;26:56,400;"become a better quarterback and training camp."
26:56,400;26:59,400;"The great thing that they have going for them right now,"
26:59,400;27:02,320;"last year they had a two week training camp"
27:02,320;27:05,240;"and Jared Stidham was bad and then hurt"
27:05,240;27:07,280;"by the end of the fourth practice."
27:07,280;27:09,680;"And at that point, Cam Newton had established himself"
27:09,680;27:10,600;"as the number one guy."
27:10,600;27:11,680;"And he was good."
27:11,680;27:14,480;"Like Cam Newton was good enough in practice to have that."
27:14,480;27:16,240;"Now they're gonna have a normal training camp."
27:16,240;27:18,160;"They're gonna have three preseason games."
27:18,160;27:20,560;"They're gonna have upwards of six weeks"
27:20,560;27:23,200;"before the opener to figure out whether or not"
27:23,200;27:26,200;"Cam Newton is gonna be a better version of himself"
27:26,200;27:27,580;"than he was last year."
27:27,580;27:29,520;"And if they find out over those six weeks"
27:29,520;27:32,840;"that he's the same guy despite all the additions around him"
27:32,840;27:36,400;"and Mac Jones comes in and plays well"
27:36,400;27:40,120;"and I'm not saying he's gonna look like he did last year at Alabama,"
27:40,120;27:43,360;"but if he's a facilitator of the offense, if he's accurate,"
27:43,360;27:46,160;"if he, I mean, think about it, the way that they're built,"
27:46,160;27:48,400;"they're built to throw the ball over the middle of the field."
27:48,400;27:49,720;"You have to be accurate."
27:49,720;27:51,400;"That's what Mac Jones does."
27:51,400;27:53,480;"That accuracy starts to pop,"
27:53,480;27:56,240;"and Cam Newton doesn't progress the way that they hope."
27:56,240;27:59,400;"Then Mac Jones, I think, has a very realistic chance to start,"
27:59,400;28:02,320;"but those are two big ifs."
28:02,320;28:03,160;"- Yeah."
28:05,520;28:07,920;"So what's his book you wrote with Zolak?"
28:07,920;28:08,760;"- Oh, yes."
28:08,760;28:12,400;"- Oh, you mean the one right there?"
28:12,400;28:13,240;"There it is."
28:13,240;28:14,080;"- There it is."
28:14,080;28:14,920;"- Oh, yeah."
28:14,920;28:16,560;"- Right above the Mickey Ward glove."
28:16,560;28:19,240;"Yeah, if these walls could talk,"
28:19,240;28:21,440;"it was just a fun book that we did."
28:21,440;28:23,880;"Just 25 years of Patriot stories"
28:23,880;28:26,960;"between him showing up in Foxborough"
28:26,960;28:30,240;"and his overlap with me and the time that we've,"
28:30,240;28:33,040;"you know, covered the theme in various capacities together."
28:33,040;28:34,880;"So it was just editing process work"
28:34,880;28:36,560;"because can Zolak not read?"
28:36,560;28:38,760;"- It's a coloring book."
28:38,760;28:40,480;"(laughing)"
28:40,480;28:44,480;"- No, I read the first half and I'm gonna guess"
28:44,480;28:48,400;"that the way it went down is somebody recorded"
28:48,400;28:52,760;"Scott Zolak just talking, probably hours."
28:52,760;28:55,880;"And then Jeff probably did the heavy lifting"
28:55,880;28:57,280;"on the writing of the book."
28:57,280;28:59,520;"- Yeah, no, what I like to tell people was"
28:59,520;29:01,120;"we just alternated words."
29:01,120;29:05,840;"So I would just call it one word and then Zo would come in and he typed the next word"
29:05,840;29:10,160;"and then we just, we alternated until we got to 80,000 and it was like..."
29:10,160;29:14,880;"We're actually trying to write a book like that because we did a, we got nowhere."
29:14,880;29:22,280;"We did a review of a Cam Newton-themed erotic novel and it was so badly written we thought"
29:22,280;29:23,640;"we can do better than that."
29:23,640;29:30,120;"So we're, we're alternating chapters without telling the other person what we're writing."
29:30,120;29:32,900;"So I'm writing the first chapter, and I'm going to hand it off to one of the brothers"
29:32,900;29:35,360;"and then to build Belichick erotic."
29:35,360;29:36,520;"We don't even know."
29:36,520;29:39,200;"We don't know where it's going to go."
29:39,200;29:41,560;"So I know where it's going to go."
29:41,560;29:42,560;"You're in."
29:42,560;29:43,560;"You can tag you in."
29:43,560;29:44,560;"Yeah."
29:44,560;29:45,560;"It's going to end a graphic penetration."
29:45,560;29:46,560;"Okay."
29:46,560;29:47,560;"I know where it's going."
29:47,560;29:48,560;"Yeah."
29:48,560;29:49,560;"Well, it's go."
29:49,560;29:56,120;"At some point I have to make sure I'm invited back to the locker room."
29:56,120;29:57,120;"So maybe."
29:57,120;30:00,040;"Maybe we can read this book."
30:00,040;30:01,640;"Yeah, we won't put your name on."
30:01,640;30:03,480;"You're good, buddy."
30:03,480;30:03,980;"You can just--"
30:03,980;30:07,080;"I'm going to tell you guys how to live your lives."
30:07,080;30:08,200;"I've got to be able to--"
30:08,200;30:09,200;"I got to be afraid of that."
30:09,200;30:11,720;"We're not even invited to the locker room already."
30:11,720;30:15,320;"So I mean, it's not skin off our bag, right?"
30:15,320;30:18,280;"I only want to go to the locker room if Troy Brown's there."
30:18,280;30:18,780;"Yeah."
30:18,780;30:19,880;"Well, he's a coach."
30:19,880;30:20,720;"So he'll be there."
30:20,720;30:22,200;"Right, right."
30:22,200;30:22,680;"All right."
30:22,680;30:23,560;"Yeah, we're going to--"
30:23,560;30:28,120;"I've got another question about the media landscape."
30:28,120;30:36,760;"So I think with like the invention of like YouTube and basically, I mean, look at three random brothers can have a podcast."
30:36,760;30:42,520;"You've seen like the the old guard like media being like, okay, we need to be objective."
30:42,520;30:46,720;"We can't be fans or we can't like, you know, step over that line."
30:46,720;30:54,240;"But now you're seeing like more and more like like the bar stool guys a lot of them are like openly fans of the teams that they cover."
30:54,240;30:59,600;"and you're like, you know, go to YouTube and it's all like fan journalism, pseudo kind of thing."
30:59,600;31:05,840;"What do you think as far as like where that's heading and do you ever like struggle with that"
31:05,840;31:10,400;"yourself as far as like, okay, I have to remain objective even though I grew up in role and,"
31:10,400;31:18,320;"you know? No, I mean, believe it or not, like that, that, that fades really quickly."
31:19,520;31:26,000;"Because I'm there to do a job and I'm not going to do it well if I'm a fan."
31:26,000;31:27,600;"It's just that's not going to happen."
31:27,600;31:32,400;"Now, I can't find the fact that I have family members who are seasoned ticket holders and"
31:32,400;31:40,400;"my daughters are growing up in the area. They're going to like the Patriots."
31:40,400;31:47,120;"There are parts of your life that you just can't erase the fact that I grew up in Lowell and"
31:47,680;31:53,440;"the fact that who I grew up sharing for. But once I get once you get into it, it really"
31:53,440;32:00,040;"is pretty easy to push that stuff aside. In, I mean, 2009, like the whole media landscape"
32:00,040;32:04,640;"changed with just the way that the websites were, you didn't need to be a traditional"
32:04,640;32:09,640;"media outlet. I mean, again, w e i dot com really blew up and like, I think it was 2008"
32:09,640;32:14,400;"and Comcast.com or whatever they were at the time, Comcast and New England, whatever,"
32:14,400;32:17,840;"that they were branded at that point. They were starting to blow up."
32:17,840;32:22,960;"And nessin.com was just a little bit behind them. But then they started to move. So"
32:22,960;32:29,600;"the traditional media landscape changed big time around that like really great when I started,"
32:29,600;32:35,920;"I got my first break. And you like at the same time, there was, I mean, there was no Twitter"
32:35,920;32:41,520;"at that point, I don't think. I mean, I know I started Twitter in 2009, but it was probably"
32:41,520;32:48,400;"after I started covering the Patriots. And there was like, here's another random story."
32:48,400;32:55,200;"I broke, believe it or not, I broke the story that Oveskin signed his like, I don't know,"
32:55,200;33:01,280;"13 year, $125 million contract with the Capitals back in, I want to say 2008."
33:01,280;33:08,320;"And I put it on the Metro's website, which I mean, my mom maybe read like, no, I was calling"
33:08,320;33:10,720;"people being like, can we understand? We know that."
33:10,720;33:16,080;"Get this onto like the news tonight, because like I just broke this massive story,"
33:16,080;33:20,800;"but like the tree fell in the woods and there is nobody within miles to get the ground."
33:20,800;33:23,920;"How did you get the info?"
33:23,920;33:26,400;"I had a very well placed source."
33:26,400;33:33,360;"Works. Worked out. But I didn't cover hockey."
33:35,440;33:40,400;"We'll say I live in DC and the sports meeting here is also very negative"
33:40,400;33:46,320;"for the Redskins, but rightfully so. Yeah, deservedly so."
33:46,320;33:52,960;"But to bar school, they do things their own way and they do a great job of it."
33:52,960;33:58,800;"Like it makes it in a different sort of comparison. Like do you remember when Bill Simmons was the"
33:58,800;34:00,800;"the Boston sports guy. Oh, yeah."
34:00,800;34:05,400;"When when he was gone in the early 2000s, I mean, he was a"
34:05,400;34:09,800;"blast to read. That's true. He probably set that standard"
34:09,800;34:12,760;"there. Yeah. But in every kid, I mean, when I got to the"
34:12,760;34:17,520;"student paper at UMass, it, I had great mentors there. And these"
34:17,520;34:20,560;"guys were like, they said it to me, they said it with every new"
34:20,560;34:23,600;"kid there, you were not going to try to write like Bill Simmons,"
34:23,600;34:28,000;"like Bill Simmons is great at what Boston sports guy is great at"
34:28,000;34:31,840;"what he does because he's funny, he knows how to write, he knows how to tell stories,"
34:31,840;34:36,240;"and he knows how to do it in a way that keeps people engaged for thousands of words at a time."
34:36,240;34:43,280;"You are a slappy, you know, 19, 20-year-old college kid. You can't write worth a damn."
34:43,280;34:48,400;"You're not nearly as funny as you think you are, and it takes me four hours to edit your crap that"
34:48,400;34:53,760;"you hand in every night to stick to covering the lacrosse game. Someone needs to tell Greg that."
34:56,800;35:03,120;"So it was like, people can try to replicate the bar school stuff, but they're not going to be as"
35:03,120;35:08,400;"funny. They're not going to be as innovative. Like those, Portnoy is a millionaire because"
35:08,400;35:14,320;"he does what nobody else can do is good as him. And, you know, people who try"
35:14,320;35:19,360;"will more likely than not fail. So like, I've always just taken it like,"
35:19,360;35:24,960;"think about what you're good at, focus on that stuff. Don't try to be who you're not."
35:25,760;35:30,760;"write whatever you feel, write whatever you feel."
35:30,760;35:35,440;"Don't try to have a personality that isn't yours."
35:35,440;35:37,480;"You know, when I'm on with Tuttur and Rich,"
35:37,480;35:39,640;"like, I don't know, I think I'm like,"
35:39,640;35:42,080;"I have some dry humor and I might sneak in here"
35:42,080;35:43,640;"from time to time or whatever."
35:43,640;35:46,120;"Those guys are like way funnier than me."
35:46,120;35:48,040;"So I'm not gonna go on Tuttur and Rich"
35:48,040;35:49,960;"and try to match those guys joke for joke"
35:49,960;35:51,760;"and make an ass out of myself."
35:51,760;35:53,360;"So I just like stay in my own lane."
35:53,360;35:57,260;"I just, you know, be who we are and don't try to force it"
35:57,260;35:58,960;"because when you start forcing stuff,"
35:58,960;36:01,360;"you get exposed way too quickly, especially."
36:01,360;36:03,880;"- So you say that we should keep doing this podcast"
36:03,880;36:07,360;"for every single Patriots game."
36:07,360;36:09,360;"It's what we're going to start to finish"
36:09,360;36:14,360;"about 286 and spend 90 minutes talking about each one."
36:14,360;36:15,920;"- It's like 300."
36:15,920;36:18,560;"- That's what you guys can do and nobody else can do it the way."
36:18,560;36:21,040;"- Nobody else has this sort of 40."
36:21,040;36:22,620;"- Tell us the truth when you heard that."
36:22,620;36:25,780;"you were like, that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard."
36:25,780;36:27,380;"- No, I like the idea."
36:27,380;36:28,220;"I really do."
36:28,220;36:30,300;"- Execution wise."
36:30,300;36:31,620;"- Yeah, I do."
36:31,620;36:34,380;"- I'm not gonna be as iron, we'll say."
36:34,380;36:36,820;"- Yeah, I mean, hey, it's a cool idea."
36:36,820;36:41,820;"It's, I mean, it's a really cool idea to go back"
36:41,820;36:43,380;"and look at all this stuff,"
36:43,380;36:46,540;"because thinking how many people have watched"
36:46,540;36:48,860;"95% of Patriots games,"
36:48,860;36:52,180;"that every Patriots game over the last two decades."
36:52,180;36:53,840;"I mean, I know I have."
36:53,840;36:56,380;"But how many do you remember from the beginning of the season?"
36:56,380;36:57,380;"Yeah."
36:57,380;36:59,140;"I can't remember 95% of the game."
36:59,140;37:01,940;"And this first game of the '04 season was--"
37:01,940;37:02,440;"Yeah."
37:02,440;37:02,940;"Yeah."
37:02,940;37:04,380;"It's interesting what you do remember"
37:04,380;37:05,540;"and what you don't remember."
37:05,540;37:06,040;"Yeah."
37:06,040;37:09,180;"That's because odd things that are like clear as day,"
37:09,180;37:11,660;"remember it like multiple plays from this game"
37:11,660;37:13,620;"and the other game is like not a clue."
37:13,620;37:14,620;"Could even play the score."
37:14,620;37:15,140;"Yeah."
37:15,140;37:17,140;"Yeah."
37:17,140;37:20,060;"Yeah, I mean, I think if I went through the box score"
37:20,060;37:26,940;"that season opener in 2004. I'm sure things would start to come back to me. But I think that was"
37:26,940;37:33,980;"no, I want to say, I might even be thinking of the the band are raising against the Raiders"
37:33,980;37:39,980;"more than the Brady Manning season opener than anything. So it's, and those things start to run"
37:39,980;37:45,580;"together. Yeah. That'd be fun though to kind of sit back and rewatch all those things from 15"
37:45,580;37:51,100;"plus years ago. Yeah, I'm sure it gets better the longer you watch it. Yeah, it's finding"
37:51,100;37:56,380;"games that you can actually make out who the players are. Yeah, I mean, I've talked to,"
37:56,380;38:01,260;"I love doing stories like oral histories of games that happened 15 years ago, whatever,"
38:01,260;38:05,580;"10 years ago. And I'll talk to guys who played in those games and they'll, you know, some of them"
38:05,580;38:12,300;"are like, yeah, I don't remember what happened. Oh, yeah. It's, it's a fun exercise. It's got to"
38:12,300;38:14,600;"How do you find exercise?"
38:14,600;38:16,000;"- Yeah, no, it has been so far."
38:16,000;38:17,520;"- Yeah, the good games are awesome."
38:17,520;38:21,120;"But then like the slogs against Buffalo in December"
38:21,120;38:23,440;"and you're like, oh, why am I watching this?"
38:23,440;38:25,120;"- You don't even watch them."
38:25,120;38:26,200;"- Exactly why."
38:26,200;38:30,060;"It's the nine, six Browns game that almost broke me."
38:30,060;38:33,640;"- There's something."
38:33,640;38:37,840;"- Even like now, like when they were, you know,"
38:37,840;38:40,480;"juggernaut in the middle of winning three Super Bowls"
38:40,480;38:44,480;"in five years or whatever, you know, recently,"
38:44,480;38:49,480;"show up on the road in Buffalo, no, a Jets game or whatever,"
38:49,480;38:53,480;"and the Jets wouldn't be good and it'd be a one o'clock game."
38:53,480;38:56,480;"And I'm going to the stadium like,"
38:56,480;39:01,480;"this is just going to be a boring like 35 to 10 game."
39:01,480;39:02,480;"But I'll write my game."
39:02,480;39:03,480;"- Never in 10."
39:03,480;39:06,480;"- Yep, I'll be out of the building by six or something like that."
39:06,480;39:08,480;"It's just, yeah."
39:08,480;39:11,600;"Yeah, we were always like some of those gems that you"
39:11,600;39:18,000;"like remembered it at the time like those one jets game that ended with like a huge brawl"
39:18,000;39:20,560;"That I think met light started"
39:20,560;39:23,120;"Yeah off of a I think it was a"
39:23,120;39:26,800;"genome Smith interceptions on the end it"
39:26,800;39:28,720;"And"
39:28,720;39:33,760;"Like I don't even remember this game. This is amazing. How do I how did I forget that this game ended in a brawl?"
39:34,400;39:39,200;"And so that was actually what got me to start this podcast was like, we need to go back and watch some of these games."
39:39,200;39:41,480;"Because what else have I forgotten?"
39:41,480;39:43,600;"And yeah, it's a shit ton."
39:43,600;39:48,160;"And then you rewatch them and forget them again."
39:48,160;39:49,000;"No, yeah."
39:49,000;39:52,640;"But we can always listen to our podcast and remember that's true."
39:52,640;39:55,400;"The Cliffs notes."
39:55,400;39:56,360;"Yeah, exactly."
39:56,360;39:57,440;"Oh, they're long."
39:57,440;40:00,760;"So all right."
40:00,760;40:03,680;"Well, we should probably let you go because I know you have other stuff to do."
40:03,680;40:06,480;"you're onto bigger and better than this."
40:06,480;40:09,800;"But before you go, we ask everybody this,"
40:09,800;40:11,600;"who is your favorite patriot?"
40:11,600;40:13,280;"- Oh man."
40:13,280;40:14,360;"- All time."
40:14,360;40:16,880;"- And why is it Troy Brown?"
40:16,880;40:19,280;"(laughing)"
40:19,280;40:20,120;"- Steve."
40:20,120;40:20,960;"- Ah."
40:20,960;40:24,760;"- I don't know, it's hard for me to say"
40:24,760;40:27,160;"I have a favorite patriot just because again,"
40:27,160;40:29,880;"get back, it gets to the job aspect of it."
40:29,880;40:32,160;"I mean, like, yeah, you growing up,"
40:32,160;40:34,040;"there's a fan and stuff like that."
40:34,040;40:35,700;"But like, I don't want to put myself out there"
40:35,700;40:36,640;"and be like, yeah, you know,"
40:36,640;40:38,660;"because I've gotten to know some of those guys."
40:38,660;40:41,300;"Like even guys that I didn't cover,"
40:41,300;40:44,640;"like had been long been retired or whatever."
40:44,640;40:47,520;"I think recently I've stuck in this isn't like a favorite"
40:47,520;40:50,680;"or whatever, a recent calling of mine has been to figure out"
40:50,680;40:53,600;"why the hell Stanley Morgan isn't in the Hall of Fame."
40:53,600;40:55,620;"I think I've gone on more than my share"
40:55,620;40:58,240;"of social media rants over that topic"
40:58,240;41:00,040;"in the last couple of months."
41:00,040;41:06,040;"So, I mean, if I have to give a shout out to an old school patriot, I'm going to go with"
41:06,040;41:08,520;"Stanley Morgan because that's how he all came."
41:08,520;41:12,200;"His numbers and his first six seasons are absolutely absurd."
41:12,200;41:16,440;"They're better than some guys who are in the hall of fame who played in the same era."
41:16,440;41:22,840;"I mean, 20 plus yards a catch for six consecutive seasons to start his career."
41:22,840;41:27,200;"Second fastest guy to 10,000 yards."
41:27,200;41:28,680;"And he did it for bad teams."
41:28,680;41:31,280;"I mean, yeah, like who was thrown on the football?"
41:31,280;41:32,280;"Right."
41:32,280;41:35,480;"I mean, Grogan was great, but for parts of that,"
41:35,480;41:38,480;"he was hurt for large parts of that."
41:38,480;41:42,080;"So it's a Stanley Morgan should be in the Hall of Fame."
41:42,080;41:45,200;"And I will not rest until I'm out."
41:45,200;41:48,720;"That's why I wanted to have you on here, Jeff."
41:48,720;41:50,720;"You're a Stanley Morgan Hall favorite."
41:50,720;41:53,080;"That's what I like to fucking listen to."
41:53,080;41:55,240;"That's how long it's been."
41:55,240;41:56,760;"That's how long it's been."
41:56,760;41:58,200;"Hell yeah."
41:58,200;42:06,700;"Yeah. Also, in honor of having Jeff on, we've decided that we're going to give away a year"
42:06,700;42:14,200;"subscription to the athletic to a listener. So I think what do we land on? We landed on"
42:14,200;42:23,760;"if you you got a lever review of the podcast doesn't have to be good. We understand we're"
42:23,760;42:31,280;"human. But yeah, so just leave a review anywhere, iTunes or pod chase or whatever app you use."
42:31,280;42:38,160;"And then text the the Dinesy hotline to let us know that it's you. And we're going to pick one"
42:38,160;42:44,240;"at random. And if you don't text us, we won't know because they don't actually tell you who"
42:44,240;42:49,520;"leaves these reviews. So you got a leave review and then you got to text the hotline. Steve,"
42:49,520;42:57,200;"what's the number? 603. Yeah. 505. Yeah. Troy Brown for three. That's right."
42:57,200;43:08,960;"8043. 603. 505. 8043. So. I appreciate you guys doing that. Absolutely. Supporting the athletic"
43:08,960;43:15,200;"and I hope whoever gets that free subscription like truly enjoys it. I mean, I can't say I love"
43:15,200;43:22,960;"the work that they let us do at the outlet. We do everything we can to make sure, like,"
43:22,960;43:28,080;"we understand, especially, like, it's a little easier now than it was three years ago when I"
43:28,080;43:33,440;"joined the company and, you know, the thought of paying a subscription fee for online content,"
43:33,440;43:42,560;"you know, it was not common whatsoever three years ago. And it's tough to get people to,"
43:42,560;43:48,080;"I mean, I know what it was like, you know, downloading free music 20 years ago and now I haven't"
43:48,080;43:57,680;"been like, I get it. I had that. I know. Right. So I work my ass off. I know everybody else at"
43:57,680;44:04,240;"the company does to make sure that when you are, you know, putting a few bucks a month into our"
44:04,240;44:10,080;"product, we want to make sure that you not only enjoy it, but like you are willing to keep coming"
44:10,080;44:19,120;"back. So everything I write for the most part, so almost everything I write is my aim to have"
44:19,120;44:24,160;"unique content. I try to get my access to the readers as much as possible. Like I know that"
44:24,160;44:29,760;"people are paying money to read our stuff and we want to make it worth it. So thank you again"
44:29,760;44:34,880;"for for supporting it. And again, whoever gets the subscription, I hope you can see the work"
44:34,880;44:39,280;"and the effort that we put into this stuff. Anybody listening to this podcast where we're going"
44:39,840;44:41,720;"way deep on a Patriots game."
44:41,720;44:45,080;"Yeah, and it's tailor made for the like, yeah."
44:45,080;44:47,320;"Like the athletic content for sure."
44:47,320;44:48,160;"Yes, for sure."
44:48,160;44:48,960;"Yeah."
44:48,960;44:50,480;"Because it's like, what we're doing,"
44:50,480;44:52,960;"but like for stuff that's happening now."
44:52,960;44:55,000;"Oh, no, I was going to say actually good."
44:55,000;44:56,000;"Well, that's you."
44:56,000;44:59,560;"Doesn't have Greg in it."
44:59,560;45:00,800;"Yeah."
45:00,800;45:02,800;"But we're doing not yet."
45:02,800;45:03,800;"Not yet."
45:03,800;45:04,800;"Yes."
45:04,800;45:07,480;"Thanks for having me."
45:07,480;45:09,560;"Thanks for coming on, bud."
45:09,560;45:14,200;"Sorry too soon. Take care. Wait, wait, wait."
45:14,200;45:24,360;"All right, that's gotta be tough to follow that with. I like Jeff. Yeah,"
45:24,360;45:29,920;"I think we're chill. Yeah. Oh, but he didn't shit on Colby. Damn it."
45:29,920;45:37,080;"Yeah. So Colby, if you're listening, go fuck yourself. Yeah, get out of his driveway."
45:37,160;45:38,840;"Yeah, right. What the fuck you fucking stunk."
45:38,840;45:39,760;"You're on house, buddy."
45:39,760;45:41,000;"Jesus, right?"
45:41,000;45:42,040;"Oh, but he's my neighbor."
45:42,040;45:43,760;"I can look through his windows. It's cool."
45:43,760;45:46,000;"That's not it's not Colby fucking not get off."
45:46,000;45:47,960;"Put the binoculars down, Colby."
45:47,960;45:50,680;"All right."
45:50,680;45:53,240;"So speaking of football."
45:53,240;45:57,960;"There was some football that happened back in 2004."
45:57,960;46:00,640;"And I think we should probably talk about it, Steve."
46:00,640;46:01,400;"What do you think?"
46:01,400;46:03,560;"Yeah, I mean, it was nice."
46:03,560;46:05,400;"It was like a."
46:05,400;46:07,400;"rematch. Yeah."
46:07,400;46:10,100;"You see, Jamgy, everyone remembers that AOT Championship game."
46:10,100;46:13,300;"No one remembers a rematch week one season opener."
46:13,300;46:20,100;"So the only reason I remember this game was because Madden,"
46:20,100;46:23,900;"that year's Madden had just come out like not too far before it."
46:23,900;46:29,100;"And I just played this game in Madden and it came down to a"
46:29,100;46:30,200;"last second field goal."
46:30,200;46:34,700;"And I was like, this is so realistic, which back in 2004,"
46:34,700;46:40,620;"I don't think it was, but I sure felt it. Did you hit a fucking duck squib kick wide, right?"
46:40,620;46:45,100;"No, I hit the game winner without a minutary because he doesn't mess. But the controller was"
46:45,100;46:49,820;"vibrating as like a heartbeat because it was clutch. I knew that year, too. And I'm like,"
46:49,820;46:55,340;"Oh my God, this is so fucking my adrenaline is racing. And it was great. And it was probably,"
46:55,340;46:58,940;"as we've talked about before on rookie because I like to beat the piss out of things."
46:58,940;47:03,500;"Oh, yeah. Still came down a lot. How did it come down to a last minute field goal?"
47:03,500;47:09,740;"It's the Colts man fucking Peyton Manning. That's the first game I ever played on on that man. You know it happens"
47:09,740;47:16,340;"What's that that may be the year with the fucking like the vision cone and shit? Oh, I mean, I don't know"
47:16,340;47:19,580;"I'm not a big man guy. I'm terrible at video games. Yeah, I know"
47:19,580;47:23,440;"That's why I played on easy Steve who was favored in this game"
47:23,440;47:30,260;"So the New England Patriots favored by three which basically means it was a push because you got three points of playing at home"
47:30,260;47:32,260;"so I was even"
47:32,260;47:40,760;"Because I feel like this is back when the Patriots were still underrated because Madden is in there talking about how he thinks Brady is better than people give him credit for."
47:40,760;47:45,560;"Yeah, no, I'm back to being a Madden stand."
47:45,560;47:46,360;"I love the dude."
47:46,360;47:47,160;"I've been."
47:47,160;47:47,760;"Yeah."
47:47,760;47:48,960;"That's what I mean."
47:48,960;47:53,260;"But like, since we started this podcast, I'm all in on John Madden."
47:53,260;47:53,960;"I should roll that down."
47:53,960;47:55,060;"I'm all in."
47:55,060;47:56,060;"I love early 2000s."
47:56,060;47:56,860;"I love it."
47:56,860;47:57,960;"So good."
47:57,960;47:58,460;"Yeah."
47:58,460;48:01,460;"His quote was to me, Tom Brady is one of the best quarterbacks in all of football."
48:01,860;48:03,200;"week one, 2004."
48:03,200;48:05,220;"You already see, he already knows."
48:05,220;48:06,380;"It's like this guy."
48:06,380;48:10,340;"He's like, he's made those comments before about him joking about, you know,"
48:10,340;48:13,780;"him giving Brady shit and that Super Bowl."
48:13,780;48:18,060;"Yeah, calling it completely wrong on that on that last drive."
48:18,060;48:21,620;"He's like, I have another I would have, but I would talk to him more."
48:21,620;48:22,900;"I'm never going to say that about him."
48:22,900;48:27,140;"He's another quote, Matt and quote, a fumble is a fumble is a fumble."
48:27,140;48:29,060;"And you know what?"
48:29,060;48:30,260;"I can't agree with that more."
48:30,260;48:31,140;"Oh, yeah."
48:31,260;48:33,660;"Everyone's getting way too, you know,"
48:33,660;48:35,220;"yeah, because you like it out of here."
48:35,220;48:37,520;"Like that could you look at it at live speed."
48:37,520;48:40,180;"That's a fumble and then we saw it super duper,"
48:40,180;48:41,540;"duper, duper, duper, slow."
48:41,540;48:43,140;"Like, oh, baby, I don't know."
48:43,140;48:45,340;"Oh, was was he able to touch that blade of grass"
48:45,340;48:48,260;"before the ball started to slightly move for one frame?"
48:48,260;48:49,340;"Yeah, Madden hates that."
48:49,340;48:52,260;"And I, yeah, I think he had a point"
48:52,260;48:54,820;"because if you look at the game now,"
48:54,820;48:57,540;"it's gotten a little out of hand with all the reviews of the"
48:57,540;48:58,820;"- It slows it down."
48:58,820;49:00,260;"- Oh my God."
49:00,260;49:01,100;"And--"
49:01,100;49:02,740;"- This is year two of instant replay."
49:02,740;49:04,520;"- I mean, I guess we're just going straight in"
49:04,520;49:07,860;"on the commentators, but John Madden also said that the,"
49:07,860;49:13,020;"'cause this is the first game of the new,"
49:13,020;49:17,180;"what am I trying to say, the new emphasis on the--"
49:17,180;49:18,020;"- Oh yes."
49:18,020;49:19,900;"- Touching the wide receivers of defensive holding"
49:19,900;49:20,740;"and whatever."
49:20,740;49:23,700;"- Which they called the good five times since game?"
49:23,700;49:25,020;"- Yeah, best part was though,"
49:25,020;49:27,660;"the first time they called it this season on the Colts."
49:27,660;49:30,140;"But that's like the only time they call them the Colts."
49:30,140;49:34,980;"But Madden said that the Colts holding claims for last year's"
49:34,980;49:38,380;"AFC Championship team or over or Championship game was over exaggerated."
49:38,380;49:40,380;"Yeah. Like they weren't. They were fine."
49:40,380;49:43,300;"Madden was on team. Fuck those receivers up."
49:43,300;49:45,380;"Yeah. I mean, as he should be."
49:45,380;49:48,580;"Let's talk about the new guys."
49:48,580;49:51,380;"Now, like I said, before we get into the game, let's let's talk a bit about"
49:51,380;49:53,700;"the off season because this off season was"
49:54,740;49:57,300;"The great all-timer history. Yeah. Yeah."
49:57,300;50:02,700;"I think you could probably make it until the past off season, the 2021."
50:02,700;50:04,380;"No, that's fair."
50:04,380;50:07,900;"2007, pre-2007, too, with the Welker and the Moss."
50:07,900;50:09,820;"Yeah."
50:09,820;50:12,860;"It's a great deal, too. But this one, yeah, talk to me, talk to me about"
50:12,860;50:14,980;"because the Patriots came in."
50:14,980;50:17,740;"They had basically one weakness, right?"
50:17,740;50:19,580;"And that was no running game."
50:19,580;50:24,220;"And also, I think if you had a second weakness, it would be"
50:24,220;50:28,940;"that the defensive line and not being able to stop the run."
50:28,940;50:29,440;"Yeah."
50:29,440;50:29,440;"Right."
50:29,440;50:31,660;"So what are the pages to see?"
50:31,660;50:34,940;"Well, we got we had two first round picks, right?"
50:34,940;50:35,940;"Right."
50:35,940;50:36,940;"So oh, that's the other thing."
50:36,940;50:37,940;"Yeah."
50:37,940;50:42,980;"So we had now we are because we had our own first round pick, which is 32, obviously,"
50:42,980;50:45,140;"because you know, which was been Watson."
50:45,140;50:46,140;"Yeah."
50:46,140;50:49,340;"But we also had number 21, which we got from Baltimore the year before."
50:49,340;50:51,700;"I think Baltimore traded up into the first."
50:51,700;50:57,380;"they traded for the New England first round pick. And then they gave us their first round"
50:57,380;51:00,700;"pick in 2004 as well."
51:00,700;51:02,700;"Which VW."
51:02,700;51:08,500;"Yeah, was only Vince Wolfork. No big deal. One of the greatest picks ever the Patriots."
51:08,500;51:10,500;"All time."
51:10,500;51:15,260;"Yes. Just from not only their production, but also personality standpoint."
51:15,260;51:17,780;"Yeah. Oh yeah. And just like a great human being."
51:17,780;51:18,780;"Oh yeah."
51:18,780;51:20,780;"What did they trade for Corey Dillon?"
51:20,780;51:25,780;"It wasn't a lot. Yeah, it was"
51:25,780;51:32,380;"I won't say it's a second round pick. Yeah"
51:32,380;51:35,380;"Second round and like something else I think but yeah"
51:35,380;51:41,980;"I mean he was already like one of the best backs in the league by far right? It was really awesome, but he's just"
51:41,980;51:44,700;"This is pre"
51:45,460;51:50,420;"Marvin Lewis got hired the year before maybe and before"
51:50,420;51:57,420;"Carson Palmer he must have come next year or this year. He's is pretty the Bengals actually becoming"
51:57,420;52:05,340;"Mediocre where they're mediocre forever. Yeah, and there's a core Dylan was Cincinnati from 97 to 2003"
52:05,340;52:08,100;"And let's see six years"
52:08,100;52:13,740;"Cincinnati let's just go through there there so from 97"
52:14,340;52:19,940;"They were seven and nine and then three and thirteen four and twelve four and twelve six and ten"
52:19,940;52:24,420;"Two and fourteen and then two thousand three there were eight and eight"
52:24,420;52:28,340;"And that eight and eight was the first year with Marvin Lewis"
52:28,340;52:31,420;"But let's see the quarterbacks"
52:31,420;52:36,060;"Jeff Blake Nilo Donald at the end of his career Jeff Blake again"
52:36,060;52:38,980;"this Achilles Smith and"
52:38,980;52:41,180;"John Kitna"
52:41,180;52:43,300;"tough yeah, and"
52:43,380;52:48,380;"All he did was run for, let's see,"
52:48,380;52:54,580;"1100, 1100, 1200, 1400, 1300, 1300."
52:54,580;52:57,620;"And then in 2003 ran for 541,"
52:57,620;52:58,980;"I think he got injured."
52:58,980;53:01,460;"But there was some bad blood at the end of that."
53:01,460;53:03,800;"2003, like the end of the run with the bangles,"
53:03,800;53:05,620;"which is why Patre's got him for cheap"
53:05,620;53:09,540;"because he was, you know, a quote unquote, malcontents."
53:09,540;53:10,580;"And I was trying to find the quote,"
53:10,580;53:11,900;"but I couldn't really find it anywhere."
53:11,900;53:16,780;"just like mentions of it. But apparently, and they mentioned it, the comedy mentioned in this game,"
53:16,780;53:23,340;"where the Bengals offensive line basically told Corey Dillon, ""We don't want to block for you,"
53:23,340;53:29,740;"we'll want to block for somebody else."" Yeah. Which is crazy if he puts up all that production."
53:29,740;53:35,980;"Right. That's tough. Yeah, on like two and 14 teams, and he's fucking like he is the offense."
53:35,980;53:38,780;"We saw them in 2001."
53:38,780;53:40,700;"That was the first game we watched, remember?"
53:40,700;53:41,980;"Yeah, he crushed us."
53:41,980;53:44,380;"And he just, it was just the Corey Dillon show."
53:44,380;53:46,380;"I think it was a Killie Smith Peck 10."
53:46,380;53:48,540;"And the Killie Smith didn't do shit,"
53:48,540;53:50,700;"because all you had to do was hand it off to Corey Dillon"
53:50,700;53:53,900;"and watch him run for in four or five yards a game."
53:53,900;53:55,260;"Yeah, don't listen to that episode."
53:55,260;53:57,180;"That's a terrible episode of this podcast."
53:57,180;53:59,580;"Yeah, I wouldn't start with that."
53:59,580;54:00,540;"I wouldn't go back a little bit."
54:00,540;54:02,380;"But yeah."
54:02,380;54:04,860;"Well, I like the start for the Patriots in this game."
54:04,860;54:11,380;"game because they get Corey Dillon who's by far with those names we listed everyone else"
54:11,380;54:16,900;"in retrospect Vince Wilfberg is sick but you know back then he's a rookie."
54:16,900;54:17,900;"He's a rookie right?"
54:17,900;54:18,900;"Yeah."
54:18,900;54:20,980;"But we've got a new toy on offense."
54:20,980;54:25,820;"So they come out two tight ends and spread the field and don't even put Corey Dillon out"
54:25,820;54:27,820;"there and just throw the shit out of the ball."
54:27,820;54:28,820;"Yeah."
54:28,820;54:30,940;"They started the game no huddle five wide."
54:30,940;54:33,940;"- Trove immediately down the field, throwing it every play."
54:33,940;54:36,300;"- He thought it was like six of eight or something."
54:36,300;54:39,740;"- That's what Belichegu, that's what his like,"
54:39,740;54:43,740;"his blankie is, you know, the two tight end set wide."
54:43,740;54:44,980;"- Right, yeah, yeah."
54:44,980;54:47,340;"Which he would perfect in like 2011."
54:47,340;54:48,180;"- Yeah, perfect."
54:48,180;54:49,100;"- For those that challenge."
54:49,100;54:51,020;"But, and it looks like he's trying to do it again."
54:51,020;54:53,740;"I mean, he's been doing that two tight end set for,"
54:53,740;54:55,980;"I think long ago we know,"
54:55,980;54:59,220;"I think he tried to do it in Cleveland as well."
54:59,220;55:02,500;"Yeah, let's just do a whole do a Cleveland Browns podcast."
55:02,500;55:04,060;"We'll rewatch every Cleveland game."
55:04,060;55:04,740;"We'll find out."
55:04,740;55:07,180;"Yeah, I don't know if you're going to be able to find those games."
55:07,180;55:09,340;"I think they've been burned the tape of them."
55:09,340;55:11,260;"No, nobody's saved those."
55:11,260;55:13,300;"They know we're trying to watch that again."
55:13,300;55:14,900;"No, I don't think so."
55:14,900;55:18,220;"Yeah."
55:18,220;55:21,540;"So, uh, but before we get in the game, I just want to touch on the draft a little"
55:21,540;55:24,980;"bit too, because this draft was bananas."
55:24,980;55:28,500;"Uh, the 2004, this was, uh, you,"
55:28,580;55:32,600;"well known for the first two picks, which was the charges"
55:32,600;55:34,500;"drafting Eli Manning number one."
55:34,500;55:37,820;"And then Eli being like, I ain't playing for you."
55:37,820;55:40,740;"So then the charges traded."
55:40,740;55:45,420;"Eli Manning to giants with a fourth pick for Phillip Rivers,"
55:45,420;55:47,880;"which fucking ridiculous."
55:47,880;55:53,380;"But also other records were set where the most wide receivers were selected"
55:53,380;55:54,540;"in the first round with seven."
55:54,540;55:56,420;"It's a lot of fucking wide receivers."
55:56,420;55:59,220;"the first round, which you've never seen anymore. Yeah."
55:59,220;56:04,100;"Like two this year? Like a quarter almost. Right. And the most trades in the first round"
56:04,100;56:12,660;"ever with 28. There were 28 trades. Like this first round was an absolute shit show. Do the"
56:12,660;56:20,100;"pages trade at all? No, I mean, technically they got the trade for Baltimore. So that counts, but"
56:20,100;56:24,280;"but like 28 trades involved in that first round."
56:24,280;56:27,940;"- Where was Rothace Burger pick?"
56:27,940;56:29,740;"'Cause he's the same draft class."
56:29,740;56:31,580;"- That's a good question."
56:31,580;56:33,220;"- He was pretty early, I feel."
56:33,220;56:35,260;"Wasn't he like three?"
56:35,260;56:39,260;"- Let's see."
56:39,260;56:40,940;"Rothace Burger, no."
56:40,940;56:42,540;"He was picked at 11."
56:42,540;56:45,700;"- Well, listen, Mophis, let's hear the..."
56:45,700;56:47,700;"- All right, so I'm just gonna give you the players"
56:47,700;56:56,500;"that made a pro ball. Eli Manning, number one, obviously. Pick number three, Arizona Cardinals,"
56:56,500;56:57,500;"Larry Fitzgerald."
56:57,500;56:59,300;"No, good pick."
56:59,300;57:04,460;"And then Philip Rivers, who swapped pick number five Washington Redskins, Sean Taylor."
57:04,460;57:10,220;"Kellen Winslow, the second. Roy Williams, DeAngelo Hall, Ben Rothusberger, Jonathan"
57:10,220;57:16,860;"Vilma, Chicago Bears, defensive tackle Tommy Harris, Eagles guard Sean Andrews, Saints,"
57:16,860;57:23,220;"offensive end will Smith number 21 Vince Wilfork nose tackle Miami the you"
57:23,220;57:29,820;"Rams picked Steven Jackson 24 Texans picked Jason babe in fence event"
57:29,820;57:36,900;"27 Benjamin Watson never went to a pro no wonder bro. I make sense. He's not he"
57:36,900;57:41,420;"was always solid never spectacular. Yeah, Colts picked at number 44 in the second"
57:41,420;57:43,420;"around Bob Sanders."
57:43,420;57:45,020;"- Pretty solid draft."
57:45,020;57:47,660;"However, I have a friend."
57:47,660;57:50,020;"- I've listed a bunch of people."
57:50,020;57:51,900;"He said seven wide receivers are drafted"
57:51,900;57:54,540;"only Fitsi min the problem."
57:54,540;57:55,380;"- Yeah."
57:55,380;57:57,500;"- Heesh."
57:57,500;57:59,660;"- Here I'll give you some other names."
57:59,660;58:01,940;"Jags picked Reggie Williams."
58:01,940;58:05,620;"Bills, Buffalo Bills legend Lee Evans."
58:05,620;58:07,140;"- He was okay."
58:07,140;58:11,020;"- Bucks picked Michael Clayton, who is her number's name."
58:11,020;58:13,580;"Bill's also picked JP Lassmann."
58:13,580;58:18,820;"Let's see, Michael Jenkins for the Falcons,"
58:18,820;58:20,980;"Rashawn Woods for the Niners."
58:20,980;58:22,300;"- Okay, none of us."
58:22,300;58:24,060;"The bills must have come out of that draft field."
58:24,060;58:25,060;"Pretty good."
58:25,060;58:27,100;"- They were, yeah, they're like our offense."
58:27,100;58:28,700;"- Yeah, we have ans."
58:28,700;58:30,420;"- Fix the offense."
58:30,420;58:31,980;"What's next?"
58:31,980;58:36,660;"But yeah, so I have a friend who's almost as big a nerd"
58:36,660;58:38,900;"as we are, or I am, I guess."
58:38,900;58:40,260;"- Yeah, don't walk in with you."
58:40,260;58:47,460;"And he put together all the players who are still left in draft since Tom Brady got drafted."
58:47,460;58:49,060;"So Brady got drafted in 2000, right?"
58:49,060;58:52,260;"So he's obviously the last person left in the 2000 draft."
58:52,260;58:55,140;"Nobody left in 2001 drafts."
58:55,140;59:00,180;"Now that your breeze retired, nobody left in 2002 drafts since Josh McCahn retired two years ago."
59:00,180;59:06,500;"Nobody left in 2003 since Jason Whitne retired this year again, I think."
59:06,500;59:07,620;"- Teddy?"
59:07,620;59:14,580;"Yeah. From 2004, there are three players left. One of them is Andy Lee the punter. Can you name"
59:14,580;59:20,820;"the other two? Fitsy. Yeah. Rockinsberger. That's right. Although Larry Fitzgerald, not technically"
59:20,820;59:24,500;"currently on a team right now. It's great. Isn't that the theme right now? It might be down to two."
59:24,500;59:31,540;"And then 2005, Aaron Rodgers, Mike Nugent, Frank Gore, Richie Enchugneto, Dan Colquitt,"
59:31,540;59:33,460;"and Ryan if it's Patrick."
59:33,460;59:37,540;"So Brady might outlast one, two, three, four, five."
59:37,540;59:40,820;"That's definitely bull drafts."
59:40,820;59:43,660;"Yeah, a lot of those guys already did hang it up."
59:43,660;59:45,300;"That's insane."
59:45,300;59:47,700;"So shout out to Brian from Path's Chat"
59:47,700;59:48,540;"for putting that together"
59:48,540;59:50,580;"'cause that's fucking crazy shit."
59:50,580;59:55,060;"But yes, all right, so that was a draft."
59:55,060;59:56,060;"That shit crazy."
59:56,060;01:00:00,900;"And this Colts team is one of,"
01:00:00,900;01:00:05,580;"'Cause I think, like you always see a lot of people talking about the"
01:00:05,580;01:00:08,860;"premier offense of the day, and it was like,"
01:00:08,860;01:00:12,380;"""Oh, Patrick, my Holmes is the second best quarterback ever behind Tom Brady."""
01:00:12,380;01:00:19,180;"And I think people forget about how terrifying Peyton Manning was as a quarterback."
01:00:19,180;01:00:22,620;"Do you think my Holmes is a plaintiff, man?"
01:00:22,620;01:00:23,060;"I don't know."
01:00:23,060;01:00:24,980;"Not yet."
01:00:24,980;01:00:29,900;"That's what I'm saying, but people are like, ""Oh, I mean, it's Tom Brady,"
01:00:30,540;01:00:33,140;"Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes,"
01:00:33,140;01:00:34,820;"the only people you hear about."
01:00:34,820;01:00:36,780;"And I think people forget."
01:00:36,780;01:00:38,660;"- Well, 'cause they're also playing Andy."
01:00:38,660;01:00:40,340;"- I know, I agree."
01:00:40,340;01:00:44,940;"But like this, especially like this like 2004"
01:00:44,940;01:00:48,740;"is kind of-- - The team was so stacked."
01:00:48,740;01:00:49,580;"I mean, there was a thing. - What was the thing?"
01:00:49,580;01:00:51,580;"- There was a good through five."
01:00:51,580;01:00:54,620;"Brandon Stokley was like their fifth receiver, right?"
01:00:54,620;01:00:55,660;"- Something like that, yeah."
01:00:55,660;01:00:57,500;"- And Brandon Stokley is a household name,"
01:00:57,500;01:00:58,820;"everyone knows who he is."
01:00:58,820;01:01:04,380;"So when I was doing the research on this, I found that this season,"
01:01:04,380;01:01:09,020;"the Colts had three wide receivers over a thousand receiving yards."
01:01:09,020;01:01:10,620;"Three."
01:01:10,620;01:01:15,580;"I'm like, that's, I mean, yeah, if you throw 4,000 yards in a season,"
01:01:15,580;01:01:16,820;"you're doing good as a quarterback."
01:01:16,820;01:01:17,300;"Right."
01:01:17,300;01:01:19,660;"And he's throwing three just to wide receivers."
01:01:19,660;01:01:22,980;"So, uh, Harrison, Reggie Wayne."
01:01:22,980;01:01:23,780;"Yeah."
01:01:23,780;01:01:26,260;"Who's the third brand in Stokely?"
01:01:26,460;01:01:27,460;"- Locally."
01:01:27,460;01:01:29,460;"- Yeah, just a check is on that team."
01:01:29,460;01:01:30,740;"- Yep."
01:01:30,740;01:01:31,580;"- Who was their other receiver?"
01:01:31,580;01:01:32,820;"Another good receiver."
01:01:32,820;01:01:35,380;"- I mean, that was kind of it, really."
01:01:35,380;01:01:36,220;"- That it?"
01:01:36,220;01:01:37,060;"- Yeah."
01:01:37,060;01:01:44,660;"But so I'm like, how many times has this happened?"
01:01:44,660;01:01:48,700;"Like teams having three players get over 1,000 receiving yards"
01:01:48,700;01:01:49,540;"in one year."
01:01:49,540;01:01:53,580;"And since 2000, as far back as it went,"
01:01:53,580;01:01:55,220;"'cause you know, fuck it."
01:01:55,220;01:02:00,220;"Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight times, right?"
01:02:00,220;01:02:06,620;"And I did it like regular season and playoffs"
01:02:06,620;01:02:08,860;"just 'cause otherwise it would be two times."
01:02:08,860;01:02:13,220;"This 2004 Colts was the one of the two teams"
01:02:13,220;01:02:15,500;"that did it in the regular season."
01:02:15,500;01:02:17,420;"So all three guys had over a thousand yards"
01:02:17,420;01:02:20,740;"going into the playoffs, which is insane."
01:02:22,460;01:02:25,600;"Before that, it was the 2002 Raiders,"
01:02:25,600;01:02:27,700;"which was Jim Brown, Jerry Rice,"
01:02:27,700;01:02:30,800;"and Charlie Garner, the running back."
01:02:30,800;01:02:32,100;"- And what?"
01:02:32,100;01:02:34,480;"- Right, at 1,073 yards."
01:02:34,480;01:02:38,400;"Two thousand four quotes, 2008 Cardinals."
01:02:38,400;01:02:39,620;"This is insane."
01:02:39,620;01:02:43,300;"This is the Cardinals team that I think went to the Super Bowl,"
01:02:43,300;01:02:47,580;"right with Kurt Warner at the helm, I think."
01:02:47,580;01:02:50,100;"Who again, another quarterback who I don't think gets us to."
01:02:50,100;01:02:51,580;"But listen to these numbers."
01:02:51,580;01:02:57,140;"Larry Fitzgerald, no, actually no, we'll start at the bottom."
01:02:57,140;01:03:00,580;"Bolden had, oh sorry, that's not that you're doing bright."
01:03:00,580;01:03:03,940;"Wasn't it Steve Breston, I think it was?"
01:03:03,940;01:03:07,820;"1,154 yards."
01:03:07,820;01:03:10,580;"Bolden had 1,228 yards."
01:03:10,580;01:03:15,940;"Larry Fitzgerald 1,977 yards."
01:03:15,940;01:03:21,300;"Dude almost had 2,000 yards, and two other guys had 1,000 as well."
01:03:21,300;01:03:22,140;"That's incredible."
01:03:22,140;01:03:23,540;"You're fucking kidding me?"
01:03:23,540;01:03:26,740;"- What's the receiver record for yards in a season?"
01:03:26,740;01:03:29,100;"- I don't know, it's gotta be up there though."
01:03:29,100;01:03:31,140;"- Is anyone broke 2000?"
01:03:31,140;01:03:33,340;"I feel like 2000 yards receiving is gonna be like,"
01:03:33,340;01:03:34,340;"would be like a huge amount."
01:03:34,340;01:03:36,940;"- I feel like somebody, I feel like Megatron did it."
01:03:36,940;01:03:39,140;"- Oh yeah, you may be right."
01:03:39,140;01:03:43,260;"Greg, stat check."
01:03:43,260;01:03:45,940;"- Greg, so we'd stat check this."
01:03:45,940;01:03:46,780;"No."
01:03:46,780;01:03:51,140;"- In regular season, Calvin Johnson had"
01:03:51,140;01:03:55,900;"1,967, and then Julio Jones, the second with 1871,"
01:03:55,900;01:03:57,580;"then Jerry Rice, 1848."
01:03:57,580;01:04:00,620;"- That's crazy to have one guy in your team"
01:04:00,620;01:04:04,260;"who's like top five all-time receiving yards."
01:04:04,260;01:04:05,100;"- Yeah."
01:04:05,100;01:04:05,940;"I mean, that's including 12, too."
01:04:05,940;01:04:08,140;"- And 18,000, 200,000, you know,"
01:04:08,140;01:04:11,100;"not even two other, two other 1100 yard guys."
01:04:11,100;01:04:13,060;"- Right, yeah, 11 and 1200 yards."
01:04:13,060;01:04:14,500;"- I mean, they're just cracking it."
01:04:14,500;01:04:16,420;"- Some other interesting notes here,"
01:04:16,420;01:04:20,180;"then it was the '09 Colts with Garthon, Wayne,"
01:04:20,180;01:04:21,980;"and Dallas Clark the tight end."
01:04:21,980;01:04:27,440;"2011 Patriots, it was Wes Welker and two tight ends."
01:04:27,440;01:04:30,380;"All three of those had over 1,000 yards."
01:04:30,380;01:04:34,620;"2012 Falcons, Gonzalez Jones and White."
01:04:34,620;01:04:40,180;"2014 Patriots, Lefell, Edelman, Gronkowski."
01:04:40,180;01:04:42,340;"- I thought 1,000 yards."
01:04:42,340;01:04:43,860;"- If you include playoffs, yes."
01:04:43,860;01:04:49,420;"Same with the 2017 Patriots with Gronkowski,"
01:04:49,420;01:04:55,500;"cooks and Amindola. Amindola had 1,007 yards. But that season, I think he actually ended"
01:04:55,500;01:05:01,980;"the regular season with like 600 something yards and then had 300 yards in the playoffs."
01:05:01,980;01:05:05,620;"To get over the hump. Bananas."
01:05:05,620;01:05:10,660;"But I mean, it is just philosophical bullshit that they don't count playoff stats and that's"
01:05:10,660;01:05:11,660;"that sort of stuff."
01:05:11,660;01:05:13,860;"I agree, which is why I count them every fucking time."
01:05:13,860;01:05:17,660;"Yeah, because like, oh, well, you know, not everyone gets played. Well, no shit."
01:05:17,660;01:05:23,060;"Yeah. So this is a, this is a cult manning team that's going to put up fucking yards."
01:05:23,060;01:05:23,760;"Yeah."
01:05:23,760;01:05:27,460;"And they kind of did it in this game."
01:05:27,460;01:05:30,360;"Just like they have the last two times."
01:05:30,360;01:05:30,960;"You've watched them."
01:05:30,960;01:05:32,960;"4,500 yards from Peyton."
01:05:32,960;01:05:33,660;"Yeah."
01:05:33,660;01:05:34,760;"49 touchdowns."
01:05:34,760;01:05:36,460;"Yep."
01:05:36,460;01:05:39,560;"Which is the record until Brady breaks it, right?"
01:05:39,560;01:05:40,260;"Right."
01:05:40,260;01:05:42,160;"And then Manning breaks it again."
01:05:42,160;01:05:46,360;"And Brady will be at this year with Denver."
01:05:46,660;01:05:48,820;"I remember Tom Brady's 50. Oh, yeah."
01:05:48,820;01:05:51,980;"I mean, in the 50th in style too."
01:05:51,980;01:05:54,100;"Yeah, so there are 10 exceptions."
01:05:54,100;01:05:56,740;"So to pussy who throws interceptions."
01:05:56,740;01:06:00,260;"All right. So talk to me about this game."
01:06:00,260;01:06:02,220;"I think we've been dancing around a long enough."
01:06:02,220;01:06:03,900;"Give it a little Lombardi score."
01:06:03,900;01:06:04,900;"Mm."
01:06:04,900;01:06:09,460;"Out of six, I would say a solid four."
01:06:09,460;01:06:14,020;"Season opener against the it's a rematch of the AFC Championship"
01:06:14,020;01:06:19,940;"game again, just like it was in 2002 against the Steelers. Back and forth game, a lot of,"
01:06:19,940;01:06:24,420;"a lot of new faces that are going to be playing a big part. You get to see Corey Dillon,"
01:06:24,420;01:06:30,500;"who is, and also Vince Wilfork, you could say this about him too, surprisingly a lot on his"
01:06:30,500;01:06:35,620;"feet for how big they are. He chased on that running back in that play. Those boys can dance"
01:06:35,620;01:06:40,580;"though. Like Corey Dillon had one run where he like, he juked two guys out of their shoes and"
01:06:40,580;01:06:42,660;"and then lower his shoulder, ran over the third guy."
01:06:42,660;01:06:45,100;"Like, I didn't know he could shoot too."
01:06:45,100;01:06:45,940;"That's almost unfair."
01:06:45,940;01:06:48,260;"I'm four in an AC Chimchi game."
01:06:48,260;01:06:51,340;"This game is one of those sneaky great launches."
01:06:51,340;01:06:52,420;"Yeah, exactly."
01:06:52,420;01:06:55,460;"Because his rematch, I AC Chimchi game."
01:06:55,460;01:06:59,300;"So it was a ton of hype around it and it lived up, came down to the last second field goal."
01:06:59,300;01:07:00,820;"Real back and forth."
01:07:00,820;01:07:02,420;"It seemed a little bit like that."
01:07:02,420;01:07:07,100;"Colts at the Colts game, where Willie makes that stop in the goal line."
01:07:07,100;01:07:07,780;"Yeah."
01:07:07,780;01:07:08,920;"- A similar game."
01:07:08,920;01:07:13,920;"- 'Cause there was a lot of similar storylines too"
01:07:13,920;01:07:15,640;"where the Patriots actually had trouble"
01:07:15,640;01:07:17,000;"stopping the run in this game."
01:07:17,000;01:07:20,000;"- Yeah, Adrian James was a beast in this game."
01:07:20,000;01:07:22,040;"- Yeah, I think one of the,"
01:07:22,040;01:07:26,280;"yeah, the Colts first touchdown drive"
01:07:26,280;01:07:29,600;"was just nine straight runs."
01:07:29,600;01:07:30,600;"And that's all they did was just run."
01:07:30,600;01:07:32,200;"- They're even 102 yards."
01:07:32,200;01:07:33,440;"- Yeah."
01:07:33,440;01:07:37,240;"Yeah, I think Adrian James finished like 140 something, right?"
01:07:37,240;01:07:39,940;"on 30 car, yeah, 30 caries for 142."
01:07:39,940;01:07:42,120;"And, you know, not really what you're expecting."
01:07:42,120;01:07:44,600;"And then Manning started getting his play action going."
01:07:44,600;01:07:46,640;"So now both these teams are going back and forth."
01:07:46,640;01:07:47,880;"- Yeah."
01:07:47,880;01:07:50,720;"- And it was just like answering all over the place."
01:07:50,720;01:07:54,000;"Like the pages start off with that five wide drive"
01:07:54,000;01:07:56,240;"all the way down, then they kick a field goal."
01:07:56,240;01:08:01,720;"Indianapolis gets stuffed on third and one,"
01:08:01,720;01:08:04,480;"but then there's like a defensive penalty with bullshit."
01:08:05,560;01:08:08,480;"But then yeah, Vince Wolf work stuff on the third and one too."
01:08:08,480;01:08:08,800;"Yeah."
01:08:08,800;01:08:10,720;"Oh, yeah, because they had Vince Wolf work on."
01:08:10,720;01:08:12,320;"They still had a Keith trailer."
01:08:12,320;01:08:12,840;"I think it was."
01:08:12,840;01:08:13,760;"Yeah, they had to do that."
01:08:13,760;01:08:17,520;"They went out and signed a bunch of fat boys and drafted the best fat boy draft"
01:08:17,520;01:08:18,920;"and then give up 202 yards."
01:08:18,920;01:08:20,400;"You know, they couldn't stop the fucking run."
01:08:20,400;01:08:21,000;"We need to do."
01:08:21,000;01:08:21,720;"Yeah."
01:08:21,720;01:08:24,800;"But they were still doing"
01:08:24,800;01:08:30,040;"red zone turnovers in this game, the Patriots defense and the Colts."
01:08:30,040;01:08:31,360;"Yeah."
01:08:31,360;01:08:34,760;"So there was a Bruce Key goal line interception on the Colts first."
01:08:34,760;01:08:36,760;"- Yeah, catch of the awesome catch."
01:08:36,760;01:08:38,280;"- It was like one of his typical,"
01:08:38,280;01:08:41,680;"like he's not really covering the guy across the middle."
01:08:41,680;01:08:42,760;"He just kind of like drops back"
01:08:42,760;01:08:45,520;"and kind of like is watching Manning's eyes"
01:08:45,520;01:08:47,360;"and then does that like dive to his sideways."
01:08:47,360;01:08:50,240;"Almost like he's a soccer goalkeeper"
01:08:50,240;01:08:52,720;"diving to make a stop"
01:08:52,720;01:08:54,640;"and somehow may as a catch that football."
01:08:54,640;01:08:55,720;"- You need to put that as a highlight"
01:08:55,720;01:08:56,800;"on the website and the other one."
01:08:56,800;01:08:57,640;"- Oh, it will be."
01:08:57,640;01:08:58,480;"- Yeah."
01:08:58,480;01:08:59,320;"- And sit down."
01:08:59,320;01:09:01,080;"- I've got it, I've got it cut and it's ready to go."
01:09:01,080;01:09:01,920;"- All right."
01:09:03,680;01:09:07,680;"And then, yeah, so it was just back and forth, back and forth."
01:09:07,680;01:09:10,560;"I thought in this game, one thing that stuck out to me"
01:09:10,560;01:09:12,340;"was Tom Brady's pocket presence,"
01:09:12,340;01:09:16,720;"because he's finally, it feels like growing into that,"
01:09:16,720;01:09:20,480;"because I remember watching like 2001, 2002,"
01:09:20,480;01:09:22,600;"there's some times where he just made like,"
01:09:22,600;01:09:25,280;"very unbrady like mistakes,"
01:09:25,280;01:09:28,320;"where he didn't feel pressure or he felt pressure"
01:09:28,320;01:09:30,360;"and it wasn't there, but now it's just like,"
01:09:31,440;01:09:34,480;"It seems like this is where his mastery of it started to come in."
01:09:34,480;01:09:38,520;"That just like you take for granted nowadays, just like he just,"
01:09:38,520;01:09:42,360;"he doesn't get sacked because he just knows he's able to feel that pressure in"
01:09:42,360;01:09:43,000;"this some place."
01:09:43,000;01:09:43,800;"Just like Mac Jones."
01:09:43,800;01:09:44,160;"I know."
01:09:44,160;01:09:44,880;"Yeah."
01:09:44,880;01:09:46,280;"Oh, we'll see."
01:09:46,280;01:09:49,880;"But there was like one play where the pages were backed up in their own end"
01:09:49,880;01:09:54,160;"zone after one of these red zone turnovers by the Colts."
01:09:54,160;01:09:57,200;"That one where Vince Wolford recovered was a fumble."
01:09:57,200;01:09:57,800;"Yeah."
01:09:57,800;01:10:00,840;"And it was like a third and 11 or something like that."
01:10:00,840;01:10:03,000;"And he's in his own end zone passing."
01:10:03,000;01:10:05,040;"It has to wait for the player to develop."
01:10:05,040;01:10:08,680;"And sidesteps like two rushing defenders."
01:10:08,680;01:10:10,720;"Like, cool as a cucumber."
01:10:10,720;01:10:12,000;"It has no issue doing it."
01:10:12,000;01:10:13,880;"Still keep his eyes out field."
01:10:13,880;01:10:15,800;"Then throws the perfect bomb to."
01:10:15,800;01:10:17,760;"- I think it was Gibbons that time."
01:10:17,760;01:10:20,720;"- My boy, good game."
01:10:20,720;01:10:21,560;"- Yeah."
01:10:21,560;01:10:24,800;"But there was, yeah, it was just like back and forth."
01:10:24,800;01:10:28,160;"Like the cold score touchdown on that nine straight runs."
01:10:28,160;01:10:29,200;"Brady comes right back."
01:10:29,200;01:10:30,720;"Oh, Dylan had a huge run after that"
01:10:30,720;01:10:36,300;"to answer. And then Brady throws a touch on a branch and then the Colts draw straight"
01:10:36,300;01:10:41,840;"back down with a huge play on their first play to Dallas Clark. And then Manning throws"
01:10:41,840;01:10:46,060;"a touch on Harrison and the Patriots have like, you know, less than two minutes left"
01:10:46,060;01:10:51,540;"when they drive down and managed to get a pititary field goal to end the half. So it"
01:10:51,540;01:10:55,140;"was just like back and forth the entire time. Definitely worth logic."
01:10:55,140;01:10:58,140;"- Yep, we'll get entertaining."
01:10:58,140;01:10:59,060;"- Yeah."
01:10:59,060;01:11:00,740;"And there was like some great,"
01:11:00,740;01:11:03,860;"like cults moments that I remember"
01:11:03,860;01:11:06,100;"where they would make a really great play"
01:11:06,100;01:11:08,380;"and then fuck it up the next one."
01:11:08,380;01:11:10,260;"- You know what was really missing though?"
01:11:10,260;01:11:11,100;"- What?"
01:11:11,100;01:11:12,500;"- Some solid manning face."
01:11:12,500;01:11:13,820;"- There wasn't a ton."
01:11:13,820;01:11:15,020;"You were absolutely right."
01:11:15,020;01:11:17,060;"There was the time where after that first"
01:11:17,060;01:11:18,860;"interception he threw on the goal line,"
01:11:18,860;01:11:20,420;"on the first drive,"
01:11:20,420;01:11:21,620;"the commentary was talking about like,"
01:11:21,620;01:11:23,580;"he went to the sideline and didn't take his helmet off."
01:11:23,580;01:11:25,180;"just stood their way and go back in."
01:11:25,180;01:11:27,060;"Like I love it."
01:11:27,060;01:11:29,260;"So it's such like a petulant child thing to do."
01:11:29,260;01:11:29,780;"It's great."
01:11:29,780;01:11:40,100;"The, and then the fourth quarter alone roller coaster, it was all over the place."
01:11:40,100;01:11:46,020;"They just go into the fourth quarter up 27, 17 up up 10, which is never safe."
01:11:46,020;01:11:47,020;"You know that with Manning."
01:11:47,020;01:11:47,540;"Right."
01:11:47,540;01:11:48,060;"And that's the thing."
01:11:48,060;01:11:53,540;"And this is that fear that I was actually talking to mom recently and she was listening"
01:11:53,540;01:11:58,220;"to that, that Colts game that we talked about last time. And she's like, that, that's the"
01:11:58,220;01:12:04,860;"piece that I remember is the feeling of it's not enough yet. Like, yes, we're up 10 and"
01:12:04,860;01:12:09,460;"we're going to the full court, but we need to be up more because the Peyton Manning was"
01:12:09,460;01:12:11,460;"a scary offense. And it,"
01:12:11,460;01:12:17,700;"Let Tom Brady has struck that fear in many people's hearts as well. I think so too. It's"
01:12:17,700;01:12:21,300;"similar to like the way you were feeling in the AFC Championship game against Patrick"
01:12:21,300;01:12:26,100;"my homes, right? Yeah. It's like, yeah, they didn't go on the first half. And that's great. But"
01:12:26,100;01:12:32,260;"like, this isn't gonna last. Yeah, and it fucking did. They put up 31. Right. And this was very"
01:12:32,260;01:12:39,220;"similar. Like you're up 10, you're going into the fourth quarter. Didn't feel safe. And that this"
01:12:39,220;01:12:45,460;"is where you started to see the, the soft defensive holding calls that, you know, the leagues just"
01:12:45,460;01:12:46,720;"just trying to prove to the Colts."
01:12:46,720;01:12:48,460;"So yeah, look, I'm calling it for real now."
01:12:48,460;01:12:49,460;"- Okay, buddy."
01:12:49,460;01:12:51,580;"- I don't know."
01:12:51,580;01:12:53,420;"- So that first drive for--"
01:12:53,420;01:12:54,940;"- I already do it in reception."
01:12:54,940;01:12:58,060;"The on-branch muffs of punt."
01:12:58,060;01:13:00,620;"- Well, wait, before that, it uncovered."
01:13:00,620;01:13:01,860;"- Before that though, before that,"
01:13:01,860;01:13:06,140;"like at the beginning of the fourth quarter,"
01:13:06,140;01:13:09,100;"the Colts score a touchdown, so it's 27-24."
01:13:09,100;01:13:10,700;"So it's a three-point game now, yeah."
01:13:10,700;01:13:13,860;"And then the next drive, Brady throws his first interception"
01:13:13,860;01:13:16,640;"in Jesus, I have it here."
01:13:16,640;01:13:17,820;"88."
01:13:17,820;01:13:20,420;"So that yeah, it's not loading."
01:13:20,420;01:13:24,500;"Um, yeah, it was like, uh, I think it was two hundred eight."
01:13:24,500;01:13:24,840;"Yeah."
01:13:24,840;01:13:30,560;"Because he came into the game with the most consecutive passes at home without an interception at two sixty three."
01:13:30,560;01:13:34,540;"Ty with Mark Bernal, which might be why Bernal is such a baby about things."
01:13:34,540;01:13:36,060;"Yeah."
01:13:36,060;01:13:37,020;"End of two 88."
01:13:37,020;01:13:37,700;"Yeah, there it is."
01:13:37,700;01:13:43,460;"In the fourth quarter, right after the culture score touched down to bring it within three."
01:13:43,460;01:13:52,540;"And then Patriots defense holds and the Colts have to punt, but because Troy Brown is an"
01:13:52,540;01:13:58,660;"actor for this game, as was Kevin Falk, by the way, which I think Madden was hypothesizing"
01:13:58,660;01:14:03,860;"that's why the Patriots kept going like five wide for a drive was basically just give Corey"
01:14:03,860;01:14:08,460;"Dillon a spell because they didn't have another running back."
01:14:08,460;01:14:12,380;"It was Corey Dillon and Patrick passed the full back and that was it."
01:14:12,380;01:14:15,220;"So it makes sense."
01:14:15,220;01:14:16,740;"So no Troy Brown."
01:14:16,740;01:14:20,000;"So Dion branches back there, returning puns,"
01:14:20,000;01:14:21,140;"and he muffs it."
01:14:21,140;01:14:24,020;"And the culture cover at the past 33."
01:14:24,020;01:14:27,220;"And then a couple of plays later,"
01:14:27,220;01:14:29,180;"it's not like Samuel's called for past interference"
01:14:29,180;01:14:30,140;"in the end zone."
01:14:30,140;01:14:31,980;"Clear past interference, yes?"
01:14:31,980;01:14:34,020;"Yeah, he didn't look bad for the ball."
01:14:34,020;01:14:34,500;"What?"
01:14:34,500;01:14:36,260;"Was that Andy?"
01:14:36,260;01:14:38,940;"It was-- was that a clear past interference?"
01:14:38,940;01:14:40,340;"I don't think it was clear, but I understand why."
01:14:40,340;01:14:41,940;"What do you mean?"
01:14:41,940;01:14:45,700;"He like he like had his hand holding down the other guy's arm."
01:14:45,700;01:14:47,220;"No, he had his hand in his face."
01:14:47,220;01:14:49,460;"It was like he was looking back for the ball."
01:14:49,460;01:14:51,060;"He looked back eventually."
01:14:51,060;01:14:51,700;"Eventually."
01:14:51,700;01:14:54,500;"After the ball hit the guy in the face because he held down his arm."
01:14:54,500;01:14:55,500;"OK."
01:14:55,500;01:14:58,220;"But you're ridiculous."
01:14:58,220;01:14:59,780;"You're ridiculous."
01:14:59,780;01:15:01,300;"Thought you were a football team."
01:15:01,300;01:15:03,900;"The past interference, the end zone, past first, the end zone."
01:15:03,900;01:15:07,140;"And this is the point where I paused the game and went back to pro football"
01:15:07,140;01:15:09,540;"reference and said, what was the score of this game?"
01:15:09,540;01:15:11,740;"Oh, it ends 2724."
01:15:11,740;01:15:16,380;"Even though the Colts have it first and goal from the one with like five minutes left."
01:15:16,380;01:15:17,260;"Mm hmm."
01:15:17,260;01:15:18,580;"What the fuck is going on?"
01:15:18,580;01:15:19,980;"Literally the next play."
01:15:19,980;01:15:20,580;"This is what I'm talking about."
01:15:20,580;01:15:21,580;"Literally the next play."
01:15:21,580;01:15:28,580;"Um, hand off to Edgar and James of the middle and he gets absolutely walloped by."
01:15:28,580;01:15:35,340;"I think it was Eugene and his Wilfork and the ball pops straight down and Wilfork just falls on it."
01:15:35,340;01:15:38,060;"Eugene set him up and our Wilfork set him up."
01:15:38,060;01:15:39,340;"Eugene came hammer."
01:15:39,340;01:15:42,240;"- I had some bigots in this game too."
01:15:42,240;01:15:43,080;"- He did."
01:15:43,080;01:15:44,620;"- That guy was a hitter."
01:15:44,620;01:15:46,980;"Rewatching all these games."
01:15:46,980;01:15:49,340;"I can see why Greg body Eugene Wilson jersey."
01:15:49,340;01:15:51,980;"- He was laying a lumber."
01:15:51,980;01:15:54,540;"- I mean, Eugene, with that whole defensive backfield,"
01:15:54,540;01:15:59,300;"definitely learn from the king of heavy hits."
01:15:59,300;01:16:01,740;"And they're even talking about Ronny Harrison about"
01:16:01,740;01:16:05,820;"the broadcast tried to find out"
01:16:05,820;01:16:10,040;"if he was the most fined person in the league,"
01:16:10,040;01:16:12,620;"and the league basically wouldn't give out those numbers."
01:16:12,620;01:16:13,740;"Like we're not gonna tell you."
01:16:13,740;01:16:15,200;"- Which means yes."
01:16:15,200;01:16:17,300;"- Yeah, and so they tried to look it up."
01:16:17,300;01:16:18,200;"And he was like,"
01:16:18,200;01:16:23,780;"it was like over $100,000 worth of fines."
01:16:23,780;01:16:25,140;"And they asked him about, he's like,"
01:16:25,140;01:16:26,980;"""I don't give a fuck."
01:16:26,980;01:16:28,020;"""I'm just gonna play my game."
01:16:28,020;01:16:30,540;"""And if they don't like it, they can go screw."""
01:16:33,340;01:16:38,340;"like that's so that was Michelle Tafoya basically translating what was obviously a"
01:16:38,340;01:16:45,860;"um, uh, a swear laced, um, actual comment from"
01:16:45,860;01:16:50,140;"Ronnie. Yeah. You're like, he just, he just doesn't even care. I'm like,"
01:16:50,140;01:16:54,580;"that's not what he said. He doesn't give a fuck. But yeah, and,"
01:16:54,580;01:16:59,500;"and I think that set the tone for this defense, because they all came out"
01:16:59,500;01:17:03,580;"hitting like that. But there, there was definitely a few times where teammates had to pull"
01:17:03,580;01:17:10,180;"Rodney Harrison off of a referee, like drag him away. But yeah, so the pages get the ball"
01:17:10,180;01:17:18,140;"on the one yard line. This is where Brady gets that big third down pass from the end zone."
01:17:18,140;01:17:23,500;"But they don't do anything with it. Not even that. They almost fuck it up. Yeah. Yeah,"
01:17:23,500;01:17:28,060;"Brady gets stripped. My goals call time out with like two minutes and eight seconds left."
01:17:28,060;01:17:32,620;"Yeah. So like you run the ball, right? Or take it down to eight seconds or whatever."
01:17:32,620;01:17:37,460;"Now we try to pass play. Yeah. They get at least off the edge, strip sack Brady."
01:17:37,460;01:17:39,540;"And Corey, don't fall on the phone."
01:17:39,540;01:17:44,380;"He jumps on it right at the two man. Like luckily, since the ball's got them bouncing"
01:17:44,380;01:17:48,460;"around back there and everyone's just run around their hair on fire, got all the way"
01:17:48,460;01:17:51,940;"to two minute warning, but it could have been a disaster because the cold said no time"
01:17:51,940;01:17:57,620;"amounts to right. Yeah, it was nuts. And then so the pages"
01:17:57,620;01:18:01,940;"put in the starts their own 35 and literally first play this"
01:18:01,940;01:18:05,980;"huge play to Stokely. So I'm like, yeah, right down the"
01:18:05,980;01:18:08,860;"center of the field, he's got a free run. It runs all the"
01:18:08,860;01:18:12,900;"way down to the 18 yard line. So it's first in 10 from the"
01:18:12,900;01:18:17,300;"18 with still like over like probably about a minute and a"
01:18:17,300;01:18:19,400;"half left, I think, give or take."
01:18:19,400;01:18:23,000;"Um, and they basically can have a couple shots at the end zone."
01:18:23,000;01:18:26,380;"If they don't do it, they can still kick the field goal with a field goal kicker."
01:18:26,380;01:18:32,300;"Who did not miss a field goal the entire last season, two thousand, two."
01:18:32,300;01:18:32,860;"Yeah."
01:18:32,860;01:18:37,300;"To be fair, the commentators jinxed the fuck out of it."
01:18:37,300;01:18:41,480;"And they probably been jinxed in forever, but they've been jinxed in this dude."
01:18:41,480;01:18:43,240;"Oh, he hasn't missed."
01:18:43,240;01:18:45,080;"Oh, he went a whole season without me."
01:18:45,080;01:18:45,820;"Oh, he's never."
01:18:46,380;01:18:53,540;"Also never misses. Yeah, and also there will Madden at one point was like oh, you know, they can kick a field goal here with a"
01:18:53,540;01:18:58,180;"A guy who hasn't missed but his last couple of field goals have looked a bit like ducks"
01:18:58,180;01:19:00,740;"Like they've been ugly, but they've been getting through"
01:19:00,740;01:19:03,060;"uh-huh and"
01:19:03,060;01:19:07,140;"So what happens is yes ball at the 18?"
01:19:07,140;01:19:09,420;"Colts"
01:19:09,420;01:19:11,980;"a couple of plays, but then on third down,"
01:19:11,980;01:19:14,700;"Willie McGinnis comes screaming off the edge"
01:19:14,700;01:19:17,020;"and sacks Peyton Manning for,"
01:19:17,020;01:19:19,140;"what felt like a very Drew Bludsoe ask play?"
01:19:19,140;01:19:21,700;"- No, I have a way better comp."
01:19:21,700;01:19:23,420;"It looks actually very, very similar"
01:19:23,420;01:19:25,820;"to the high tower Atlanta."
01:19:25,820;01:19:29,020;"Minus the back in the play because he comes off the same edge."
01:19:29,020;01:19:29,860;"- Yep, that's true."
01:19:29,860;01:19:31,940;"- And he kind of like, he starts out wide,"
01:19:31,940;01:19:34,220;"takes like a little shuffle step in right before the snap,"
01:19:34,220;01:19:35,860;"comes right off the end."
01:19:35,860;01:19:37,460;"And Manning doesn't really see him"
01:19:37,460;01:19:39,220;"and it's the same sort of situation, right?"
01:19:39,220;01:19:40,980;"the Atlanta was in field goal range"
01:19:40,980;01:19:42,700;"and that pushed him out the punt range."
01:19:42,700;01:19:45,900;"And they were in easy, easy chip shop range."
01:19:45,900;01:19:47,980;"And then he took a big ass sack and now it's like,"
01:19:47,980;01:19:49,260;"ooh, I don't know, it's probably--"
01:19:49,260;01:19:50,340;"- Now it's a 48 yarder."
01:19:50,340;01:19:52,700;"- Yeah, now it's 48 and like, ooh, that's gonna be tougher."
01:19:52,700;01:19:53,540;"- Yeah."
01:19:53,540;01:19:56,220;"- And Willie, a row graded man in here."
01:19:56,220;01:19:57,380;"- Oh my God."
01:19:57,380;01:19:58,580;"- Yeah."
01:19:58,580;01:20:00,220;"- It might even be an impelty this day in here."
01:20:00,220;01:20:01,540;"He got a little high."
01:20:01,540;01:20:03,220;"- Yeah, I don't know."
01:20:03,220;01:20:04,740;"- His clothes speeding."
01:20:04,740;01:20:06,460;"Willie's so underrated because--"
01:20:06,460;01:20:07,540;"- Oh my God, yes."
01:20:07,540;01:20:09,980;"His closing speed on Saks is awesome."
01:20:09,980;01:20:11,660;"He's such a good edge setter."
01:20:11,660;01:20:13,820;"He can cover guys coming out the backfield."
01:20:13,820;01:20:16,100;"He could do it all and Madden."
01:20:16,100;01:20:17,700;"Now the credit to him was just like, dude,"
01:20:17,700;01:20:18,700;"this is the guy you want."
01:20:18,700;01:20:20,220;"He can do everything."
01:20:20,220;01:20:21,980;"- Exactly, exactly."
01:20:21,980;01:20:24,900;"And it was, it was just like, just off the edge,"
01:20:24,900;01:20:28,820;"exact untouched off the edge and just Manning was waiting."
01:20:28,820;01:20:30,140;"It was like looking off to his left"
01:20:30,140;01:20:32,060;"so he didn't even see him coming from his right."
01:20:32,060;01:20:33,260;"Until right at the last second,"
01:20:33,260;01:20:34,660;"he just managed to tuck the ball down."
01:20:34,660;01:20:36,980;"- On the replay, you can see Madden,"
01:20:36,980;01:20:39,420;"and just like catch up the corner of his eye and be like,"
01:20:39,420;01:20:40,420;"""Ah, shit!"""
01:20:40,420;01:20:41,260;"(laughing)"
01:20:41,260;01:20:44,060;"I'm like, ""This elbow is shoulder comes up to his ear."""
01:20:44,060;01:20:45,060;"(laughing)"
01:20:45,060;01:20:46,260;"- Just brace his grip back"
01:20:46,260;01:20:48,420;"'cause you know there's nothing else he can do."
01:20:48,420;01:20:51,340;"So this is the part that I loved"
01:20:51,340;01:20:53,140;"and I'm just gonna call it out."
01:20:53,140;01:20:54,820;"This is my best for this game."
01:20:54,820;01:20:59,500;"Is apparently, and this is another thing"
01:20:59,500;01:21:01,460;"that was like people talked about it"
01:21:01,460;01:21:04,060;"but I couldn't actually find the specific of it."
01:21:04,060;01:21:06,780;"But apparently Mike Vanderjakt"
01:21:06,780;01:21:10,140;"came out onto the field for this field goal."
01:21:10,140;01:21:11,780;"And I have the quote here."
01:21:11,780;01:21:13,280;"Where is it?"
01:21:13,280;01:21:15,140;"Where is it?"
01:21:15,140;01:21:17,940;"So he hadn't missed an attempt all last season."
01:21:17,940;01:21:20,300;"And the quote is, this is from ESPN."
01:21:20,300;01:21:22,500;"""So confident with Colt's kicker Mike Vanderjack"
01:21:22,500;01:21:25,460;"that he would make a tying 48 yard field goal with 24 seconds"
01:21:25,460;01:21:28,340;"remaining in Thursday night's league opener against the Patriots"
01:21:28,340;01:21:29,500;"at Gillette Stadium."
01:21:29,500;01:21:30,700;"And why wouldn't he be?"
01:21:30,700;01:21:33,780;"He had only connected on a league record 42 in a row."
01:21:33,780;01:21:35,500;"That he turned towards the Patriots sideline"
01:21:35,500;01:21:38,660;"before setting up for the kick and rubbed a few of his fingers together."
01:21:38,660;01:21:42,220;"For those who don't speak sign language, that's universal for money."
01:21:42,220;01:21:47,740;"So he turned to the Patriot sideline and did the money thing with his hands."
01:21:47,740;01:21:52,180;"Like a money and then turns around and fucking shacks the field go to lose the game."
01:21:52,180;01:21:53,700;"It was not a good kick."
01:21:53,700;01:21:55,740;"It seemed like it was all in danger jack too."
01:21:55,740;01:21:56,740;"He just didn't hit it right."
01:21:56,740;01:21:57,500;"It was bad."
01:21:57,500;01:21:57,740;"Yeah."
01:21:57,740;01:21:59,620;"It's just fucking like it came out."
01:21:59,620;01:22:02,540;"It looked like it came off clean and then it's kind of like knuckled off to the right."
01:22:02,540;01:22:04,140;"It didn't mean caught clean."
01:22:04,140;01:22:07,140;"It didn't come out like you see kick spinning, right?"
01:22:07,140;01:22:08,140;"Yeah."
01:22:08,140;01:22:09,140;"Yeah."
01:22:09,140;01:22:11,940;"Ooh, that's a good, this kind of like a weird like off kilter spin to it."
01:22:11,940;01:22:12,940;"It did."
01:22:12,940;01:22:15,940;"And it was, it was a thing of beauty."
01:22:15,940;01:22:17,940;"It just comes out."
01:22:17,940;01:22:19,940;"It does the money thing."
01:22:19,940;01:22:23,940;"That's your end for this."
01:22:23,940;01:22:25,740;"That feels like a Greg Brown move."
01:22:25,740;01:22:26,740;"Oh, for sure."
01:22:26,740;01:22:32,780;"You're like Kobe and then shoes and then just like misses the table playing beer pog as"
01:22:32,780;01:22:39,860;"you know, that's such a Greg Brown thing. So I love that. That was, that was my best."
01:22:39,860;01:22:48,300;"What do you got for worst? Oh, all right. My worst was ESPN's new thing that they tried"
01:22:48,300;01:22:53,900;"to roll out here or ABC, wherever the fuck it was. It was called max stats, which is"
01:22:53,900;01:22:57,620;"kind of similar. It was like the precursor of what you see now where they have like,"
01:22:57,620;01:23:02,620;"Oh, this ball traveled like seven yards in the air and the Jen Stacks."
01:23:02,620;01:23:03,380;"Yeah, exactly."
01:23:03,380;01:23:07,140;"The running back got up to 32.7 miles an hour top speed."
01:23:07,140;01:23:10,940;"This one was, uh, how fast was a ball thrown?"
01:23:10,940;01:23:14,060;"And it was so they, they use one of Manning's touchdown is very"
01:23:14,060;01:23:18,340;"gundered and he's like that ball Manning's touchdown was 55 miles an hour."
01:23:18,340;01:23:21,180;"And then like that part, fine."
01:23:21,180;01:23:24,860;"Great. Like, but we're going to translate that into a baseball pitch."
01:23:25,020;01:23:26,900;"If that were a baseball, it would have,"
01:23:26,900;01:23:30,020;"it would have been an 83 mile an hour pitch."
01:23:30,020;01:23:32,780;"And John Matt was like, that's not very fast."
01:23:32,780;01:23:36,700;"- Yeah, I would have matched that out of the stadium."
01:23:36,700;01:23:37,980;"- That was a fastball."
01:23:37,980;01:23:41,700;"- The meatball just like in Seattle."
01:23:41,700;01:23:43,180;"- Maybe they'll throw it faster."
01:23:43,180;01:23:45,780;"- Tom Brady definitely will."
01:23:45,780;01:23:47,580;"Like, oh, Jesus."
01:23:47,580;01:23:48,660;"- Yeah, pretty much."
01:23:48,660;01:23:50,340;"- Not great."
01:23:50,340;01:23:52,460;"So yeah, that was probably my worst."
01:23:52,460;01:23:53,300;"What about you?"
01:23:53,300;01:24:01,300;"- You know, I have a worst and the worst is it keeps carrying over from last year."
01:24:01,300;01:24:02,300;"- Oh boy."
01:24:02,300;01:24:06,300;"- We still want the Super Bowl despite the absolute atrocious run zone offense."
01:24:06,300;01:24:07,300;"- Yeah."
01:24:07,300;01:24:09,300;"- The first time they get inside, they get inside the Colts 10."
01:24:09,300;01:24:16,300;"They're in their first single from the 10 and our fourth in goal, the field goal from the"
01:24:16,300;01:24:17,300;"11."
01:24:17,300;01:24:18,300;"- Yeah."
01:24:18,300;01:24:23,340;"Because like they throw a four yard pass and then Tom Brady takes a delay again."
01:24:23,340;01:24:27,900;"Right. Exactly. God. Just try a killer, you know?"
01:24:27,900;01:24:33,900;"Brutal. Absolutely brutal. I'm a best. Yeah, I got two. Okay."
01:24:33,900;01:24:41,260;"I'll give you a light one. Did you see the Tom Brady? What's your favorite this and that?"
01:24:41,260;01:24:45,740;"I have it. I have the clip. I was just gonna play that actually. Yeah. Let me let's hit this."
01:24:45,740;01:24:47,180;"Let me fire this up real quick."
01:24:47,180;01:24:52,940;"My best part is you can't really see it because it was a podcast, but his beard."
01:24:52,940;01:24:56,060;"Yeah, I'll see if I can post this."
01:24:56,060;01:24:57,340;"You're did Brady."
01:24:57,340;01:24:59,100;"Yeah, it was like five o'clock shadow."
01:24:59,100;01:25:01,660;"No, it's like a legitimate beard."
01:25:01,660;01:25:05,260;"He definitely did this in the offsies because this is like a, this is the most beard."
01:25:05,260;01:25:08,380;"I don't even know Brady could grow this sort of facial hair."
01:25:08,380;01:25:09,420;"I think that's fair."
01:25:09,420;01:25:10,220;"So here it is."
01:25:10,220;01:25:13,900;"This is like a, just like a little one off they did it."
01:25:13,900;01:25:17,180;"It comes with a Paul camp, a regular jersey, and like a..."
01:25:17,180;01:25:20,380;"The one word that defines me is persistence."
01:25:20,380;01:25:22,540;"I'd love to meet Bill Gates."
01:25:22,540;01:25:24,700;"My favorite food is chicken wings."
01:25:24,700;01:25:28,380;"Teriyaki, I am a horrible, horrible cook."
01:25:28,380;01:25:30,380;"My favorite movie line from Scarface."
01:25:30,380;01:25:31,900;"They're gonna not a little bad guy,"
01:25:31,900;01:25:34,060;"because you ain't gonna see a bad guy like this again."
01:25:34,060;01:25:39,100;"That laugh."
01:25:39,100;01:25:39,980;"So bad."
01:25:39,980;01:25:41,500;"The beard."
01:25:42,140;01:25:44,300;"Yeah, no, the the laugh here we go again"
01:25:44,300;01:25:48,780;"So awkward"
01:25:48,780;01:25:55,900;"Which say me do those scarface line again scarface like a nice little bad guy because you aren't going to see a bad guy like this again"
01:25:55,900;01:26:00,460;"So"
01:26:00,460;01:26:02,780;"Such a goober"
01:26:02,780;01:26:06,460;"I mean like because like right now he has like a very"
01:26:06,460;01:26:11,900;"Intentionally crafted public image. Yes"
01:26:11,900;01:26:15,900;"And that is entirely contrast that ain't it? Yeah"
01:26:15,900;01:26:21,900;"Stuck in he's got this the biggest beard of every scene Brady ever have that's true. Yeah"
01:26:21,900;01:26:28,580;"But and like and in between and his hat. He's got like a baseball cap on but it's like it's just slightly crooked too"
01:26:28,580;01:26:33,800;"So he's trying to do like that cool thing where people like how you cool turn their caps a little bit sideways"
01:26:33,800;01:26:34,740;"But he didn't do it enough"
01:26:34,740;01:26:36,820;"So it's just like your your has on straight dude"
01:26:36,820;01:26:41,140;"And then like in between each of those countries you can't see because it's an audio medium"
01:26:41,500;01:26:47,160;"But they like cut to like a picture of like a video of him on a billboard or something and he's doing finger guns"
01:26:47,160;01:26:50,460;"stupid fucking smile"
01:26:50,460;01:26:54,220;"It's stuff. I have to post that because it's just at the best part is how"
01:26:54,220;01:27:01,540;"Dicotomous it is like where he's currently at you know. Yeah. Yeah. What's your favorite food chicken wings?"
01:27:01,540;01:27:04,220;"Teriyaki"
01:27:04,220;01:27:10,600;"Terrible chicken winged nice 10 years. Yeah. Oh my god"
01:27:11,140;01:27:14,220;"And then the other, I have another clip since we're here."
01:27:14,220;01:27:19,700;"And it was before the game, who was the sideline reporter?"
01:27:19,700;01:27:20,460;"I already said it."
01:27:20,460;01:27:26,180;"Michelle Tafoya was talking to Bill Balladchek about the jamming the wide receivers and the"
01:27:26,180;01:27:27,180;"new role."
01:27:27,180;01:27:31,980;"Al, you could say Bill Bellachik's passion for football is reflected in his friend John"
01:27:31,980;01:27:34,380;"Bon Jovi's song It's My Life."
01:27:34,380;01:27:39,660;"The son of a college coach began his own career in pro football 30 years ago, now entering"
01:27:39,660;01:27:44,360;"the prime of his NFL life, the 52-year-old Belichick tries to become the first coach"
01:27:44,360;01:27:48,040;"ever to win three Super Bowls in a four-year span."
01:27:48,040;01:27:50,200;"I'm joined now by Bill Belichick, coach."
01:27:50,200;01:27:54,360;"How is this team different from the one that tried to defeat as Super Bowl champions two"
01:27:54,360;01:27:55,360;"years ago?"
01:27:55,360;01:28:00,400;"Well, I think we're a little younger, number one, and a little more experienced a quarterback,"
01:28:00,400;01:28:04,880;"but a lot of some of the same things are there, some of the same guys there, but there's some"
01:28:04,880;01:28:05,880;"new ones too."
01:28:05,880;01:28:06,880;"But I think we're a little younger."
01:28:06,880;01:28:11,880;"A lot has been made in the preseason of the rules emphasis on illegal defense."
01:28:11,880;01:28:18,880;"Many people think that might be a result of the way your defensive backs play the coach wide receivers in the AFC Championship game."
01:28:18,880;01:28:21,880;"How will the rules emphasis affect the way your defense plays?"
01:28:21,880;01:28:25,880;"Well, there's been no change in the rules. It's the same rule."
01:28:25,880;01:28:28,880;"You can't jam them after five yards and you're okay before five."
01:28:28,880;01:28:31,880;"So, you know, that's the way we coach to be four. That's the way we coach to be now."
01:28:31,880;01:28:32,880;"Coach, thanks for the luck."
01:28:32,880;01:28:34,880;"Okay, thanks for showing."
01:28:34,880;01:28:37,200;"(laughing)"
01:28:37,200;01:28:38,680;"- How's Naughty's head?"
01:28:38,680;01:28:41,160;"- He's just the fucking master class"
01:28:41,160;01:28:45,400;"that not answering a question, and it's perfect."
01:28:45,400;01:28:48,440;"- Are you gonna hear my best best?"
01:28:48,440;01:28:49,880;"- Yeah, give me your best best."
01:28:49,880;01:28:51,240;"- I'm surprised you didn't bring us up."
01:28:51,240;01:28:54,120;"There is the stat where Patriots haven't had"
01:28:54,120;01:28:59,120;"more than four yards per carry in a season for 18 years."
01:28:59,120;01:29:02,840;"I mean, that's included in 2003 season."
01:29:02,840;01:29:03,840;"I don't know how it goes."
01:29:03,840;01:29:05,840;"It's 2003 minus 18 andy."
01:29:05,840;01:29:07,640;"- Yeah, it's a long time."
01:29:07,640;01:29:09,640;"- It's a '76, I don't know."
01:29:09,640;01:29:11,480;"- I like that, yeah, in the '70s."
01:29:11,480;01:29:14,720;"- Back when the Patriots rushed for 2000 yards."
01:29:14,720;01:29:15,960;"- We get Corey Dillon."
01:29:15,960;01:29:17,920;"What do you think we got this year?"
01:29:17,920;01:29:20,240;"- I think it's probably over four years."
01:29:20,240;01:29:21,400;"- 4.1, baby."
01:29:21,400;01:29:23,600;"- Oh baby, just got there."
01:29:23,600;01:29:26,960;"- Yeah, Corey Dillon, I mean, again,"
01:29:26,960;01:29:31,280;"people under, you know, value his, you know,"
01:29:31,280;01:29:35,680;"value to this team. And he's awesome and changing that whole running game. And, you know, Aaron"
01:29:35,680;01:29:40,640;"Thon Smith was just, they just kind of got by with them last year. Or Gordon Dillon adds"
01:29:40,640;01:29:45,300;"a whole new dimension as offense. There's a play where he gets a path protection thing"
01:29:45,300;01:29:49,640;"too. And John Madden's calling this out where Gordon Dillon gets this guy coming off the"
01:29:49,640;01:29:54,200;"edge. He's free. They run a stunt and he gets the dude, cuts him under and by Kuggan"
01:29:54,200;01:29:57,800;"Munder, he gets the guy coming around him too. So he gets a two for one. Yeah, he's doing"
01:29:57,800;01:30:00,440;"Corey Dillon on that and Tom very straight on the play."
01:30:00,440;01:30:02,200;"So that was a great goal."
01:30:02,200;01:30:04,640;"Corey Dillon's impact on the team"
01:30:04,640;01:30:09,440;"felt A right off game one and B all year."
01:30:09,440;01:30:10,280;"- Yeah."
01:30:10,280;01:30:12,120;"- For the first time in 18 years."
01:30:12,120;01:30:12,960;"- Yeah."
01:30:12,960;01:30:14,560;"Also, if we're gonna talk about stuff"
01:30:14,560;01:30:16,720;"that I thought you would bring up so I didn't,"
01:30:16,720;01:30:20,560;"the Patriots have a new punter."
01:30:20,560;01:30:23,280;"Didn't even notice."
01:30:23,280;01:30:24,720;"No more Ken Walter, babe."
01:30:24,720;01:30:27,600;"It's Josh Miller from Pittsburgh."
01:30:27,600;01:30:31,060;"And he hit his first punt like 58 yards in the crack game,"
01:30:31,060;01:30:33,300;"was standing, oh, but then I got called back for holding."
01:30:33,300;01:30:35,860;"So they had to do it again."
01:30:35,860;01:30:39,180;"The fact that didn't notice means that's a huge improvement."
01:30:39,180;01:30:39,840;"Good thing."
01:30:39,840;01:30:40,340;"Yeah."
01:30:40,340;01:30:42,780;"Oh, here's another worst."
01:30:42,780;01:30:47,180;"The reason Kevin Falk wasn't there was because his mom had passed away recently"
01:30:47,180;01:30:49,420;"and so he had taken time off to deal with that."
01:30:49,420;01:30:51,340;"So hopefully we'll see him back."
01:30:51,340;01:30:51,900;"And where am I?"
01:30:51,900;01:30:55,520;"My Kevin Falk Jersey for for him."
01:30:55,520;01:30:56,660;"I remember it's of his mom."
01:30:57,020;01:30:59,580;"What a good guy Andy hell yeah, you got to do it man."
01:30:59,580;01:31:01,700;"Um, all right."
01:31:01,700;01:31:04,460;"Oh, since Greg laughs, should we do best words for him?"
01:31:04,460;01:31:10,220;"I mean, Greg's worst is tie law because man, just can't say healthy."
01:31:10,220;01:31:14,220;"And it's just like on and off the field and he got beat for the, uh, the last touchdown"
01:31:14,220;01:31:15,860;"by Brandon fucking Stokely."
01:31:15,860;01:31:16,540;"Yeah."
01:31:16,540;01:31:17,580;"Just fucking."
01:31:17,580;01:31:17,940;"Yeah."
01:31:17,940;01:31:19,660;"Greg would never say that's his worst, but okay."
01:31:19,660;01:31:21,140;"Well, we're saying it for him."
01:31:21,140;01:31:22,380;"That's why because he's not here."
01:31:22,780;01:31:29,540;"And Greg's best is Bill Belichick coming out after half time saying he's unhappy"
01:31:29,540;01:31:32,900;"with the play in the first half, but he's not making any adjustments."
01:31:32,900;01:31:35,740;"It's like the team's just got to fucking play better."
01:31:35,740;01:31:37,780;"I don't know."
01:31:37,780;01:31:38,620;"Be better."
01:31:38,620;01:31:39,060;"Yeah."
01:31:39,060;01:31:43,660;"Hey, you know, we're going to change up not fucking sucking this half."
01:31:43,660;01:31:44,740;"How about that?"
01:31:44,740;01:31:45,660;"Go out and do your job."
01:31:45,660;01:31:46,740;"Like I thought you were going to."
01:31:46,740;01:31:49,740;"Mommy."
01:31:49,740;01:31:51,020;"Oh, beautiful."
01:31:52,100;01:31:54,700;"All right, I think that pretty much covers this game."
01:31:54,700;01:31:57,540;"We've covered the fucking game of tonight, I think."
01:31:57,540;01:32:00,820;"So don't forget."
01:32:00,820;01:32:03,980;"Post a review of the podcast."
01:32:03,980;01:32:05,340;"It can be good."
01:32:05,340;01:32:05,860;"It can be bad."
01:32:05,860;01:32:06,740;"We don't really care."
01:32:06,740;01:32:07,860;"We just want some feedback."
01:32:07,860;01:32:14,740;"And that lent you in the running for a subscription to the athletic year long."
01:32:14,740;01:32:18,740;"Yeah, but don't forget to text the hotline to let us know that it's you."
01:32:18,740;01:32:22,060;"Otherwise, we won't be able to reach out to you and let you know you want."
01:32:22,060;01:32:29,060;"So I would say mom doesn't count, but she's not a big online review lady."
01:32:29,060;01:32:32,760;"Yeah, I don't think she, I mean, if she can figure out how to relieve her, leave her"
01:32:32,760;01:32:34,560;"review than she is at this point."
01:32:34,560;01:32:36,760;"Yeah, mom would probably love the athletic."
01:32:36,760;01:32:38,360;"Yeah, she probably would."
01:32:38,360;01:32:45,960;"So yeah, don't forget Texas, Dinesley Hotline, 603-505-8043."
01:32:45,960;01:32:48,260;"Hopefully we'll hear from you soon."
01:32:49,960;01:32:52,520;"And until next time, we will see you later."
01:32:52,520;01:32:53,800;"See you later."
01:32:53,800;01:32:54,800;"Cool!"

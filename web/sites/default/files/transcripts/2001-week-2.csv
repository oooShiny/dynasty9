00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:25,520;"I am not your mother."
00:25,520;00:30,280;"Welcome to episode two of the Page of Stiency podcast."
00:30,280;00:32,120;"This week we have everybody."
00:32,120;00:34,120;"We've got Mike Mello."
00:34,120;00:36,720;"How you doing, Mike?"
00:36,720;00:38,680;"Doing splendid."
00:38,680;00:39,680;"How are you doing, man?"
00:39,680;00:40,680;"Splendid."
00:40,680;00:41,680;"I'm doing very well."
00:41,680;00:43,720;"Much better now that I've been talking to you."
00:43,720;00:44,720;"Wow."
00:44,720;00:45,720;"That's so sweet."
00:45,720;00:51,000;"We've also got Steve Brown with us today."
00:51,000;00:52,160;"In the middle of dinner, I think."
00:52,160;00:54,160;"Steve, how's it going?"
00:54,160;00:55,160;"Amazing."
00:55,160;00:59,720;"What are you eating for dinner? Those burgers we had last weekend, we're up here."
00:59,720;01:03,000;"The same ones or did you cook more? That was my question."
01:03,000;01:05,880;"They were, I didn't, we didn't cook all of them, so I'm just cooking the rest of them."
01:05,880;01:11,960;"Oh okay, I was just making sure. It would have been a better story if it was the same one, yeah."
01:11,960;01:17,320;"It would have been better. That's okay. And last but definitely not least on the phone,"
01:17,320;01:24,200;"we have Greg Brown. How's it going Greg? It's going just great Andy. Nice. It's nice to have"
01:24,200;01:52,200;"here for this one. I'm glad to be here for the inaugural episode. Yeah, we'll call this the inaugural episode too. It's fine. We didn't do them before. It's okay. You didn't miss anything. Game wise, you didn't miss anything because the Bengals game was rough. Yeah, I watched that. It was a very familiar feeling, I think, was the consensus of futility, especially down at the end of the game. Yep."
01:52,200;02:03,340;"But I believe at the end of that episode, Mike made a bold statement that 9/11 was the"
02:03,340;02:07,200;"reason for the Patriots dynasty."
02:07,200;02:12,040;"I don't know if that's exactly what I said."
02:12,040;02:16,000;"I wasn't as a judge."
02:16,000;02:19,560;"If 9/11 didn't happen, the dynasty would have never happened is my point."
02:19,560;02:23,840;"So I'm pretty caught to say exactly what you just said. So yeah, I'm scared by that"
02:23,840;02:26,520;"You just call mola. Louis 9/11. I"
02:26,520;02:29,840;"mean"
02:29,840;02:33,480;"These are I"
02:33,480;02:35,800;"No comment, you know"
02:35,800;02:38,940;"Off your rousing star, but I love it"
02:38,940;02:44,680;"We could also say right like if they play the payers that might have not happened right so true"
02:44,680;02:49,000;"I'm not saying that it is a direct correlation. Okay, don't don't take it that way"
02:49,000;02:56,380;"I am just saying 9/11 did not happen Tom Brady would not be our cool action. I mean"
02:56,380;03:00,940;"he might be playing for the freaking Colts for me now. That's true. Well the 49ers."
03:00,940;03:09,860;"Right. So that's my point. You don't need to spin it. Okay. Okay. All right."
03:09,860;03:14,680;"I mean I think there's probably something to that maybe we'll get into it further"
03:14,680;03:20,760;"down the road and see like how the Panthers were at the beginning of the season because I know at"
03:20,760;03:24,440;"the end of the season they got their doors blown off of the pages but I think they kind of given"
03:24,440;03:31,960;"up on the year by that point. So maybe it does change things. See that's all I'm saying."
03:31,960;03:37,000;"I'm with you Mike. The whole narrative changed. Plus I mean here's the other thing. I don't I'm not"
03:37,000;03:46,360;"conspiracy theorists, right? But the Patriots, the Patriots are playing the Jets after 9/11. I mean,"
03:46,360;03:53,000;"I don't know man. Yeah, it just seems a little fishy. We're all Patriots in the end of the"
03:53,000;03:59,320;"year. I mean, I'm not going to say that sports is scripted, but if it were, Bob Craft is an"
03:59,320;04:05,560;"opportunist and I do not stand by that. And weren't the Patriots playing the Rams and the Rams is a"
04:06,840;04:09,480;"a Muslim figure head of something. I remember saying that pop up."
04:09,480;04:13,320;"I didn't see that frequently as well. I don't know. It seemed a little too"
04:13,320;04:19,720;"opportunistic in my opinion, but hey, this is the Patriots dynasty."
04:19,720;04:25,160;"You would think that if it was scripted, the Patriots wouldn't have lost two jets from New York,"
04:25,160;04:30,200;"right? I don't know, but the two on the moon."
04:30,200;04:34,040;"I feel like around that era, yeah, and the Patriots, you know, we're all Patriots,"
04:34,040;04:36,920;"right? I had a whole Bob crafting, I think."
04:36,920;04:41,400;"I don't know. I mean, if I were gonna like tie together the country, I would probably"
04:41,400;04:43,080;"do it around the Patriots."
04:43,080;04:48,960;"Yeah, I mean, I get it. But you think you may also do it around one of the New York teams"
04:48,960;04:50,960;"as well. So."
04:50,960;04:54,400;"You have a, you just didn't have the talent, did they?"
04:54,400;04:56,400;"Maybe that's what 2007 was."
04:56,400;04:59,160;"Oh, I could have been a little redemption there."
04:59,160;05:01,000;"Yeah, just a long game."
05:01,000;05:07,400;"change that educate yourself, lose things, whatever that you know that conspiracy documentary."
05:07,400;05:12,200;"Oh yeah and zeitgeist zeitgeist you got to check those out."
05:12,200;05:20,760;"Yup got to educate yourself back. Oh is this where you call me sheeple? Exactly."
05:20,760;05:29,240;"I don't know but I mean in all seriousness uh you know 9/11 I was reading like some of the"
05:29,240;05:32,640;"the articles that you've had available to us"
05:32,640;05:34,280;"and just kind of looking it over."
05:34,280;05:36,760;"I mean, it is pretty devastating."
05:36,760;05:38,920;"And you could even tell, like, how do you even write about it?"
05:38,920;05:40,120;"And how do you write about sports"
05:40,120;05:41,320;"after something like that happened?"
05:41,320;05:46,400;"So, I mean, I know that there's a debate between leagues."
05:46,400;05:47,640;"I'm like, if games should be played"
05:47,640;05:48,640;"or when they should be played,"
05:48,640;05:50,640;"but at the same time, the country can't stop"
05:50,640;05:51,480;"for that kind of stuff."
05:51,480;05:55,160;"And I think that overall the country, New York, the leagues,"
05:55,160;05:56,280;"they all kind of did what they could"
05:56,280;05:57,360;"to kind of rally everything."
05:57,360;06:04,520;"So yeah, because for the listeners that don't know what we do behind the scenes,"
06:04,520;06:08,440;"I put together old clippings of the Boston Globe."
06:08,440;06:12,520;"And so for this one, I put together like the day after September 11, like the"
06:12,520;06:13,320;"sports section."
06:13,320;06:17,000;"And that, that was the argument was, you know, do you keep going?"
06:17,000;06:21,280;"Do you play the games this weekend or do you not and like push everything off?"
06:21,280;06:24,720;"So of course, obviously they push it off one week, which is why instead of playing"
06:24,720;06:29,160;"the Panthers, they skipped a week, put the Panthers at the end of the season, and then"
06:29,160;06:30,560;"played the Jets the week after."
06:30,560;06:32,840;"That's not even that."
06:32,840;06:33,760;"That's not what happened, right?"
06:33,760;06:38,640;"It was the only time that the, that's whatever happened to the season is found around."
06:38,640;06:39,760;"It's all the week."
06:39,760;06:45,880;"Um, I'm wondering if it happened back in like the strike shortened era, I think that would"
06:45,880;06:50,640;"be the only other time I could think of, but the only time that since we've been alive,"
06:50,640;06:51,640;"yeah."
06:51,640;06:56,520;"and they were watching like the Andruzy brothers like that one that one had me going with the"
06:56,520;07:04,600;"fields you know yeah oh yeah yep pretty powerful yeah I didn't expect it to as much because it's"
07:04,600;07:11,480;"been so long but it definitely hit me somewhere yeah dude and then like how about I mean I love"
07:11,480;07:16,760;"this guy's name that he's like a master trooper Ben Clark sort of led the national anthem and he"
07:16,760;07:18,320;"you went through like this whole,"
07:18,320;07:21,680;"it was like part performance art, part like history lesson,"
07:21,680;07:24,000;"talking about like sort of our country"
07:24,000;07:24,840;"in the national anthem,"
07:24,840;07:26,960;"but I thought that was phenomenal."
07:26,960;07:30,520;"- Yeah, I was riveted the whole time."
07:30,520;07:34,360;"And even before that they started the whole programming"
07:34,360;07:38,960;"with New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani talking about,"
07:38,960;07:43,120;"you know, unity and New York and strength"
07:43,120;07:44,160;"and all that stuff."
07:45,480;07:50,560;"It's interesting to see that side of him, especially what he's become these days, but"
07:50,560;07:52,960;"he was very eloquent, I thought."
07:52,960;07:58,200;"And then they moved on to that whole extended national anthem."
07:58,200;08:03,800;"It was, yeah, like Greg's, I wasn't expecting to be hit that hard by it because it's been"
08:03,800;08:10,120;"so long, but it was like, even the moment of silence felt longer than any moment of silence"
08:10,120;08:11,120;"you hear in him."
08:11,120;08:14,120;"Did you see the Lionel Richie thing?"
08:14,120;08:15,120;"No."
08:15,120;08:22,900;"I miss that I watched it through YouTube and they had like some extended opening and they had like Lionel Richie"
08:22,900;08:31,360;"Doing like a piano song solo type thing. It was ridiculous. Oh, that's right. Yeah, that was a right after Rudy. I think it wasn't it"
08:31,360;08:35,200;"Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, no, I forgot about that. Yeah"
08:35,200;08:38,080;"So my question is gonna be"
08:38,080;08:42,360;"Who would you have to do it in today's day and age?"
08:42,720;08:45,900;"If you have like a national tragedy and you got a pick like"
08:45,900;08:52,400;"Songbird of our generation who you got going out there. Oh, that's a good question"
08:52,400;08:55,400;"Well, who is he you think?"
08:55,400;08:57,960;"tail switch maybe"
08:57,960;09:02,360;"Tell us I gotta be you know, but it's a good be classy"
09:02,360;09:05,560;"Probably somebody in country music I would think"
09:05,560;09:08,440;"Luzan"
09:08,440;09:10,680;"well"
09:10,680;09:11,680;"No."
09:11,680;09:12,680;"Yeah."
09:12,680;09:13,680;"It was a"
09:13,680;09:14,680;"Bruce Springsteen dude."
09:14,680;09:15,680;"You'd be perfect."
09:15,680;09:16,680;"Oh, you're right."
09:16,680;09:17,680;"Yeah."
09:17,680;09:18,680;"He's not like really."
09:18,680;09:19,680;"Yeah."
09:19,680;09:21,680;"Everybody loves his songs."
09:21,680;09:24,680;"I mean, he's kind of not our generation though."
09:24,680;09:26,680;"He's like way back there anyway."
09:26,680;09:27,680;"I'd say Tom."
09:27,680;09:28,680;"Yeah."
09:28,680;09:29,680;"I mean, he's still a song."
09:29,680;09:30,680;"Right."
09:30,680;09:31,680;"You still know his songs."
09:31,680;09:32,680;"Oh, yeah."
09:32,680;09:36,680;"I mean, he's a classic, but I thought we were talking about today, like the classics of today."
09:36,680;09:43,160;"of today. Is he still even springing so alive? I don't know. I feel like we're entering dark"
09:43,160;09:55,320;"territory here. A little bit. A dull could work. Oh, good one. Yep. That's not a bad one."
09:55,320;10:01,720;"Hopefully this, you know, we never have to address this ever moving forward. Would that be clear?"
10:01,720;10:10,280;"But I'll have to pass off to a very patron centric start here. It sure is. Yeah, this is about football guys."
10:10,280;10:18,280;"Well, I mean, you kind of have to talk about this because this is like the mood going into this game was super patriotic."
10:18,280;10:27,280;"Yeah. And I mean, it's also crazy just looking back because I mean, at the time, I mean, I was, you know, in college."
10:27,280;10:32,000;"And, you know, what the hell, you don't know anything when you're in college, right?"
10:32,000;10:33,000;"So I don't know."
10:33,000;10:36,200;"So like I quite understood like exactly what was happening at that time."
10:36,200;10:40,960;"I know there was a confusion as to like, you know, who was behind it and what this whole"
10:40,960;10:41,960;"thing was."
10:41,960;10:46,080;"So looking back now, I mean, you definitely have a different perspective on the whole"
10:46,080;10:47,080;"thing for sure."
10:47,080;10:48,080;"Yeah, absolutely."
10:48,080;10:49,080;"Yeah."
10:49,080;10:53,560;"Did you notice they don't refer to it as 9/11 either?"
10:53,560;10:56,040;"either because it's like it happened last week."
10:56,040;10:59,600;"So I wonder if it was like last week."
10:59,600;11:04,520;"That's always kind of interesting."
11:04,520;11:08,440;"It's like when does it that know that name become like a"
11:08,440;11:09,360;"unanimous thing?"
11:09,360;11:10,080;"The date."
11:10,080;11:11,360;"Yeah, that's a good point."
11:11,360;11:12,560;"Yeah."
11:12,560;11:15,720;"Yeah, I wonder when that happened."
11:15,720;11:18,880;"I wonder if it was on the one year anniversary of like, this is the date it"
11:18,880;11:19,320;"happened."
11:19,320;11:22,200;"This is the date that I looked down at him for me."
11:23,120;11:26,880;"Right. Yeah, that would make sense. Like a year on, you're like 9/11. Yeah."
11:26,880;11:36,000;"Yeah. I mean, in like adding to Greg's question, like, what, how do you guys feel about how they,"
11:36,000;11:40,960;"they went with this? Like, what do you think the ideal situation would be to sort of pay"
11:40,960;11:44,640;"respects and kind of let the country heal a little bit before going back to? I mean,"
11:44,640;11:48,160;"you think that it's a right to just get back into playing these games?"
11:48,160;11:55,240;"I think it's a balancing act and I think even when they were playing this game like in the papers they were"
11:55,240;11:57,520;"People on both sides were like yeah"
11:57,520;11:57,760;"well"
11:57,760;12:01,080;"there's the NFL just getting back into it because they don't want to lose any money and"
12:01,080;12:03,160;"The other half is like yeah"
12:03,160;12:05,680;"We need to get back into this because we can't let you know"
12:05,680;12:10,600;"Terrorists dictate our lives and we just need to get back to doing what we're doing. So I think"
12:10,600;12:17,040;"They walked to find enough balance. I'm sure there was shady shit going on"
12:17,040;12:24,660;"on in terms of like they were trying to get whoever's using the what's the stadium in"
12:24,660;12:29,520;"New Orleans the super dome at the time they're trying to get whoever's using it the weekend"
12:29,520;12:33,200;"after the original Super Bowl to move their shit."
12:33,200;12:34,200;"All right."
12:34,200;12:38,680;"So there was kind of like some some of that stuff going on so the I think there was some"
12:38,680;12:42,880;"like the NFL doesn't want to lose any money sort of things happening."
12:42,880;12:48,760;"Right. I mean, it's a catch 22 though, because in one sense, I mean, it's sort of like the"
12:48,760;12:51,720;"evil empire where you're talking about, they just want to make money, but then it's also"
12:51,720;12:56,600;"like, you know, we're capitalist society. And if we do allow that to kind of change our"
12:56,600;12:58,600;"behaviors, then what are we doing?"
12:58,600;12:59,600;"Right. Exactly."
12:59,600;13:07,560;"Yeah, I'm strongly in that camp of like the point of terrorism is to fuck up your, you"
13:07,560;13:10,320;"you know, your shit makes you overreact."
13:10,320;13:13,920;"So it's like that's basically giving in"
13:13,920;13:16,080;"to what they why they get it, you know?"
13:16,080;13:17,160;"- Right."
13:17,160;13:18,840;"And the fact that we're still taking our shoes off"
13:18,840;13:21,000;"to get our airplanes, these kind of points."
13:21,000;13:22,240;"- Yeah, it's a fair point."
13:22,240;13:24,080;"- Not me, pre-check, bro."
13:24,080;13:26,360;"- That's how the other half lives, I guess."
13:26,360;13:27,200;"Must be nice."
13:27,200;13:29,520;"- It is."
13:29,520;13:34,320;"- All right then, I guess it's just me, assholes."
13:36,800;13:42,440;"So the one thing I did catch was that I know Greg touched on the Andruzi brothers, so"
13:42,440;13:46,400;"the whole family actually going out there because the dad was there too, right?"
13:46,400;13:50,440;"But yeah, we're saying that that was Robert Kraft's idea, which I thought was kind of"
13:50,440;13:51,440;"cool."
13:51,440;13:57,960;"It is and it was also, I mean, I don't know, because it's always a debate with like entertainment"
13:57,960;14:01,480;"and these spectacles of like, like you said, how much is opportunity versus how much is"
14:01,480;14:06,280;"heart out, but just at least not even talking about craft or whatever, but just seeing the"
14:06,280;14:11,560;"family seeing how they spoke. I mean, that was like really just amazing to see their reaction,"
14:11,560;14:15,320;"how much they did, loved the country, how much they were felt. And I mean, all of them are from"
14:15,320;14:17,320;"New York. I'm not mistaken. So."
14:17,320;14:23,480;"Yeah, because they were all at least a couple of them were firefighters in the New York Fire"
14:23,480;14:27,560;"Department. And we did something in the Super Bowl as well, something similar."
14:27,560;14:32,920;"Yeah, that sounds familiar. Yeah, I think. And one of the, because they interviewed them"
14:32,920;14:37,320;"like towards the end of the game, the brothers on the sideline, as the game was going on."
14:37,320;14:45,640;"And I thought they said that one of the brothers, like 9/11 was his first day on the force."
14:45,640;14:49,320;"- Oh, I think something like that. Yeah, it's insane."
14:49,320;14:55,720;"- And the other one was like, he was actually on the scene like 10 minutes before the"
14:56,600;14:58,640;"the tower fell or the tower collapsed."
14:58,640;15:02,600;"And so like, it makes a lot of sense that"
15:02,600;15:04,520;"they have all people were there"
15:04,520;15:09,520;"and were the ones being celebrated at this."
15:09,520;15:10,840;"Like they were the face of it."
15:10,840;15:11,680;"That kind of made sense"
15:11,680;15:13,520;"because they also had the connection to football obviously."
15:13,520;15:16,360;"But like it was like they just pulled some randos"
15:16,360;15:19,680;"out of the stands because there was some like"
15:19,680;15:20,600;"generic connection."
15:20,600;15:22,440;"Like these guys actually were legit."
15:22,440;15:25,480;"- When the, who was the commissioner?"
15:25,480;15:30,920;"was it tag we boo tag however you yes I believe so yeah so I mean we could"
15:30,920;15:35,840;"probably wager that giddell might not handle it as classy I don't know that's"
15:35,840;15:40,720;"just a gut feeling well I mean there was a whole bunch of stuff swirl around"
15:40,720;15:45,640;"tag with boo about how we didn't want to cancel the games that weekend to because"
15:45,640;15:50,360;"the Jets threatened to just not play regardless if they held the games or not"
15:50,360;15:54,160;"like all the players so they weren't gonna play so then he canceled it what do you"
15:54,160;15:56,160;"I think Adele would have done a few years in charge."
15:56,160;15:59,360;"- Oh, he would have fucked it up somehow."
15:59,360;16:00,200;"- Found a way."
16:00,200;16:02,800;"- I mean, he probably would have suspended Brady"
16:02,800;16:03,800;"for some reason."
16:03,800;16:06,040;"(laughing)"
16:06,040;16:09,320;"- I don't know, I don't think that's..."
16:09,320;16:12,480;"It's my guess."
16:12,480;16:14,240;"- That's dark, but I kinda like it."
16:14,240;16:18,080;"- I mean, I'm just going by the past, you know."
16:18,080;16:21,160;"- Yeah."
16:21,160;16:24,920;"So all right, let's kind of get into a bit of the game"
16:24,920;16:29,160;"that now that we've beaten the dead horse of 9/11,"
16:29,160;16:30,520;"which is a great way to start this."
16:30,520;16:32,440;"A couple of things I know in the last episode,"
16:32,440;16:34,680;"we talked about the replacement referees,"
16:34,680;16:36,280;"which I completely forgotten about."
16:36,280;16:37,760;"And now I know why."
16:37,760;16:42,760;"It was because the NFL sorted out the referee situation"
16:42,760;16:45,720;"real fast after 9/11 happened."
16:45,720;16:48,400;"So they had the regular refs back in this game."
16:49,840;16:56,000;"that I thought you could really tell because I don't think they were very good. But the other"
16:56,000;17:00,560;"generic game thing was that the commentators' game were Dick Enberg and Dan Deardorf,"
17:00,560;17:10,320;"which I found offensive personally because out of every commentator that I've ever listened to"
17:10,320;17:15,120;"do a football game, I think Dan Deardorf is easily the worst. We still got to do this ridiculous."
17:17,920;17:24,000;"He was so bad. I started just tracking all the things that they got wrong. And then I got so"
17:24,000;17:30,720;"angry that I stopped doing it. How far did you get? Let's see. They were getting names wrong from"
17:30,720;17:37,600;"the opening kickoff. They mentioned whoever the the kicker was. They got that name wrong."
17:37,600;17:41,440;"They were calling both punters, Tom Tupa, for both teams."
17:41,440;17:47,760;"As they should. They didn't understand penalties. They couldn't understand that"
17:47,760;17:51,200;"loss of you get a loss of down on intentional grounding. It took them, I think,"
17:51,200;17:55,200;"two intentional groundings or maybe three for them to actually understand that that was happening."
17:55,200;18:00,080;"And then Dan kept bringing up how painful it must be for"
18:00,080;18:04,640;"Patriots fans to watch Curtis Martin have so much success. They kept bringing that up"
18:04,640;18:07,760;"over and over again, because he's a dickhead. Imagine a huge..."
18:07,760;18:08,640;"Right, but that's fair."
18:08,640;18:12,480;"...of Dan fucking up. That'd be longer than his podcast episode."
18:15,600;18:18,300;"I mean, we could do as better as everything dandy."
18:18,300;18:20,880;"I was going to say, I think Andy, that's a challenge."
18:20,880;18:23,100;"The passion project of violence do this."
18:23,100;18:28,920;"But seriously, like every time they'd make a call on a play, they would get it wrong initially."
18:28,920;18:30,080;"It's like, oh, he was out of bounds."
18:30,080;18:33,480;"And then like, as you see the referee come over saying he caught it in bounds."
18:33,480;18:37,000;"It's like, I thought I was remembering it wrong."
18:37,000;18:43,480;"And I just had this like pent up anger over like somebody who was mediocre, but no, he's, he's awful."
18:43,480;18:44,840;"Hey,"
18:44,840;18:52,520;"right? You don't? I think you're a game recently. No, I don't think so. But he"
18:52,520;18:58,680;"didn't quite go for a while. Yeah. Good for him. You know, he's not he's not cynical. He's just kind of a"
18:58,680;19:04,200;"goof. He's just watching a different game than I am. I think it's kind of fun watching him because it's like,"
19:04,200;19:10,920;"he's like a goof is uncle, you know, he's just like bumbling around, he's screwing up. And it's"
19:10,920;19:15,920;"It's entertaining as like a good commentator, you know?"
19:15,920;19:18,960;"Nah, 'cause he feels so condescending about it."
19:18,960;19:21,400;"Like he knows more than like the people he's talking to."
19:21,400;19:22,400;"He's really he's talking to anybody."
19:22,400;19:23,880;"He's getting it all wrong."
19:23,880;19:25,240;"I think that's, that's what I have fun."
19:25,240;19:26,600;"There's a lot of weird."
19:26,600;19:28,720;"He's sort of like not in on the joke."
19:28,720;19:31,720;"Maybe I've got the anger issues or something."
19:31,720;19:32,640;"I find it infuriating."
19:32,640;19:34,160;"Yeah, that was it."
19:34,160;19:37,400;"Do you want to talk about those issues?"
19:37,400;19:40,600;"What was we trying to say, Craig?"
19:40,600;19:41,680;"I was thinking Dan Fouts."
19:41,680;19:42,720;"Who's worst?"
19:42,720;19:45,220;"Oh, Fouts is terrible."
19:45,220;19:46,720;"Yeah, he's bad."
19:46,720;19:48,240;"Dear Dorf is worse."
19:48,240;19:51,060;"This is the the hill that I die on."
19:51,060;19:51,880;"Dear Dorf is worse."
19:51,880;19:52,360;"Fouts."
19:52,360;19:53,160;"I hate Fouts."
19:53,160;19:57,240;"No, just because I guarantee as we go through these games, the"
19:57,240;20:00,680;"Patriots will get a lot of Dan Dorf and you guys will come around."
20:00,680;20:02,280;"Because he is."
20:02,280;20:04,800;"I I even remember him."
20:04,800;20:07,540;"I remember specifically."
20:08,280;20:13,200;"I think it was a bills game, but it was a punt and he, he, I think he was watching a"
20:13,200;20:13,800;"different game."
20:13,800;20:21,640;"Cause he was talking about it being a kickoff and it had like the wrong teams he was"
20:21,640;20:22,160;"talking about."
20:22,160;20:24,160;"It was just completely wrong."
20:24,160;20:28,680;"And every single aspect of the, of the commentary, it was made a word up there."
20:28,680;20:29,200;"I'm so angry."
20:29,200;20:30,280;"You can find us."
20:30,280;20:34,280;"Hey, can we circle back and talk about your anger issues for a second?"
20:35,360;20:40,160;"Apparently Greg was about to drop some knowledge on that."
20:40,160;20:43,480;"I know he's got some insight into my anger issues."
20:43,480;20:44,320;"OK."
20:44,320;20:50,160;"Yeah, I work with you for two summers and I've never done so much."
20:50,160;20:53,360;"So mad at traffic in my entire life."
20:53,360;20:57,400;"And now I commute into Boston and nothing has changed."
20:57,400;20:59,600;"Oh, God."
20:59,600;21:01,480;"Are you working on those issues?"
21:01,480;21:03,280;"I mean, I guess I'll be talking about it."
21:03,280;21:04,960;"We're starting their process."
21:04,960;21:10,200;"Fixing that what the thing is like that's the only thing that gets me angrier's traffic"
21:10,200;21:14,260;"And bad once I'm angry like well"
21:14,260;21:17,360;"The door and the referee"
21:17,360;21:22,620;"All right, all right, let me rephrase that the things get me angry at things that don't work the way they should"
21:22,620;21:25,720;"Traffic is one dandeed or if it's the other"
21:25,720;21:31,680;"Just our what a list and call your hit list"
21:32,200;21:38,080;"Oh boy, right? I'm getting a little uncomfortable here"
21:38,080;21:45,400;"Can't wait to see this come up in a court hearing I don't condone anything that's been said so far"
21:45,400;21:48,000;"Including anything that I've said"
21:48,000;21:51,800;"Blonde cutting all the I'm cutting everything you just said out mike so don't worry about it. Thank you"
21:51,800;21:54,600;"Dandy or trial exhibit a"
21:56,100;22:01,580;"God on his tombstone or whatever it says, you know bad commentation"
22:01,580;22:05,900;"I also have to get angry you start making up words"
22:05,900;22:12,940;"Well, what's the verb for?"
22:12,940;22:18,420;"The past participle of commentate, I don't know what I'm looking for"
22:18,420;22:23,280;"What's the noun version of it? I don't know again big fan about how patriots"
22:23,280;22:24,720;"this podcast has been."
22:24,720;22:29,120;"I know this is like you're taking me back to like the classroom."
22:29,120;22:31,440;"I mean, I'm getting a mini panic attack right now."
22:31,440;22:32,280;"I don't know if you guys know that."
22:32,280;22:32,960;"Good."
22:32,960;22:37,040;"Well, that that puts you in the right mood for watching the football game, I think."
22:37,040;22:40,200;"So let's let's back up."
22:40,200;22:42,160;"Let's talk about my panic issues."
22:42,160;22:46,720;"We'll get to those."
22:46,720;22:48,000;"I'm sure they'll come out natural."
22:48,000;22:50,160;"I don't know how long we want to go."
22:52,200;22:56,680;"All right, so let's talk about the players in this game because the starting"
22:56,680;23:02,600;"lineups were who's who of forgettable AFC players, I think."
23:02,600;23:05,560;"Well, except for the Jets D, right?"
23:05,560;23:10,040;"Well, I think except for the Patriots D more than anything, even the Jets"
23:10,040;23:11,760;"D didn't have a ton of names."
23:11,760;23:12,760;"I don't know."
23:12,760;23:15,000;"I thought that like every time we said something, maybe it was just because I was"
23:15,000;23:18,440;"so familiar with them, but what's happening?"
23:19,000;23:22,480;"Oh, Steve is not paying a goddamn attention."
23:22,480;23:24,520;"Steve, you button, I think."
23:24,520;23:25,160;"Maybe."
23:25,160;23:27,840;"Yeah, my crew make a moment and want to make a ton of noise."
23:27,840;23:30,640;"Yeah, well, you're doing a great fucking job."
23:30,640;23:32,680;"You'll put the baby on."
23:32,680;23:35,760;"I'm very interested in what they think."
23:35,760;23:36,360;"Right, Gary."
23:36,360;23:41,840;"Hey, oh, I'll be cutting this part."
23:41,840;23:45,320;"Give it a listen."
23:45,320;23:47,920;"Steve, they make it so hard to edit."
23:47,920;23:48,980;"I can feel it already."
23:48,980;23:52,540;"Wait, listen, see how it feels."
23:52,540;23:53,500;"Then make your decision."
23:53,500;23:59,240;"Greg, last week, the last episode we did a halfway through, he was like, all right, I got to go."
23:59,240;24:01,920;"I got to eat dinner and just fucking left halfway through the podcast."
24:01,920;24:02,800;"Yeah."
24:02,800;24:04,780;"Halfway through like 90 minutes in."
24:04,780;24:06,280;"What was it?"
24:06,280;24:10,560;"It was like 40 minutes of good material in the 90 minutes."
24:10,560;24:11,400;"So do you understand this?"
24:11,400;24:12,480;"Exactly."
24:12,480;24:14,740;"Yeah."
24:14,740;24:17,280;"So, Mili, you're talking about the Jets defense."
24:17,560;24:20,160;"You think I I had four names."
24:20,160;24:21,800;"I recognize the John Abraham."
24:21,800;24:24,160;"Hey legend who's a monster."
24:24,160;24:26,160;"He was there."
24:26,160;24:29,400;"There was comparing him to what's his name?"
24:29,400;24:33,520;"Derek Thomas, which I thought was a little overboard, but OK."
24:33,520;24:35,040;"James."
24:35,040;24:36,440;"He's pretty good in this time."
24:36,440;24:39,320;"He was, but he was no Derek Thomas."
24:39,320;24:41,480;"Derek Thomas had seven sacks in a game, didn't he?"
24:41,480;24:42,840;"Seven, I think."
24:42,840;24:45,960;"Could be like that's that's."
24:46,160;24:47,420;"I don't think he quite got out."
24:47,420;24:50,580;"I often remember him as a falcon and James Ferrier as a stealer."
24:50,580;24:52,180;"Yes, that was the other name."
24:52,180;24:54,740;"Like I don't remember these guys is just so much."
24:54,740;24:58,740;"So yeah, John Abraham James Ferrier, Molluis for obvious reasons."
24:58,740;25:02,920;"And then Victor Green only because he became a patriot the next season."
25:02,920;25:07,400;"In the world about like Aaron Glenn and Sean Ellis."
25:07,400;25:08,260;"Those guys were pretty good."
25:08,260;25:14,220;"I mean, they're their names, like kind of recognize, I guess."
25:15,300;25:22,220;"Yeah, I think Aaron Glenn was a great one. I think he's a Hall of Samer. I'm a stigging Aaron Glenn"
25:22,220;25:24,740;"Yeah, sure no"
25:24,740;25:30,900;"On I was with the guy that the it's a traffic they got from Bell check though. I know that"
25:30,900;25:36,300;"Oh, was he really hey, we never really address that maybe that's for another time, but we should talk about that"
25:36,300;25:38,380;"What's that?"
25:38,380;25:41,780;"the the whole like how Belichick got to be"
25:42,620;25:46,860;"Patriots had coach and how he left the Jets to begin with and started this whole thing."
25:46,860;25:52,220;"Yeah, I think that's a fair thing to do. I don't know if we'll touch on it today because we're"
25:52,220;25:56,140;"already, what, 45 minutes in, but we haven't actually talked about the game."
25:56,140;25:59,580;"Right, but we're technically three minutes in, so."
25:59,580;26:00,940;"Yeah, that's fine."
26:00,940;26:10,140;"Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'd say there's more names on the Jets defense than the Jets offense."
26:11,340;26:14,220;"Because it was basically Curtis Martin and that was it."
26:14,220;26:15,900;"Wanker bet?"
26:15,900;26:22,300;"Yes, Wanker bet only because he was the original White slot receiver."
26:22,300;26:27,660;"The original lunch pail guy, the Vinnie Testa, that name Ring of Bell?"
26:27,660;26:29,660;"Yeah."
26:29,660;26:35,500;"So Vinnie Testa variety for as old as he was in this game, he was 37, almost 38, I think,"
26:35,500;26:36,380;"by the end of the season."
26:37,660;26:42,540;"He's still what five years younger than Tom Brady is still playing right now"
26:42,540;26:45,660;"Brady is 40 Brady 42 or 43"
26:45,660;26:49,980;"42 I believe I think it turns 43 to see yeah"
26:49,980;26:55,820;"It did stick as like the two most unappletive quarterbacks have ever seen in one game"
26:55,820;27:05,660;"Well with three right I mean if you're including Brady Bledso and that's true"
27:06,860;27:08,700;"one. Can you follow that? Dude."
27:08,700;27:13,740;"All right. I. Yes. Say it again."
27:13,740;27:18,380;"I could say you could even make the analogy that there were two twin towers"
27:18,380;27:22,580;"standing back there. Oh, yeah. Cut that one. Yeah, we're not. We're not"
27:22,580;27:25,220;"doing that. Okay. We're not doing that."
27:25,220;27:29,180;"Yeah. So so which one went down first?"
27:29,180;27:32,300;"Because that we're not doing this guys."
27:33,500;27:37,820;"cutting all of this. Jesus Christ. I'm about 10 seconds away from walking off of this thing."
27:37,820;27:42,140;"Yeah, that's definitely not making the final cut. Jesus."
27:42,140;27:47,420;"That's brutal. I'm not going to say well played, but..."
27:47,420;27:55,100;"No. Yeah. It does. But I did think that both of these"
27:57,660;28:08,060;"lineups kind of were very similar to each other. Like you had an older quarterback who was on his"
28:08,060;28:14,060;"last legs, a team that was focused, an offensive focus around the running game on both sides"
28:14,060;28:20,940;"with no name receivers at the time. And then like both strengths were the defense on both sides."
28:20,940;28:25,900;"And those were the names that you're wrecking it. And it's like all the stats were almost exactly"
28:25,900;28:30,300;"even to all across the board. Like these were probably the perfectly matched teams."
28:30,300;28:38,140;"I had a note on that because they were showing Curtis Martin's numbers from the year before"
28:38,140;28:43,180;"and it was like 1200 yards. It was like, oh, it's pretty good. Three-pointed yards to carry."
28:43,180;28:51,340;"So I looked up like watching attempts players add back then. If you look from that season,"
28:51,340;28:56,340;"in there's like 10 or 12 guys with 300 plus attempts."
28:56,340;28:58,420;"And there was only one last year."
28:58,420;29:00,420;"- Oh wow."
29:00,420;29:02,980;"- And take one with 160."
29:02,980;29:07,020;"So like, rushing like workhorse running back"
29:07,020;29:10,660;"is like completely same since then."
29:10,660;29:11,740;"- Yeah."
29:11,740;29:14,420;"And I think the pages may have been kind of the driving force"
29:14,420;29:17,940;"for that where they just have a stable of mediocre guys"
29:17,940;29:20,860;"who they can just cycle through when one gets hurt."
29:20,860;29:21,780;"'Cause I think that was a problem,"
29:21,780;29:23,740;"is if you had that workhorse and he went down,"
29:23,740;29:24,640;"you kinda fucked."
29:24,640;29:27,580;"- Well, do you think that it stemmed from,"
29:27,580;29:31,300;"I mean, obviously Robert Edwards was supposed to be"
29:31,300;29:36,300;"the next big running act for the Patriots"
29:36,300;29:38,740;"a couple of years prior,"
29:38,740;29:40,500;"and obviously he went down, you're sort of like,"
29:40,500;29:42,780;"I think they were like running back hell for a while."
29:42,780;29:44,980;"- Yeah, 'cause they were trying to like second channel"
29:44,980;29:46,940;"regular and less correlation."
29:46,940;29:48,780;"- Right, yeah."
29:48,780;29:54,580;"I think the in 2000 they were starting Kevin Falk is there every down back which did not work very well"
29:54,580;30:05,340;"Like as a community right committee because you had talking news good, but you couldn't use them in that role"
30:05,340;30:07,340;"So you're like all right third down back"
30:07,340;30:10,100;"Antoine's"
30:10,100;30:16,620;"Just plow up the mess. I'll like I was using both, you know, yeah, exactly and then you had GR Redmond in there too for I"
30:17,540;30:21,080;"I don't know. Well, I mean, you say all that. And then if you watch this game, the leading"
30:21,080;30:26,980;"rusher was the full back mark Edwards, which I mean, he had like a hell of a game until"
30:26,980;30:35,740;"his mishap until both mishaps. Did you fumble to twice? Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. But I love"
30:35,740;30:40,580;"the guy. Apparently those are his first two fumbles as well. Like of his career. Was this"
30:40,580;30:45,280;"the at the point where, as I said, was this at the point where it clearly wasn't at the"
30:45,280;30:47,460;"point where like, you know, you'd be in the Belichick's"
30:47,460;30:49,240;"doghouse if you messed up."
30:49,240;30:54,100;"I don't think they had the dog house erected yet."
30:54,100;30:57,220;"They weren't good enough to be able to put people in the"
30:57,220;30:57,780;"doghouse."
30:57,780;30:58,660;"What were you going to say?"
30:58,660;30:59,700;"They put them out right away."
30:59,700;31:00,260;"I would."
31:00,260;31:04,500;"Yeah, like they they were throwing to him like split"
31:04,500;31:05,340;"him out wide."
31:05,340;31:08,860;"Like he seemed like he was the offensive weapon, which"
31:08,860;31:13,820;"if your full back is your offensive go to weapon, that's"
31:13,860;31:17,020;"Probably not a great sign. I don't think even in 2001"
31:17,020;31:25,500;"But I mean should we touch on the whole Curtis Martin stuff since I don't know if we'll get a chance to do it further down the line"
31:25,500;31:27,220;"like the whole yeah, I"
31:27,220;31:32,420;"Cuz I looked into the whole like Curtis Martin trade and basically it was a"
31:32,420;31:39,180;"bit of a poison pill and I think this was when all the poison pill stuff was going on because I remember there was"
31:40,620;31:45,280;"There was one that was a tipping point. I think it had to do with the Vikings and an offensive lineman or something like that"
31:45,280;31:48,300;"What is a poison pill?"
31:48,300;31:54,380;"The poison pill is they would put like if a team is trying to sign somebody I"
31:54,380;31:59,600;"Think like the Vikings they were trying to sign some Cowboys offensive lineman or something like that"
31:59,600;32:01,900;"And so they put a poison pill in where like the"
32:01,900;32:10,140;"Because if he was a restricted free agent for instance, it would put something in like if if you if the the guy gets more"
32:10,140;32:20,140;"than 50 yards rushing in the state of Texas, you would have to pay like a $5 million bonus"
32:20,140;32:25,340;"sort of thing. So the Cowboys obviously couldn't match that. So then he would be able to,"
32:25,340;32:28,300;"you'd be free to sign with a different team. Oh, that's genius."
32:28,300;32:35,340;"Yeah. Oh, absolutely. I heard that. Yeah. Well, they got rid of it because it started."
32:36,860;32:37,860;"Who was it?"
32:37,860;32:41,280;"Charles Clay going to the bills not too long ago, like they"
32:41,280;32:41,960;"just structured it."
32:41,960;32:44,280;"So like all those salaries in the first year."
32:44,280;32:45,860;"Yeah."
32:45,860;32:48,680;"So I mean, it's still kind of happens, but they got rid of a lot"
32:48,680;32:50,800;"of the egregious stuff where you couldn't do that."
32:50,800;32:53,060;"Um, but this was before that."
32:53,060;32:53,560;"So."
32:53,560;32:58,680;"Yeah, basically the poison pill and the Curtis Martin one was like"
32:58,680;33:02,640;"he was running out of his, his original rookie deal."
33:03,440;33:08,440;"And so the Jets offered him like a,"
33:08,440;33:12,400;"what looked like a huge contract,"
33:12,400;33:15,440;"but they also had a clause that prohibited the team"
33:15,440;33:17,200;"from using the franchise tag,"
33:17,200;33:20,440;"which means he could be an unrestricted free agent"
33:20,440;33:21,300;"the next year."
33:21,300;33:25,320;"And so the page couldn't resign"
33:25,320;33:27,280;"because they'd risk losing the year after,"
33:27,280;33:30,520;"but, and then they wouldn't get any draft picks"
33:30,520;33:31,360;"or anything like that,"
33:31,360;33:32,800;"they comp picks and that sort of stuff."
33:32,800;33:37,800;"So the Jets signing for a big contract"
33:37,800;33:39,440;"and it's probably gonna be bigger"
33:39,440;33:40,960;"than what the Patriots would have signed for anyway"
33:40,960;33:44,160;"'cause they thought he was kind of on the decline"
33:44,160;33:48,440;"which he wasn't, but there was like a whole bunch"
33:48,440;33:51,960;"of like extra money added in that wasn't actually real money"
33:51,960;33:55,920;"just to kind of steal him away."
33:55,920;33:59,600;"'Cause the Patriots offered Martin six years"
33:59,600;34:02,080;"at $12 million and the Jets ended up paying him"
34:02,080;34:04,340;"a five year 28 million dollar contract."
34:04,340;34:07,900;"Mm. So you got a you got a bunch more."
34:07,900;34:10,140;"I mean, it's probably the best decision for Curtis Martin, but."
34:10,140;34:12,380;"Suck for Pat's fans."
34:12,380;34:14,260;"All I remember is be I just can help."
34:14,260;34:17,060;"Go ahead. Steve."
34:17,060;34:21,400;"I go. I said, all our members be hurt by Curtis Martin, betray me."
34:21,400;34:22,380;"Stab me in the back."
34:22,380;34:24,660;"Yeah, Judas."
34:24,660;34:28,700;"Yeah, that's a that's a middle school opinion right there."
34:28,700;34:30,140;"Oh, hundred percent."
34:31,860;34:34,180;"- It doesn't look like it. - I just couldn't help."
34:34,180;34:35,300;"I mean, I wrote the note,"
34:35,300;34:37,060;"like, do you think that the,"
34:37,060;34:39,380;"I mean, they won like three out of four Super Bowls,"
34:39,380;34:41,860;"do you think if Curtis Martin, all things equal,"
34:41,860;34:43,940;"he's the only difference was, you know,"
34:43,940;34:46,460;"on those teams that they would have gotten four in a row?"
34:46,460;34:47,580;"- Yeah, I mean."
34:47,580;34:51,300;"- Or would they have like emphasized him too much maybe?"
34:51,300;34:54,100;"- He had some great years in New York."
34:54,100;34:55,420;"- Yeah."
34:55,420;34:58,700;"- Like, I have a stats product right now,"
34:58,700;35:05,700;"and he had looks like seven, eight straight thousand yard seasons for the Jets."
35:05,700;35:06,700;"Yeah."
35:06,700;35:14,540;"And I don't, I think, uh, I saw a stat where he was only one of like, there was only two"
35:14,540;35:17,540;"other guys who had done it for seven years in a row or more."
35:17,540;35:18,540;"One of them was Barry Sanders."
35:18,540;35:23,140;"I can't remember the other one of us, but you know, big names sort of thing."
35:23,140;35:26,060;"But you're not thinking for in a row with him."
35:26,060;35:31,580;"I don't think because I think 2002 they didn't lose it wasn't because they didn't have a running game"
35:31,580;35:36,160;"I think it's just because they had a super hangover more than anything"
35:36,160;35:40,960;"Yeah, some of them with Brett far remember hating Brett far because of 2002 season"
35:40,960;35:46,100;"Brett far is a is the reason we missed the playoffs twice. I just"
35:46,100;35:51,900;"Remember hating him because he would send dick pics to people and I didn't think that was appropriate"
35:51,900;35:53,900;"He didn't like his dick pics my"
35:54,260;35:59,320;"No, what I saw not a fan or he's mad you didn't get them"
35:59,320;36:02,380;"Who says I didn't"
36:02,380;36:04,380;"Oh to say oh?"
36:04,380;36:10,700;"All right, let's"
36:10,700;36:17,640;"Well wait one more comment on curse Martin. Yeah, he played 11 years"
36:17,640;36:22,140;"Thousand-yard in Canada Stevens"
36:22,820;36:25,820;"Jesus it's pretty good. That's pretty impressive"
36:25,820;36:28,780;"Yeah, almost"
36:28,780;36:32,060;"1,700 rushing yards a year before you retire"
36:32,060;36:41,060;"Yeah, just running back to play for 11 straight years and still be that productive I think"
36:41,060;36:45,940;"Yeah, that's a guy. I'll show you again. You should be in the Hall of Fame. I think I"
36:45,940;36:49,220;"agree is he in the Hall of Fame somebody check that"
36:49,220;36:54,220;"No, he's not home."
36:54,220;36:55,220;"I don't think so."
36:55,220;36:57,220;"Well, that's a freaking try."
36:57,220;37:00,220;"We should turn off the time talking about that bullshit."
37:00,220;37:01,220;"Other question."
37:01,220;37:03,220;"I said, no time passed."
37:03,220;37:04,220;"I have no."
37:04,220;37:07,220;"Mike, I check your Aaron Glenn."
37:07,220;37:08,220;"Take two."
37:08,220;37:09,220;"He's not in the hall."
37:09,220;37:10,220;"Thank you."
37:10,220;37:11,220;"Yeah, I'll check."
37:11,220;37:12,220;"We need to double check that one."
37:12,220;37:13,220;"But I all right."
37:13,220;37:14,220;"All right."
37:14,220;37:15,060;"- There you go."
37:15,060;37:18,140;"(laughing)"
37:18,140;37:18,980;"- Jesus."
37:18,980;37:22,140;"- Yeah, I mean, I'm not too worried"
37:22,140;37:25,380;"about spending all this time talking about Curtis Martin"
37:25,380;37:27,580;"in 9/11 because there's not much talk about"
37:27,580;37:28,980;"in the actual game itself."
37:28,980;37:33,860;"But let's just talk about the Jets for a bit."
37:33,860;37:38,220;"They did go 10 and six this year."
37:38,220;37:41,020;"- Wait a minute, Curtis Martin isn't all the same guys."
37:41,020;37:41,860;"Jesus."
37:43,140;37:44,780;"Yeah, I'm fact checking right here."
37:44,780;37:47,580;"All right."
37:47,580;37:50,100;"So you're one for two on Hall of Fame calls."
37:50,100;37:50,540;"Good."
37:50,540;37:51,380;"That's all I'm saying."
37:51,380;37:51,980;"Yeah."
37:51,980;37:52,340;"All right."
37:52,340;37:53,380;"It's back to 500."
37:53,380;37:55,500;"You know what?"
37:55,500;37:56,340;"Patriots."
37:56,340;38:01,020;"Sam Theodore from the Pro Football Hall of Fame."
38:01,020;38:06,700;"I'm not sure you just checked out because yeah, because if he actually is,"
38:06,700;38:09,980;"that's going to make me angry than the fact that you're just telling me that he is."
38:09,980;38:11,500;"I'm just going to blow up your thing."
38:11,500;38:12,420;"That to make me angry."
38:12,420;38:19,020;"He received the Pete Rosell radio television award from the pro football."
38:19,020;38:21,220;"For freaking commentation."
38:21,220;38:22,420;"That's awesome."
38:22,420;38:27,820;"Mike, you might get back to this."
38:27,820;38:31,220;"You would not know talent if it hit you in the face is all I'm saying."
38:31,220;38:34,120;"Neither would the commentation hall of fame."
38:34,120;38:34,920;"You apparently."
38:34,920;38:37,820;"Oh, God damn it, Dan Deodor."
38:37,820;38:39,120;"Fucking useless."
38:40,020;38:43,780;"I am I'm I'm gonna put together a super clip of him saying shit wrong."
38:43,780;38:45,700;"When you passion project."
38:45,700;38:47,340;"Got a sick one."
38:47,340;38:49,100;"He did."
38:49,100;38:49,700;"I'll give him that."
38:49,700;38:54,580;"So yeah, so the Jets finished third in the AFC East made the playoffs."
38:54,580;38:56,460;"Three teams in the AFCs made the playoffs."
38:56,460;38:58,740;"So AFC at least."
38:58,740;38:59,500;"I don't think so."
38:59,500;39:02,460;"The dolphins are the bills."
39:02,460;39:05,300;"I believe it's dolphins."
39:05,300;39:05,580;"Yeah."
39:05,580;39:07,100;"I don't think the bills were good at this point."
39:07,820;39:11,660;"This was there at Jim Kelly hangover era, which can be pretty bad."
39:11,660;39:12,380;"Hangover to."
39:12,380;39:14,940;"Oh, no, no, it's the Colts."
39:14,940;39:16,700;"Wasn't it?"
39:16,700;39:17,620;"Oh, yeah."
39:17,620;39:18,300;"Yeah."
39:18,300;39:19,860;"They were in there."
39:19,860;39:23,820;"Yeah, Patriots Colts jets with the three ASE teams."
39:23,820;39:25,860;"You played for God."
39:25,860;39:26,220;"Yeah."
39:26,220;39:29,900;"I mean, can we just say Jim Kelly for straight Super Bowls?"
39:29,900;39:33,140;"I mean, I don't know if he was a quarterback for all of them, but that is a"
39:33,140;39:33,940;"pretty bad hangover."
39:33,940;39:35,300;"And I don't know if they've made a playoff sense."
39:35,300;39:36,620;"So that's terrible."
39:37,100;39:38,260;"I made it once."
39:38,260;39:40,520;"There were nine and seven a couple of years ago."
39:40,520;39:44,940;"That's the playoffs and they lost to the jags."
39:44,940;39:49,940;"Uh, and a game that ended like six, three and the music."
39:49,940;39:51,440;"Oh, you're right."
39:51,440;39:52,700;"Oh, I remember that."
39:52,700;39:53,380;"Oh, yeah."
39:53,380;39:57,660;"And the music series of America where they lost to the Titans on that"
39:57,660;39:58,860;"throwback on the kickoff."
39:58,860;39:59,740;"Oh, you're right."
39:59,740;40:00,020;"Yep."
40:00,020;40:00,460;"Okay."
40:00,460;40:01,540;"Wow."
40:01,540;40:04,020;"The illustrious playoff career actually."
40:04,020;40:05,420;"Yeah."
40:05,420;40:08,660;"- Yeah, so they would end up losing the wild card"
40:08,660;40:11,980;"to the Oakland Raiders, which I think we will end up"
40:11,980;40:13,460;"touching on later."
40:13,460;40:15,980;"Head coach is one of my favorite term edwards."
40:15,980;40:21,700;"- This is first year as NFL head coach."
40:21,700;40:25,740;"He was with the Jets, yeah, from here until 2005"
40:25,740;40:28,860;"and then with the Chiefs obviously for most six to 08."
40:28,860;40:31,740;"And then I think from there you just went to college."
40:31,740;40:33,500;"I know he's coaching college now."
40:34,700;40:35,980;"- I don't wanna say state."
40:35,980;40:36,980;"- Yeah, okay."
40:36,980;40:39,100;"And it was great to have him in the league"
40:39,100;40:43,020;"because the Patriots would go nine and two"
40:43,020;40:45,180;"against Armad Woods coach teams."
40:45,180;40:46,020;"- One, two games."
40:46,020;40:48,380;"- Between '01 and '01, yeah, and this was one of them."
40:48,380;40:50,740;"- I guess, yeah."
40:50,740;40:51,580;"That was in the break."
40:51,580;40:53,140;"- He went nine and one."
40:53,140;40:55,940;"- Yeah, yeah, basically."
40:55,940;41:02,260;"And also the only other coach of note was Bob Sutton,"
41:02,260;41:04,380;"who was the linebacker's coach,"
41:04,380;41:07,040;"which with this line back in crew you think would be a good thing but then you"
41:07,040;41:07,680;"see"
41:07,680;41:09,600;"the historically bad"
41:09,600;41:13,940;"chief saw a defense of last year and how he was fired for being"
41:13,940;41:15,720;"absolutely gone awful"
41:15,720;41:16,760;"that's a fun note"
41:16,760;41:18,080;"you just brought everything down"
41:18,080;41:20,360;"well that was the idea"
41:20,360;41:22,880;"I harm Edwards"
41:22,880;41:24,200;"Harry will do that to a guy"
41:24,200;41:25,920;"to a podcast"
41:25,920;41:27,680;"you could talk"
41:27,680;41:28,640;"any"
41:28,640;41:29,700;"what"
41:29,700;41:31,680;"you should talk to somebody"
41:33,280;41:36,560;"What about about my anger toward people?"
41:36,560;41:38,280;"People I've never met."
41:38,280;41:40,840;"It is it's people I've never met."
41:40,840;41:44,880;"If I if I meet you, I'm less likely to be angry at you, I think."
41:44,880;41:45,480;"I don't know."
41:45,480;41:47,800;"I think I've made you pretty angry over the years."
41:47,800;41:49,120;"So that's a false statement."
41:49,120;41:51,360;"I feel like it's the other way around, actually."
41:51,360;41:54,920;"Yeah, it has actually been that way for a long time."
41:54,920;41:56,480;"Yeah."
41:56,480;41:59,920;"I mean, the the headbutt that I gave you in the face, that was by accident."
41:59,920;42:01,360;"If we're putting the cars in the chair."
42:01,360;42:03,040;"Just can't let it go, you know?"
42:03,040;42:05,800;"I could have, I mean, I don't condone violence,"
42:05,800;42:07,760;"but things could have gone a million different ways."
42:07,760;42:09,480;"And I'm a peaceful man."
42:09,480;42:12,360;"And he just won't let the headbutt thing go."
42:12,360;42:13,600;"And I don't understand."
42:13,600;42:15,560;"I mean, it's the headbutt of 15 years ago"
42:15,560;42:16,600;"for crying out loud."
42:16,600;42:17,520;"- Yeah, that's true."
42:17,520;42:20,680;"I don't know when he's telling you guys,"
42:20,680;42:23,520;"but I'm just frankly sick of it."
42:23,520;42:26,560;"- Oh, that's not what I've heard."
42:26,560;42:31,120;"- I'm just clear to mind that I wanted to bring up."
42:31,120;42:34,800;"Just to give a little start to the conversation is I was watching the big"
42:34,800;42:41,680;"Lebowski the other day and the baller. Yeah, I'm the genius."
42:41,680;42:51,280;"Look, I may or may not have heard that about 50,000 times. So thanks for being 50,000 at once."
42:51,280;42:58,560;"And I was also dressed up as that gentleman for Halloween premiere. So you can find those"
42:58,560;43:07,920;"picture. It will be a treat for you if you can dig that up. That would be a treat. Head,"
43:07,920;43:14,240;"a hair net and all. I think I'm looking at bowling ball. Yeah. And the purple jumpsy, right?"
43:14,240;43:19,920;"Yeah. Purple jumpsy of the whole shebang. Yeah. We're going to talk about what his character is"
43:19,920;43:23,440;"because I didn't really think about it until after I wore the costume that I probably don't"
43:23,440;43:30,840;"I don't want to be associated with that guy as a character, but it didn't look like I don't remember the character in the movie."
43:30,840;43:36,720;"I think the character in the movie allegedly may or may not have spent time with children. I don't know."
43:36,720;43:41,400;"I may have not been a little that fact."
43:41,400;43:44,360;"Yeah, that's what I was headed, but all right. Okay."
43:44,360;43:50,160;"Moving on, we all make mistakes, guys."
43:50,160;43:53,160;"Speaking of pedophile, how about the first half of this football game?"
43:53,160;43:57,160;"Oh boy. Yeah, I'm going to leave now guys. Thank you."
43:57,160;44:00,160;"What do you Steve?"
44:00,160;44:05,160;"Do we think he's really gone?"
44:05,160;44:08,160;"I don't think he's really gone."
44:08,160;44:16,160;"Yeah, so let's talk about this football game. You know, now that we're like 45 minutes into this 55 minutes into this."
44:16,160;44:17,160;"I'm going to do this."
44:17,160;44:19,160;"Oh, give me a lot of editing."
44:19,160;44:21,160;"Oh, I decided to come back guys."
44:21,160;44:22,160;"All right."
44:22,160;44:23,160;"Okay."
44:23,160;44:24,160;"Thank God."
44:24,160;44:25,160;"I'll give you one more chance."
44:25,160;44:27,160;"I couldn't sneak wide for that one."
44:27,160;44:30,160;"So we'll give this another go."
44:30,160;44:31,160;"All right."
44:31,160;44:32,160;"Let's do this."
44:32,160;44:34,160;"I'm on the edge."
44:34,160;44:35,160;"All right."
44:35,160;44:36,160;"Mike, lead us off for the first half."
44:36,160;44:38,160;"Tell me your thoughts on the first half of this game."
44:38,160;44:39,160;"The first half."
44:39,160;44:45,160;"I would say top 250 games I've ever seen played out."
44:45,160;44:47,160;"I'll tell you why."
44:47,160;44:54,820;"One that that judge do is just tough as nails. I remember like we said those those started star"
44:54,820;44:56,600;"studied team there"
44:56,600;45:00,960;"The punter Lee Johnson again. I said it last time. I'll say it again star punter"
45:00,960;45:04,680;"What else can you say the guys number one and everything?"
45:04,680;45:12,240;"For 42 miles or something like that total exactly it doesn't matter that he played for 72 years. He's amazing"
45:13,280;45:16,220;"Bottom of the barrel teams his entire career"
45:16,220;45:18,720;"Yeah"
45:18,720;45:23,080;"The running game I felt was far better just optics wise"
45:23,080;45:30,480;"I don't know how you guys felt about that, but I thought maybe they used four guys like you touched on but they were pretty pretty solid"
45:30,480;45:32,480;"I think"
45:32,480;45:35,120;"Don't know if you guys thought it was a"
45:35,120;45:43,160;"It was an an obvious upgrade or if you even knew I mean that that Antoine Smith would sort of be the"
45:43,160;45:49,260;"the guy. Yeah, it didn't feel like it from this game. It felt like they were sharing a"
45:49,260;45:56,540;"low like, like we taught touch on early. There's a lot of Mark Edwards getting actual physical"
45:56,540;46:02,780;"handoffs. My guess is going back to like, I think it was Greg talking about the dog"
46:02,780;46:12,100;"house. I don't think we I don't remember seeing as much Mark Edwards. But then again,"
46:12,100;46:18,660;"may just not be remembering correctly. But I feel like when thinking about the O1 season,"
46:18,660;46:24,900;"you think about Antoine Smith being the war course. And that wasn't happened in this game."
46:24,900;46:29,380;"It was much more spread out. There was a whole lot of JR Redmond and Mark Edwards and Kevin"
46:29,380;46:34,500;"Falk getting carries in this game. Yeah, I mean, it was all pretty even. But what stood out to me"
46:34,500;46:41,500;"in the first half was the unbelievable play of Drew Bledso."
46:41,500;46:43,500;"Okay."
46:43,500;46:49,500;"I feel like essentially every good play that he made was followed by a horrible one right"
46:49,500;46:50,500;"after it."
46:50,500;46:51,500;"Yes."
46:51,500;46:53,500;"I was hoping."
46:53,500;46:54,500;"Yeah."
46:54,500;46:57,500;"Yeah, and it happened time and time again."
46:57,500;46:58,500;"It was actually amazing."
46:58,500;46:59,500;"Yeah."
46:59,500;47:04,700;"That one intentional grounding where he's about to get shafting is like flip it."
47:04,700;47:05,700;"Skyarm."
47:05,700;47:08,700;"It's so good."
47:08,700;47:18,540;"Or they got down to the goal line and it's fourth in goal and they're going for it and"
47:18,540;47:21,780;"then Bloods Oak gets a delay a game."
47:21,780;47:28,500;"Yeah, the Red Zone and the crazy thing was that it was fourth down and you know some"
47:28,500;47:34,960;"no bell check mind games. Uh, they do a long snap or long count and then they,"
47:34,960;47:37,960;"somebody goes off sides and get the first down and then he pulls that right"
47:37,960;47:40,700;"after. Oh yeah. On the, on the field goal attempt, right?"
47:40,700;47:45,180;"Yep. Cause it was a chip shop field goal for them three or whatever it was."
47:45,180;47:48,700;"And they do a hard count on the field goal to get the defensive jump off."
47:48,700;47:52,380;"And that gets in the first down and then they drive down to the goal line and"
47:52,380;47:55,580;"then they kick a field goal anyway."
47:56,820;47:57,820;"I was a genius."
47:57,820;48:00,860;"I'm surprised more people don't do that."
48:00,860;48:02,180;"A hard count on a..."
48:02,180;48:04,620;"Yeah, I don't remember seeing that too much."
48:04,620;48:05,620;"Yeah."
48:05,620;48:06,620;"That was very bell check-in."
48:06,620;48:08,900;"I loved it."
48:08,900;48:10,700;"But every coach in the world does the..."
48:10,700;48:14,700;"It's fourth down and we come out and we hard count and let the clock run out."
48:14,700;48:17,700;"I hate that."
48:17,700;48:18,980;"It never works."
48:18,980;48:20,860;"It never works ever."
48:20,860;48:24,260;"But every coach is like, ""Oh, I'm going to get them on this one."""
48:24,260;48:25,260;"It's true."
48:25,260;48:26,260;"So, all right."
48:26,260;48:29,580;"They go for a fourth and then they just go on and you're like that sucks"
48:29,580;48:32,620;"So okay, I agree with you 100%"
48:32,620;48:37,160;"But recently the pages have started doing this thing where on"
48:37,160;48:43,420;"Fourth down they'll leave the offense out and they'll kind of linger and all of a sudden the offense will sprint off the field"
48:43,420;48:48,180;"And the pun team will sprint on and then I hate that I don't know why"
48:48,180;48:53,300;"But you know it's like one of these mind games and they're doing it for some specific reason. I just don't know what it is"
48:54,380;48:57,660;"It's the fuck with the fans cuz like all we're gonna go for I know"
48:57,660;49:04,220;"He's probably not fond of the fans or the media or his team or maybe"
49:04,220;49:09,860;"People in general"
49:09,860;49:14,420;"The Marius Thomas. Oh, yeah, that's kind of an interesting thing"
49:14,420;49:18,980;"It's also interesting that place is it's gonna speak out a little bit more a little bit more pellet tech stuff"
49:18,980;49:23,980;"I don't know if that's social media driven or whatnot, but interesting. Yeah, I mean I think it's it the"
49:23,980;49:28,700;"only guys ever seem to speak out about that stuff for guys who don't spend much time here."
49:28,700;49:34,940;"Who was the the cold swider receiver that we picked up and then he retired because it was too"
49:34,940;49:40,060;"hard. Reggie Wayne. Oh Wayne Krabat. Yeah. Yeah. What did you mean? Can I ask you a name for that?"
49:40,060;49:48,060;"Mr. I guess I guess I mean. Is that two underneath your eyes? Yes. Man. Yeah. Reggie Wayne. So Wayne"
49:48,060;49:54,620;"Corvette back to the game. Yeah. No, but my final note of the"
49:54,620;49:59,900;"half is that drooplets go ahead 17 yards passing. Oh my god."
49:59,900;50:08,060;"It was great. No, but also I think that they also mentioned"
50:08,060;50:11,420;"from how we were talking about Terry Glenn was suspended for the year by Bill Bellachek."
50:11,420;50:16,860;"Yeah. Ended up being like a four week suspension after the fact."
50:16,860;50:22,780;"So yeah, I think the league game of four weeks suspension and then he came back."
50:22,780;50:28,940;"He must have come back his Tom Brady's first ever touchdown pass was to Terry Glenn, wasn't it?"
50:28,940;50:30,220;"I think so."
50:30,220;50:36,460;"And then so he must come back and then I think other shit happened and then"
50:36,460;50:39,820;"Belichick just got sick of him and suspended him."
50:39,820;50:44,460;"But we should definitely look that up for the next podcast because, yeah, I first thought that he"
50:44,460;50:47,500;"he was suspended for the year, but I don't think that ended up happening."
50:47,500;50:53,900;"Yeah, I think I think I saw him say that it was like, he got suspended by the league,"
50:53,900;50:57,020;"and then he just didn't show up for like training camp and practice."
50:57,020;51:02,340;"So the Patriots were like, well, just for the year, but he must have changed at some points."
51:02,340;51:03,460;"Yeah."
51:03,460;51:10,700;"So the only other thing that I had for the first half was the emergence of the tuck rule"
51:10,900;51:15,140;"Because the only one long drive that the Jets had,"
51:15,140;51:17,260;"they were driving, they were in the red zone."
51:17,260;51:22,260;"And Estiverty got hit as his arm was like pulling"
51:22,260;51:25,780;"the ball back down again."
51:25,780;51:28,100;"Pages recovered the fumble, but then they overturned it"
51:28,100;51:30,740;"and the Jets ended up getting a tying field goal"
51:30,740;51:33,340;"at the end of the, yeah, and this game ended 3-3."
51:33,340;51:35,340;"- It's funny that they don't like bring that up"
51:35,340;51:37,220;"when the Tuck Rule was discussed."
51:37,220;51:38,620;"You know, they kind of make it seem like"
51:38,620;51:41,660;"That was the first time anyone had even thought of that."
51:41,660;51:42,500;"Right."
51:42,500;51:44,180;"The pace is not a reward."
51:44,180;51:44,980;"That's right."
51:44,980;51:45,480;"Exactly."
51:45,480;51:47,180;"It stands out."
51:47,180;51:49,380;"Foreshadowing, shall we say?"
51:49,380;51:50,380;"Right."
51:50,380;51:51,260;"That's crazy."
51:51,260;51:53,300;"I was actually having a conversation with some of my work"
51:53,300;51:58,500;"today about the ""Lion,"" the ""Miss"" calls and the ""Lion"" game."
51:58,500;52:01,500;"And I was like, they miss calls all the time."
52:01,500;52:02,300;"Sometimes you get them."
52:02,300;52:03,420;"Sometimes you don't."
52:03,420;52:05,020;"And the kid was like, oh, well, you don't"
52:05,020;52:07,820;"think that you're a Patriots fan and you get every call."
52:07,820;52:10,060;"It's like, no, you're just bitter."
52:10,060;52:12,580;"So you like the calls that went for the Patriots,"
52:12,580;52:13,500;"stick out in your mind."
52:13,500;52:17,100;"Like, yeah, cause it was gone against that."
52:17,100;52:18,580;"It's like, I'm just demon."
52:18,580;52:18,820;"Yeah."
52:18,820;52:20,540;"So stop thinking about it."
52:20,540;52:21,540;"Where's the fun in that?"
52:21,540;52:22,500;"I agree with you, man."
52:22,500;52:24,900;"I love being angry about things."
52:24,900;52:26,380;"Remember, I'll bet you about all of this."
52:26,380;52:29,820;"I still say Eli Manning should have been called in the grasp"
52:29,820;52:31,220;"in the helmet catch."
52:31,220;52:34,380;"Everything, Andy."
52:34,380;52:34,700;"Yeah."
52:34,700;52:35,420;"Problems, bro."
52:35,420;52:37,020;"(laughs)"
52:37,020;52:37,860;"- Yep."
52:37,860;52:38,700;"- It talks."
52:38,700;52:43,260;"- It is toxic, I love it."
52:43,260;52:48,260;"Yeah, so going back to the 17 yards passing,"
52:48,260;52:52,420;"the total yards in the first half,"
52:52,420;52:55,260;"the Jets had 136 and the Patriots had 90."
52:55,260;52:58,420;"- Yeah, it was tough to watch."
52:58,420;53:00,260;"- It was rough."
53:00,260;53:03,060;"The second half wasn't much better."
53:03,060;53:04,860;"Should we stop with that though?"
53:04,860;53:09,580;"All right, who's got notes on the second half? Oh, everybody great"
53:09,580;53:19,500;"Things will go with pink first"
53:19,500;53:26,300;"Um, there's just more blut"
53:26,300;53:31,260;"Genius play I mean"
53:31,260;53:33,820;"Beautiful bond to troy brown for"
53:34,220;53:37,940;"in the fourth, right, for a touchdown, or, yeah, 58 yarder."
53:37,940;53:41,420;"And then he throws a pick in the end zone,"
53:41,420;53:42,420;"return to midfield."
53:42,420;53:44,100;"So I guess it wasn't a touchdown."
53:44,100;53:46,860;"So yeah, 58 yard pass, they make it down the field,"
53:46,860;53:48,460;"throws a pick right after."
53:48,460;53:51,140;"- Did you see the replay when they were showing the pick?"
53:51,140;53:57,540;"And all, I think there was two or three receivers"
53:57,540;54:00,260;"to the right side of the field in the right corner"
54:00,260;54:01,860;"of the end zone, in the left corner,"
54:01,860;54:08,060;"It was one receiver and I believe it was either five or six defenders around him and bloods was like yep"
54:08,060;54:10,060;"No, that's my choice throw on to the left"
54:10,060;54:13,500;"Brutal yeah, but is it is it a kind of funny?"
54:13,500;54:17,060;"Soldier bloods. So I"
54:17,060;54:21,140;"Get a sick kick out of it looking back. I think it's"
54:21,140;54:24,980;"So I think this but this was my point"
54:24,980;54:28,340;"Go ahead Jay"
54:28,340;54:33,780;"You remember the feeling comes back so quickly of like yeah blood so awesome, but he also"
54:33,780;54:43,420;"Was that very because that very familiar feeling of futility at the end of games"
54:43,420;54:48,580;"Like well, we were kind of in it, but you know, this is what happens where the Patriots"
54:48,580;54:53,740;"You know, I mean, but if you look at it this way, he kept it interesting every week like with blue rating"
54:53,740;54:56,540;"You know, you kind of know what to expect"
54:57,060;55:02,720;"Well, we do now, but I think back in oh one I think the difference for this team and the reason they turn around was"
55:02,720;55:05,180;"It was still the same. I think"
55:05,180;55:08,700;"Brady wasn't any better than true blood so"
55:08,700;55:14,600;"But they were still keeping closely in the games and Brady would make that one last play at the end of the game"
55:14,600;55:16,780;"To get the W instead of losing the game"
55:16,780;55:23,660;"Yeah, and that's how they ran the whole team like all the way through oh four"
55:24,220;55:32,100;"Or until even 0.7 when Brady got his weapons. Yeah, I think what's those more talented quarterback like stronger arm"
55:32,100;55:40,140;"They both can't move so like it was all about like decision-making and like situational football that Brady was way better at"
55:40,140;55:43,700;"Right and that was how Belichick ran the team"
55:43,700;55:46,300;"Which I think is probably why Brady moved up the depth try so quickly"
55:46,300;55:51,460;"Because he could he understood the situational aspect of it better than the other guys. Yep"
55:52,060;55:59,780;"Yeah, so maybe maybe when people say Tom Brady's a system quarterback, that's the system they're talking about. They're right. They're right. Yes"
55:59,780;56:05,860;"Yeah, what an intelligent guy who makes good decisions and wins games a"
56:05,860;56:08,700;"guy who"
56:08,700;56:12,780;"His focus on the situational aspect of things is"
56:12,780;56:16,740;"Better than others that system I guess"
56:16,740;56:20,100;"We'll workshop that we'll workshop that we'll get there"
56:21,140;56:23,140;"How can we spend on this?"
56:23,140;56:26,260;"He's elite, but he's not Joe Flacko elite"
56:26,260;56:31,660;"And that one playoff run. Yeah, we're not gonna talk about that playoff run"
56:31,660;56:36,460;"I mean it flacko's playoff run was worth what a hundred and thirty million dollars or whatever the hell it was"
56:36,460;56:43,320;"Yeah, what a lot of yeah, that's you ruined the the Ravens, which is great. Yeah for years"
56:43,320;56:46,260;"Yeah, it's still recovering all right"
56:46,260;56:50,540;"So I mean, that's kind of the only thing that happened that half right was there anything else?"
56:50,540;56:58,760;"Was that game over 10 lights off good about nothing interesting else happened"
56:58,760;57:05,380;"Dry it up pretty quick drew blood so got pulled"
57:05,380;57:09,220;"Because of performance right"
57:09,220;57:14,260;"That's what they said. Yeah, I got I have the I have the quote here from"
57:14,460;57:21,780;"None other than our favorite Dan Deidorff were being told bloods of replacement not because of injury and there was actually"
57:21,780;57:25,300;"Some Belichick mind game. Well, there was a full"
57:25,300;57:29,220;"Article in the boss and globe the next day"
57:29,220;57:35,060;"Basically pitching about like Dan Deidorff pitching about no, not Danny. It was a whoever the sideline reporter was"
57:35,060;57:37,700;"I don't remember her name"
57:37,700;57:44,140;"But basically she went up and asked the PR people and like yep, no, it's not an injury related thing and everybody's like"
57:44,140;57:49,980;"Yeah, it is. Like, apparently even Gill and Gino on the radio broadcast, like they're"
57:49,980;57:52,140;"saying it's not an injury thing."
57:52,140;57:57,220;"Well, and I mean, we're obviously talking about Mo Lewis's hit on Bledso and sort of"
57:57,220;58:03,300;"him kind of finishing up that drive and then being pulled. But he was standing on the sideline."
58:03,300;58:07,460;"What I think is insane is Dini have a punctured lung and like internal bleeding and the guy"
58:07,460;58:10,300;"is just standing on the sideline like nothing happens."
58:10,300;58:11,300;"Yeah."
58:11,300;58:18,260;"I mean, I mean, they interviewed Brady after the game, and Brady actually said something"
58:18,260;58:24,300;"along the lines of, ""I was right there when you got hit, and if I ever get hit that hard,"
58:24,300;58:25,980;"I'm going to be in the hospital for a month."""
58:25,980;58:28,300;"Like, ""Droup, Bledzo can take a shot."""
58:28,300;58:30,100;"Oh, hell yeah, he can."
58:30,100;58:32,900;"I mean, he's tough."
58:32,900;58:38,940;"But I also couldn't see in the broadcast that I was able to watch, but I mean, wasn't his"
58:38,940;58:41,660;"whole face mask like bent when he took that shot."
58:41,660;58:46,420;"That's what they said. Yeah. But you couldn't see it. I mean, you"
58:46,420;58:50,020;"didn't really see him much with the helmet back on. Right. But"
58:50,020;58:50,740;"yeah, I didn't."
58:50,740;58:54,340;"It was like legend things. Yeah. Well, maybe it was bent, but it"
58:54,340;58:57,180;"was just like, not enough. You can actually see it sort of"
58:57,180;58:57,820;"thing. Right."
58:57,820;59:00,140;"It's technically bent."
59:00,140;59:06,460;"I mean, I just looking back, I don't know if it was a I"
59:06,460;59:13,100;"definitely remembered seeing face mask and just like I would do this it was so that didn't happen."
59:13,100;59:16,620;"Yeah, no, I don't think so. It was good to confirm that."
59:16,620;59:26,060;"Well, if you want to go conspiracy, I got one for you. Oh, God. They're all saying that, you know,"
59:26,060;59:31,420;"nobody really knew how hurt blood so was and that they put it back in the game and then they"
59:31,420;59:35,100;"finally pulled them. I think they knew how hard he was but put him back in the game anyway."
59:35,900;59:40,780;"But they just made him hand the ball off. All he did, he did two handoffs and a shovel pass,"
59:40,780;59:45,100;"and then they turned the ball over and he never saw the field again. I think they knew how hard he was."
59:45,100;59:49,980;"So what would be the purpose of that as a decoy?"
59:49,980;59:54,140;"No, so you can get more and Tom Brady can come in."
59:54,140;59:57,260;"Exactly. Oh, there you go. See? We got there."
59:57,260;01:00:02,380;"Well, the one score game, so they're probably hoping they could pull a game off."
01:00:02,940;01:00:09,180;"Yeah, that would probably my guess, but which Tom Brady almost they didn't seem like they were going to trust"
01:00:09,180;01:00:15,180;"Bloods out to throw the ball down, but to see his point, I think he's right you put Brady in there and you expect him to look like"
01:00:15,180;01:00:20,300;"The absolute goober that he looks like on his his player profile picture there"
01:00:20,300;01:00:25,420;"And like he just looked like normal Brady's out there just"
01:00:26,620;01:00:31,900;"calm and collected, picking up chunks of yards, actually moving the ball for the first time"
01:00:31,900;01:00:36,380;"through the year and the entire game. You had more than 17 passing errors, I think, in that"
01:00:36,380;01:00:42,220;"drive, right? Oh, did he? Well, I think one of his passes was for like 20 something yards,"
01:00:42,220;01:00:47,900;"so he must have. Well, and it was interesting because obviously, I mean, he didn't have command"
01:00:47,900;01:00:53,900;"of that, the first team, you know, so certain things were sloppy. He was a little bit slower"
01:00:53,900;01:01:00,140;"than maybe we're used to. But even in a sort of a two-minute drive, it still looked better than"
01:01:00,140;01:01:05,980;"Bledsoe's had in the last like five years. It did. It looked more in control. But you're right,"
01:01:05,980;01:01:13,900;"it was a lot slower than you expect from a Tom Bray-led offense because it's such a well-oiled"
01:01:13,900;01:01:18,940;"machine these days that they can run a two-minute offense in no time. But you're right, it was,"
01:01:18,940;01:01:26,140;"Yeah, I've let me see he was five of seven on the drive before I just started chucking the end zone because they didn't have it."
01:01:26,140;01:01:30,460;"So I mean, he was you walk right down the field quarterback injuries."
01:01:30,460;01:01:32,300;"Pat Mahomes just went to the locker room."
01:01:32,300;01:01:34,300;"Yeah."
01:01:34,300;01:01:35,540;"Oh, sure."
01:01:35,540;01:01:36,420;"You're playing right now."
01:01:36,420;01:01:37,420;"Oh, that's wild."
01:01:37,420;01:01:38,100;"It's Thursday night."
01:01:38,100;01:01:38,460;"That's right."
01:01:38,460;01:01:38,900;"I forgot."
01:01:38,900;01:01:40,900;"Whoa."
01:01:40,900;01:01:43,300;"So I don't."
01:01:43,300;01:01:46,540;"I'm pretty sure I've told one of you this."
01:01:47,140;01:01:52,980;"But my worry for Patrick Mahomes because I love watching that to play was that he's"
01:01:52,980;01:01:56,980;"going to be the next RG three where he lights the league on fire for a year and nobody can"
01:01:56,980;01:02:01,700;"stop him. But as soon as he starts, he gets that first injury, he just won't be the same guy."
01:02:01,700;01:02:04,020;"I'm a big fan too. He's awesome. Yeah."
01:02:04,020;01:02:10,260;"It's so fun to watch that guy play. He's amazing. Did you know it used to be a shortstop?"
01:02:10,260;01:02:11,620;"No."
01:02:11,620;01:02:16,900;"He's playing baseball. Yes. That was a baseball player."
01:02:16,900;01:02:23,940;"professional. Yeah. I mean, hopefully he heals up. I mean, I mean, you know, maybe when like,"
01:02:23,940;01:02:30,820;"if things go as they seem to go and, you know, Brady retires and whatever, I mean, this dude's"
01:02:30,820;01:02:35,940;"gonna be lighting up all kinds of teams and, you know, it's not gonna be fun for the Patriots,"
01:02:35,940;01:02:40,420;"perhaps, but it would be fun to see overall. But yeah, hopefully he doesn't hurt himself."
01:02:43,460;01:02:48,580;"Think it'd be him Watson him and you shot Watson not Jared said he goes out already"
01:02:48,580;01:02:52,980;"Jared sitoms already throw the pick six"
01:02:52,980;01:02:58,580;"What I want to take the brain to throw his first pick six good question still just ahead of the game"
01:02:58,580;01:03:01,300;"Can we check the stats on that?"
01:03:01,300;01:03:03,940;"I bet we could"
01:03:03,940;01:03:07,540;"I may have a step nice. Oh"
01:03:10,180;01:03:13,460;"I am the state all shit on with stupid stuff you guys say"
01:03:13,460;01:03:18,900;"And all the favor"
01:03:18,900;01:03:25,860;"Hi, here we go. I actually I have a list of Tom Brady's pick sixes his first one"
01:03:25,860;01:03:29,380;"Was"
01:03:29,380;01:03:31,540;"2001"
01:03:31,540;01:03:37,380;"October 28th against the Broncos in the fourth quarter. Does that make sense?"
01:03:38,700;01:03:40,700;"Yeah, first one"
01:03:40,700;01:03:45,600;"You can play for Troy Brown is intercepted by Dennard Walker"
01:03:45,600;01:03:51,240;"At the day nine in return for 39 yards for touch day. So what was that what we're here?"
01:03:51,240;01:03:57,140;"2001 it'll be this year, but it'll be in November against the Bronco. Let's see what we get"
01:03:57,140;01:04:01,640;"And I don't know what we get it. I guess he wanted a sad guy. That's pretty impressive actually we get these numbers"
01:04:05,180;01:04:06,380;"Why have this been saved?"
01:04:06,380;01:04:07,380;"Yeah."
01:04:07,380;01:04:14,940;"If this is like conspiracy themed based episode, then I'm starting to wonder why you have"
01:04:14,940;01:04:16,820;"all these numbers and if I can trust them."
01:04:16,820;01:04:19,020;"But we can discuss amongst ourselves."
01:04:19,020;01:04:20,700;"This is a pro football reference."
01:04:20,700;01:04:24,620;"I actually had it up for some other thing."
01:04:24,620;01:04:30,420;"Something about, because didn't James Winston throw like two or three pick sixes in one"
01:04:30,420;01:04:32,420;"single game recently this year?"
01:04:32,420;01:04:34,820;"I don't think it was him."
01:04:34,820;01:04:37,580;"maybe it's him or Fitzpaw for somebody."
01:04:37,580;01:04:40,500;"- Two and against the nine."
01:04:40,500;01:04:45,500;"- Yeah, so I was looking up how long ago it was"
01:04:45,500;01:04:47,860;"since Brady's thrown two."
01:04:47,860;01:04:52,860;"And it was his second to last one was December of 2017"
01:04:52,860;01:04:56,380;"against the Bills of all teams."
01:04:56,380;01:04:59,540;"And then one most recent one was obviously"
01:04:59,540;01:05:01,740;"the Falcons and Super Bowl."
01:05:01,740;01:05:02,580;"That same year."
01:05:02,580;01:05:05,820;"So, yeah, Cliff."
01:05:05,820;01:05:07,780;"All right."
01:05:07,780;01:05:11,980;"Anybody else want to talk about anything Brady did that jumped out to him?"
01:05:11,980;01:05:15,060;"I mean, I think he looked faster than I remember."
01:05:15,060;01:05:17,540;"Apparently he's fast."
01:05:17,540;01:05:21,460;"But yeah, well, I mean, I think he's more agile now, but I mean,"
01:05:21,460;01:05:23,420;"I think he was like hauling ass on that one run."
01:05:23,420;01:05:25,420;"Yeah, which was like three plays."
01:05:25,420;01:05:27,740;"It looked exactly the same as the one that bloods are going to hurt on."
01:05:27,740;01:05:31,580;"And it was like three plays later, but Brady died out of balance instead of"
01:05:32,100;01:05:37,700;"slowing, I feel like Bledsoe slowed down and like pulled up instead of stepping out of bounds. Yeah,"
01:05:37,700;01:05:43,860;"I just go whoa. I think it was a racing for the hit maybe. I guess I'm wondering because he got"
01:05:43,860;01:05:48,980;"caught from behind and I think that kind of threw him off bounds. We couldn't brace himself well"
01:05:48,980;01:05:53,220;"enough, but still, I don't know why he was slowing down. Let's just say you're saying that."
01:05:53,220;01:05:58,340;"I mean, I'm not putting words in your mouth, but you're saying that the reason that happened to"
01:05:58,340;01:06:01,660;"he got hurt and he punctured his lung was Bledso's fault."
01:06:01,660;01:06:03,740;"Yeah, 100%."
01:06:03,740;01:06:05,380;"That's that's fantastic."
01:06:05,380;01:06:08,620;"Because we have stepped out of bounds three steps before he did."
01:06:08,620;01:06:10,340;"And we turn up."
01:06:10,340;01:06:12,660;"And take on that."
01:06:12,660;01:06:13,780;"That that man."
01:06:13,780;01:06:17,140;"We ever interview him."
01:06:17,140;01:06:18,860;"I want you to tell him that."
01:06:18,860;01:06:20,660;"If you know he'll agree with him."
01:06:20,660;01:06:22,140;"I can feel it."
01:06:22,140;01:06:22,540;"OK."
01:06:22,540;01:06:24,740;"I personally think it was the Illuminati."
01:06:27,020;01:06:31,060;"We're going that deep. I mean, I knew I knew the Patriots."
01:06:31,060;01:06:33,900;"How'd you look at the $1 bill? Come on."
01:06:33,900;01:06:36,740;"This is the chem trails he saw him in this guy."
01:06:36,740;01:06:40,700;"Hey, you're right. I did watch that YouTube video that one time."
01:06:40,700;01:06:44,780;"It makes it all clear."
01:06:44,780;01:06:46,340;"Let's see. What else?"
01:06:46,340;01:06:50,260;"Only other thing I have for leftovers."
01:06:50,260;01:06:51,500;"I've update next time."
01:06:51,500;01:06:53,020;"Oh, I've updated. Let's go."
01:06:53,300;01:06:54,300;"I got a what?"
01:06:54,300;01:06:58,300;"You know, Flacko fumbled the ball for a touchdown from Chiefs."
01:06:58,300;01:06:59,300;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:59,300;01:07:00,300;"Go ahead."
01:07:00,300;01:07:01,300;"Bring that up."
01:07:01,300;01:07:06,300;"Now he's ruining the..."
01:07:06,300;01:07:07,300;"Good."
01:07:07,300;01:07:10,300;"We got to get back."
01:07:10,300;01:07:12,300;"We got to get regularly cleared."
01:07:12,300;01:07:13,300;"Connection, here."
01:07:13,300;01:07:14,300;"I know, no kidding."
01:07:14,300;01:07:17,300;"I'll mail him a microphone at this point."
01:07:17,300;01:07:18,300;"It's brutal."
01:07:18,300;01:07:25,900;"All right. So the only thing I had left were leftovers just from the broadcast in general,"
01:07:25,900;01:07:30,200;"them showing CMGI field in the background and the fact that it was going to be called"
01:07:30,200;01:07:37,660;"CMGI field. Did you remember that? That's a deep cut. That was a..."
01:07:37,660;01:07:41,900;"Would you care to elaborate? I actually looked up who CMGI was."
01:07:41,900;01:07:43,660;"Yeah, I don't even know what this is."
01:07:43,660;01:07:48,660;"- So apparently they were like a web company"
01:07:48,660;01:07:52,340;"that owned a bunch of,"
01:07:52,340;01:07:54,100;"they're actually out of Andover, Massachusetts,"
01:07:54,100;01:07:56,260;"but the article that I found was called,"
01:07:56,260;01:07:59,700;"""Could CMGI have been the Google of Boston?"""
01:07:59,700;01:08:02,460;"So they were like a big-ass tech company"
01:08:02,460;01:08:04,140;"that would buy smaller tech companies"
01:08:04,140;01:08:07,260;"and they owned, here we go,"
01:08:07,260;01:08:09,460;"included companies like Altavista,"
01:08:09,460;01:08:13,480;"like those Geo cities, Raging Boom, which I vaguely remember,"
01:08:13,480;01:08:15,940;"Snapfish, Yesmail, and others."
01:08:15,940;01:08:17,740;"So I think Altavista was there,"
01:08:17,740;01:08:20,420;"their big search engine that was supposed to be like,"
01:08:20,420;01:08:21,260;"- Oh yeah."
01:08:21,260;01:08:22,620;"- The Compounderies."
01:08:22,620;01:08:23,660;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:08:23,660;01:08:26,860;"Altavista and Ask Jeeves and all of those, Yahoo."
01:08:26,860;01:08:29,740;"And obviously we know what happened."
01:08:29,740;01:08:34,220;"But they got hit big by the dot com bubble."
01:08:34,220;01:08:38,260;"So they could no longer afford to rent the stadium."
01:08:38,260;01:08:42,620;"I look the worst stadium names."
01:08:42,620;01:08:45,020;"That's my dad name."
01:08:45,020;01:08:46,860;"I don't want to go this."
01:08:46,860;01:08:49,620;"It's in India, it's a cricket stadium."
01:08:49,620;01:08:52,700;"So this is a guy's name."
01:08:52,700;01:08:54,940;"So it's like Ralph Wilson or Lambo."
01:08:54,940;01:08:59,220;"His name is Dr. YS Rajasek."
01:08:59,220;01:09:05,420;"Are already the ACA, BDC, a cricket stadium."
01:09:07,180;01:09:09,180;"I love that you found out."
01:09:09,180;01:09:11,500;"I love that."
01:09:11,500;01:09:13,180;"What did you go to get there?"
01:09:13,180;01:09:15,180;"We need the stats guy, huh?"
01:09:15,180;01:09:16,480;"I know."
01:09:16,480;01:09:17,680;"What was I thinking?"
01:09:17,680;01:09:23,500;"Couldn't just say to Rod Stadium."
01:09:23,500;01:09:26,060;"Come on, buddy."
01:09:26,060;01:09:27,100;"Now you got to get the full name in,"
01:09:27,100;01:09:29,820;"but it doesn't have the same effect otherwise."
01:09:29,820;01:09:36,100;"Here, it'll signature line with all the acrons and bullshit."
01:09:36,100;01:09:41,100;"that's fantastic. Will you say Mike?"
01:09:41,100;01:09:44,860;"I don't know if you're going to talk about the other leftover, but I was going to bring"
01:09:44,860;01:09:50,340;"up what we're going to do the best and worst thing again, because I do have one that it's"
01:09:50,340;01:09:52,740;"actually a pretty good Bledso play."
01:09:52,740;01:09:56,420;"Yeah, let's do it. Give me your best somewhere, Mike."
01:09:56,420;01:10:04,220;"All right, for best. So Damian would be fumbles the shotgun snap and Bledso died on some of"
01:10:04,220;01:10:07,220;"while like a maniac as like two like jets are jumping on them."
01:10:07,220;01:10:12,060;"It made me think of like, you know, can't even the Super Bowl is like deciding"
01:10:12,060;01:10:13,460;"if you should jump on the ball and he does it."
01:10:13,460;01:10:14,580;"And like they could have won the game."
01:10:14,580;01:10:18,780;"And this is like, you know, against the jets week too."
01:10:18,780;01:10:21,060;"And the guys like putting his life on the line."
01:10:21,060;01:10:22,620;"So that was pretty awesome."
01:10:22,620;01:10:23,900;"That was great."
01:10:23,900;01:10:25,420;"That was this classic true blood."
01:10:25,420;01:10:26,420;"So."
01:10:26,420;01:10:28,180;"Oh, what?"
01:10:28,180;01:10:29,380;"But what did it?"
01:10:29,380;01:10:30,340;"What did you do the play after?"
01:10:30,340;01:10:32,780;"Cause I bet it was a what would I call them?"
01:10:32,780;01:10:39,460;"But clench blood so because oh yeah, nothing makes you but clenched tighter than drew blood so on third and long"
01:10:39,460;01:10:47,900;"That is great it's because I like I was I knew the outcome of the game"
01:10:47,900;01:10:52,940;"I've watched this game before and it's from 2001 and every time you draw back on third and 12"
01:10:52,940;01:10:56,440;"I could it was like an instinct. It's just like tighten up like oh oh oh"
01:10:56,440;01:10:59,840;"Oh, yeah, no, that was a bad decision"
01:11:00,900;01:11:07,100;"Every time so what's your best like that what country blood so now that was the best what was your best"
01:11:07,100;01:11:13,380;"Every time somebody other patrons such the ball outside of Tom Brady"
01:11:13,380;01:11:21,340;"There's too much man. There's like my kid where you do all that stuff. I'm actually going to it"
01:11:21,340;01:11:28,240;"So all right. I'm going to counterpoint that because my best was every time Troy Brown touched the ball"
01:11:29,540;01:11:37,620;"Because I remember like obviously I like have the soft spot for Troy Brown and I'm always like,"
01:11:37,620;01:11:44,980;"yeah, Troy Brown is my favorite, Patriots. But I never like, you kind of forget why until you go"
01:11:44,980;01:11:51,300;"back and actually watch the game and the dude is electric. And he was kind of the only weapon."
01:11:51,300;01:11:56,100;"It felt like he's he was the only weapon on the Patriots for years, but they never even really"
01:11:56,100;01:12:01,700;"utilized him for whatever reason. But like he's returning puns and he's like not calling for"
01:12:01,700;01:12:06,100;"a catch is even though the three guys were at him and still somehow managed to get 10 15 yards"
01:12:06,100;01:12:10,740;"on pun returns. Every time he catches the ball he goes for 20 yards. He's always wide open."
01:12:10,740;01:12:17,860;"And I wrote down like that that uh return that he had I was like for 23 yards but it was like"
01:12:17,860;01:12:24,020;"it looked amazing. Yeah. Oh yeah. He was in the second quarter. Yeah. Every time he touches the"
01:12:24,020;01:12:28,180;"ball. You're right. He probably should have called a fair catch for it. He's like, you"
01:12:28,180;01:12:34,740;"know what? No, I got this. And he's side steps that first guy every time. Like Edelman,"
01:12:34,740;01:12:40,500;"when he used to return him, I'm gonna, I'm gonna change my statement and say the versus"
01:12:40,500;01:12:44,620;"every time what I was involved in anything. I said that. All right."
01:12:44,620;01:12:48,540;"You're right. You convinced me. Quite a reversal."
01:12:48,540;01:12:52,140;"Uh, kind of, he's big."
01:12:52,140;01:12:59,860;"My thing, my, my worst was, um, watching Gerard Cherry try to be the poor man's Matthew's"
01:12:59,860;01:13:04,740;"that one play where he let the returner up before the returner even caught the ball."
01:13:04,740;01:13:11,460;"That's kind of being a gunner on the punt team is like not hitting the guy until it catches"
01:13:11,460;01:13:12,460;"the fucking thing."
01:13:12,460;01:13:14,460;"And then he gets up like, whoa, what do they do?"
01:13:14,460;01:13:17,620;"It's like, man, you know, Matthew's there."
01:13:17,620;01:13:19,620;"Maybe took a risk"
01:13:19,620;01:13:21,820;"Sure did"
01:13:21,820;01:13:24,700;"Sometimes you gotta you gotta go for it sometimes, you know"
01:13:24,700;01:13:28,300;"There was a quote in the paper the day after about him being like well"
01:13:28,300;01:13:32,980;"I think I kind of got pushed I'm like now I watch to see if you did you didn't get pushed at all, but"
01:13:32,980;01:13:37,500;"He just hammered through three guys against the kick returner"
01:13:37,500;01:13:40,220;"not a mission"
01:13:40,220;01:13:42,220;"It sounds my worst"
01:13:42,220;01:13:44,340;"What about you Steve? What's your best voice?"
01:13:45,260;01:13:48,540;"That pick blood so through that we talked about was just"
01:13:48,540;01:13:52,180;"fall"
01:13:52,180;01:13:59,860;"Come like they had like oh we can do a little momentum here and that so what's your worst?"
01:13:59,860;01:14:11,120;"Passes definitely get a little little taste of Tom Brady wants to come you know just an apertive"
01:14:11,120;01:14:14,580;"That's a good one"
01:14:14,580;01:14:18,580;"All right, Greg, give me some best and worst."
01:14:18,580;01:14:23,580;"Yes, I didn't have a best and worst, but I have one note that we didn't talk about."
01:14:23,580;01:14:29,580;"I don't know if you guys caught this, but they were talking about Kevin Swain and how."
01:14:29,580;01:14:38,580;"So I looked up his Wikipedia. This guy at one point played 52 straight weeks of professional football."
01:14:38,580;01:14:45,580;"So he played for the NFL, the AFL, and the XFL all in one year."
01:14:45,580;01:14:49,580;"52 straight week."
01:14:49,580;01:14:52,580;"That's a full year plan every week."
01:14:52,580;01:14:55,580;"Good to go."
01:14:55,580;01:14:57,580;"And maybe like the exit."
01:14:57,580;01:14:59,580;"This dynasty might."
01:14:59,580;01:15:04,580;"Alas, two iterations of the XFL if we're lucky."
01:15:04,580;01:15:06,580;"which could be awesome."
01:15:06,580;01:15:08,820;"(laughing)"
01:15:08,820;01:15:10,820;"- That would be amazing."
01:15:10,820;01:15:13,220;"So that sounds like it's your best."
01:15:13,220;01:15:14,620;"- Yeah, we'll call that my best."
01:15:14,620;01:15:15,620;"- Yeah, hell yeah."
01:15:15,620;01:15:17,180;"- Yeah, you can go ahead though."
01:15:17,180;01:15:18,740;"- No, no worse."
01:15:18,740;01:15:19,940;"- No, that's all I had."
01:15:19,940;01:15:21,860;"- An eternal optimist, I like it."
01:15:21,860;01:15:24,500;"- Yeah, yep."
01:15:24,500;01:15:25,980;"- Yeah, what about the,"
01:15:25,980;01:15:30,980;"you could use the jumbo Tron in the old Shafer stadium,"
01:15:33,140;01:15:35,260;"I look like they were calling at this point, Fox Rose Stadium."
01:15:35,260;01:15:37,580;"That thing looked beat."
01:15:37,580;01:15:40,340;"Like broken pixels and shit."
01:15:40,340;01:15:41,540;"Do you hear them make?"
01:15:41,540;01:15:43,860;"Confront of the stadium and the commentators."
01:15:43,860;01:15:44,540;"Yeah."
01:15:44,540;01:15:48,820;"Whether like, oh, they're going to, they're going to sure miss this place."
01:15:48,820;01:15:50,660;"And then do it all 10 with a not."
01:15:50,660;01:15:51,500;"Oh, yeah."
01:15:51,500;01:15:52,580;"Like."
01:15:52,580;01:15:53,180;"Yeah."
01:15:53,180;01:15:54,700;"Yeah."
01:15:54,700;01:15:56,180;"Fucking dear to earth."
01:15:56,180;01:15:58,780;"The most used in the not joke."
01:15:58,780;01:16:00,140;"God."
01:16:00,140;01:16:00,740;"Yeah."
01:16:00,740;01:16:02,340;"You know, it's all about the whole fan."
01:16:02,340;01:16:04,340;"All the same career."
01:16:04,340;01:16:06,340;"No, all the famer."

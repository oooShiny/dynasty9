00:00,000;00:06,720;This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,
00:06,720;00:10,920;you have the choice not to. My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying
00:10,920;00:15,720;to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid. You still want to listen? Go right
00:15,720;00:24,680;ahead. I am not your mother.
00:24,680;00:29,240;Welcome back to the Pageant's Dynasty podcast, the podcast where we're going back and rewatching
00:29,240;00:33,620;every game of the dynasty era. Uh, we haven't actually done that in a while.
00:33,620;00:38,720;But we are back at it today. And with me are the trusty brothers,
00:38,720;00:41,180;Brown, Steven, Greg boys. How you doing?
00:41,180;00:44,780;I'm doing great and full piss and vinegar for this playoff.
00:44,780;00:46,300;Right.
00:46,300;00:50,300;It's all at this point, you know, oh, um,
00:50,300;00:53,020;beating the cults again.
00:53,020;00:57,460;Wake me up in the super bowl.
00:57,460;01:04,420;Well, all right. So, yeah, if you hadn't, if you weren't aware, if you've forgotten,
01:04,420;01:08,980;because it's been so long since we've done one of these, we are starting the 2004 playoffs
01:08,980;01:15,060;with the AFC divisional round where the Colts would come to Foxborough Stadium. No,
01:15,060;01:19,140;Foxborough, Massachusetts, Gillette Stadium, no longer Foxborough Stadium.
01:20,580;01:27,620;to play the New England Patriots who came into the game at 14 and two. No big deal.
01:27,620;01:33,540;Colts would finish their season 12 and four. One of those losses was to this New England Patriots.
01:33,540;01:41,540;The first week of the season. And after that game, they mentioned in this, the announcers
01:41,540;01:46,020;were saying that Tony Dungy said, "Because we lost that, we'll be playing them in January
01:46,020;01:48,660;at their place." That's right. He foreshadowed this.
01:48,660;01:54,020;He sure did. He was correct. But this was...
01:54,020;01:55,220;He should have done something about it.
01:55,220;01:57,220;That game was at Indianapolis too, right?
01:57,220;01:59,620;No, it was Banner Night, Stevie. Come on.
01:59,620;02:01,540;It was Banner Night, baby.
02:01,540;02:05,300;You're thinking of the goal line stop game that was last year.
02:05,300;02:07,140;Yeah, that was 2003.
02:07,140;02:16,980;Yeah, this year was Peak Peyton Manning. This was what all the kids have forgotten when they say
02:16,980;02:26,340;that whoever their favorite current quarterback is, is the best quarterback ever. The scariest
02:26,340;02:33,860;quarterback ever. Can I get that off my chest? Goat, that whole acronym is the most overused thing
02:33,860;02:40,580;in not even just sports, but in everything. I feel like it wasn't really a thing before
02:40,580;02:44,660;Brady though. It wasn't. Maybe Jordan. It wasn't. Maybe Jordan started it?
02:44,660;02:47,940;And then I think it came around like the same time people started going Brady
02:47,940;02:50,500;to go and then they're like, well, Jordan's the go.
02:50,500;02:55,300;And then next thing you know, everybody under the sun is the goddamn goat.
02:55,300;02:56,420;It's true. Yeah.
02:56,420;03:00,740;Look at this little goat I have from Chewy still.
03:00,740;03:02,580;Remember this thing, Greg?
03:02,580;03:04,460;What? Why do you have that?
03:04,460;03:08,300;Because you know me, I like keeping old shit for way too long.
03:08,300;03:10,900;What significance to that?
03:10,900;03:12,180;I thought that was before.
03:12,180;03:15,060;This is the Tom Brady goat that we had in the minivan.
03:15,060;03:18,500;I would have thought the minivan out dated that.
03:18,500;03:21,860;Oh, no, this thing is definitely chewy.
03:21,860;03:26,900;So for those that don't know, we used to have a Plymouth Grand Voyager that was originally purple
03:26,900;03:32,820;until we rattle canned it four, five, six times into different things.
03:32,820;03:36,740;I think when it died, was it still the green monster?
03:36,740;03:39,780;We redid the green monster at one time.
03:39,780;03:41,780;Yeah, we did. Yeah, we did that one twice, I think.
03:41,780;03:45,860;- Why do we never do a Patriots, a goat version, you know?
03:45,860;03:48,940;- Yeah, this is too gauche.
03:48,940;03:51,820;- We could have changed the license plate to goat.
03:51,820;03:53,500;- We could have.
03:53,500;03:56,180;We could have done it like the Dumb and Dumber.
03:56,180;03:58,660;- Did you say that's too gauche, Andy?
03:58,660;03:59,500;- Yeah.
03:59,500;04:00,340;(laughs)
04:00,340;04:01,160;- Jesus Christ.
04:01,160;04:02,300;- Actually, you know why?
04:02,300;04:06,380;It was because I could only do straight lines with the tape.
04:06,380;04:09,560;So I could do the boxes for Fenway Park,
04:10,640;04:15,200;But I couldn't do like, I wasn't able to freehand the Patriots logo and spray
04:15,200;04:19,640;paint. How do we do those silver flames then?
04:19,640;04:20,860;Cause those things are tits.
04:20,860;04:22,360;Those were awful.
04:22,360;04:27,080;We just spray paint. We just got spray paint from the store.
04:27,080;04:31,340;Well, that was when Pimp My Ride was, was hot in the streets.
04:31,340;04:32,260;That's true.
04:32,260;04:36,140;So you bought a spinning hubcaps that would helicopter off the side of the van.
04:36,140;04:37,420;If you were on highway speeds.
04:37,560;04:42,200;And if you remember the first iteration, we just literally wrote pimp my ride in
04:42,200;04:47,160;spray paint and mom was like, you will not be driving a car that says pimp around
04:47,160;04:50,360;on it to be fair.
04:50,360;04:52,200;Yeah, that's kind of legit.
04:52,200;04:53,040;Yeah.
04:53,040;04:54,440;Yeah.
04:54,440;04:54,840;Yeah.
04:54,840;04:56,160;That was a wise decision by her.
04:56,160;05:04,240;But, uh, speaking of, of pimping, pimping rides, this colt offense was, it
05:04,240;05:07,080;was big pimping in the exhibit of.
05:07,280;05:14,320;The NFL at that point. 100% yeah, because if you like a thousand yard receivers, they'll give you not one, not two, but three
05:14,320;05:17,920;One thousand yard receivers in the same season. Can you name them?
05:17,920;05:20,720;Yep, Harrison Wayne Stokely
05:20,720;05:24,240;You're reading my notes, aren't you? No, I'm reading my own notes
05:24,240;05:28,960;Look who came prepared for the playoffs. Holy shit
05:28,960;05:34,720;You didn't get in order but that's cool enough. They had rookie Dallas Clark too, the tight end
05:35,680;05:38,960;I don't know if it was rookie, but it was early Dallas clock. Yeah, it's definitely early.
05:38,960;05:43,920;Yeah. And he went for, I don't know, like close to a thousand yards. And then the only real players
05:43,920;05:50,160;they had on defense was Dwight Freene and Robert Mathis, who were SAC specialists, especially in
05:50,160;05:57,360;the dome on that turf. I think Freene actually led the league with 16 sacks. Mathis had 10 and a
05:57,360;06:02,680;half himself. And then they also had rookie Bob Sanders, their
06:02,680;06:06,600;first pick of the 2004 draft, which came around two, I don't
06:06,600;06:07,840;know what happened in the first draft.
06:07,840;06:14,320;So with this offense, you know, you'd think they would go pretty
06:14,320;06:17,900;heavy in the draft colts. So two other farmers gonna give you the
06:17,900;06:21,960;positions that they drafted. Safety tight end linebacker,
06:21,960;06:24,720;linebacker, cornerback, guard, cornerback, quarterback, kicker.
06:26,400;06:31,600;All of those players except the kicker actually made the roster and this defense was garbage.
06:31,600;06:34,800;There's no names on here that are actually worth.
06:34,800;06:38,160;I was like middle of the road though, weren't they?
06:38,160;06:49,120;17th or something in points. It was one of those things where the other teams, the powerhouses in
06:49,120;06:55,520;the AFC were the first and second scoring defenses. And then it was the Colts who just decided,
06:55,520;06:57,320;We're not doing defense this year.
06:57,320;07:02,000;Uh, and they just, they just won games on, on offense alone.
07:02,000;07:04,920;But I mean, their offense is historically good.
07:04,920;07:08,600;Like we talked about it last year about how hot they were coming into that.
07:08,600;07:15,200;They see championship game, but this team was arguably a better offense than
07:15,200;07:16,800;the Colts team last year.
07:16,800;07:17,500;This was a record.
07:17,500;07:18,720;This was a historical time.
07:18,720;07:19,560;So yeah.
07:19,560;07:20,000;Yeah.
07:20,000;07:25,000;Uh, cause this was the year that Peyton Manning broke Marino's touchdown record
07:25,080;07:27,760;where they threw 49 touchdowns in the season.
07:27,760;07:32,720;And man, it was named MVP, of course.
07:32,720;07:34,840;And they actually, the Colts themselves
07:34,840;07:36,640;threw 51 total touchdown passes
07:36,640;07:39,800;because Jim Sorji played,
07:39,800;07:42,180;he didn't actually start the last game of the season,
07:42,180;07:44,580;but he played most of it with the starters
07:44,580;07:46,380;and threw a couple touchdown passes.
07:46,380;07:51,760;And actually the Colts were,
07:51,760;07:53,480;again, one of the hottest teams in the league.
07:53,480;07:58,360;pages haven't lost since we gate to the Steelers still. Um,
07:58,360;08:00,440;no, that's not right. They lost, uh,
08:00,440;08:04,600;they lost that card war to Miami. Yeah.
08:04,600;08:09,120;And I courage war orange. That's right. Exactly. Right. Um,
08:09,120;08:11,760;Colts also nine and one in their last 10 games,
08:11,760;08:15,340;the only game they lost was they played Denver last week of the season in
08:15,340;08:19,640;Denver. And then I think Denver like had to win to get in the playoffs.
08:19,640;08:22,920;And if Denver won, they would play the Colts in Indianapolis.
08:22,920;08:25,920;So the culture is like trot out the second team and lost.
08:25,920;08:30,920;But then they smoked the Broncos next week at home.
08:30,920;08:32,920;They scored five touchdowns in the first half.
08:32,920;08:36,920;Yeah, it was 49, 49, 24, 35 to one at halftime.
08:36,920;08:38,920;Manning threw four.
08:38,920;08:43,920;He was 27 to 33 for 457 four touchdowns,
08:43,920;08:47,920;which was the second highest passing total in a playoff game up to that point.
08:47,920;08:48,920;Yeah.
08:48,920;08:49,920;Yeah.
08:49,920;08:51,920;Reggie Wayne had 10 catches, 221 yards and two touchdowns.
08:51,920;08:53,760;and two touchdowns in that game.
08:53,760;08:56,200;- 'Cause they were picking on, I actually found,
08:56,200;08:58,920;for some reason, there's no video of that game.
08:58,920;09:01,960;Like I even found the prime time,
09:01,960;09:05,840;like post game highlights clip of like all the games.
09:05,840;09:08,160;And for some reason that game had been cut out.
09:08,160;09:12,200;So I don't know why, but I have nerd connections as I do.
09:12,200;09:15,080;And I found the extended highlights
09:15,080;09:18,260;and it was basically, do you remember Rock Alexander?
09:18,260;09:20,160;- No. - No.
09:20,160;09:20,980;- I don't remember him for the name.
09:20,980;09:24,900;defensive back on the Broncos and he had a bad day covering Reggie Wayne.
09:24,900;09:27,380;So he just got torched the entire day.
09:27,380;09:31,060;I don't think you needed to watch the highlights to gather that Andy.
09:31,060;09:37,220;No, it was literally just Peyton Manning picking on this one defensive back for our five touch
09:37,220;09:40,180;to four touchdowns and 400 yards. Ridiculous.
09:40,180;09:43,860;And then the Patriots don't have Tyler or Tyrone Poole.
09:43,860;09:49,140;The Patriots are starting, you know, Brandon Sowkli, a thousand yard receiver in the slot
09:49,780;09:53,140;is going up against Troy Brown as the defensive back.
09:53,140;09:54,680;Yeah, it's crazy.
09:54,680;09:59,040;What was the what was the line on this game?
09:59,040;09:59,840;Who's favored?
09:59,840;10:00,940;Patriots by one.
10:00,940;10:04,180;So technically the Colts because you get three points at home.
10:04,180;10:05,380;Yeah.
10:05,380;10:07,880;Wait, what I what I'm going to do.
10:07,880;10:09,080;Biggest general spot.
10:09,080;10:10,180;Patriots by four, you mean?
10:10,180;10:12,040;We're playing by home.
10:12,040;10:13,580;No, it's pages by one.
10:13,580;10:15,140;Yeah, so Patriots by four.
10:15,140;10:17,240;Manoff is on a neutral field to be Colts by two.
10:17,240;10:18,380;Right, exactly.
10:18,380;10:20,380;So here I'm going to play you the intro to this though.
10:20,380;10:24,140;Because it was pretty legit.
10:24,140;10:27,340;To the game right now.
10:27,340;10:29,420;Yeah. Yeah. To the game.
10:29,420;10:31,020;How long is it?
10:31,020;10:33,020;A minute.
10:33,020;10:41,660;They are the talk of the National Football League and everyone is asking the same question.
10:43,660;10:44,860;- And he got a tiny fire.
10:44,860;10:45,700;- Touchdown over the middle.
10:45,700;10:46,540;- Touchdown!
10:46,540;10:47,860;- Oh, that was two weeks.
10:47,860;10:48,700;- Touchdown!
10:48,700;10:49,540;- Touchdown!
10:49,540;10:52,540;- And the movie stopped.
10:52,540;10:53,380;- Three words.
10:53,380;10:54,220;- Defense.
10:54,220;10:55,040;- Defense.
10:55,040;10:55,880;- Defense.
10:55,880;10:56,820;(upbeat music)
10:56,820;11:00,180;- Bill Velveczyk's Patriots had the answer a year ago.
11:00,180;11:03,300;Stifling Peyton Manning and Indianapolis' attempt
11:03,300;11:04,780;to go to the Super Bowl.
11:04,780;11:10,220;This season, they met again with the same result.
11:10,220;11:11,620;- Willy Mcgillis, he's back.
11:11,620;11:12,460;- The gift is up.
11:12,460;11:13,300;The gift is...
11:13,300;11:15,300;No good! No good!
11:15,300;11:25,500;A win today would advance the Patriots place in history and add to the talk of their modern-day dynasty.
11:25,500;11:31,640;They haven't lost at home in over two years and the same question applies.
11:31,640;11:36,460;Just press the hands, commit teamwork.
11:36,460;11:37,460;Here we go.
11:37,460;11:38,460;And back to back.
11:38,460;11:39,460;Good job!
11:39,460;11:40,460;Touchdown!
11:40,460;11:41,460;Give me an ambulance!
11:41,900;11:45,980;The Colts are on a roll and focused on finally winning in Foxborough
11:45,980;11:49,120;New England
11:49,120;11:51,140;in the Annapolis
11:51,140;11:53,920;Two teams with the same question
11:53,920;11:57,640;Which team will have the answer today?
11:57,640;12:00,700;This game time, baby
12:00,700;12:07,560;How hard are your nipples Andy oh
12:10,360;12:11,200;- Oh yeah.
12:11,200;12:13,600;- I guess we need to fucking stop the podcast.
12:13,600;12:14,920;- Yeah, if I can't be on it,
12:14,920;12:15,960;nobody can be on it. - How come I'm being
12:15,960;12:17,240;self-centered? - This is my thing.
12:17,240;12:19,200;I'm gonna stop recording.
12:19,200;12:21,000;Satan Manning over here.
12:21,000;12:23,660;(both laughing)
12:23,660;12:27,000;You're right, how the fuck does that happen?
12:27,000;12:28,080;- How did we not think of that?
12:28,080;12:28,920;- Yeah.
12:28,920;12:31,360;- Hey man, that's pretty clever.
12:31,360;12:32,280;- It's perfect.
12:32,280;12:33,560;- Yeah, that's fantastic.
12:33,560;12:36,640;- Even though he's kind of a lovable guy at this point, but.
12:36,640;12:38,560;- Well, that's how Satan died, you know?
12:38,560;12:41,140;That's how Satan gets you to drop your guard.
12:41,140;12:42,060;- That's true.
12:42,060;12:43,660;- Tell us more about that, Steve.
12:43,660;12:44,940;- Yeah, I would see his horns.
12:44,940;12:46,540;Sometimes he looks a little friendly,
12:46,540;12:49,420;but then he gets in there and he's a real piece of shit.
12:49,420;12:51,420;And he makes his wife buy his HGH.
12:51,420;12:53,660;- Is that why sins feel so good?
12:53,660;12:54,500;- Yes.
12:54,500;12:55,320;- Okay.
12:55,320;12:56,160;- It's the kind of sins, Greg.
12:56,160;12:57,540;- I don't know.
12:57,540;13:00,500;- Since you were doing on your little hiatus there, Andy.
13:00,500;13:02,660;- I don't know what the hell happened there.
13:02,660;13:03,980;- You've been covetous, Andy?
13:03,980;13:04,820;- It's been a day.
13:04,820;13:08,300;Yes, covetous of not being on the podcast.
13:08,300;13:09,300;I believe it.
13:09,300;13:12,740;We'll let you back in, I guess.
13:12,740;13:16,460;Speaking of Covetous, Patriots haven't lost at home in two years.
13:16,460;13:17,460;Did you hear that part?
13:17,460;13:18,460;I did.
13:18,460;13:19,460;Did you hear that part?
13:19,460;13:22,940;Yeah, it was pretty awesome.
13:22,940;13:29,500;But I think if we're talking Covetous, we should talk about the Boston Globe.
13:29,500;13:36,020;Because we have, we actually have a new intern who will join us at some point.
13:36,020;13:38,780;our buddy Tim, who is helping out.
13:38,780;13:42,040;And so we cut up some of the Boston Globe articles.
13:42,040;13:45,260;And my favorite are the staff picks,
13:45,260;13:48,380;because all of them have scores in the 30s,
13:48,380;13:51,600;except for on board just where you only gave the calls
13:51,600;13:53,600;28 points to beating the Patriots.
13:53,600;14:00,460;And Bob Ryan was probably the,
14:00,460;14:05,580;your typical Bob Ryan, Boston Sports Media,
14:05,580;14:07,320;- Negativity.
14:07,320;14:09,160;Pick cults 31, pages 28.
14:09,160;14:11,240;A game I've been dreading for two months.
14:11,240;14:13,840;- That doesn't sound that negative.
14:13,840;14:14,680;- Bob Ryan.
14:14,680;14:15,520;- It's a 3.8.
14:15,520;14:16,360;- Go fuck yourself.
14:16,360;14:17,180;Bob Ryan, what a dang.
14:17,180;14:18,280;- How can you get mad about that, Andy?
14:18,280;14:19,120;You...
14:19,120;14:21,480;- Watch me.
14:21,480;14:24,280;- Is that a real question?
14:24,280;14:25,120;- Yeah, was that rhetorical?
14:25,120;14:27,360;- Every day you're wrestling with how cynical
14:27,360;14:28,660;you can actually be.
14:28,660;14:31,620;- All right, what about this?
14:31,620;14:34,160;Dan Shaughnessy, patrons 35, cults 34,
14:34,160;14:38,820;Patriots get break when Vander Jack misses extra point as Walt Coleman erroneously rules wide, right?
14:38,820;14:42,360;I like that way to take that seriously Danch honestly
14:42,360;14:48,940;Like we take this seriously I get why they're picking high scores though
14:48,940;14:53,320;I mean, I think it was supposed to the there's in the weather is supposed to miss
14:53,320;14:57,700;Yeah, it wasn't supposed to come to later. Yeah, which would have made a lot more sense
14:57,700;15:02,800;But I mean even having said that though the Colts just came out like running the ball
15:03,400;15:11,080;Which kind of made sense because they, they had a lot of success in week one with running the ball against the Patriots.
15:11,080;15:13,440;They ran for like almost 200 yards, I think. Is that right?
15:13,440;15:17,640;Um, and like their scoring drives were mostly like run based.
15:17,640;15:23,920;But still like they just came out trying to run the ball and it wasn't working early and they didn't really get away from it very quickly.
15:23,920;15:30,480;They, uh, like they went three and out the first few drives and then back to it.
15:31,040;15:36,040;Uh, like they're the only real drive they had was, uh, when they, they scored their
15:36,040;15:39,360;only points in the game, field goal right before half, they got the ball back with
15:39,360;15:43,760;a minute, 52 left 11 plays minute, 52 and, and kicked the field goal.
15:43,760;15:44,560;Your gun.
15:44,560;15:47,760;They're gun shy.
15:47,760;15:49,400;They don't know what to do.
15:49,400;15:51,920;They're own six in new England with Manning.
15:51,920;15:54,160;So they're like, we gotta try something different because what we've been
15:54,160;15:55,280;doing does not work.
15:55,280;15:55,880;Yeah.
15:55,880;15:56,640;Got in their own heads.
15:56,640;16:00,240;- You got our man, Chris Parman last week.
16:00,240;16:02,240;- He was saying the same thing.
16:02,240;16:03,600;Like we asked him about Miami.
16:03,600;16:05,200;He's like, we just get in our own heads.
16:05,200;16:06,320;That's all it is.
16:06,320;16:07,520;That's the reason we lose my email time
16:07,520;16:08,840;because we're just getting our own heads.
16:08,840;16:11,440;- That being said, taking the ball out of the MVP
16:11,440;16:14,920;who just set the touchdown record is a bold strategy.
16:14,920;16:17,040;- It is.
16:17,040;16:18,800;- But I guess Adrian James is pretty good too though.
16:18,800;16:20,240;You know, you can argue that.
16:20,240;16:22,320;- He was a thousand yard rusher.
16:22,320;16:29,120;The Manning was 27 of 42, 238, no touchdowns, one interception.
16:29,120;16:34,000;Sacked once for 18 yards, but I mean 42 attempts.
16:34,000;16:35,460;How many attempts did he have the week before?
16:35,460;16:36,600;Craig?
16:36,600;16:38,400;33.
16:38,400;16:39,120;33.
16:39,120;16:44,920;He had less attempts technically the week before and had 458 yards.
16:44,920;16:47,480;And this one he had 42 attempts.
16:47,480;16:51,240;A lot of those like at the end of the game, they're just like trying to chuck it around,
16:52,000;16:53,160;But it was too late at that point.
16:53,160;16:55,560;I mean, you build your team to play on Parrif.
16:55,560;16:58,940;You can't really, uh, you can't really bitch your moan when you,
16:58,940;17:00,600;when you lose on grass.
17:00,600;17:01,800;It was true.
17:01,800;17:05,560;And there was some, uh, there was some controversy about that too, about how.
17:05,560;17:11,640;The, uh, the Patriots were letting the field get sloppy, like they
17:11,640;17:13,000;didn't cover it or something in time.
17:13,000;17:16,720;Um, let's see.
17:16,720;17:18,080;It's, I think that was in the globe too.
17:18,520;17:23,440;It was, yeah, basically the feel was, was because of the weather, like,
17:23,440;17:26,580;oh yeah, they, they let it, they didn't cover it overnight.
17:26,580;17:27,620;And so it was supposed to be bad.
17:27,620;17:32,780;Um, but it turns off, turns out that, uh, that wasn't the case.
17:32,780;17:39,060;Um, they, uh, covered it when there was supposed to be covered.
17:39,060;17:43,060;And, you know, it was all just garbage, but it was, I remember that being brought
17:43,060;17:49,940;up after the game by a lot of, you know, Colts fans and Colts media and stuff like that about,
17:49,940;17:54,980;you know, Patriots cheating again and all of that jazz, which Greg thoughts.
17:54,980;18:04,020;Um, have you seen the Vic documentary on ESPN? No, dude. First of all, you should watch it.
18:04,020;18:10,740;Vic, Michael, Vic is the fucking man. Like he's, he's exactly what you would want a like,
18:11,540;18:15,800;how like putting someone in jail should work of like, yeah, he got
18:15,800;18:19,340;caught up with his childhood friends. He really wasn't like a terrible person.
18:19,340;18:23,540;They put him in jail and he was like, came out a changed man and has been
18:23,540;18:28,500;great ever since. But the point being, he was talking about when he gets on the
18:28,500;18:32,900;turf and he's like, boy, you put me on that turf. Ain't nobody stopping me,
18:32,900;18:38,220;which I think is fair. You get like these crazy athletes. That is like a
18:38,220;18:44,620;really big factor in games like this. We saw a free knee on the turf, like how much faster he looks.
18:44,620;18:49,260;You build your team. I mean, greatest show on turf is another good example. You have a team that's
18:49,260;18:56,940;built around speed and quickness and athleticism. I think that is worth like 10 points.
18:56,940;18:59,580;Per game or just generally?
18:59,580;19:01,660;Per game.
19:01,660;19:03,900;Jesus. Okay. Yeah. I mean.
19:05,020;19:12,380;So do you think maybe the move from natural grass to synthetic turf has increased the speed of the
19:12,380;19:21,820;NFL, right? I would say it slows it down. I think the synthetic stuff is closer to grass than turf.
19:21,820;19:25,340;But they've gone away from both, right? There's no more like the old school turf,
19:25,340;19:30,060;the greatest show on turf turf. That shit was awesome. And there's no more sloppy-
19:30,060;19:32,780;No, they should. It was literally carpet on concrete.
19:33,420;19:40,980;Did that just destroy people so was the opposite end of the spectrum of the just sloppy slop grass mud?
19:40,980;19:44,260;And in in its place is pretty much this shit everywhere
19:44,260;19:48,260;But this game like the the field wasn't really that bad because I think it was so cold
19:48,260;19:54,980;It is kind of frozen. So there wasn't a lot of we watch earlier in the season the the Ravens game
19:54,980;20:00,700;Which they referenced in this and that was remember there was like mud up to their ankles and stuff and whoever the commentator was
20:00,700;20:06,940;was like, they had the measuring stick in the mud to show how deep it was. And like,
20:06,940;20:10,540;yeah, that was a slop fest. And that was two teams just like,
20:10,540;20:15,660;heavyweights just slugging it out. But this wasn't that this like every, there was no like
20:15,660;20:18,460;lost footing. There was no people slipping around. It was just like,
20:18,460;20:23,660;it was a little cold and snowing a bit, but it wasn't like outrageous weather.
20:25,260;20:31,900;No. In fact, I think it was almost shades of the week one because the pages came out
20:31,900;20:37,260;five wide in the first half. Like they did. Remember they had all this
20:37,260;20:44,700;hullabaloo about getting Corey Dillon, right? And then they started the game five wide,
20:44,700;20:48,140;no huddle. And he wasn't even on the field for the first like drive, drive and a half.
20:48,140;20:53,500;I remember that. So it was kind of similar to this. Bray's slinging around, he hit
20:54,220;21:02,060;nine different receivers on the day. 1827, 144. So you have a big numbers, but he completed what
21:02,060;21:10,460;he needed to. I think the biggest issue in this game was this is a running game, right? Let's
21:10,460;21:15,340;this was not a throw the ball around the park game from the Patriots. 27 pass attempts,
21:15,340;21:23,820;to what? 38 rushes, but this wasn't like pass attempts that we saw in the snowball or anything
21:23,820;21:29,020;where people like slipping around like the balls all over the place and you know it wasn't like
21:29,020;21:34,540;it wasn't a hot mess. They were still playing their passing game. They just didn't need it
21:34,540;21:40,860;as much because Corey Dillon ran for 100 something yards and 144. Yeah and Kevin Falk ran for another
21:40,860;21:47,900;56. So I mean yeah. Dillon had his money rushing yards as Brady had passing yards. I think that
21:47,900;21:49,900;It kind of tells the story, right?
21:49,900;21:53,820;Yeah, but it wasn't.
21:53,820;21:58,820;Dylan had a longer run than Brady had a longest completion by that's true.
21:58,820;21:59,140;Yeah.
21:59,140;22:02,780;17 yard log versus Corey Dillon in a 42 yard run.
22:02,780;22:03,780;Yeah.
22:03,780;22:05,940;I think Corey had a couple of them too, didn't he?
22:05,940;22:08,980;He had a long his passive 18 yards.
22:08,980;22:11,540;Corey Dillon had the biggest play of the day.
22:11,540;22:16,300;I mean, yeah, I think the biggest detriment in the passing game was
22:16,620;22:17,960;Why'd you see it was dropping balls?
22:17,960;22:19,180;My guess is because their hands were cold.
22:19,180;22:23,400;Cause you know, I think I can't remember if it was Dallas Clark or Brandon
22:23,400;22:24,780;Stolte out there with no gloves.
22:24,780;22:26,780;Maybe the balls were deflated.
22:26,780;22:29,020;Maybe they were overinflated.
22:29,020;22:30,740;Maybe they deflated them.
22:30,740;22:31,260;They would have won.
22:31,260;22:35,420;Well, the Patriots balls are deflated, but the colds balls were not.
22:35,420;22:39,500;I've heard rumors out there that that could be a thing.
22:39,500;22:41,340;What deflated balls?
22:41,340;22:44,400;Andy, what's the ideal gas law off top of your head?
22:44,400;22:45,020;Don't look it up.
22:45,860;22:50,900;Um, I don't know. I actually used to know it. So I'm disappointed in myself.
22:50,900;22:56,900;Yeah. I figured you would be in a fucking hard on nerd equals NRT.
22:56,900;22:58,980;Oh, who's the nerd now?
22:58,980;23:03,220;Well, I spent like however many dollars going to college for it.
23:03,220;23:11,540;So I probably should know that outside of the Patriots, the flaky big dummies.
23:11,540;23:12,260;Right. Exactly.
23:14,020;23:16,420;I think we got that tiny dick energy right now.
23:16,420;23:19,020;Yeah, tiny dick energy.
23:19,020;23:22,180;Dude, that's equal to our T squared.
23:22,180;23:25,220;Yeah, I said that's a buddy dirty dad.
23:25,220;23:27,820;I'm like a Roman statue over here.
23:27,820;23:29,780;Just fucking tiny dick swinging.
23:29,780;23:32,140;They're just using all my brain power in my head.
23:32,140;23:35,260;Doesn't even get past the balls.
23:35,260;23:37,620;Yeah. Jesus.
23:37,620;23:42,820;So, I mean, I.
23:42,820;23:53,300;I guess it didn't feel to me. I don't know how it felt to you guys, but it didn't feel to me like this was like Corey Dillon running wild.
23:53,300;23:55,860;Well, Steve, I didn't watch the game. Let's put that up up front.
23:55,860;23:57,860;That's not true. I watched the first half.
23:57,860;23:59,860;He said, "Very busy week. Cool."
23:59,860;24:06,180;And, well, let's get something on the air while we're on the fucking, while we're alive here.
24:06,180;24:11,940;I got some grievances to air against you, Steve. Oh boy. We were supposed to record last night.
24:12,580;24:15,620;And Steve texted last minute.
24:15,620;24:16,980;I'm going to be late.
24:16,980;24:17,980;You guys do it alone.
24:17,980;24:20,420;And I didn't want to do it alone because I love you so much, Steve.
24:20,420;24:27,060;But I had cooked pizzas in the oven and I was shoveling them down my gullet
24:27,060;24:28,300;to get ready for seven.
24:28,300;24:30,860;I burnt the living hell out of the top of my mouth.
24:30,860;24:35,620;Did I taste anything for fucking 24 hours?
24:35,620;24:38,820;And then you just go, I will push it to tomorrow.
24:40,980;24:43,860;And every time I think about it, Steve, I'm like, that's son of a bitch.
24:43,860;24:44,700;Steve Brown.
24:44,700;24:47,260;Do you don't, I mean, I think this wasn't planned.
24:47,260;24:48,540;You know, it was part of my master plan.
24:48,540;24:51,300;You think I didn't know that you were having pizza for dinner.
24:51,300;24:53,260;Like your wife's phone, Greg.
24:53,260;24:53,980;She's a rat.
24:53,980;24:55,700;Yeah.
24:55,700;24:56,660;Well, jokes on you.
24:56,660;24:59,060;Even if I didn't have a deadline to meet, I still would have
24:59,060;25:00,140;crammed it down my gallon.
25:00,140;25:00,460;Yeah.
25:00,460;25:01,060;I know.
25:01,060;25:04,020;So this is how you eat.
25:04,020;25:06,460;Oh Jesus Christ.
25:09,860;25:15,460;I'm not even gonna go there because Greg, I don't think you're blameless in this at all.
25:15,460;25:17,060;Why?
25:17,060;25:22,980;That's all. Because you're the one that made us change the day of the week to do this,
25:22,980;25:25,940;because you had soccer on Thursdays when we normally record.
25:25,940;25:26,820;I'm sorry, I leave my house.
25:26,820;25:30,100;And then failed to mention that you're not actually playing because you're hurt.
25:30,100;25:31,940;You're injured.
25:31,940;25:32,820;I am injured.
25:32,820;25:36,020;So I was also cramming food down my gullet.
25:38,660;25:42,900;Do you guys eat? I'm just so busy I can't even eat, you know?
25:42,900;25:52,580;No. Speaking too busy, how about that Tony Dungy? He seemed like a busy guy on this day.
25:52,580;26:01,060;He seemed pretty excited that for the first time in I think the last four games,
26:01,060;26:08,100;he won the coin toss against Patriot. So he was able to put his high octane offense on the field
26:08,100;26:10,380;because the last I think the last four games, last three games,
26:10,380;26:13,980;the Patriots won the toss and gone down and scored the opening points.
26:13,980;26:18,900;So you would think that this was like the perfect start for the Colts
26:18,900;26:20,300;to get the ball first.
26:20,300;26:25,420;That you had a decent kick return to start at like the 35 almost 40.
26:25,420;26:30,700;And then three and out immediately running the ball.
26:30,700;26:34,100;That's garbage. Can't do that.
26:34,100;26:37,380;This let's let's read out Edges stat line for the game.
26:37,580;26:38,580;Give it to me.
26:38,580;26:42,180;He is like.
26:42,180;26:45,340;14 carries 39 yards.
26:45,340;26:49,540;Along with seven longer seven.
26:49,540;26:51,100;Did we say the score?
26:51,100;26:52,440;Did we already mention the score?
26:52,440;26:53,440;We have not mentioned the score.
26:53,440;26:58,080;The score is Patriots 20 Colts three.
26:58,080;27:00,580;Yeah. So not great
27:00,580;27:03,580;from the offensive standpoint for the Colts generally.
27:03,580;27:05,020;Yeah. Let's see.
27:05,020;27:06,700;But we didn't completely shut them down.
27:06,700;27:09,160;It was kind of like odds and ends and how they got stopped.
27:09,160;27:12,160;I mean, they had 230 passing yards.
27:12,160;27:15,640;They didn't run the ball well, but they had a bunch of drops.
27:15,640;27:18,220;There's only one interception.
27:18,220;27:20,680;Should have been two, though.
27:20,680;27:22,260;But there's only one, right?
27:22,260;27:25,600;There's three turnovers, I guess, that you may hit Eugene Wilson
27:25,600;27:28,180;between the two and the nine in the end zone on their field.
27:28,180;27:31,060;And the only points they scored in the field will be the play before.
27:31,060;27:32,100;They've been a shutout.
27:32,100;27:34,640;I should have been shut out of that.
27:34,640;27:38,080;But I mean, yeah, I mean, holding this team with three points.
27:38,080;27:41,120;You know what it is. It's time of possession that to me, that's the
27:41,120;27:47,040;takeaway from this entire game is complete domination in time of possession.
27:47,040;27:51,280;Well, this is where you get the nickname clock killing Corey Dillon, right?
27:51,280;27:53,680;That was a nickname.
27:53,680;27:55,600;Yeah.
27:55,600;27:57,840;Don't I like it.
27:57,840;27:58,400;I didn't mind.
27:58,400;28:00,720;I ain't that clever.
28:00,720;28:03,200;I didn't know that either.
28:04,000;28:06,480;Really? You've never heard Clock killing Corey Dillon?
28:06,480;28:07,280;No.
28:07,280;28:08,880;Man, I thought it was going to podcast with Pats fans.
28:08,880;28:09,600;What the fuck happened?
28:09,600;28:14,640;But yeah, I think it basically came from this game where because like Greg says,
28:14,640;28:20,480;the Patriots had almost 38 minutes of possession of the Colts 22.
28:20,480;28:24,240;Which is 21 plus minutes in the second half.
28:24,240;28:25,920;Cool.
28:25,920;28:26,640;It was 6.3.
28:26,640;28:29,840;Yeah, the second half was you got super quiet all of a sudden, Greg.
28:30,720;28:39,460;But their second half drives were, let's see, um, third quarter, they got the ball
28:39,460;28:45,200;nine 46 left 15 plays, eight minutes, 16 seconds, 87 yards ended in a touchdown.
28:45,200;28:50,400;The next drive, they got the ball in the fourth quarter, uh, just started at
28:50,400;28:54,640;14 minutes, 34 seconds left in fourth quarter, 14 play starting their own six,
28:54,640;28:58,620;14 plays, seven and a half minutes, 94 yards, another touchdown.
28:59,140;29:01,900;That's basically a quarter right there in two drives game right there, right?
29:01,900;29:06,340;You just ground out between yourselves one quarter, two touchdowns.
29:06,340;29:12,100;Well, and they had a 16 play 78 yard drive in the first half to that.
29:12,100;29:14,740;And if you'll go that ending in a field goal is bullshit.
29:14,740;29:21,740;Yeah, well, so there's even season averages less than six plays,
29:21,740;29:25,740;25 yards drive and two and a half minutes.
29:27,460;29:33,060;So you get drives of 16, 15 and 14, eight over eight minutes,
29:33,060;29:34,620;twice and over seven minutes.
29:34,620;29:37,620;Another time that's, it's pretty dominant.
29:37,620;29:41,100;Guess the Colts longest drive.
29:41,100;29:42,420;Oh, I actually wrote this down.
29:42,420;29:47,380;This is funny because it's, it's funny in both terms of plays and time.
29:47,380;29:49,020;No, give it to me.
29:49,020;29:55,180;If for plays, it's 12 plays, 59 yards, two and a half minutes.
29:55,280;29:59,900;And it ended at interception and for time it's eight plays 30 yards,
29:59,900;30:02,240;four and a half minutes and it ends in a fumble.
30:02,240;30:10,880;Yeah. And then one scoring drive was 11 plays in a 52 67 yards.
30:10,880;30:12,860;And if you'll go, it's garbage time. Right.
30:12,860;30:13,860;It's fucking end of the game.
30:13,860;30:19,340;Well, that was the end of the half. Yeah. So yeah, definitely,
30:19,340;30:23,700;definitely a rough one. Um, but also, I don't know if you guys caught this,
30:23,700;30:28,740;But they're talking about Rodney Harrison, obviously, you know, in typical Rodney fashion,
30:28,740;30:31,460;he was irritated to hear all the talk about the Colts offense.
30:31,460;30:36,980;So he obviously had a chip on his shoulder, which, you know, shot harp for the course.
30:36,980;30:44,980;But he was also saying that even with like missing Tylon, everybody, he was more confident
30:44,980;30:50,340;in the defense this year compared to last year's playoffs against the Colts because he said they
30:50,340;30:55,020;had found some new wrinkles this time. And also they mentioned something about how he
30:55,020;30:58,760;was saying that they found some tells on Manning's play action, which I felt like they could
30:58,760;31:04,720;use to their advantage, which I think probably worked because I don't remember any play action
31:04,720;31:09,420;play working. But I was kind of shocked that like there was no more talk about that because
31:09,420;31:15,920;I feel like finding a tell on Peyton Manning is especially in a year that he threw 49 touchdowns
31:15,920;31:17,240;is kind of a big deal, no?
31:17,240;31:22,880;Yeah, I don't know. I feel like Harrison kind of talks out of his ass sometimes.
31:22,880;31:30,440;More confident this year than last year. Like, I don't know about that.
31:30,440;31:33,840;Justin, they're pro. Well, they held him to three points, which is better than they did last year. Right?
31:33,840;31:37,920;I felt like this was a more dominant defensive play, you think?
31:37,920;31:41,560;Yeah. I don't know. I felt like they were hanging on at the end of the last year's game.
31:41,560;31:45,280;Yeah. Because the offense was horrendous, if you remember.
31:45,280;31:47,280;- Was it? Yeah. - Yeah.
31:47,280;31:49,280;Remember Brady had that chance to kill the game
31:49,280;31:51,280;and he threw an interception.
31:51,280;31:53,280;There was like, Ty Law and Harrison were like,
31:53,280;31:55,280;pissed on the sidelines.
31:55,280;31:59,280;- That's right. Yeah. I do remember.
31:59,280;32:01,280;- You can argue with the results though.
32:01,280;32:03,280;- I can both, yeah, but still.
32:03,280;32:05,280;- I mean, that team is,
32:05,280;32:07,280;you lose Ty Law and Richard Seymour.
32:07,280;32:11,280;I don't care how good your scheme is.
32:11,280;32:13,280;You know.
32:13,280;32:18,740;That's true, but you also gain Vince Wilfork in the middle, which probably single handedly
32:18,740;32:21,080;helps slow down that rushing game.
32:21,080;32:22,080;Oh yeah.
32:22,080;32:24,600;I mean, Vince Wilfork's not as good as Richard Seymour though.
32:24,600;32:25,600;That's a step down.
32:25,600;32:26,600;At run defense?
32:26,600;32:27,600;I don't know.
32:27,600;32:28,600;Awesome.
32:28,600;32:29,600;I don't really know.
32:29,600;32:35,320;I'll probably give the slight edge to Wilfork.
32:35,320;32:38,160;I mean, also it's rookie Wilfork, so maybe not at this point, but yeah.
32:38,160;32:40,600;I understand where you're coming from.
32:40,600;32:41,600;Let's see.
32:41,600;32:47,660;What else we got? Yeah. Oh, did you catch that Peyton Manning had the fourth longest
32:47,660;32:54,260;run against the Patriots defense this year? 19 yards scramble in week one. No, the fourth
32:54,260;33:00,920;longest run against the Patriots defense, which I wouldn't mind seeing again, come back because
33:00,920;33:07,020;I feel like the Patriots run defense as of late has been suspect. Do you agree? Yeah,
33:07,020;33:10,300;that's where it all starts to right? If you stop the run, then everything else you can
33:10,300;33:15,300;kind of scheme around. You should be a coach. I mean, less so nowadays, because nobody's
33:15,300;33:19,120;a run first team, are they? Like they were back in the early 2000s. Dude, I want to see
33:19,120;33:24,700;Mac Jones run. He had the same 40 time as Patrick Mahomes. Really? I don't believe that.
33:24,700;33:29,420;Yeah, Steve, stat check that. Stat check it, Steve. Stat check it, Steve. I'm not the stat
33:29,420;33:33,740;check guy. I am not. You are now. You just cut off a work. You're still in work mode.
33:33,740;33:36,140;Check it. Yeah, absolutely not.
33:36,140;33:40,780;Steve, useless.
33:40,780;33:42,620;Why would the Internet lie to me?
33:42,620;33:45,340;I said unless I'm an idiot and I read it correctly.
33:45,340;33:50,500;Craig, have you never been on the Internet before?
33:50,500;33:53,900;Yeah, but why would you lie about something stupid like that?
33:53,900;33:57,580;You know, have you never been on the Internet before?
33:57,580;33:59,540;I do.
34:01,460;34:06,140;Have you not been following the, uh, the account of, I believe it's ball sack
34:06,140;34:12,740;sports on Twitter who just post, um, made up quotes about basketball players.
34:12,740;34:16,180;And they, they got covered by ESPN as if it's correct.
34:16,180;34:17,180;Yeah.
34:17,180;34:18,860;I mean, that's ESPN for you though.
34:18,860;34:19,620;Right.
34:19,620;34:22,260;So we like to hold ourselves a higher standard, Greg.
34:22,260;34:26,100;So if you would fact check that for us, I don't want to be faster.
34:26,100;34:27,540;He's faster.
34:27,540;34:28,580;Yeah.
34:28,580;34:30,980;What homes are in four, eight.
34:30,980;34:31,820;- Yeah.
34:31,820;34:34,800;- Mack Jones ran a 467.
34:34,800;34:35,640;(laughs)
34:35,640;34:37,140;- Mack children of 467.
34:37,140;34:37,980;- Like, he's getting any faster, yeah.
34:37,980;34:39,720;- But it says, dude, unofficial.
34:39,720;34:41,960;I think that's his from his pro day.
34:41,960;34:43,600;- Oh, wait, all right, 6-8. - 468.
34:43,600;34:44,440;- Yeah.
34:44,440;34:46,020;- 472 and 468.
34:46,020;34:47,860;- Brady was a 528.
34:47,860;34:48,940;(laughs)
34:48,940;34:51,520;- Brady was slower than Wilfork, remember?
34:51,520;34:53,840;- I need video this fucking 40.
34:53,840;34:56,220;(laughs)
34:56,220;34:57,060;- Oh, God.
34:57,060;34:59,160;So what was Josh Allen's 40 yard dash?
34:59,160;35:00,000;476.
35:00,000;35:00,840;- Yes.
35:00,840;35:03,360;- So Josh Allen,
35:03,360;35:06,520;Mac Jones have basically the same 40 yard dash.
35:06,520;35:07,360;- Yeah, he-
35:07,360;35:08,200;- Oh no.
35:08,200;35:09,400;- Watch a video that's like 30 seconds
35:09,400;35:11,360;and you get a 30 second ad to watch it.
35:11,360;35:14,120;It's like, God damn it dude.
35:14,120;35:17,040;- Oh yeah Greg, tell me how much you hate advertising.
35:17,040;35:17,880;- I can't wait for it.
35:17,880;35:19,080;- It's 80 with commentators.
35:19,080;35:21,680;- They're gonna put advertising to like turn my car on.
35:21,680;35:23,400;You know, those like subscription things.
35:23,400;35:25,300;They're gonna be like, well,
35:25,300;35:26,960;we could fucking give it to you for free
35:26,960;35:30,000;if you just accept these ads shoved up your ass.
35:30,000;35:34,720;Oh, ad suppositories coming next.
35:34,720;35:39,000;I'll admit it.
35:39,000;35:39,920;I just watched it.
35:39,920;35:45,000;It didn't look very athletic, but it was, it was effective though.
35:45,000;35:45,320;Yeah.
35:45,320;35:50,400;It's clearly fast, but it kind of runs like with the chicken wing
35:50,400;35:55,240;arms and like, so he's awkwardly efficient.
35:55,940;35:59,960;Awkwardly, I don't know, what are we looking for?
35:59,960;36:01,360;- Can't argue with the results.
36:01,360;36:02,880;- Right, that's what I'm saying.
36:02,880;36:05,200;That's how I play sports.
36:05,200;36:08,040;Awkward as fuck, but it works on the end.
36:08,040;36:10,660;- Saw the profile view, it looked pretty good.
36:10,660;36:11,500;- Oh, all right.
36:11,500;36:14,600;- Guy looks good in shorts, you know?
36:14,600;36:15,440;- I do.
36:15,440;36:17,360;- Matt Jones.
36:17,360;36:19,120;Let's get him on the run.
36:19,120;36:20,720;- All right.
36:20,720;36:21,560;- Let's do it.
36:21,560;36:24,200;- Roll him out, put him on the move.
36:24,200;36:28,040;I think this is a hot take, but I think the offense is going to be better without McDaniels.
36:28,040;36:31,280;I don't think that was much of a hot take.
36:31,280;36:32,280;Yeah.
36:32,280;36:33,280;I don't know.
36:33,280;36:37,560;McDaniels is like taking this team to the Super Bowl a bunch of times.
36:37,560;36:38,560;Was it him or was it Brady?
36:38,560;36:40,560;How did he do without Brady?
36:40,560;36:43,600;Dude, so many times I've been frustrated by McDaniels.
36:43,600;36:44,600;Yeah, same.
36:44,600;36:47,400;Third and long draw plays.
36:47,400;36:48,400;Yeah.
36:48,400;36:50,800;Although having said that, they ran out in this game.
36:50,800;36:52,520;Kevin Falk picked up the first down.
36:52,520;36:53,520;No big deal.
36:53,520;36:56,160;And be like a third and eight or something ridiculous.
36:56,160;36:57,520;That was gonna be one of my best.
36:57,520;37:02,120;But speaking of people who shouldn't be running it, I would
37:02,120;37:04,320;put Dominic Rhodes in that category.
37:04,320;37:07,760;He had one carry.
37:07,760;37:10,960;That technically was a screen pass, one catch.
37:10,960;37:13,960;Um, negative two yards.
37:13,960;37:17,680;And, uh, he basically gave the ball to Teddy Brusey, which I
37:17,680;37:20,160;think is the play that you remember.
37:20,160;37:21,280;That's unfair.
37:22,680;37:26,520;He did not give the ball to Teddy Briski. Teddy Briski took the ball from him.
37:26,520;37:31,560;He didn't stop Teddy Bruce. You're taking it.
37:31,560;37:32,560;I don't think he had a choice.
37:32,560;37:34,320;Teddy Briski is taking that fucking ball.
37:34,320;37:38,160;I mean, Teddy Briski asked nicely first.
37:38,160;37:40,360;No, you don't think?
37:40,360;37:41,520;No. OK.
37:41,520;37:42,680;He was rude. Came out of nowhere.
37:42,680;37:44,960;Give me that. I suppose he did.
37:44,960;37:47,200;And that is uncouth, I would say.
37:47,200;37:51,080;But yeah, I think that's the.
37:51,080;37:55,760;The defining play like you remember the 2003 Colts game
37:55,760;38:00,280;playoff game with Tyler laws interceptions, right? Um, at least one of them.
38:00,280;38:01,920;And I think there's the,
38:01,920;38:05,880;the defining play of this game is Teddy Bursky ripping the ball out of Dominic
38:05,880;38:10,640;Rhodes' hands, which I believe Greg wasn't out there at their longest drive in,
38:10,640;38:12,520;in some fashion that ended in a fumble.
38:12,520;38:16,000;Yeah. The longest amount of time they held the ball. Yeah.
38:18,600;38:23,160;for a whole four minutes and 47 seconds before they fumbled it. But it was,
38:23,160;38:25,080;they were like in New England territory, I think.
38:25,080;38:27,400;- He had thrown the peaches 39 yard line.
38:27,400;38:32,920;- Yeah. So they were driving to score and they just couldn't do it.
38:32,920;38:36,680;And then also there was another fumble that he recovered.
38:36,680;38:39,080;Brueske had himself a game in this, I thought.
38:39,080;38:44,280;Kind of quietly, because he didn't do much outside of the two fumble recoveries.
38:44,280;38:48,680;And one was, I think it was Rodney Harrison, stripped Marvin Harrison.
38:48,680;38:55,880;They tried a screen pass, which in the wild card game worked for like a 40 yard touchdown.
38:55,880;38:59,480;Like one of those wide receiver screens that Harrison took to the house.
38:59,480;39:02,360;Tried it again. You got picked up like 10, 15 yards, but then
39:02,360;39:06,120;met the other Harrison and popped the ball out.
39:06,120;39:07,160;Bruce just fell on it.
39:07,160;39:09,880;I don't know if you also notice he,
39:09,880;39:12,840;Bruce, he also opened the second half with a nice kick return to the 45.
39:12,840;39:20,240;when the Colts were kicking in the wind. So that was pretty dope. So MVP of this game,
39:20,240;39:21,240;Teddy Bursky.
39:21,240;39:22,240;Corey Dillon.
39:22,240;39:23,240;Corey Dillon.
39:23,240;39:28,840;Boys just don't think outside the box already.
39:28,840;39:29,840;Clock killing Corey Dillon.
39:29,840;39:30,840;You learn a new nickname.
39:30,840;39:34,400;Yeah, if you get a nickname in the game, you got to be MVP.
39:34,400;39:35,920;Yeah, that's fair. All right.
39:35,920;39:37,600;I certainly wasn't the MVP.
39:37,600;39:43,980;Now that was that was Manning and this was also I realized towards the end of the game that this was
39:43,980;39:47,280;the Peyton Manning a commercial Peyton Manning
39:47,280;39:53,880;Because there was a cut that meat sign and I believe it was also a chant. Oh, is that a waltz? Yeah
39:53,880;40:00,320;Way later in his career. No, no, no, according. I mean according I think it was in the Boston Globe articles
40:00,320;40:05,440;there was something about the cut that meat chance, which I didn't I didn't I didn't pick up in the what else listen to the
40:05,440;40:07,440;game, but
40:07,440;40:12,240;I definitely saw a science that cut that meat. There was also a couple other signs. One that
40:12,240;40:16,600;was MVP, but it stood for make vacation plans, which was pretty clever.
40:16,600;40:17,600;That is nice.
40:17,600;40:25,000;That's not bad. There was also, Greg, I think you might like this one, Van Der Shank, open
40:25,000;40:26,560;mouth, insert foot.
40:26,560;40:27,560;Stupid.
40:27,560;40:34,360;What was your name for him before we started?
40:34,360;40:35,360;Nothing.
40:35,360;40:37,960;Oh, now you're all shy.
40:37,960;40:38,960;All right.
40:38,960;40:43,320;Now he decides to censor himself three years into the podcast.
40:43,320;40:47,200;Mom earmuffs.
40:47,200;40:50,840;Mike Vanderjerk me off.
40:50,840;40:51,840;Very naughty.
40:51,840;40:54,480;I'm so naughty born.
40:54,480;40:56,120;Oh, Gregory.
40:56,120;40:57,120;Can't take you anywhere.
40:57,120;41:00,400;Can you just call me Longcock?
41:00,400;41:01,400;That's right.
41:01,400;41:02,400;James Mungro.
41:02,400;41:04,400;There's another good name.
41:04,400;41:12,600;The second no, no less the second James mongrel the second.
41:12,600;41:13,600;So he's not a junior.
41:13,600;41:14,600;He's a second.
41:14,600;41:16,400;Yeah, we look this up.
41:16,400;41:19,840;Yeah, with um, garden minch you because he's a second.
41:19,840;41:26,600;Yeah, it's whether it's juniors if it's your father's name second is if it's your grandfather.
41:26,600;41:27,600;That's right.
41:27,600;41:28,840;Yeah, but your father isn't that same name.
41:28,840;41:29,840;It's correct.
41:29,840;41:30,840;Yeah.
41:30,840;41:31,840;Okay.
41:31,840;41:33,040;You want to take a, are we done with the game?
41:33,040;41:35,000;I'm good to get around the league wrap up.
41:35,000;41:36,560;I got a lot of notes.
41:36,560;41:37,400;- Okay, yeah.
41:37,400;41:39,920;I mean, I think, Steve, you have any other notes
41:39,920;41:41,520;on the game you didn't watch?
41:41,520;41:43,480;- I got some best and worst, but nothing.
41:43,480;41:44,320;- All right.
41:44,320;41:46,080;- We can go to the recap.
41:46,080;41:48,140;- All right, Greg, give me some around the league.
41:48,140;41:52,860;What was going on in 2004, January, 2005, technically?
41:52,860;41:55,520;- Yeah, so, I mean, this is obviously divisional pets
41:55,520;41:56,960;had to buy, right?
41:56,960;41:57,800;- Right, yeah.
41:57,800;41:58,640;- Right, yeah.
41:58,640;42:03,640;- So the one notable wild card game that I found
42:03,640;42:07,720;was the Vikings Packers, Randy Moss, Moonings,
42:07,720;42:08,560;- Yes, it was.
42:08,560;42:09,600;- and the M.O.L.
42:09,600;42:10,440;- That was this year.
42:10,440;42:11,280;- I love that.
42:11,280;42:14,680;- Which turned out to be one of,
42:14,680;42:17,080;I think it was Moss's last touchdown as a Viking,
42:17,080;42:18,200;if I remember correctly.
42:18,200;42:19,120;- Oh, damn.
42:19,120;42:19,960;- Yeah.
42:19,960;42:23,360;Also, in that game, you guys were like--
42:23,360;42:24,880;- It was the announcer of that game
42:24,880;42:26,440;that was just disgusted. - Jill Bock.
42:26,440;42:28,360;- Yeah, so it was disgusted by it.
42:28,360;42:32,880;- Yeah, Joe Buck said it was a disgusting act,
42:32,880;42:34,640;which has found out in me.
42:34,640;42:37,080;Actually, and I looked up a bunch of like articles
42:37,080;42:40,200;around that time and it was actually Joe Buck
42:40,200;42:41,640;that was getting the majority of the hate
42:41,640;42:43,000;rather than Randy Moss.
42:43,000;42:45,320;Like I thought there'd be like people pissing at Randy,
42:45,320;42:47,120;but no one really was.
42:47,120;42:48,800;- I bet that if Twitter was around at that point,
42:48,800;42:50,360;they would have been, but you're right.
42:50,360;42:54,780;Because the whole thing was that in Green Bay,
42:54,780;42:59,140;the fans would moon the play, the opposing players as they came and went.
42:59,140;43:02,380;So this was kind of like stuff. Yeah.
43:02,380;43:05,500;He was kind of giving it back to him. What a sweet football.
43:05,500;43:09,860;His quote after the game was he was just having a little fun with the boys.
43:09,860;43:13,020;Yeah. It's not really much shit.
43:13,020;43:18,380;And Greg, you are correct. This is his last season in Minnesota.
43:18,380;43:20,340;You were, you were going to trade to Oakland 2005.
43:20,340;43:23,740;So I think it's his last touchdown as a, as a Viking.
43:24,180;43:25,460;I mean, it loses the next week.
43:25,460;43:26,940;That's the way to go out in it.
43:26,940;43:28,260;Dude.
43:28,260;43:33,500;So, but there was an overreaction of people hating on Buck, the Vikings owner.
43:33,500;43:39,280;So Buck had the Vikings game in the division around and he wanted them to
43:39,280;43:44,900;remove Buck for quote, a prejudice that surpassed objective reporting.
43:44,900;43:47,420;Like, Jesus, get fucked dude.
43:47,420;43:51,240;I just had a gut reaction watching this fucking play and you're over here.
43:52,220;43:58,460;freaking prejudice surpassing objective reporting. Like, dude, you kidding me?
43:58,460;44:00,780;That's a dude who's never listened to Boston sports talk.
44:00,780;44:02,380;- Right. - Yeah.
44:02,380;44:04,460;That's a Bill Poli move right there. That's what that is.
44:04,460;44:10,620;I saw an interview with Joe Buck too. He seems pretty self-aware of it. He's like,
44:10,620;44:14,620;listen, I called it. It was one of those things that happens in the moment. I didn't know the
44:14,620;44:21,340;context, yada, yada. But you know how Moss does the Come On Man segment?
44:21,340;44:22,180;- Yeah, yeah.
44:22,180;44:24,780;- Apparently there was a play recently
44:24,780;44:26,980;where someone was tackling Joe Burrow
44:26,980;44:29,220;and they like tackle him by the pants
44:29,220;44:31,060;and it like pulled his pants down.
44:31,060;44:33,820;And Randy Moss was like, "That's a disgusting act."
44:33,820;44:36,380;(both laughing)
44:36,380;44:37,340;- Amazing.
44:37,340;44:38,700;- So that also shows.
44:38,700;44:40,380;Like, Buck said that like,
44:40,380;44:41,980;Randy Moss has been super chill about it.
44:41,980;44:44,060;Like never got mad once.
44:44,060;44:45,900;Like next time he's like gapped him off,
44:45,900;44:47,180;he's like, "Well, I don't care."
44:47,180;44:48,860;- It's Randy Moss, that's how he is.
44:48,860;44:49,940;- Yeah, yeah.
44:49,940;44:53,540;I think he's one of the more most misunderstood players in the league or any
44:53,540;44:54,380;Moss.
44:54,380;44:57,820;I think now people kind of come around on him. I think at the time, probably.
44:57,820;45:01,980;But now he's like on Sunday night countdown. People kind of get it.
45:01,980;45:03,540;Not anymore. I don't think, but yes.
45:03,540;45:09,140;I don't think his contract was in review this year. Oh, he's off. Yeah.
45:09,140;45:11,180;I bet. Let's get him on the pod. Yeah.
45:11,180;45:16,700;All right. So I was the only, I was the only wildcard game that I thought had any
45:16,700;45:19,860;note. So the, um,
45:19,860;45:25,380;other than the cold one. Yeah. Oh, one other note from that game that you guys are probably like
45:25,380;45:26,820;far through four interceptions.
45:26,820;45:35,060;Shocking dude, he had this one fucking touchdown. He's like, it's like they're like the 10 yard
45:35,060;45:39,940;line. He's like rolling out and he's like running out of space to throw it. And he literally does
45:39,940;45:48,180;this no look like underhand shovel pass across his body that like just lands in this dude's lap.
45:48,180;45:52,580;It was the most ridiculous awesome play from VARB, but he'd already crossed the line.
45:52,580;45:57,780;By like three or four yards, not like he stepped over.
45:57,780;46:00,420;He's fucking grinning, dude. He's the fucking man.
46:00,420;46:04,820;He's a fucking tool. And he almost brought him back.
46:04,820;46:06,180;Even after throwing four picks.
46:06,180;46:08,980;But of course, I mean, that's such a weirdness.
46:08,980;46:10,580;It's just too tough to overcome.
46:10,580;46:15,060;So I think that's one of the, uh, did you see one of the, the, um,
46:16,660;46:19,620;The records that will never be broken is Brett Favre's interception record.
46:19,620;46:20,820;Yeah, we talked about that.
46:20,820;46:22,020;No, we'll ever break that.
46:22,020;46:26,020;Yeah. Overall turnover record because he had a fucked ton of fumbles.
46:26,020;46:27,060;Oh, he did, dude.
46:27,060;46:30,340;Did that happen? He was a gunslinger, you know?
46:30,340;46:32,740;Yeah, he was just out there fucking shooting from the hip.
46:32,740;46:36,340;Yes, you do.
46:36,340;46:42,740;Yeah. So then the Eagles would get a bye, right? They played the Vikings in the next round.
46:43,380;46:48,660;Eagles win. The only thing I had note there was Fred X, Freddie
46:48,660;46:52,500;Mitchell's got two touchdowns. And when he caught his first
46:52,500;46:56,340;one, he did the pulling the pants up. Yeah, celebration.
46:56,340;47:00,240;Fair play. That's funny. Not too bad. Not too bad. Pretty funny.
47:00,240;47:04,040;So yeah, 2714 Eagles one at home.
47:04,040;47:09,120;And I think the eagle I believe when we were talking about the
47:09,320;47:12,760;Steelers and how much of a wagon they were.
47:12,760;47:17,880;They beat the only two undefeated teams in the league back to back weeks.
47:17,880;47:22,360;It was the Patriots and the Eagles, the only two remaining undefeated teams.
47:22,360;47:24,320;And the Steelers just stomped them both.
47:24,320;47:25,360;Yeah.
47:25,360;47:29,280;And Eagles going into their fourth straight NFC title game.
47:29,280;47:29,720;Yeah.
47:29,720;47:30,720;Basically that went so.
47:30,720;47:30,960;Yeah.
47:30,960;47:33,000;The Buffalo bill style thing.
47:33,000;47:34,440;Cause they hadn't won one yet.
47:34,440;47:35,400;They had lost all three.
47:35,400;47:35,960;Yep.
47:36,440;47:41,440;And they will be playing the Michael Vick Atlanta Falcons.
47:41,440;47:42,600;Oh, Dan.
47:42,600;47:45,200;This is also, I believe, Vick's last year
47:45,200;47:47,920;until the incident.
47:47,920;47:48,760;Oh, really?
47:48,760;47:50,520;Yes.
47:50,520;47:52,040;What incident was that, Craig?
47:52,040;47:54,280;(laughing)
47:54,280;47:57,560;It actually was not.
47:57,560;47:59,280;No?
47:59,280;48:00,800;He played 2005, 2006,
48:00,800;48:01,800;and then according to Pro Football,
48:01,800;48:03,640;maybe it was 2007, 2008.
48:03,640;48:07,000;Miss season violation of league personal conduct policy.
48:07,000;48:08,120;It was the cheese.
48:08,120;48:10,440;The nicest way you can put that.
48:10,440;48:11,240;Fuck me.
48:11,240;48:12,240;Roger Goodell.
48:12,240;48:12,920;I did.
48:12,920;48:15,000;Who did they beat?
48:15,000;48:19,680;They beat the Rams to the end of the greatest show on tariff.
48:19,680;48:21,560;The bulger bulger Rams.
48:21,560;48:21,760;Yeah.
48:21,760;48:22,320;Yeah.
48:22,320;48:25,040;So they just fucking stopped them.
48:25,040;48:25,800;Like crazy.
48:25,800;48:26,600;I'm running on them.
48:26,600;48:27,120;Yeah.
48:27,120;48:30,920;It was, these are the first half records that they sent that game.
48:30,920;48:33,160;They had 239 rushing yards.
48:33,240;48:35,000;Oh, just in the first half.
48:35,000;48:40,140;Oh, done a work done had 126 rushing yards in the first half.
48:40,140;48:45,700;Um, they finished with 327 Vic had one 19.
48:45,700;48:55,020;And then Vic set the record for the longest playoff run by a Falcon with 47
48:55,020;48:57,860;in the first half and then done broke that record in the second half.
48:57,860;48:58,940;62 yarder.
48:58,940;49:01,500;Jesus.
49:01,540;49:04,660;So yeah, 47 17 without barely even throwing the ball.
49:04,660;49:06,820;And they, they kick the shit out of them.
49:06,820;49:12,780;I think they had like a 70 passing down to, yeah, they have 70 passing yards and one.
49:12,780;49:15,100;Oh my God. 47 17.
49:15,100;49:16,860;It might be worth looking at the highlights.
49:16,860;49:18,540;Just remember how awesome Vic was too.
49:18,540;49:24,940;Cause he's still, I think, I think he's more athletic than Lamar Jackson.
49:25,180;49:32,860;Michael Vick was the best video game character of all time in Madden 2004.
49:32,860;49:37,420;Like you weren't allowed to play him if you were playing a friend or somebody.
49:37,420;49:39,620;Like you couldn't, you couldn't pick the Falcons because it was cheating.
49:39,620;49:41,780;Cause he was so overpowered.
49:41,780;49:43,700;He was pretty sweet.
49:43,700;49:44,660;Yeah.
49:44,660;49:47,540;In an absolute cannon of an arm too.
49:47,540;49:48,180;Oh yeah.
49:48,180;49:49,340;He would just flick the ball.
49:49,340;49:50,260;Uh-huh.
49:50,260;49:53,660;Which I think Lamar Jackson kind of similar.
49:54,180;49:56,100;He doesn't put much effort into it.
49:56,100;49:59,100;I think Vic is a little better.
49:59,100;50:03,380;Like I think Lomar Jackson is a better thrower of a football.
50:03,380;50:06,900;Maybe I think.
50:06,900;50:09,460;Yeah, you got to think about Arrow to write
50:09,460;50:13,440;this man against 2004 guys who are wearing gigantic shoulder pads.
50:13,440;50:16,040;Lamar is doing it against super athletic
50:16,040;50:19,140;sideline to sideline linebackers.
50:19,140;50:19,980;Yeah, that's a good point.
50:19,980;50:22,140;Yeah, maybe we'll get into that thing at some point.
50:22,140;50:26,060;go down the whole Vic rabbit hole because it's definitely an interesting story.
50:26,060;50:31,020;Like how he grew up and how that all that stuff ended up going down was
50:31,020;50:37,500;yeah, there's some shit about him getting like in trouble too. That was super shady about like,
50:37,500;50:42,380;he didn't actually do very much wrong. Oh, interesting. Yeah. Yeah, but he was the name,
50:42,380;50:48,060;right? Yeah. Yeah. So yeah, so it's going to be Falcons Eagles in the NFC Championship,
50:48,060;50:54,220;the AFC championship. Steve, you're gonna love this. The fucking Steelers Jets. The Steelers
50:54,220;51:03,100;win 20 to 17 in overtime. The Jets had the ball with two minutes left kicking a field goal,
51:03,100;51:10,700;danked it from 47 yards. Big Ben throws a pick on the very next drive. They get in
51:10,700;51:17,580;range again and then pushed one wide left from 43 yards. So they missed two game-winning field goals
51:17,580;51:21,340;in the last two minutes and then promptly lost immediately in overtime.
51:21,340;51:23,100;I love you, right? I do love that.
51:23,100;51:33,100;Yeah. Yeah. So Steelers Patriots, two best teams in the AFC meeting in Pittsburgh, right?
51:33,100;51:33,580;Oh yeah.
51:33,580;51:34,300;That is correct.
51:34,300;51:34,780;Yeah.
51:34,780;51:36,140;You've got one loss in the year.
51:36,140;51:37,020;Rookie Big Ben.
51:37,020;51:43,660;Yeah. And the Steelers have 15 consecutive wins coming in this game. The last home loss
51:44,460;51:49,180;was in 2003, which is fucking forever ago, because we're in
51:49,180;51:54,500;2000, January 2005. At this point, they are first the NFL
51:54,500;51:57,100;and total defense with the fewest points allowed. And they
51:57,100;52:01,140;are second in the NFL in rush offense, which is even with Ben
52:01,140;52:06,820;Ross's burger, he is not the the main attraction, the main drive
52:06,820;52:11,780;of this baby. I can't wait to watch Troy Paul Amalo. He's one
52:11,780;52:13,740;of the forgotten awesome players.
52:13,740;52:17,240;Yeah. Like generation defining players that people don't talk about enough.
52:17,240;52:19,080;You don't think he's forgotten?
52:19,080;52:20,920;I don't think so. I see highlights of them all the time.
52:20,920;52:22,420;Do you?
52:22,420;52:24,720;I felt like him and Bob Sanders, people are similar.
52:24,720;52:27,020;Yeah, Bob Sanders, people don't talk about either.
52:27,020;52:27,520;Bob Sanders.
52:27,520;52:29,620;Like Ed Reed, you know, fucking.
52:29,620;52:33,020;Sean Taylor.
52:33,020;52:35,820;What about my boy, Troy?
52:35,820;52:38,220;Troy Brown?
52:38,220;52:39,820;No. Yes.
52:39,820;52:42,140;Speaking of Troy Brown, it's getting best and worse.
52:42,140;52:43,140;Yeah.
52:43,140;52:44,340;Steve, you want to go first?
52:44,340;52:46,260;Yeah, a lot of Troy Brown bests.
52:46,260;52:48,900;Should I just go right into those?
52:48,900;52:50,260;Yeah, I'll just go right into those.
52:50,260;52:51,660;Just go right into them, Steve.
52:51,660;52:52,660;Just do what feels right.
52:52,660;52:57,420;Yeah, I just like, I don't know what's going on with the pro football reference page.
52:57,420;53:01,740;It doesn't have all of the defensive stats for the Patriots.
53:01,740;53:02,740;Oh yeah.
53:02,740;53:03,740;You're right.
53:03,740;53:04,740;Oh, that's two players.
53:04,740;53:06,740;It only has Indianapolis, right?
53:06,740;53:09,340;Yeah, it has all the Indians.
53:09,340;53:11,420;It's like a three players.
53:11,420;53:12,860;What the hell is going on here?
53:12,860;53:13,500;I don't know.
53:13,500;53:14,980;Troy, Troy played a fucking great game.
53:14,980;53:17,480;Dude, this is the first time I've ever seen
53:17,480;53:20,060;pro football reference be missing something.
53:20,060;53:21,380;Yeah, same.
53:21,380;53:23,380;We use this shit religiously.
53:23,380;53:27,460;Oh, but I played a great game because Peyton was picking on him
53:27,460;53:28,100;as he should.
53:28,100;53:28,580;Right.
53:28,580;53:31,780;The Patriots secondary is absolute bunch of scrubs
53:31,780;53:34,300;and a wide receiver playing cornerback.
53:34,300;53:37,540;And he's got Brandon Stokely thousand yards.
53:37,540;53:38,620;He was a great saucer.
53:38,620;53:42,580;So he might be the best in the NFL against Troy Brown and he was
53:42,580;53:45,100;definitely getting be a little bit, but then Troy, if I can battle back,
53:45,100;53:48,880;had some sick third downstops, had a ball or punt return.
53:48,880;53:50,660;Yeah, that was sweet.
53:50,660;53:54,620;When he had like, he knocked that pass down and then return the kick.
53:54,620;53:55,180;Yep.
53:55,180;53:58,340;And then he was out there on offense and the next place I got
53:58,340;54:00,260;damned, how old is this dude?
54:00,260;54:01,020;Yeah.
54:01,020;54:04,940;This is like peak Troy Brown, just playing all phases of the game.
54:04,940;54:06,100;It was sick.
54:06,700;54:10,060;It's like not peak Troy Brown, but it is in some ways too.
54:10,060;54:11,740;Like, no, it's certainly not.
54:11,740;54:16,060;Yeah, it's not like, cause how good he was, but just how versatile he was.
54:16,060;54:16,540;Yeah.
54:16,540;54:18,900;He was like, how it's prototypical.
54:18,900;54:23,260;Troy Brown prototype Troy Brown, which I guess you could call peak Troy Brown
54:23,260;54:25,260;because that's what made him good is.
54:25,260;54:30,620;Well, we were talking to Kevin Falk about his ability to like return kicks
54:30,620;54:32,180;and how he's like the leading yard.
54:32,180;54:35,260;He's like, my only job while there was just secure the ball, right?
54:35,500;54:43,900;Yeah, not get your most important guy out there. So it's Troy Brown like, Hey, Troy, I know you're playing offense and defense, but like we really can't afford a fumble on a kicker.
54:43,900;54:47,660;Turn is going to blow this game open. So yeah, get out there, buddy.
54:47,660;54:55,580;Yeah, that was that was going to be my best was like, there was literally one long highlight of Troy Brown, break up the pass on third down.
54:55,580;55:01,620;And then as they're like, you know, they're talking about it, they're watching him and you can see him running back to go get the punt, which he does.
55:01,620;55:05,220;and then he returns the punt and then he just like stands there on the field
55:05,220;55:07,580;and waits for the offense to come to.
55:07,580;55:09,380;And then he's out there as a slot receiver.
55:09,380;55:12,900;Yeah, like, damn, you just doesn't take a break.
55:12,900;55:15,300;Love to know how many in the NFL.
55:15,300;55:16,580;Yeah, it's not Pop Warner's.
55:16,580;55:19,060;It's his fucking NFL division playoff game.
55:19,060;55:22,660;Yeah, and this isn't like the 1930s where you're playing against,
55:22,660;55:23,780;you know, like mechanics and stuff.
55:23,780;55:26,700;And this is your your side job where guys can play both sides.
55:26,700;55:29,740;But this is.
55:29,740;55:37,180;It's gotta be kind of obnoxious to be like a practice squad cornerback.
55:37,180;55:41,660;And Troy Brown picks it up in the middle of the season and is better than you. And you're like,
55:41,660;55:47,580;"Damn it, dude. I've spent my entire life dedicating myself to this craft and this fucking
55:47,580;55:51,580;asshole just picks it up halfway through." I would agree with you if the Patriots actually
55:51,580;55:55,420;had any practice squad cornerbacks left. I think they were starting them all.
55:55,420;55:57,500;I guess where Randall gave his name from. Oh, he just needed general, right?
55:57,500;55:58,340;- Yeah, I say you're right.
55:58,340;55:59,180;- Yeah, I know.
55:59,180;56:00,760;- You're street free agents, like,
56:00,760;56:02,600;"Dude, I can do that.
56:02,600;56:04,780;Just give me a spot."
56:04,780;56:06,100;- And then you watch and you're probably like,
56:06,100;56:07,880;"God, man, he was pretty good."
56:07,880;56:08,720;- Yeah.
56:08,720;56:09,560;(laughs)
56:09,560;56:11,000;So he's second on the team interceptions.
56:11,000;56:12,560;He kind of knows what he's doing.
56:12,560;56:13,680;- He's a slot receiver.
56:13,680;56:16,620;- He also plays the first six plays of the game,
56:16,620;56:18,740;including a three and out by the Colts,
56:18,740;56:21,140;the kick return, the first two Patriots games.
56:21,140;56:23,520;The first two offensive slots.
56:23,520;56:26,980;He's just like, "All right, try to just get out there."
56:26,980;56:30,660;I think he'll like on this game he has T Brown on his jersey though
56:30,660;56:39,260;Did he yeah interesting is there another Brown I don't I like can never
56:39,260;56:43,100;Remember Troy Brown ever having T Brown on his jersey
56:43,100;56:46,740;I'm trying to think if there's another Brown on defense maybe that we've missed
56:46,740;56:50,020;But they're not sure like why would it be just this playoff game?
56:50,020;56:54,700;They must have signed somebody for just the playoff this seems crazy because he hasn't had it all year
56:54,900;57:00,040;Maybe they're like special jerseys because it's the playoffs and they have like patches on so they gave you a now
57:00,040;57:05,900;I want a T Brown Jersey god damn right. Yeah, he Brown baby. Yeah, 2004 T Brown
57:05,900;57:12,180;Get the Super Bowl patch on or something. Did you know here's fun fact Troy Brown for one year with number 86
57:12,180;57:19,040;When yeah, he was not always on Brady. No way what like when he first started or what? Yeah
57:19,040;57:21,040;It was like it was like a second year
57:21,040;57:22,880;NFL
57:22,880;57:27,280;So who knew I was a little upset when they're bitching about his
57:27,280;57:32,600;There I said, oh he fair caught it. He didn't that's such bullshit. Oh, yeah
57:32,600;57:39,120;He never got above it say you got to get above your head and he's like he started it was close
57:39,120;57:43,240;I'm gonna get it. He didn't get above shoulder. Yeah, it's fucking Tony Dungy. Although I
57:43,240;57:46,480;Want to give you this is kind of my best and worst
57:46,480;57:51,540;That's all in one getting it's topical Tony Dungy
57:51,540;57:57,660;We've talked a lot about the pages doing the direct snap to Kevin Falk and how they mastered
57:57,660;57:58,660;that play.
57:58,660;58:02,300;We talked with Kevin Falk about it.
58:02,300;58:08,700;But the Colts tried to do it in this game and they got called for a false start because
58:08,700;58:12,580;Manning lined up under center and then moved away.
58:12,580;58:17,940;And because he lined up under center, you're not allowed to basically go motion from under
58:17,940;58:21,520;center for some arcane rule that whatever the commentator was.
58:21,520;58:25,280;knew immediately which shocked me because it's fucking football commentators.
58:25,280;58:32,160;I have some other kudos for the commentators too. Andy, you want me to share those with you?
58:32,160;58:36,800;Yeah, because I have one too, believe it or not. So you go first.
58:36,800;58:43,520;Wow. Phil was pointing out Patrick Pass's Great Block on the punt return by Troy.
58:43,520;58:49,360;And I didn't even see it the first time. I went back and watched it. I was like, wow,
58:49,360;58:54,000;That's a great, great. And then they're like talking about how good the field is and immediately
58:54,000;58:59,840;Corey Dillon risks off that big run. Yeah. They also had that highlight package of how great of
58:59,840;59:06,240;a blocker Daniel Graham was. They're showing like all the complicated blocks that he was
59:06,240;59:12,320;having to do like he had to go pick up the weak side middle linebacker on one place so that
59:12,320;59:16,640;Kevin Falk could make the cutback on the drop lines like shit like that.
59:16,640;59:21,600;And then I found it interesting where Phil was like outraged about a hit.
59:21,600;59:25,040;And I think it was the first time I've seen a commentator be like, Oh my God,
59:25,040;59:29,520;look at that hit. What a, when it was like those ones that were previously celebrated
59:29,520;59:32,880;is on Brandon Stokely from I think Eugene Wilson, you know, Samuels.
59:32,880;59:33,760;Yeah. Yeah.
59:33,760;59:34,400;Samuels.
59:34,400;59:35,600;That's my best.
59:35,600;59:37,600;Was that it?
59:37,600;59:39,440;Yeah. Fucking decapitated him.
59:39,440;59:40,000;It was sick.
59:40,000;59:43,520;Phil disagreed with you.
59:43,520;59:46,000;Well, you can get fucked, dude.
59:46,000;59:50,640;It's a man sport. Maybe he should play like fucking golf or tennis or something.
59:50,640;59:56,480;He's doing his best Eugene Wilson impressionation.
59:56,480;01:00:02,880;Yeah. Samuel had some comments after the game about that hit.
01:00:02,880;01:00:09,120;Okay. Let's see. Quote, "I was hoping the flag wouldn't come out to Samuel who knew how his
01:00:09,120;01:00:13,200;hit might have been interpreted by the officials in yesterday's 20 to 3 playoff win over the Colts.
01:00:13,200;01:00:15,360;Hopefully I won't get a FedEx letter on Wednesday,
01:00:15,360;01:00:20,240;notifying him of a league in post-fines. I mean, I think I got a lot of shoulder on him.
01:00:20,240;01:00:27,680;I didn't leave with my helmet. Odds on the fact that he had a FedEx letter in his locker the next
01:00:27,680;01:00:34,800;day. I'm a go on. I don't know. I don't know if he did it all, but I have to imagine he did.
01:00:34,800;01:00:38,640;Because that I was like, "Thanks for helping with the helmet." It was brutal.
01:00:38,640;01:00:46,480;And then, oh, really smart timeout by Belichick, you know, saved a guy being wide open.
01:00:46,480;01:00:53,600;Smartly called the timeout to save a wide open, you know, he saw the confusion on defense and
01:00:53,600;01:00:58,960;what a heads up coaching play to maybe you come out there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
01:00:58,960;01:01:07,840;And then my negative primary actually one more fun fact, two fun facts. There was a week three
01:01:07,840;01:01:10,560;by for us. It seems crazy.
01:01:10,560;01:01:11,120;Super early.
01:01:11,120;01:01:12,400;In this day and age, right?
01:01:12,400;01:01:13,040;Right.
01:01:13,040;01:01:15,440;At this point, they've been playing football for like three,
01:01:15,440;01:01:16,400;four months straight.
01:01:16,400;01:01:22,160;And the Patriots went from 27th and rushing to seven. Just by
01:01:22,160;01:01:22,920;adding Corey Dillon.
01:01:22,920;01:01:24,800;Yeah, that's all took.
01:01:24,800;01:01:25,760;That's pretty good.
01:01:25,760;01:01:30,280;Yeah, that's not a bad, not a bad set. I'll give you some more
01:01:30,280;01:01:31,320;fun stats if you want.
01:01:31,320;01:01:31,840;Yeah.
01:01:31,840;01:01:33,120;Hit him with him with them.
01:01:34,760;01:01:38,920;This is where they showed it with a minute 23 left in the first half.
01:01:38,920;01:01:41,720;The last first half shutout of the Indianapolis Colts,
01:01:41,720;01:01:46,360;2003 in the AFC Championship game at New England.
01:01:46,360;01:01:50,200;They would eventually kick a field goal here, so they would just escape.
01:01:50,200;01:01:55,640;But also another Peyton Manning stat for you.
01:01:55,640;01:02:02,680;In 2004 regular season, Peyton Manning had 68 20 plus yard completions.
01:02:03,640;01:02:10,200;68 the week before and against Denver he had 11 cool in this game
01:02:10,200;01:02:15,240;stuff you didn't even break like that is correct 18 years
01:02:15,240;01:02:23,160;not too bad and also the Colts postseason turnovers last one here um in 2003 last two years
01:02:23,160;01:02:29,240;the postseason turnovers Colts have had versus any other team in three games they had two
01:02:29,240;01:02:33,400;First the Patriots in two games, eight turnovers.
01:02:33,400;01:02:39,800;They just cannot solve the genius that is Bill Belichick's defense. Would you agree Greg?
01:02:39,800;01:02:43,320;No, I guess it's a snow and Tyler.
01:02:43,320;01:02:45,400;There is no Tyler in this game.
01:02:45,400;01:02:48,840;Well, Sante Samuel played pretty well I thought.
01:02:48,840;01:02:51,320;How do you know you're told?
01:02:51,320;01:02:54,280;No, I mean he knocked some dude's head off.
01:02:54,280;01:02:58,360;Eugene Wilson played well too.
01:02:58,360;01:03:01,260;- Who didn't play well is my biggest negative
01:03:01,260;01:03:03,780;is the fucking punter dude, Josh Miller.
01:03:03,780;01:03:05,520;- Who gives a shit?
01:03:05,520;01:03:07,440;- He touch backs his first two punts
01:03:07,440;01:03:12,200;and then punting from the 43 gets only 29 yards.
01:03:12,200;01:03:13,640;- Dude, two minutes left.
01:03:13,640;01:03:16,160;- Fucking punters, Steve.
01:03:16,160;01:03:17,200;- Greg, you know who cares?
01:03:17,200;01:03:18,520;Belichick cares about the punter.
01:03:18,520;01:03:19,980;- That's exactly right.
01:03:19,980;01:03:22,280;- That's why he's never gonna win this league.
01:03:22,280;01:03:24,520;(laughing)
01:03:24,520;01:03:26,960;- Good Lord.
01:03:26,960;01:03:30,560;- All right, Greg, you got any best of worst for us?
01:03:30,560;01:03:34,960;- My worst has probably got to be the feeling
01:03:34,960;01:03:39,960;of like cult fans after this game of you have,
01:03:39,960;01:03:42,400;you're like, oh fuck, do we have Dan Marino?
01:03:42,400;01:03:46,440;You know, like, he just broke Dan Marino's touchdown record.
01:03:46,440;01:03:50,560;He's putting up these like, this was the fifth,
01:03:50,560;01:03:53,840;at the time the fifth ranked offense in NFL history.
01:03:54,960;01:03:57,720;And he goes in and puts up another stinker
01:03:57,720;01:03:59,680;after doing it last year.
01:03:59,680;01:04:00,520;- Three points.
01:04:00,520;01:04:03,200;- And he's fucking 0-7 in Foxborough, right?
01:04:03,200;01:04:07,160;He's like, they've lost what, six straight,
01:04:07,160;01:04:08,600;'cause we lost six straight to New England
01:04:08,600;01:04:10,200;and nine straight in Foxborough.
01:04:10,200;01:04:14,000;So you gotta be like, is this what we have?
01:04:14,000;01:04:16,560;Like is this, and they kinda did.
01:04:16,560;01:04:18,400;You know what I mean?
01:04:18,400;01:04:21,080;They do win that one, but to some degree,
01:04:21,080;01:04:23,360;he is like a regular season hero
01:04:23,360;01:04:27,020;that could never quite get over that hump in the playoffs.
01:04:27,020;01:04:28,920;- Doesn't he have the most ever one and done's
01:04:28,920;01:04:31,000;in the playoffs out of any quarterback?
01:04:31,000;01:04:33,640;- Yeah, I believe so.
01:04:33,640;01:04:34,600;It's a lot.
01:04:34,600;01:04:36,680;- Yeah, but yeah, I mean, that's gotta be
01:04:36,680;01:04:38,040;a tough realization to come to,
01:04:38,040;01:04:40,680;'cause at this point, he's what, six years in the league,
01:04:40,680;01:04:42,040;something like that, you're probably like,
01:04:42,040;01:04:44,000;all right, we kinda know we have.
01:04:44,000;01:04:47,960;He's not gonna like, he's already basically peaked
01:04:47,960;01:04:50,960;as what a regular season quarterback we know he can be.
01:04:50,960;01:04:52,400;So now all it comes down to is,
01:04:52,400;01:04:55,720;can you win these big games and win Super Bowls
01:04:55,720;01:04:57,760;and like build on a legacy, which--
01:04:57,760;01:05:00,320;- And the answer so far is resounding no.
01:05:00,320;01:05:01,880;- Resounding no.
01:05:01,880;01:05:03,380;- Not if Tom Brady's still playing.
01:05:03,380;01:05:04,640;- Yeah.
01:05:04,640;01:05:05,480;- Or so that was--
01:05:05,480;01:05:07,920;- I'm sorry, not if Bill Belichick is still coaching.
01:05:07,920;01:05:09,940;- Yeah, and not if B.B. is still coaching.
01:05:09,940;01:05:13,340;- Right, 'cause I mean, let's go into it.
01:05:13,340;01:05:15,440;Bill Belichick's more genius in this game.
01:05:15,440;01:05:19,360;Messing with Peyton Manning's head
01:05:19,360;01:05:21,700;with how many down linemen he played.
01:05:21,700;01:05:23,740;Um, there was certain situations.
01:05:23,740;01:05:27,940;Let's not pretend that fucking man hasn't seen this shit before.
01:05:27,940;01:05:30,880;He's seen zero Don Lam in guaranteed he hasn't.
01:05:30,880;01:05:34,420;I bet he had that just came out that just started this year.
01:05:34,420;01:05:38,420;Or if he like, do you think that's why Manning was sucking dick?
01:05:38,420;01:05:40,820;You know, I threw an interception on that drive.
01:05:40,820;01:05:43,720;It was in his head. Yeah.
01:05:43,720;01:05:45,760;I think it's the players on the field.
01:05:45,760;01:05:47,760;I think it's Harrison. I think it's law.
01:05:47,760;01:05:50,900;I think it's guys like that that just make plays.
01:05:51,140;01:05:57,060;And the Colts were dropping a ton of passes. Like even that first drive, they were like three drops
01:05:57,060;01:06:03,540;and it's like, okay, these guys don't have the mental like fortitude to get through this game.
01:06:03,540;01:06:05,300;Yeah, because Belichick's in their head.
01:06:05,300;01:06:07,540;Steve, did you know that Greg was a Colts fan?
01:06:07,540;01:06:07,940;Yeah.
01:06:07,940;01:06:09,860;That was just like a Colts fan with all these excuses.
01:06:09,860;01:06:14,420;Yeah. But if they don't recover the field, if they cover the field, they better.
01:06:14,420;01:06:17,140;I'm shitting on Manning. You guys are trying to blow Belichick.
01:06:18,340;01:06:20,780;Did you see there's nobody down on the line?
01:06:20,780;01:06:24,980;It must have been so confusing for this guy who's a fucking Hall of Famer.
01:06:24,980;01:06:28,180;Yeah, you can. It's fucking Peyton.
01:06:28,180;01:06:30,860;Annie is like the most cerebral quarterback has ever lived.
01:06:30,860;01:06:33,580;Wow. You just gave it to Tom Brady there.
01:06:33,580;01:06:35,580;Yeah, he just chokes in big games. That's all.
01:06:35,580;01:06:39,460;A quote from Tony Dungy.
01:06:39,460;01:06:42,340;Well, you know, I pride myself in knowing the rules like
01:06:42,340;01:06:45,660;coach like coach Tony Dungy, that rule I didn't know.
01:06:46,020;01:06:48,700;What they say is once you go under center, if you move away from the center,
01:06:48,700;01:06:50,260;you have to be set for a second.
01:06:50,260;01:06:52,740;A fairly obscure rule, but it's in there somewhere, I guess.
01:06:52,740;01:06:55,580;You know, who knows that rule, Greg?
01:06:55,580;01:06:57,420;Oh, sick, dude.
01:06:57,420;01:07:00,500;That was the turning point of the game, and he was at five yard penalty.
01:07:00,500;01:07:02,820;Hey, it worked.
01:07:02,820;01:07:05,060;Actually, you know, you know, check my boys, dude,
01:07:05,060;01:07:06,140;that's how I'm going to start calling you guys.
01:07:06,140;01:07:08,820;Bell check, but boys, because it's incredible.
01:07:08,820;01:07:11,820;You want you want to hear some penalties that did affect the game
01:07:11,820;01:07:14,500;on that last scoring drive for the Patriots.
01:07:14,820;01:07:18,820;two defensive holding penalties called on the Colts. Whose fault was that?
01:07:18,820;01:07:21,780;Players for Bill Paulian.
01:07:21,780;01:07:23,700;Yeah.
01:07:23,700;01:07:28,580;Why? Because he's the one that got that rule instituted. And now I came back to buy them on
01:07:28,580;01:07:32,500;that last 94 96 yard drive, whatever it was.
01:07:32,500;01:07:38,420;Oh, Andy spin zone, dude. I love how triggered Greg is right now. This is the best.
01:07:38,420;01:07:41,300;Dude, it's like watching like fucking CNN or Fox News.
01:07:42,900;01:07:45,180;That's what it is. Little to help man cope with another.
01:07:45,180;01:07:47,100;That's what I feel like I'm doing when I watch you guys.
01:07:47,100;01:07:49,300;Andy, Andy, what was that quote? Andy, Andy, what was that quote?
01:07:49,300;01:07:51,380;Let's just talk over Greg. Let's just talk over Greg.
01:07:51,380;01:07:53,300;That will do. So if I can talk at the same time.
01:07:53,300;01:07:54,660;No, no, let's talk over Greg.
01:07:54,660;01:07:58,500;Would anybody say, but if I just talk the loudest, then people think I'm fucking right.
01:07:58,500;01:08:02,580;Wrong. Wrong. Greg's wife is a dog.
01:08:02,580;01:08:06,260;Wrong. Wrong.
01:08:06,260;01:08:08,660;You got a dog wife, Greg.
01:08:08,660;01:08:10,860;Dog wife. Steve.
01:08:10,860;01:08:12,780;I knew your mom's Zodiac killer, Greg.
01:08:12,780;01:08:16,860;But that will do little to help Manning cope with another clunker.
01:08:16,860;01:08:20,340;He is a visible superstar who is developing a reputation as a guy
01:08:20,340;01:08:22,100;who can't get it done when it matters.
01:08:22,100;01:08:25,900;Yeah, the only time I think about my history is when I walk in this interview
01:08:25,900;01:08:28,900;room, said Manning, it's a lot of the same song as last year.
01:08:28,900;01:08:31,380;I hope we could talk about something different, like a win.
01:08:31,380;01:08:34,220;There's a lot of pressure to see signs all week with my name on it.
01:08:34,220;01:08:35,740;It's my name versus the Patriots.
01:08:35,740;01:08:37,820;I never play that way or feel that way.
01:08:37,820;01:08:40,220;I knew it was the Colts versus the Patriots, but I want to do my job.
01:08:40,260;01:08:41,420;And I didn't do that well today.
01:08:41,420;01:08:43,440;He didn't.
01:08:43,440;01:08:48,060;Got to suck to be a fucking Colts fan.
01:08:48,060;01:08:52,860;I might tell you, you just get so excited every year.
01:08:52,860;01:08:56,020;Like crescendos in this like, Oh, here's our chance.
01:08:56,020;01:08:58,340;We're going to do it this year.
01:08:58,340;01:09:03,640;And then just fucking get your shit pushed in in the snow, like two years in a row.
01:09:03,640;01:09:06,340;And you're fucking, you're stuck.
01:09:06,340;01:09:10,180;quarterback. This grasses fans on live television.
01:09:10,180;01:09:15,540;Oh, here's, here's the more after that's
01:09:15,540;01:09:16,260;depressing.
01:09:16,260;01:09:19,900;Greg, this is for you. You'll like this. Gumble damn Reno
01:09:19,900;01:09:22,460;Boomer size in all pick the Patriots to win with Shannon
01:09:22,460;01:09:25,140;Sharp going for the Colts. After the game is I since
01:09:25,140;01:09:28,460;admitting might be quote, this generation's damn Marino a great
01:09:28,460;01:09:31,140;football player, but he's not going to get to a Super Bowl like
01:09:31,140;01:09:34,140;you said, at which point Marino interjected, Hey, I got to a
01:09:34,140;01:09:39,020;Super Bowl and a size and finish not with that defense. You know what I mean? There's too much
01:09:39,020;01:09:43,340;pressure on him to be perfect every week just like you, Marino, had to be. There's a discussion that
01:09:43,340;01:09:51,020;seemed guaranteed to be continued once the studio lights went off. Yeah, I mean, it sucks. There's
01:09:51,020;01:09:55,500;a difference between like you team losing and you playing well and your team losing and like
01:09:55,500;01:10:01,500;you playing terrible. Like when the Pats beat the Chiefs in homes, like had that really good game,
01:10:01,500;01:10:06,460;You're like, at least Chiefs fans can go home being like, we got a guy, you know,
01:10:06,460;01:10:11,020;he put his nuts on the table, he plays dick off, he just lost to a better team. But
01:10:11,020;01:10:16,700;these games are so like, must be so disheartening to be a fan of the team. Because you're like,
01:10:16,700;01:10:21,020;what happened to him? Like, I watched this guy for like 17 games and he was,
01:10:21,020;01:10:26,700;he's unstoppable. And then he, for some reason, he just gets this game and he's just horrific.
01:10:26,700;01:10:27,260;Three points.
01:10:27,260;01:10:31,180;Zoom raising once he faces BB just like and lays an egg. Yeah.
01:10:31,180;01:10:35,180;Oh, Peyton, Satan Manning.
01:10:35,180;01:10:40,300;Can only hide the horn so long, Greg.
01:10:40,300;01:10:42,620;He made a deal with the devil, I guess.
01:10:42,620;01:10:49,100;I found the quote about the fans chanting. It's also about like the signs that they had.
01:10:49,100;01:10:53,740;Quote, "After the game, you will get your ring. Suffer ring, red one."
01:10:54,540;01:10:57,740;The crowd was yelling cut that meat cut that meat in reference to the manning's
01:10:57,740;01:11:01,900;act in pain in which you choose for the common folk while they're performing their jobs.
01:11:01,900;01:11:07,020;Brutal. You see LeBron, LeBron would have called that racist.
01:11:07,020;01:11:08,940;You see that?
01:11:08,940;01:11:17,420;He was on his TV show, whatever shows that barbershop was. Yeah, Boston's racist. Why?
01:11:17,420;01:11:19,660;And he was like, they're like, why do you say that? He's like,
01:11:19,660;01:11:22,540;dude, whenever I go up there, they're always chanting like fuck LeBron.
01:11:23,180;01:11:25,900;It's like, dude, we've been saying fuck everybody.
01:11:25,900;01:11:31,660;It's not special, dude. It's not about you. Let's say that to Peyton.
01:11:31,660;01:11:35,100;They will say it to Bron James and say it to your mother. I don't give a damn.
01:11:35,100;01:11:36,940;To be fair, that commercial was sweet.
01:11:36,940;01:11:41,980;Yeah. And the one where the kids and you throw them football at them.
01:11:41,980;01:11:43,660;Yeah. I remember that one.
01:11:43,660;01:11:46,700;Like make a wish. I think it was an SNL skit. Yeah.
01:11:46,700;01:11:50,460;Yes. Yeah. Hucking the footballs out.
01:11:50,460;01:11:51,180;Yeah. That's funny.
01:11:51,180;01:11:52,060;That was a good one.
01:11:52,060;01:11:53,860;- What else have we got here?
01:11:53,860;01:11:56,020;- He's on, isn't he doing com things here?
01:11:56,020;01:11:59,340;- He was doing that thing with his brother.
01:11:59,340;01:12:00,180;- What was it?
01:12:00,180;01:12:01,540;Amazon or something?
01:12:01,540;01:12:04,580;- Who did just give a huge, oh Brady, right?
01:12:04,580;01:12:07,220;- No, Brady signed a deal when he's done.
01:12:07,220;01:12:09,020;- For like 10 million years or something.
01:12:09,020;01:12:09,860;- Yeah.
01:12:09,860;01:12:11,460;- That's ridiculous.
01:12:11,460;01:12:12,760;- He's gonna be terrible.
01:12:12,760;01:12:14,700;- I think.
01:12:14,700;01:12:15,540;- Yeah.
01:12:15,540;01:12:17,780;- I think he's gonna be a smarter Tony Romo.
01:12:17,780;01:12:21,020;- Greg's not negatively as charismatic as Tony Romo.
01:12:21,020;01:12:23,100;He's such a negative bitch, Greg.
01:12:23,100;01:12:26,260;- Dude, they gave him like a $300 million contract
01:12:26,260;01:12:29,580;for a guy that like has someone run his social media forum.
01:12:29,580;01:12:30,740;Like, come on.
01:12:30,740;01:12:32,900;- I can't wait for him to get dragged
01:12:32,900;01:12:34,560;for calling something disgusting.
01:12:34,560;01:12:37,980;- Yeah, that disgusting act.
01:12:37,980;01:12:38,820;- Yeah.
01:12:38,820;01:12:44,220;- It's a prejudice that surpasses objective reporting
01:12:44,220;01:12:45,220;is what it is.
01:12:45,220;01:12:47,900;(both laughing)
01:12:47,900;01:12:49,880;- Oh, good lord.
01:12:49,880;01:12:52,880;Alright boys, you got anything else?
01:12:52,880;01:12:53,880;Nope.
01:12:53,880;01:12:54,880;Alright.
01:12:54,880;01:12:55,880;That's it.
01:12:55,880;01:12:56,880;Where are we off to next week?
01:12:56,880;01:13:02,880;The Steel City, the Three Rivers, Three Rivers Stadium, a rematch of 2001.
01:13:02,880;01:13:04,880;Smogsville, USA.
01:13:04,880;01:13:05,880;It's a championship game.
01:13:05,880;01:13:07,880;But this time with the...
01:13:07,880;01:13:08,880;The new...
01:13:08,880;01:13:10,880;The new Troy Palomalo.
01:13:10,880;01:13:12,880;The new Queen of the NFL.
01:13:12,880;01:13:13,880;Benis?
01:13:13,880;01:13:14,880;Is Benis still kicking?
01:13:14,880;01:13:15,880;I don't believe...
01:13:15,880;01:13:16,880;God, I hate the Steelers, dude.
01:13:16,880;01:13:18,880;I don't know if I hate them.
01:13:18,880;01:13:19,720;I hate them.
01:13:19,720;01:13:21,280;No, he's still there.
01:13:21,280;01:13:23,000;I don't I have a hard time hitting them
01:13:23,000;01:13:25,280;because they never win.
01:13:25,280;01:13:26,520;You know, they have as many
01:13:26,520;01:13:27,840;intervals as the Patriots did.
01:13:27,840;01:13:29,440;Greg, you don't understand what is.
01:13:29,440;01:13:30,360;Yeah, but none of those counted
01:13:30,360;01:13:32,160;because they were before any of us are born.
01:13:32,160;01:13:33,200;So yeah, that's true.
01:13:33,200;01:13:34,040;And he's right.
01:13:34,040;01:13:36,960;And he's like a classic dude, spin zone guy.
01:13:36,960;01:13:38,920;And Greg, you don't understand what it's like.
01:13:38,920;01:13:40,480;Tonight on Fox News, we have
01:13:40,480;01:13:43,720;Andy defending the Patriots in any way he can possible.
01:13:45,640;01:13:49,920;Well, I just got fresh reading a book.
01:13:49,920;01:13:52,840;Well, the excerpts of the book called The Asterisk.
01:13:52,840;01:13:57,280;Written by a.
01:13:57,280;01:14:01,680;It's written by a.
01:14:01,680;01:14:04,320;Steelers fan and.
01:14:04,320;01:14:05,680;I'm trying to I'm trying to point out.
01:14:05,680;01:14:07,980;Spit it out, Andy, what is it?
01:14:07,980;01:14:09,860;It's all about how the Steelers Super Bowls don't count
01:14:09,860;01:14:12,280;because they're before this guy was born before.
01:14:12,520;01:14:21,240;No, it's how the Patriots don't count because Roger Goodell and the Patriots have
01:14:21,240;01:14:24,680;colluded to cheat the Patriots into six Super Bowl wins.
01:14:24,680;01:14:29,800;I'm not going to say the R word, but that's R worded.
01:14:29,800;01:14:31,960;Racist?
01:14:31,960;01:14:40,840;Oh, here's the full name of the book. The asterisk, a fan's grievance on cheating
01:14:40,840;01:14:45,640;and rule manipulation in the NFL. $4 paperback if you want.
01:14:45,640;01:14:47,560;So it's more than just Patriots stuff?
01:14:47,560;01:14:49,000;I sent another book club episode.
01:14:49,000;01:14:51,240;It is not more than just the Patriots stuff. That's the thing.
01:14:51,240;01:14:57,720;So it's a Steelers fan who ended up living in Portsmouth, New Hampshire of all places
01:14:57,720;01:15:01,400;and got so sick of arguing with Patriots fans that they weren't
01:15:01,400;01:15:06,840;cheaters or the Patriots cheaters and should have all their super bowl shipped from them
01:15:08,120;01:15:10,440;that he wrote a book.
01:15:10,440;01:15:15,120;Do the cheater thing and like the the referees thing.
01:15:15,120;01:15:19,480;Is just such a sour grape bullshit, you know.
01:15:19,480;01:15:21,080;Oh, yeah.
01:15:21,080;01:15:23,280;But this is like next level sour.
01:15:23,280;01:15:27,560;So many fans do that, too, of like their immediate reaction after teams lose is
01:15:27,560;01:15:31,560;you cheated or the refs do like.
01:15:31,560;01:15:35,400;Jaguars fans, I think, are the worst at the moment.
01:15:35,800;01:15:38,240;that AFC Championship game where Miles Jack wasn't down.
01:15:38,240;01:15:40,300;Oh, yes.
01:15:40,300;01:15:42,440;I mean, to be fair, it's all they got to hang their hat on.
01:15:42,440;01:15:45,480;Yeah. I mean, you can complain about calls, but they go either way.
01:15:45,480;01:15:47,640;And like the one people that think it's like,
01:15:47,640;01:15:50,540;do the NFL wants these teams in the Super Bowl.
01:15:50,540;01:15:51,780;It's like they don't give a shit.
01:15:51,780;01:15:52,640;They're making money.
01:15:52,640;01:15:54,540;So much money they don't have to do with.
01:15:54,540;01:15:57,320;They'd rather not fuck with the Golden Pig.
01:15:57,320;01:15:59,780;Yeah. Golden Goose.
01:15:59,780;01:16:01,980;And actually, I think it
01:16:01,980;01:16:05,180;Super Bowls are probably more watched now if the Patriots aren't in it.
01:16:05,180;01:16:09,380;Yeah, I mean, they don't, I don't think they fuck around with any of that shit.
01:16:09,380;01:16:11,620;They just try and call them the best they can.
01:16:11,620;01:16:13,980;And sometimes they do a better job than other times.
01:16:13,980;01:16:15,660;Yeah, this isn't the NBA.
01:16:15,660;01:16:19,260;I also think the referees aren't, well, you should probably be full-time employees and
01:16:19,260;01:16:20,780;not have side jobs.
01:16:20,780;01:16:23,500;I think it's a very hard thing to do to referee a game.
01:16:23,500;01:16:26,020;So I think this is about as good as you get.
01:16:26,020;01:16:28,620;Yeah, I mean, I know the rule.
01:16:28,620;01:16:30,420;Andy, Andy, care to comment?
01:16:30,420;01:16:34,180;Yeah, I think it could be, I think they could have more help, like put more replay cameras
01:16:34,180;01:16:39,060;around so you get better at any of those. But yeah, I think it could be sped up. Yep.
01:16:39,060;01:16:43,860;Like the replays obnoxious that takes that long. Right? Like they, what's, is it hockey where they
01:16:43,860;01:16:50,740;have the replay guy in the booth or soccer actually now, right? It's the fucking else calls it.
01:16:50,740;01:16:57,460;Hockey does awesome is if you don't get a call, you challenge and you miss it penalty. Yeah.
01:16:57,460;01:17:03,780;Really? I love it. Or delay a game. That's fucking kick ass dude. So they only challenge things that
01:17:03,780;01:17:06,220;that they're like, we're fucking,
01:17:06,220;01:17:08,140;I think we're gonna get this yet.
01:17:08,140;01:17:10,300;This is like an obvious overturn.
01:17:10,300;01:17:12,520;- Yeah, I mean, in this game even,
01:17:12,520;01:17:19,100;Tony Dungy challenged the obvious fumble by Harrison
01:17:19,100;01:17:20,500;at the end of the game,
01:17:20,500;01:17:22,860;because it was like a Hail Mary
01:17:22,860;01:17:25,060;that maybe he'll get overturned, but it was blatant.
01:17:25,060;01:17:27,940;- Fucking penalized in 15 yard, or if you get it.
01:17:27,940;01:17:29,740;- If you get it, unsportsmanly conduct delay game.
01:17:29,740;01:17:30,860;- No, you have to play with 10 men.
01:17:30,860;01:17:33,180;- Making us all watch extra commercials.
01:17:33,180;01:17:35,100;Definitely 10 men for the rest of the drive.
01:17:35,100;01:17:38,180;See, Steve, now you talk my language here.
01:17:38,180;01:17:44,300;All right, boys.
01:17:44,300;01:17:48,700;So we will see you next week in Three Rivers Stadium.
01:17:48,700;01:17:50,340;More jersey we wearing.
01:17:50,340;01:17:52,380;I don't know who's the hero.
01:17:52,380;01:17:53,420;Tom Brady.
01:17:53,420;01:17:54,620;I got a Harrison.
01:17:54,620;01:17:57,140;Harrison probably deserves a jersey wear at some point.
01:17:57,140;01:18:01,780;I'd say probably Dion Branch has himself a good branch.
01:18:01,780;01:18:03,600;Save that one for the Super Bowl.
01:18:03,600;01:18:05,100;- Yeah, good point, Steve.
01:18:05,100;01:18:06,140;- Fair, fair, fair.
01:18:06,140;01:18:07,660;- Good point.
01:18:07,660;01:18:09,620;- Steve Brown.
01:18:09,620;01:18:13,260;Yeah, Rodney Harrison's probably one and one A.
01:18:13,260;01:18:14,180;- All right.
01:18:14,180;01:18:15,980;Well, I think that's it for this week.
01:18:15,980;01:18:17,540;So until next week.
01:18:17,540;01:18:19,820;- Good, I'm getting sick of you guys anyways,
01:18:19,820;01:18:21,020;especially you, Andy.
01:18:21,020;01:18:23,220;- Says the guy who hasn't showed up in a month.
01:18:23,220;01:18:25,180;(both laughing)
01:18:25,180;01:18:27,940;Yeah, do you have anything to say
01:18:27,940;01:18:31,060;about why you weren't there last week or are you good?
01:18:31,060;01:18:32,060;I always say that.
01:18:32,060;01:18:33,860;The four people is too many.
01:18:33,860;01:18:36,260;Okay, I do it for the fans.
01:18:36,260;01:18:37,660;Yeah. Oh, all right.
01:18:37,660;01:18:39,460;So you got people talking over each other.
01:18:39,460;01:18:42,460;It gets like it just doesn't feel like a conversation.
01:18:42,460;01:18:44,360;It feels like an interview and you have like four people.
01:18:44,360;01:18:50,060;I don't join this podcast to interview people.
01:18:50,060;01:18:52,060;I have enough shit like that at work.
01:18:52,060;01:18:54,360;I don't need to come here and be like, well, excuse me, sir.
01:18:54,360;01:18:58,860;Like, how did you feel on the first time you stepped onto the field?
01:19:00,860;01:19:03,460;Tommy Longcock. Yeah. Tommy Longcock.
01:19:03,460;01:19:05,500;I'm trying to fuck around with my brothers.
01:19:05,500;01:19:07,620;No, I talk to famous people.
01:19:07,620;01:19:09,660;Let's go eat with them and bang their mouths.
01:19:09,660;01:19:14,860;From what?
01:19:14,860;01:19:18,100;Hang their mouth.
01:19:18,100;01:19:20,140;Let's go eat with them and bang their mouths.
01:19:20,140;01:19:23,620;Hopefully moms from the podcast over this place.
01:19:23,620;01:19:28,140;The fuck is that from?
01:19:28,140;01:19:30,020;Hang on, hang on. One more.
01:19:30,020;01:19:32,260;I knew I'd be shitting pancakes.
01:19:32,260;01:19:34,020;Oh, yeah, I know that.
01:19:34,020;01:19:35,900;Yeah, yeah.
01:19:35,900;01:19:39,420;But now you don't remember the let's go eat with them and bang their mouths.
01:19:39,420;01:19:41,740;Is that from the Cam Newton episode?
01:19:41,740;01:19:42,860;No, no.
01:19:42,860;01:19:45,820;I think I have a full story.
01:19:45,820;01:19:48,260;Yo, I got those chicks from last night lined up.
01:19:48,260;01:19:50,460;Let's go eat with them and bang their mouths.
01:19:50,460;01:19:51,460;Oh, I know.
01:19:51,460;01:19:55,300;I know. That's right.
01:19:55,300;01:19:57,620;Yeah, that's incognito.
01:19:57,620;01:19:58,660;Yeah.
01:19:58,660;01:20:02,260;I got that. That's a fucking direct quote from the.
01:20:02,260;01:20:03,940;Yes, yes, that is a direct quote.
01:20:03,940;01:20:05,660;They're. That's your name.
01:20:05,660;01:20:08,540;That one. I don't know.
01:20:08,540;01:20:11,100;I feel like that might be our sign off.
01:20:11,100;01:20:12,100;No, wait a minute.
01:20:12,100;01:20:13,700;Just don't. What about like?
01:20:13,700;01:20:15,140;Thanks for listening.
01:20:15,140;01:20:17,100;Don't forget. Bang their mouths.
01:20:17,100;01:20:21,100;And we had said that a while ago that we had a new sign off.
01:20:21,100;01:20:22,940;No. All right. Hmm.

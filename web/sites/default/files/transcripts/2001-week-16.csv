00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,160;"I am not your mother."
00:19,160;00:24,160;"Alright, welcome back to the Page of Stimesy Podcasts."
00:24,160;00:29,480;"podcast. This isn't really is a bit of a departure from what we've been doing"
00:29,480;00:34,840;"normally is the bi week in 2001 for the Patriots. So we thought we would do our"
00:34,840;00:41,280;"own little bi week episode. So we still have everybody with us today. Gentlemen,"
00:41,280;00:46,240;"how you how you're handling how you holding up with everything going on"
00:46,240;00:52,400;"right now in the world. I'm sitting pretty. I'm loving it. Yeah, you're sounding"
00:52,400;00:55,880;"pretty. I wish we could quarantine all the time."
00:55,880;01:00,120;"Yeah. So who knows when this is coming out? Probably"
01:00,120;01:02,440;"may or"
01:02,440;01:03,120;"quarantine."
01:03,120;01:07,960;"Yes. So probably should we predict when the quarantine will"
01:07,960;01:09,680;"end? Yeah. Yeah."
01:09,680;01:14,960;"As well. If this is in the future date today is March 20. Yes."
01:14,960;01:17,320;"So this is it. We're as you can probably hear our voices still"
01:17,320;01:20,320;"the beginnings of the first week of quarantine for most of us. I"
01:20,320;01:23,120;"I think we still have hope left."
01:23,120;01:27,680;"So Steve, what is your prediction for when this one?"
01:27,680;01:31,600;"- I am gonna say May 12th."
01:31,600;01:34,600;"- Yeah, right."
01:34,600;01:37,480;"- It seems like you put some thought into that."
01:37,480;01:40,040;"I was just gonna pick a number of random, but all right."
01:40,040;01:40,880;"- Yeah, I did."
01:40,880;01:42,320;"I just picked the number of random."
01:42,320;01:43,880;"- Oh, okay."
01:43,880;01:46,880;"- Like longer than I think, but before my birthday."
01:46,880;01:47,960;"- All right, all right."
01:47,960;01:50,460;"So you think we're going back to work on a Wednesday, Steve?"
01:50,460;01:53,120;"Fucking 88."
01:53,120;01:55,880;"All right, Greg, you're turn then."
01:55,880;01:59,620;"I'm saying July 6th."
01:59,620;02:02,300;"So after the fourth, we're all coming back."
02:02,300;02:03,980;"You think so?"
02:03,980;02:05,780;"Yeah, that's a long time."
02:05,780;02:07,160;"Sure is, dude."
02:07,160;02:07,880;"All right."
02:07,880;02:09,700;"We got to flatten the curve."
02:09,700;02:11,180;"That's true."
02:11,180;02:12,100;"That's what they say."
02:12,100;02:12,360;"Yeah."
02:12,360;02:13,160;"That's a big thing."
02:13,160;02:13,920;"Yeah."
02:13,920;02:16,580;"I've been writing a lot of internet."
02:16,580;02:23,380;"Mike, what do you think?"
02:23,380;02:28,780;"Well, it depends, you know, because they have the, they have this vaccine now, I think,"
02:28,780;02:33,300;"for malaria that's supposedly doing some things, but I hear on the low, but there's"
02:33,300;02:34,620;"some side effects."
02:34,620;02:38,020;"So if they started injecting people with this stuff and then like two weeks later, other"
02:38,020;02:40,700;"stuff is happening, that will definitely sway things."
02:40,700;02:47,700;"So I'm guessing nine weeks from now, whatever that is."
02:47,700;02:48,700;"All right."
02:48,700;02:52,340;"What are the side effects, Mike, do you know?"
02:52,340;02:56,740;"I think it's increased heart rate and having, like if you have some type of heart condition"
02:56,740;03:00,700;"or something, it's pretty much not good."
03:00,700;03:04,780;"And if you have an erection for more than four hours, you probably call a doctor."
03:04,780;03:08,940;"They have said that, but I don't know if it's common knowledge."
03:08,940;03:11,940;"- Oh, that's a different drug?"
03:11,940;03:13,340;"- It might be the same, I don't know what the--"
03:13,340;03:14,180;"- That's the one I--"
03:14,180;03:15,020;"- That's the one I--"
03:15,020;03:15,840;"- Sorry."
03:15,840;03:16,680;"- About all the time, so I wasn't sure."
03:16,680;03:18,780;"- Is that fight off the Corona, maybe?"
03:18,780;03:20,300;"I bet you they haven't even tried."
03:20,300;03:22,380;"- It fights off a lot of things."
03:22,380;03:23,900;"- All right."
03:23,900;03:27,140;"Well, somebody should tell Trump to give it a shot."
03:27,140;03:28,140;"- Oh, he's tried it."
03:28,140;03:33,540;"It might be a good time to try boner pills, you know?"
03:33,540;03:34,380;"He's stuck it off."
03:34,380;03:35,700;"- It's out."
03:35,700;03:37,180;"- A lot of babies."
03:37,180;03:40,020;"Yeah, we're just yanking off if you're single. I don't know."
03:40,020;03:40,860;"Yeah."
03:40,860;03:44,460;"You think that this is going to be another like boom, like a baby boom."
03:44,460;03:47,460;"Two to three months of lockdown."
03:47,460;03:51,740;"Well, here's the other side is if you're stuck with your significant other for"
03:51,740;03:54,780;"all day, could get sick of them."
03:54,780;03:57,580;"It might be off. Might have the opposite effect."
03:57,580;04:00,540;"Ooh, spike in divorces."
04:00,540;04:02,260;"The voices and no kidding."
04:02,260;04:04,380;"Then think about that."
04:04,540;04:08,420;"man, what's going to happen to the, the society?"
04:08,420;04:12,820;"All right, who else got some dates?"
04:12,820;04:19,860;"I think we're not going to have this lifted until November 2020."
04:19,860;04:20,980;"What?"
04:20,980;04:23,660;"Oh boy."
04:23,660;04:25,340;"One day, November seconds."
04:25,340;04:26,900;"Dude, what's going to be?"
04:26,900;04:27,740;"Damn."
04:27,740;04:33,060;"And I'm always saying that because I'm still bitter about the Tom Brady news."
04:33,060;04:36,780;"And if that happens, if it's November, then I think the football season will have been"
04:36,780;04:37,620;"canceled."
04:37,620;04:38,620;"So."
04:38,620;04:44,180;"We're the odds that we've finished this podcast, the whole dynasty before the quarantine"
04:44,180;04:45,180;"is over."
04:45,180;04:46,540;"Um,"
04:46,540;04:50,780;"8% to 1 odds."
04:50,780;04:53,380;"The whole, the whole thing, the, every season?"
04:53,380;04:54,380;"Yep."
04:54,380;04:55,380;"Oh,"
04:55,380;04:56,380;"Um,"
04:56,380;04:58,500;"Well, we discussed there's no end to the Patriots dynasty yet."
04:58,500;04:59,500;"So who knows?"
04:59,500;05:01,500;"And if there is no full host."
05:01,500;05:06,420;"think we've discussed that. Wait, do we decide it isn't it hasn't ended or it has?"
05:06,420;05:08,900;"I think it was a split decision."
05:08,900;05:09,900;"Has that?"
05:09,900;05:11,660;"I don't know."
05:11,660;05:13,260;"I don't know."
05:13,260;05:17,700;"But if football doesn't come back, you recorded because it's never now."
05:17,700;05:19,740;"Stittling into the Super Bowl."
05:19,740;05:22,580;"We can go back here and you'll have egg on your face, brother."
05:22,580;05:26,940;"This is true when this gets released in November 2020."
05:26,940;05:28,420;"Hey, it's in the archives, man."
05:28,940;05:33,940;"So there are 361 games so far in this since,"
05:33,940;05:36,220;"imagine at some point if we get desperate,"
05:36,220;05:37,700;"we'll go back to the 2000 season."
05:37,700;05:42,700;"So 361 games so we could record an episode every day"
05:42,700;05:46,060;"and be here this time next year."
05:46,060;05:48,500;"Still releasing episodes."
05:48,500;05:51,380;"- Yeah, that's tough. - So they have to talk"
05:51,380;05:53,220;"into you guys, that's enough for me."
05:53,220;05:54,300;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
05:54,300;05:55,140;"- Me too."
05:55,140;05:57,100;"- I'll think about it."
05:57,100;06:00,080;"Well, I'll be here."
06:00,080;06:00,920;"Just fuck you guys."
06:00,920;06:06,880;"I would sound like with you doing"
06:06,880;06:09,440;"just me. Yeah, it wouldn't be great."
06:09,440;06:10,240;"I don't think it could be."
06:10,240;06:11,560;"I mean, you have a lovely voice."
06:11,560;06:13,560;"I've often said that ASMR."
06:13,560;06:15,920;"It would probably turn into that."
06:15,920;06:16,920;"Yeah."
06:16,920;06:18,800;"You get a real face for radio, Andy."
06:18,800;06:20,080;"Oh boy."
06:20,080;06:21,640;"Good job. We're related."
06:21,640;06:25,940;"Well, he has a different face, Andy, but I see where you"
06:25,940;06:29,060;"It's not a better face. I didn't say it was"
06:29,060;06:35,940;"I know I'm just I'm just letting everybody else that that hasn't met us. No, it's not a better face"
06:35,940;06:43,600;"I think we've already decided yeah weeks ago that the only person that doesn't have a face for radio was Mike"
06:43,600;06:49,860;"His beautiful haircut. Well, oh, right, right. I'm the pretty one of the family"
06:49,860;06:55,460;"Pretty ugly dude Mike told me I look like Tom Brady"
06:55,460;06:56,300;"- That's true."
06:56,300;06:57,780;"- On here."
06:57,780;06:58,620;"That's on record."
06:58,620;06:59,460;"- Guilty."
06:59,460;07:01,260;"- Yeah, but I think he was on PCP though, so."
07:01,260;07:02,100;"(laughs)"
07:02,100;07:03,460;"- I don't know about that."
07:03,460;07:05,460;"- Those are all you guys."
07:05,460;07:06,540;"- I believe that may have been scratched"
07:06,540;07:07,900;"from the record, Andy."
07:07,900;07:09,220;"We'll have to talk about that."
07:09,220;07:11,700;"- Yeah, which means this may have to be as well."
07:11,700;07:13,620;"- I didn't know you would like to get wet."
07:13,620;07:14,620;"(laughs)"
07:14,620;07:15,660;"- I don't know what that means."
07:15,660;07:17,780;"So next topic."
07:17,780;07:18,700;"(laughs)"
07:18,700;07:19,620;"- All right."
07:19,620;07:20,460;"So,"
07:20,460;07:24,580;"because this is the bi-week,"
07:24,580;07:26,500;"I kind of wanted to do a little bit of, you know,"
07:26,500;07:28,180;"what the Patriots would do."
07:28,180;07:31,020;"Wanna look internally, just briefly,"
07:31,020;07:34,320;"kind of do some self scouting as it were."
07:34,320;07:37,220;"So a couple of things,"
07:37,220;07:38,980;"I just want to bring to your attention"
07:38,980;07:44,420;"for our analytics,"
07:44,420;07:46,720;"which may only be exciting to us,"
07:46,720;07:49,620;"but in all transparency,"
07:49,620;07:53,580;"we have officially gone over a hundred listens"
07:53,580;07:58,460;"for an episode. It happened this week. So I single episode one"
07:58,460;08:02,100;"episode has 106 the first episode has 106 listens."
08:02,100;08:03,700;"Wow. Yeah."
08:03,700;08:06,020;"Why don't you even me?"
08:06,020;08:07,580;"It drops off every time."
08:07,580;08:13,780;"From there. Yeah, I don't know if this is the best topic to go"
08:13,780;08:16,460;"on here with. But you do you man."
08:16,460;08:18,060;"Well, say me to this part."
08:18,060;08:19,820;"That's what I'm saying. Yeah."
08:20,300;08:24,020;"And so congratulations for that."
08:24,020;08:25,580;"We've hit 100."
08:25,580;08:31,700;"And I've also been kind of generally keeping track"
08:31,700;08:35,060;"of when we say stupid shit, we don't know the answer."
08:35,060;08:38,980;"So I went back and tried to look some of that shit up."
08:38,980;08:42,460;"I know it's not complete because I only did it sometimes"
08:42,460;08:43,900;"when I felt it was super egregious."
08:43,900;08:49,660;"But some of the things that we have said--"
08:49,660;08:54,160;"I have in here. I think we already debunked this, but Aaron Glenn is not in the Hall of Fame."
08:54,160;08:56,960;"Allegedly. We don't know."
08:56,960;08:57,960;"Aaron Glenn."
08:57,960;08:59,260;"Aaron Glenn."
08:59,260;09:02,360;"Terry Glenn is definitely in the Hall of Fame."
09:02,360;09:05,160;"Terry Glenn."
09:05,160;09:05,560;"Also."
09:05,560;09:08,060;"Yeah."
09:08,060;09:08,560;"Step back."
09:08,560;09:10,060;"Yeah."
09:10,060;09:10,560;"Watch it off."
09:10,560;09:11,160;"He's not."
09:11,160;09:12,060;"Okay."
09:12,060;09:13,760;"It was worth a shot."
09:13,760;09:14,560;"Well, that was quick."
09:14,560;09:15,760;"Yeah."
09:17,460;09:21,580;"I believe we're also going back and forth on whether or not Terry Glenn got a Super Bowl ring."
09:21,580;09:22,160;"He did not."
09:22,160;09:23,580;"What?"
09:23,580;09:24,940;"You know, you have a"
09:24,940;09:26,220;"confirmed, huh?"
09:26,220;09:26,980;"Yeah."
09:26,980;09:27,380;"I can't."
09:27,380;09:28,380;"Oh my goodness."
09:28,380;09:29,260;"How do you figure that out?"
09:29,260;09:31,580;"Uh, somebody told somebody, so I looked it up."
09:31,580;09:34,900;"And, uh, yeah, he did not get."
09:34,900;09:36,660;"I don't know where I found it, but he did not get one."
09:36,660;09:38,820;"The fabric of the world just fell apart right now."
09:38,820;09:39,540;"Yeah."
09:39,540;09:44,580;"Uh, we talked about Curtis Martin and I had to get super garbled there."
09:44,580;09:47,260;"Andy, take it back."
09:47,260;09:51,460;"I'm just like when underwater. Yeah."
09:51,460;09:55,820;"I don't know. My internet just. Oh, really?"
09:55,820;09:58,380;"Because I've been talking for a shit. Kelly."
09:58,380;10:00,420;"We're live."
10:00,420;10:01,700;"Oh, I'm sorry."
10:01,700;10:02,860;"I'm unbelievable."
10:02,860;10:06,140;"This is what I'm talking about."
10:06,140;10:07,580;"We're not going to make it."
10:07,580;10:11,860;"Kelly just walked in on a fucking happy hour live chat."
10:11,860;10:14,580;"Craig Brown's Buckass naked."
10:14,820;10:23,940;"What does it butthole naked? Is that it? Something? What's that from? That's from."
10:23,940;10:29,740;"Incoming, you know, no, it was the rock. Oh, so it wasn't Gluck."
10:29,740;10:33,580;"It was what's his name. The Y Jaseva from the Ravens. Oh, yes."
10:33,580;10:38,180;"It's med everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Say in somebody with butthole wide open."
10:38,180;10:41,020;"So I don't remember what yeah, he's the best. Yeah."
10:43,940;10:47,180;"You can tell I've been editing the Christmas one for too long."
10:47,180;10:49,340;"Because it's all in there."
10:49,340;10:50,060;"Let's see."
10:50,060;10:50,660;"What else we talked about?"
10:50,660;10:52,660;"We talked about Curtis Martin and his poison pill"
10:52,660;10:54,220;"in his contract."
10:54,220;10:57,700;"And we did a horrendous job explaining it."
10:57,700;10:59,740;"So I looked it up a bit more."
10:59,740;11:02,780;"Basically, the poison pill was a clause in the contract"
11:02,780;11:04,460;"that stated that Curtis Martin would become"
11:04,460;11:07,060;"an unrestricted free agent after one year"
11:07,060;11:10,300;"if the Patriots match the offer."
11:10,300;11:11,620;"And the Patriots would have been forced"
11:11,620;11:17,140;"pay like a $3 million roster bonus, which they wouldn't have been able to fit into the cap."
11:17,140;11:24,100;"So that was why they couldn't bring them back. That seems a bit more clear at that time."
11:24,100;11:28,500;"And now what was the, is that what you were going to say last time before you went underwater?"
11:28,500;11:36,420;"Yes. Okay. Cool. And also just a side note on that while I was looking that up,"
11:37,540;11:44,020;"The Jets general manager Mike Tanenbaum is regarded in many circles as the guy who"
11:44,020;11:47,460;"fathered the idea of the poison pill. So of course it was a Jetson mention."
11:47,460;11:51,780;"I mean it's a smart move. It is. That's a Belichick move too, you know."
11:51,780;11:57,940;"You're showing your bias again Andy. You'd be like it's genius."
11:57,940;12:03,860;"Of course and I mean he exploits everything. So yeah, it definitely sounds like it."
12:03,860;12:05,620;"What are you talking about? I call the rules of the rules."
12:06,980;12:11,460;"Wait, Andy, can you just admit that Belichick has cheated before? Can you say that?"
12:11,460;12:17,300;"Sure. Well, yeah. All right. All right. Now we're on the same page. So you sent the rule for"
12:17,300;12:22,580;"rolling. Okay. Whoa. Okay. So the end of the loop. Yeah. There you go. All right. We're on the"
12:22,580;12:28,980;"same page. You're growing. All right. In week four, I think it was just me and Mike talking about"
12:30,180;12:33,180;"sex versus Tom Brady and the leaders in that."
12:33,180;12:35,540;"And we talked about how"
12:35,540;12:38,820;"what a what an episode that was my dad."
12:38,820;12:41,460;"Yeah, I think that was a dolphin's one, wasn't it?"
12:41,460;12:42,860;"I don't remember."
12:42,860;12:46,060;"That was the game that we talked about how we would never watch that game again."
12:46,060;12:48,180;"Oh, something just happened."
12:48,180;12:49,180;"Yeah."
12:49,180;12:50,260;"Is everyone OK?"
12:50,260;12:53,700;"I think Steve now has yes."
12:53,700;12:57,540;"Oh boy."
12:57,540;12:59,640;"So yeah, so we we fucked up some of the numbers."
12:59,640;13:01,520;"I'm not gonna bother correcting it."
13:01,520;13:02,820;"Stay chill out."
13:02,820;13:03,660;"Right?"
13:03,660;13:04,660;"What the fuck are you doing, Steve?"
13:04,660;13:07,260;"What are you making?"
13:07,260;13:08,460;"Fucking pizza back there."
13:08,460;13:09,620;"I'm getting out of the beer."
13:09,620;13:11,260;"Cool."
13:11,260;13:12,480;"You want to make a little bit more noise?"
13:12,480;13:12,880;"Like do it."
13:12,880;13:15,420;"I you could hear that."
13:15,420;13:16,180;"I was all in my kitchen."
13:16,180;13:17,580;"You know we could hear that."
13:17,580;13:20,580;"And they thought you came down with something."
13:20,580;13:23,180;"Pretty sure after all of ours now."
13:23,180;13:25,820;"Had it already beat it."
13:25,820;13:27,100;"There it is."
13:27,100;13:28,100;"Oh boy."
13:28,100;13:33,660;"But Mike, in that episode, we were talking about the number of people who lost their"
13:33,660;13:35,980;"jobs due to the Patriots, if you recall."
13:35,980;13:37,820;"Oh yeah."
13:37,820;13:42,460;"And I came up with a real rough back of the envelope number."
13:42,460;13:47,500;"Did a little bit of research, and I came up with, in terms of coaches and quarterbacks"
13:47,500;13:54,620;"in the AOC East, about 58 of them have lost their job due to the ongoing Patriots dynasty."
13:54,620;13:56,900;"That's amazing."
13:56,900;13:59,980;"a lot. You think that bell check feels bad about that?"
13:59,980;14:08,380;"No comment. Okay. Hey, I have something. I have a quote from"
14:08,380;14:13,260;"Terry Glenn about the ring. Do you see this? Well, Terry, 29. This"
14:13,260;14:16,580;"isn't 2019. He said if they offer me one, I'll certainly accept"
14:16,580;14:19,980;"it and keep it in my archives. It would be nice. It would be"
14:19,980;14:24,740;"nice to get one. Yeah. Wait, he said that in 2019. That's in"
14:24,740;14:28,020;"article was written. Oh, no, never mind. 2002."
14:28,020;14:30,380;"I think I read that."
14:30,380;14:33,620;"Yeah, I was going to say, I mean, we're not going to ruin that"
14:33,620;14:35,460;"surprise, but yeah, wait,"
14:35,460;14:36,660;"talk to the Terry glint a bit."
14:36,660;14:40,940;"That's a bullshit. So Putin gets a Super Bowl ring and Terry"
14:40,940;14:41,620;"Glenn doesn't"
14:41,620;14:44,740;"is that confirmed?"
14:44,740;14:45,740;"Putin has one?"
14:45,740;14:46,900;"I thought so."
14:46,900;14:49,580;"I believe Putin kind of took it."
14:49,580;14:51,020;"Right."
14:51,020;14:52,340;"Story. I think so."
14:52,740;14:54,580;"classic. Yeah, shocking."
14:54,580;14:56,340;"I think it was an accident, Andy."
14:56,340;14:58,580;"I think it was a miscommunication, the language barrier."
14:58,580;15:00,260;"Perhaps."
15:00,260;15:02,500;"But I'm guessing it probably wasn't."
15:02,500;15:04,500;"It was just blamed on that."
15:04,500;15:06,020;"Do you think that's how your plan should have gotten one?"
15:06,020;15:08,740;"I mean, we can, I guess, further assess after you go down."
15:08,740;15:09,340;"Yeah."
15:09,340;15:09,860;"Yeah."
15:09,860;15:11,420;"We'll talk about that in a minute."
15:11,420;15:15,140;"The last thing that I had was when we had Connor on,"
15:15,140;15:17,620;"and we were talking all about kickers,"
15:17,620;15:21,220;"he wanted to know a kicker accuracy by distance."
15:21,220;15:24,780;"And basically, Goskowski is the more accurate kicker."
15:24,780;15:26,740;"Ouch."
15:26,740;15:27,820;"That's what I say."
15:27,820;15:34,180;"And then in the playoffs, they didn't have it broken down my distance, but."
15:34,180;15:39,980;"Vintitary was a less accurate kicker in the playoffs, too."
15:39,980;15:40,460;"Surprising."
15:40,460;15:41,020;"Really?"
15:41,020;15:42,300;"That's a really huge shoe."
15:42,300;15:45,700;"He made 70s, just over 76% of his field goals."
15:45,700;15:46,900;"Really?"
15:46,900;15:49,700;"And Goskowski's made 88%."
15:50,580;15:53,760;"Minnitary didn't miss an extra point, but they were also from the two-yard line."
15:53,760;15:57,060;"You never miss one? Nope."
15:57,060;15:59,660;"Not on the playoffs. Oh, gotcha."
15:59,660;16:04,460;"He was 367 of 374"
16:04,460;16:09,700;"in the regular season, 98.1%, which is still just very slightly lower than"
16:09,700;16:12,380;"Kostkowski's 98.3%. So"
16:12,380;16:16,860;"Kostkowski, more accurate kicker, just in general."
16:19,100;16:20,100;"in your face, Connor."
16:20,100;16:22,340;"Indeed."
16:22,340;16:26,000;"So that's all I had."
16:26,000;16:28,100;"I just want to clear those things, get the, uh,"
16:28,100;16:30,380;"just get some transparency here."
16:30,380;16:33,620;"We're not perfect, but we're working towards being so."
16:33,620;16:35,300;"No, we're not."
16:35,300;16:38,820;"And if any, no, we're definitely, if any of our listeners have anything else"
16:38,820;16:42,300;"they want to talk about, um, Greg's email address is"
16:42,300;16:45,860;"gd brown, something earlier."
16:46,500;16:52,500;"You're gonna throw my email? Yeah. Yeah. If you have an issue with the podcast email Greg."
16:52,500;17:01,300;"Now keep in mind that on our rate by the time you send us a question it might take us three months"
17:01,300;17:07,780;"to answer it on air but hey it'll be answered. Yeah. Or you can you can hit up Mike Mello on Twitter"
17:07,780;17:15,060;"at I don't know leave me alone. Yeah, so it is five three four. Yeah. Just the old the old Twitter."
17:15,060;17:27,060;"I write some do's on that one. Can I sneak peek my incognito Jonathan Martin? I have a relevant"
17:27,060;17:34,740;"text from that. Oh, Jonathan Martin says, what's your address to which incognito responds one,"
17:34,740;17:37,300;"one two three four, go fuck yourself place."
17:37,300;17:40,340;"He went with place."
17:40,340;17:41,700;"Yeah."
17:41,700;17:41,900;"Yeah."
17:41,900;17:42,500;"It's classed."
17:42,500;17:45,780;"Distinguished one two three fours the best part."
17:45,780;17:53,060;"Uh, so yeah, so the set, the second part of this was going to be, we're going to do some deep dives"
17:53,060;17:56,260;"because I think that's kind of also what the Patriots would do."
17:56,260;17:59,540;"They would take a deeper look into their, their own stuff."
17:59,540;18:02,300;"So this is one that I had set up."
18:02,380;18:07,180;"We have talked a lot about Terry Glenn, but we haven't really gotten into Terry"
18:07,180;18:10,780;"Glenn, the person, the man, the myth, the legend."
18:10,780;18:16,540;"So I thought we would do a bit of a deep dive on him next."
18:16,540;18:24,220;"So Terry Glenn, Terry Tyree Glenn, which I feel like is foreshadowing his"
18:24,220;18:27,740;"middle name, his middle name is Tyree and his first name is Terry."
18:27,740;18:28,660;"Yes."
18:28,660;18:30,060;"Yeah."
18:30,060;18:31,340;"Just verifying."
18:31,940;18:34,140;"Yes, Terry's Tyreagelin."
18:34,140;18:35,260;"That's tough."
18:35,260;18:39,020;"Born July 23rd, 1974 in Columbus, Ohio."
18:39,020;18:41,420;"That will come back to be important later."
18:41,420;18:46,620;"We talk a lot about, I think football players"
18:46,620;18:48,460;"coming from rough upbringings."
18:48,460;18:50,220;"I think we talked about, you know,"
18:50,220;18:52,300;"David Patton and Troy Brown,"
18:52,300;18:54,500;"like being super poor and having like"
18:54,500;18:56,660;"worked the fields and stuff"
18:56,660;18:59,180;"to make ends meet for their family and things like that."
18:59,180;19:02,380;"Like what? I thought he was like shipping coffee."
19:02,380;19:07,700;"Really loading loading coffee on the trucks by the bag full."
19:07,700;19:09,700;"Yeah, it's not what he's not working to feel."
19:09,700;19:12,380;"What are you talking about? Troy Brown was coffee."
19:12,380;19:14,420;"He was. Yeah. Oh, he wasn't."
19:14,420;19:16,340;"Yeah. All right. Cool."
19:16,340;19:18,540;"And we have you ever farmed coffee?"
19:18,540;19:21,540;"No, it's not as glamorous as you would think."
19:21,540;19:24,300;"He was unloading trucks, man."
19:24,300;19:26,820;"What are we talking about? Troy Brown?"
19:27,420;19:32,700;"I don't know. The other guy. David Pat. Yeah. He was loading coffee on the truck."
19:32,700;19:36,620;"Wait, Greg, while this guy's not nonsense, can you look at it, please?"
19:36,620;19:37,820;"What do you want to look up?"
19:37,820;19:42,500;"Well, just Troy, Troy Brown, before football job."
19:42,500;19:44,860;"All right. Thank you."
19:44,860;19:48,420;"I mean, I don't believe in the Troy Brown biography, but check."
19:48,420;19:50,980;"The whole tree. You write it."
19:50,980;19:54,420;"It's a it sounded like he wrote it. Yeah."
19:54,420;19:55,820;"Hmm."
19:56,380;19:57,380;"We had a drill."
19:57,380;19:58,980;"How come I've never heard of this?"
19:58,980;20:01,140;"Because you haven't read the book."
20:01,140;20:04,860;"I guess you're not a real Troy Brown fan because you're not a fan of the Browns."
20:04,860;20:05,340;"Hmm."
20:05,340;20:06,180;"I'm not."
20:06,180;20:07,180;"And I never admitted."
20:07,180;20:08,620;"This is true."
20:08,620;20:10,140;"In fact, he's admitted multiple times."
20:10,140;20:12,700;"He's not a fan of these Browns."
20:12,700;20:14,860;"I do love Troy Brown, though."
20:14,860;20:15,700;"All right."
20:15,700;20:16,020;"Yeah."
20:16,020;20:17,820;"I'll get you a copy of the book."
20:17,820;20:23,420;"I'm given I'm given up on the stat check because apparently it's a Troy Brown."
20:23,420;20:25,940;"The NBA to all right."
20:25,940;20:28,260;"Yeah, it's really not a word for it."
20:28,260;20:31,540;"Just seems like a little bit made up on your own."
20:31,540;20:31,700;"All right."
20:31,700;20:34,700;"Next next by week, we'll we'll do a deep dive on Troy Brown"
20:34,700;20:36,940;"on people's jobs before they made it."
20:36,940;20:38,980;"Yeah."
20:38,980;20:41,500;"Do you know that Kurt Warner was a was a bad boy?"
20:41,500;20:44,820;"Yeah. Did you did you know that Fitzpatrick went to Harvard?"
20:44,820;20:47,060;"I didn't."
20:47,060;20:49,420;"Wait, did he really?"
20:49,420;20:51,740;"Did Antonio Gates play basketball?"
20:51,740;20:53,220;"Really?"
20:53,220;20:54,220;"I think so."
20:54,220;20:56,260;"I heard some breaking news."
20:56,260;21:02,180;"So anyway, back to Terry Glenn, this deep dive has gotten really deep so far."
21:02,180;21:06,340;"We know his middle name and when he was born, but his"
21:06,340;21:15,420;"his mom was on welfare as far back as you can remember, apparently, and his father"
21:15,420;21:16,580;"left when he was two."
21:16,580;21:20,620;"Dude, we're laughing here and you just come with that right after Jesus."
21:20,620;21:24,100;"Oh, no, it gets, it gets a little worse before it."
21:24,100;21:26,100;"But it doesn't really get better."
21:26,100;21:28,100;"We'll see what you guys can do with this."
21:28,100;21:34,100;"So he never knew his father and when Terry was 13 years old, his mother was beat to death"
21:34,100;21:36,100;"by a man she had recently met."
21:36,100;21:38,100;"Holy shit."
21:38,100;21:39,100;"Wow."
21:39,100;21:42,100;"Yeah, so here's where here it is."
21:42,100;21:47,100;"She'd been killed on October 8, 1987, beaten to death by casual acquaintance who had been"
21:47,100;21:48,100;"stalking her."
21:48,100;21:51,100;"Terry didn't need a judge or jury to tell him who was responsible."
21:51,100;21:53,100;"He knew that damn fat man."
21:53,100;21:58,580;"Kenneth Adams now 33 was sentenced to 10 to 25 years after pleading guilty to involuntary manslaughter"
21:58,580;22:01,940;"So he didn't mean to"
22:01,940;22:06,340;"Terry Glenn says he liked her and she didn't like him. I guess that's why he did it"
22:06,340;22:09,700;"According to the article I found on people.com"
22:09,700;22:12,380;"so"
22:12,380;22:17,620;"Yeah, Glenn was 13 years old. He had a younger sister too because he"
22:18,940;22:23,520;"Like from but it was like a step sister I think because he considered suicide"
22:23,520;22:27,660;"But then thought that there would be nobody to take care of his sister. So he didn't"
22:27,660;22:32,700;"So his sister went to live with her biological dad"
22:32,700;22:35,340;"Terry Glenn bounced around between"
22:35,340;22:42,300;"Onto locals and stuff for a few years before finally one of his friends parents took him in"
22:42,300;22:48,740;"And it would they were like, you know friends and playful ball together and stuff like that"
22:48,740;22:55,480;"that. And basically was raised by these people and he says that football saved his life because"
22:55,480;23:00,980;"otherwise like a lot of his friends are dead and stuff like that. So like, dude had a rough"
23:00,980;23:11,180;"upbringing. I think he was obviously good at football. I think that's pretty apparent"
23:11,180;23:18,180;"by the rest of his career, but he actually walked on it, Ohio State, the V, Ohio State"
23:18,180;23:24,380;"University. I think he got some other scholarships to play it like small plays, but decided he"
23:24,380;23:30,340;"was just going to walk on there. And at the time, there was a guy who go on to play for"
23:30,340;23:35,120;"the Oilers, who then turned to Titans Chris Sanders, and another name you might recognize"
23:35,120;23:40,380;"Joey Galloway, where the starting wide receivers at Ohio State, that he decided to just walk"
23:40,380;23:48,460;"on it before he right Joey Galloway for I remember one Joey Galloway play and it's"
23:48,460;23:53,140;"even make it out of training camp you did yeah he made it a couple weeks and then whatever"
23:53,140;24:00,140;"season that was I want to say oh six it was those dark years of right I'm gonna make that"
24:00,140;24:06,180;"team that's what I'm saying yeah but it was I just remember Joey Galloway I think he ran"
24:06,180;24:10,100;"the wrong route and Brady just like tore it on the entire time they were walking off the"
24:10,100;24:16,180;"field. How many times is that going to happen with those new teammates? Oh, too soon."
24:16,180;24:19,640;"I'll see. I know. I'm sorry. I can't help myself."
24:19,640;24:24,080;"So can I give you a factoid real quick? Yeah."
24:24,080;24:29,080;"Because I was like, Colombo, so high. Oh, is that even like a high crime rate?"
24:29,080;24:34,380;"Apparently, Columbus has one of the highest crime rates in America compared to all"
24:34,380;24:36,020;"communities of all sizes."
24:36,660;24:40,580;"What? Really? Can you check on Lawrence messages at twice? Thank you."
24:40,580;24:50,500;"It's I'm sure it's on the list. So Mike, so this is your brethren here, I guess."
24:50,500;24:58,180;"What you're saying? I don't know. He seems like he's had a harder life than than some."
24:58,740;24:59,740;"I will say."
24:59,740;25:03,740;"It's lower than Columbus."
25:03,740;25:06,740;"Saw a 15% decline in 2017."
25:06,740;25:07,740;"It's getting better."
25:07,740;25:08,740;"What's going on?"
25:08,740;25:09,740;"Yeah."
25:09,740;25:10,740;"I'm really proud."
25:10,740;25:14,740;"I just want to thank everybody involved for cleaning up the community."
25:14,740;25:18,740;"I always knew that it was a beautiful place."
25:18,740;25:20,740;"And I'm just really happy to hear that, Greg."
25:20,740;25:21,740;"Thank you."
25:21,740;25:24,740;"I'm personally welcome as I got better once Mike left."
25:24,740;25:31,740;"Yeah, it was slowly, you know, getting better. I think it was, what was that 20 years ago?"
25:31,740;25:34,740;"Yeah, no, it's great to see that."
25:34,740;25:36,740;"I mean, you for being shitty."
25:36,740;25:41,740;"I know, but I've also like helped out in the community, but I don't like to brag about that."
25:41,740;25:43,740;"So I have to."
25:43,740;25:44,740;"Lawrence?"
25:44,740;25:49,740;"Yeah, I purchased drugs from Lawrence as recently as five years ago."
25:49,740;25:51,740;"All right."
25:51,740;25:55,300;"- Once Greg stopped purchasing drugs, boom."
25:55,300;25:58,540;"- Yeah, yeah, those numbers seem to be the coil."
25:58,540;26:00,000;"- You did the law town brown."
26:00,000;26:02,820;"- Jesus."
26:02,820;26:08,380;"- So back to our old friend, Terry Glenn."
26:08,380;26:11,820;"So I walked under Ohio State and then in the junior year,"
26:11,820;26:16,180;"all I did was set school records with 64 catches,"
26:16,180;26:20,900;"1400 yards and 17 touchdowns, which is pretty phenomenal."
26:20,900;26:22,260;"Yeah, especially back then."
26:22,260;26:23,780;"Yeah, exactly."
26:23,780;26:26,660;"And his numbers were outrageous."
26:26,660;26:30,740;"His best game came against the University of Pittsburgh."
26:30,740;26:33,860;"Nine catches 253 yards, which is school record."
26:33,860;26:34,700;"I don't know if it still is."
26:34,700;26:36,620;"Can we fact check that, Greg?"
26:36,620;26:41,820;"And his average was 28.1 yards per catch."
26:41,820;26:43,220;"Four touchdowns."
26:43,220;26:46,500;"Oh, and a two-point conversion."
26:46,500;26:48,100;"So he was hot shit coming out."
26:48,100;26:49,360;"Who's thrown in the ball?"
26:49,360;26:53,360;"It didn't say, but I bet we could Google it."
26:53,360;26:56,660;"I don't think it matters at Ohio State."
26:56,660;26:59,440;"Do they, have they ever had a real quarterback"
26:59,440;27:00,620;"come out of Ohio State?"
27:00,620;27:01,660;"- Yeah, not really."
27:01,660;27:03,260;"- I feel like they're all just like."
27:03,260;27:06,380;"- Is it a real quarterback?"
27:06,380;27:07,920;"- Yes, I guess no is the answer."
27:07,920;27:14,420;"So that was, that was his college career."
27:14,420;27:21,380;"He was, you know, he did eventually get his, um, his degree from Ohio State."
27:21,380;27:25,260;"I don't know what ended didn't say, but, um, after his junior year,"
27:25,260;27:31,220;"he decided to declare for the draft and he was drafted seventh overall by your"
27:31,220;27:33,500;"Michael New England Patriots back in 1996."
27:33,500;27:35,620;"Yo, I got a name for you."
27:35,620;27:39,860;"I'll give it to the Ohio State quarterback, Tom Toopa."
27:40,940;27:43,820;"with no 84 to 87."
27:43,820;27:44,220;"Yep."
27:44,220;27:48,500;"And I didn't say anything, but when you get to Tom to buy now,"
27:48,500;27:50,700;"that will go over that nugget."
27:50,700;27:52,860;"Also, like Tom's Zach."
27:52,860;27:55,140;"All right."
27:55,140;27:57,460;"Also on the path Kirk herb street."
27:57,460;27:59,260;"He's an Ohio state guy."
27:59,260;28:01,100;"The quarterback."
28:01,100;28:01,620;"Yeah."
28:01,620;28:03,900;"I think it's like literally like the biggest names."
28:03,900;28:06,420;"Yeah, because none of these guys played with."
28:08,900;28:11,140;"Who was it? Who was that quarterback in the early 90s?"
28:11,140;28:15,500;"Does it say what is early 90s 92 to 95?"
28:15,500;28:17,700;"Yeah, Bobby Hoing."
28:17,700;28:19,860;"Oh, Bobby Hoing."
28:19,860;28:20,900;"Yeah."
28:20,900;28:24,740;"So that was probably was right on the bottom."
28:24,740;28:25,820;"Great."
28:25,820;28:27,620;"Bobby, because he came out in 96."
28:27,620;28:29,340;"So right."
28:29,340;28:31,580;"You know, he was good."
28:31,580;28:32,420;"Yeah."
28:32,420;28:37,220;"So Glenn coming out of school draft is seventh overall by your New England"
28:37,220;28:42,620;"Patriots 96 by Robert Kraft, not by Bill Parcells as we all know."
28:42,620;28:44,860;"And let's see."
28:44,860;28:49,300;"Apparently, Parcells was outspoken of his desire to draft a defensive player."
28:49,300;28:53,500;"And he was also outspoken about how he was overruled by team management, which we"
28:53,500;28:57,140;"all remember something about don't ask me to cook the dinner."
28:57,140;28:58,860;"If I can't buy the groceries, wasn't that the saying?"
28:58,860;29:01,100;"Yeah, great line."
29:01,100;29:05,460;"Yeah, that's it's, it's one of the top bill parcels lines, I think."
29:05,980;29:10,940;"But didn't we figure out what Bill Parcells' actual name was?"
29:10,940;29:14,580;"Greg, didn't you have that?"
29:14,580;29:16,860;"Bill Parcells actual name."
29:16,860;29:18,900;"It's not William."
29:18,900;29:20,140;"No."
29:20,140;29:22,340;"I remember this."
29:22,340;29:25,060;"What happens when you listen to our episodes?"
29:25,060;29:25,980;"That's really."
29:25,980;29:30,420;"Oh, yeah, that's Dwayne, Dwayne Charles Parcells."
29:30,420;29:31,020;"That's right."
29:31,020;29:36,380;"And Tuna and I'm pretty sure the reason he goes by bill is because in school he was"
29:36,380;29:42,780;"Confused with another guy whose name was bill. So we just started going by bill because it was easier"
29:42,780;29:48,060;"It's a nickname's get made right yeah"
29:48,060;29:54,220;"Oh your nicknames are never ones you want to have because those don't stick the ones you want to have don't stick"
29:54,220;29:58,380;"Right milo"
29:58,380;30:00,780;"Um, yeah"
30:00,780;30:04,980;"I think that's exactly."
30:04,980;30:10,260;"So yeah, and then so there was all that shit with Parcels and Terry Glenn, and obviously"
30:10,260;30:11,760;"didn't like him."
30:11,760;30:16,500;"He made his displeasure known referring to Glenn as she after Glenn pulled a hamstring"
30:16,500;30:20,900;"two weeks in training camp and that force, well, quote unquote, forced him to miss the"
30:20,900;30:23,940;"rest of training camp and the season over against dolphins."
30:23,940;30:24,940;"Question."
30:24,940;30:31,260;"Now we've all heard of that part, but did Terry Blin ever comment on Parcel's just dean for him?"
30:31,260;30:37,800;"He did he wasn't too bothered by it to be honest. Oh really? Yeah, because I think the quote"
30:37,800;30:41,180;"I don't have the exact quote here. I don't think but it was something along the lines of"
30:41,180;30:44,980;"I've been through a lot growing up. So that really didn't bother me"
30:44,980;30:48,140;"That makes sense. Yeah, yeah, exactly"
30:49,460;30:51,460;"Series I read that like oh, yeah, that's"
30:51,460;30:57,420;"Do we know the the player that he wanted?"
30:57,420;31:00,300;"Instead of Glenn"
31:00,300;31:05,980;"That's a good question. Yeah, who's like draft to like right after him. I'm looking at the draft right now"
31:05,980;31:13,240;"Alex molden a cornerback is the next defensive player Regan up Shaw the end"
31:13,240;31:18,460;"There's no one really of name here. Who did the Patriots draft?"
31:18,460;31:22,700;"like what positions did they draft rather than Terry Glenn that year?"
31:22,700;31:25,420;"Because that would probably give you an idea of what"
31:25,420;31:27,020;"ourselves was looking for."
31:27,020;31:29,820;"Well, that is a good personal."
31:29,820;31:30,820;"Lawyer-Molloy."
31:30,820;31:32,220;"Wait, oh yeah."
31:32,220;31:33,420;"Right."
31:33,420;31:37,980;"But Greg thinks a good point though, if there's no other names, then it's not the worst pick"
31:37,980;31:38,980;"in the world."
31:38,980;31:39,980;"I mean, I guess, yeah."
31:39,980;31:40,980;"Especially seven overall."
31:40,980;31:41,980;"Yeah."
31:41,980;31:42,980;"Right, exactly."
31:42,980;31:46,420;"This was a stacked wide receiver draft too though."
31:46,420;31:47,420;"Was it?"
31:47,420;31:48,420;"Who else?"
31:48,420;31:52,420;"Kishan Johnson Marvin Harrison Eric"
31:52,420;31:53,720;"Molds."
31:53,720;31:56,180;"Mushin Muhammad."
31:56,180;31:57,660;"That was a stack."
31:57,660;31:58,580;"Yeah."
31:58,580;32:00,020;"Who went well?"
32:00,020;32:01,140;"Rollo wins."
32:01,140;32:02,820;"Damn."
32:02,820;32:03,580;"Good word."
32:03,580;32:04,540;"Yeah."
32:04,540;32:05,620;"Joe Horan."
32:05,620;32:07,340;"Who had one over that?"
32:07,340;32:08,980;"Kishan."
32:08,980;32:09,860;"Oh, you do."
32:09,860;32:10,340;"OK, yeah."
32:10,340;32:11,380;"That makes sense."
32:11,380;32:17,100;"So I think Glenn held his own against all those wide receivers"
32:17,780;32:23,260;"Because in his rookie season, he recorded 90 catches for 1100 yards and six touchdowns."
32:23,260;32:29,860;"And at the time, those 90 receptions were the most ever in a single season by a rookie in"
32:29,860;32:30,700;"an awful history."
32:30,700;32:39,380;"And it was actually in Patriots history, second most ever behind Ben Coates, I think"
32:39,380;32:41,340;"had 94 or 96."
32:41,340;32:44,780;"So that's all he did."
32:44,780;32:45,220;"Yeah."
32:45,260;32:49,920;"And that was his rookie year was the year the Patriots went to Super Bowl 31"
32:49,920;32:52,080;"against the Green Bay Packers."
32:52,080;32:54,920;"Now, can I interject here again with you, man?"
32:54,920;32:58,280;"Parsell is kind of like a douche though, then, huh?"
32:58,280;33:01,600;"Because the guy's a rippet on Glenn."
33:01,600;33:07,240;"He basically helps the team go to the Super Bowl and then he records."
33:07,240;33:08,240;"Yeah."
33:08,240;33:13,280;"And then he bales on the team with his disdain because Robert craft made"
33:13,280;33:14,680;"him pick Terry Glenn in the first place."
33:15,080;33:16,400;"which turned out to be the right decision."
33:16,400;33:16,880;"Right."
33:16,880;33:17,480;"Yeah."
33:17,480;33:19,240;"That's pretty awesome."
33:19,240;33:19,880;"Yeah."
33:19,880;33:22,480;"That's spiteful."
33:22,480;33:23,920;"Geez."
33:23,920;33:24,440;"A little bit."
33:24,440;33:24,720;"Yeah."
33:24,720;33:26,280;"Um."
33:26,280;33:31,720;"So then, uh, that was 96."
33:31,720;33:32,920;"That was his rookie year."
33:32,920;33:38,760;"Uh, not much really happened until 99 in 98."
33:38,760;33:43,800;"He set the Patriots receiving record with 193 yards against the Steelers."
33:44,160;33:47,240;"Mmm, so that's three years two years into his career"
33:47,240;33:52,040;"99 he led the team again with receptions was 69 nice"
33:52,040;33:58,500;"1100 yards and four touchdowns and 14 games. I think you know injury troubles again"
33:58,500;34:06,160;"And then on October 30 set the franchise records with 13 receptions for 214 yards against the Cleveland Browns"
34:06,160;34:11,400;"Yeah, so I remember him being good. I don't remember him being this good. Well, yeah"
34:12,600;34:19,920;"England proponent there back in the day and you told me that he sucked so I believe you even said that he didn't have the"
34:19,920;34:23,880;"capability of catching two touchdowns in a game. I think that was your direct quote"
34:23,880;34:27,860;"He is not caught to touch that well, you never caught two touchdowns in the game. Yeah"
34:27,860;34:34,120;"But you said he didn't even have the ability to catch two touchdowns. Now you just talk words my mouth. That's a tough look Andy. Yeah, I know"
34:34,120;34:38,720;"What the hell put more is my bond. I never said no, no, I heard that's what I heard. I was like no"
34:38,720;34:41,720;"I know he's never caught too, but he could you know"
34:41,720;34:47,480;"I heard a lot of things. Okay. I heard it too. Sure. You did. Thank you. See? All right. Hey,"
34:47,480;34:54,280;"I mean, I'm on team Andy. How do you have 213 yards and only one touchdown? Okay, you guys"
34:54,280;34:59,800;"go fuck you, Steve. I know this is so how about this Steve? Are you ready for this one? You're"
34:59,800;35:05,640;"you'll probably like this too. Terry Glenn is the Drew Bledsoe of wide receiver. Okay."
35:05,640;35:11,240;"And I've said this frequently. Both of them could be in the Hall of Fame given a couple of"
35:11,240;35:13,500;"things here or there that might have been different."
35:13,500;35:14,800;"- Given each other?"
35:14,800;35:17,160;"- Hey, it could be."
35:17,160;35:19,640;"- Because, I mean, they had their chance."
35:19,640;35:21,440;"- Yeah, and they did pretty well."
35:21,440;35:24,000;"Now give them a bunch more time,"
35:24,000;35:25,800;"'cause obviously Terry Glenn hated Tom Brady."
35:25,800;35:26,640;"I mean, that was a given."
35:26,640;35:27,920;"You didn't even wanna play with them."
35:27,920;35:29,200;"So-- - Is that what happened?"
35:29,200;35:31,880;"- Yeah, so that's what I'm told."
35:31,880;35:35,040;"So-- - Your sources, huh?"
35:35,040;35:36,960;"It's something that had to suck"
35:36,960;35:38,720;"with both Terry Glenn and Tom Brady."
35:38,720;35:39,560;"- Yeah."
35:39,560;35:44,560;"- Yeah, I'm just, I'm saying what I hear guys."
35:44,560;35:47,080;"So it kind of--"
35:47,080;35:49,160;"- I'm sure it's where these voices are coming from."
35:49,160;35:50,080;"(laughs)"
35:50,080;35:53,920;"- If once I didn't go down, we don't know what it could have been."
35:53,920;35:57,080;"- This is, yeah, it's true."
35:57,080;35:58,920;"I've seen that argument pop up lately now"
35:58,920;36:00,320;"that Tom Brady's got."
36:00,320;36:02,240;"- Also, this is another tidbit that people didn't talk about"
36:02,240;36:07,080;"back then, but Terry Glenn used to stay at Drew Bledsoe's house."
36:07,080;36:09,480;"I mean, they would build a relationship together."
36:09,480;36:10,200;"What do you mean?"
36:10,200;36:15,160;"Just like hang out, but easy sleepovers, slumber parties, pillow fights."
36:15,160;36:17,880;"You know, they supported each other as a beautiful thing."
36:17,880;36:20,240;"You know, now, now we're actually"
36:20,240;36:21,480;"does that with Antonio Brown."
36:21,480;36:24,960;"People are like, Oh, it's so great."
36:24,960;36:26,880;"But nobody's talking about a blood cell back then."
36:26,880;36:28,720;"That was a humanitarian for crying out."
36:28,720;36:32,680;"So the sources I have said that, uh, when, when Terry Glenn and Andrew"
36:32,680;36:32,880;"blood."
36:32,880;36:34,480;"So we're, we're having a sleepovers."
36:34,840;36:37,100;"What they were actually doing is they were buying a case of surge,"
36:37,100;36:38,000;"the soda surge."
36:38,000;36:38,580;"Okay."
36:38,580;36:40,700;"And they were going on AOL chat rooms at the time,"
36:40,700;36:41,700;"pretending to be lesbians."
36:41,700;36:47,880;"That is very specific playing NFL blitz."
36:47,880;36:51,860;"I know that a lot of that's great."
36:51,860;36:53,220;"Sounds familiar."
36:53,220;36:58,660;"Imagine that ASL question mark."
36:58,660;36:59,820;"That's right."
36:59,820;37:02,380;"Man, those are interesting times."
37:04,220;37:06,340;"Allegedly, allegedly, right?"
37:06,340;37:10,460;"Allegedly, yeah, I'm sure I'm sure both Drew blood so and Turigland learned a lot."
37:10,460;37:13,060;"Did they mention something about like cybering?"
37:13,060;37:14,420;"Was that what it was called?"
37:14,420;37:14,980;"Cybering."
37:14,980;37:20,540;"Moving on real, right?"
37:20,540;37:21,460;"Moving on."
37:21,460;37:23,980;"Just you made that up, right?"
37:23,980;37:25,060;"They what?"
37:25,060;37:27,900;"The cyber chat thing."
37:27,900;37:31,060;"I think it sounds pretty real."
37:31,060;37:33,220;"Yeah, but you both made it all up, right?"
37:33,220;37:39,680;"they didn't hang out together. That bled so fast. I just need to know. Allegedly."
37:39,680;37:45,680;"Allegedly. I don't want to hear allegedly. Just is there anything even alleging it? No."
37:45,680;37:51,280;"Or okay. I would have to like look back on that, but I'll let you know next time."
37:51,280;37:54,320;"Thank you. Is that football or not football?"
37:54,320;37:58,760;"off. Wow. It's totally fun."
37:58,760;38:07,560;"Yeah. Definitely not football. 100% of football. So 99 is also when Terry Glenn's off the field"
38:07,560;38:14,560;"stuff started to kind of catch up to him. He was cited for speeding was three hours late"
38:14,560;38:22,520;"for practice. One done. That's why he was speeding. I mean, three hours late. It's tough look."
38:22,520;38:29,080;"He was also later accused of inappropriately inappropriately touching a woman outside a nightclub the previous night"
38:29,080;38:32,600;"Mmm the previous night of his speeding ticket and"
38:32,600;38:39,100;"Then after missing the game against Buffalo Bills because of the flu he was suspended for the season final the season finale"
38:39,100;38:42,920;"My headcoat Pete Carroll for failing to show up for treatment"
38:42,920;38:49,900;"Which is a harboring of things to come I think we're supposed to quarantine"
38:51,080;38:53,080;"You would think right, but I mean"
38:53,080;38:58,600;"I'm surprised that P carol actually disciplined. So yeah, right? That's true. Yes"
38:58,600;39:01,720;"Carol's laying out a lot. You know you fucked up"
39:01,720;39:05,080;"But it was also I think the last game this season"
39:05,080;39:07,080;"so"
39:07,080;39:09,800;"And then so 2000 more issues"
39:09,800;39:14,760;"He tested positive from marijuana and entered the NFL substance abuse program"
39:14,760;39:19,160;"Such an abuse of substance right he also"
39:19,880;39:25,780;"Although think about that if you can function and catch balls and touchdowns and all this other stuff up high"
39:25,780;39:29,800;"You're doing pretty good, man. I'm gonna look at Josh Gordon"
39:29,800;39:34,880;"Yeah, he used to be doing while he was setting all those records now"
39:34,880;39:37,320;"Have you ever played sports high Mike?"
39:37,320;39:43,640;"You know, I probably not because I don't know what that feels like"
39:43,640;39:45,640;"right"
39:45,640;39:47,640;"How are you? No"
39:47,960;39:52,760;"allegedly. But talking. You think Terry Glenn got it from"
39:52,760;39:53,280;"Lawtown?"
39:53,280;39:56,120;"It's a"
39:56,120;39:58,520;"building."
39:58,520;40:00,400;"Wasn't any more into the the Molly?"
40:00,400;40:03,920;"I think it was called back to see back then."
40:03,920;40:06,680;"I think we'll get there."
40:06,680;40:10,800;"Wait, here's a question though. So now with the CBA, I think"
40:10,800;40:14,120;"there's more lacks like marijuana laws and I'm sure that'll"
40:14,120;40:17,480;"probably evolve over time. So I wonder like how many"
40:17,520;40:20,560;"wide receivers that wouldn't have to contend with that would have been"
40:20,560;40:24,320;"phenomenal given that they weren't in the program."
40:24,320;40:30,400;"We'll never know like Randy Moss. Yeah, that's true too. Yeah, Terry"
40:30,400;40:33,360;"Gwen could have been the Hall of Fame. Randy Moss was phenomenal anyway."
40:33,360;40:34,240;"True."
40:34,240;40:41,040;"So yeah, so he tested positive marijuana and I think that came back, I think we"
40:41,040;40:46,480;"actually talked about a little bit in 2001 if you remember, because he got all"
40:46,480;40:51,880;"pissed off about how the page like he I guess that came out the"
40:51,880;40:54,200;"information that he tested positive and he was in the"
40:54,200;40:58,160;"substance abuse program. It got leaked somehow. And so he"
40:58,160;41:03,840;"tried to I think sue the league. And the Patriots like never"
41:03,840;41:06,760;"really supported him was his was his thing. So that's kind of"
41:06,760;41:10,960;"why he was sitting out at the beginning and the whole I'm"
41:10,960;41:13,960;"hurt, but I'm not getting paid. And so I'm not getting paid. So"
41:13,960;41:19,000;"heart sort of thing. I think it's more about money because if you like he said he's gone through"
41:19,000;41:23,000;"worse I'm pretty sure he doesn't give a crap of bill Belichick stands by him or not. Yeah maybe"
41:23,000;41:29,800;"but speaking of money in 2000 he signed a six-year 50 million dollar contract extension"
41:29,800;41:35,640;"with an 11 and a half million dollar signing bonus so yeah it's pretty happy for back then."
41:35,640;41:42,600;"Right so there was that plus the the Drew Bledsoe 10 year 100 million dollar signing"
41:42,600;41:46,200;"You thought these two would be the cornerstone of your offense for the next however long."
41:46,200;41:49,080;"Imagine what that would look like again."
41:49,080;41:53,960;"Yeah, it would look like the Dallas Cowboys."
41:53,960;41:56,680;"How do you figure?"
41:56,680;41:58,840;"No."
41:58,840;42:00,040;"How do you figure?"
42:00,040;42:02,360;"That's where they both ended up."
42:02,360;42:04,440;"No, I don't buy it."
42:04,440;42:05,640;"With Bill Parsell."
42:05,640;42:06,920;"Greg, can you check that?"
42:06,920;42:07,880;"Bill Parsell."
42:07,880;42:09,240;"Yeah, I just checked it."
42:09,240;42:09,720;"They're right."
42:10,520;42:15,400;"Yeah, but here's the thing. That was at the tail end, man. So I don't know."
42:15,400;42:18,680;"He's they were different people back then."
42:18,680;42:22,840;"You know, perhaps we're in a spry. I mean, Pilezzo was what?"
42:22,840;42:26,360;"Oh, he was 36 or something by that point. Come on."
42:26,360;42:30,680;"I've never seen a 36 year old quarterback perform at a high level."
42:30,680;42:35,560;"So you're on to something. Yeah. Well, where it's the first time we've ever seen it, Andrew."
42:35,560;42:40,360;"So bite your tongue. Thirty six year old. Yeah. True. True breeze is 39."
42:40,360;42:41,920;"No, we don't believe it."
42:41,920;42:42,760;"How old are you?"
42:42,760;42:43,720;"It was like 40."
42:43,720;42:45,280;"No."
42:45,280;42:46,080;"Sorry."
42:46,080;42:47,600;"How old is Joe Montana?"
42:47,600;42:48,520;"What do you mean?"
42:48,520;42:49,360;"Actually, he was pretty young."
42:49,360;42:51,320;"Joe Montana was probably 28 when he retired."
42:51,320;42:53,040;"No, I think he was like 30."
42:53,040;42:54,880;"He was early 30s."
42:54,880;42:55,840;"Yeah, he was--"
42:55,840;42:56,800;"Yeah, but wait a minute."
42:56,800;42:58,520;"This current trend outside of, yeah,"
42:58,520;43:00,020;"like the war moons to the test of Earth"
43:00,020;43:01,960;"is but like starting, starting quarterbacks,"
43:01,960;43:03,520;"that hasn't really happened until recently"
43:03,520;43:07,960;"with the rivers and Eli Manning's and all that kind of stuff."
43:07,960;43:10,640;"So there you go, Andy."
43:10,640;43:11,480;"Boom."
43:11,480;43:12,800;"- You showed me."
43:12,800;43:13,640;"- Thank you."
43:13,640;43:18,440;"- But going back to what you were saying about Molly, Mike,"
43:18,440;43:19,280;"in 2000."
43:19,280;43:20,120;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
43:20,120;43:21,120;"- I may have touched on this too."
43:21,120;43:23,200;"They were given, he was given permission"
43:23,200;43:25,920;"with Tylon, Troy Brown to stay in Buffalo"
43:25,920;43:27,360;"after a game up there,"
43:27,360;43:30,520;"because they didn't wanna fly in the bad weather"
43:30,520;43:32,200;"because it's fucking Buffalo."
43:32,200;43:36,760;"But they were given permission to do that"
43:36,760;43:40,100;"On the condition that the three were back in Foxborough the next day for team meeting"
43:40,100;43:47,860;"The players were later seen as strip club in Canada and Tyla was arrested for possession of ecstasy and they were also late getting to the money meeting"
43:47,860;43:50,020;"so"
43:50,020;43:53,100;"That was also in Troy Brown's book if you want to read it. He was"
43:53,100;43:57,840;"Probably the only apologetic one. I would imagine out of all three of those players"
43:57,840;43:59,880;"You'd imagine"
43:59,880;44:06,000;"Troy Brown was one of them. Troy Brown was on that list. Yeah, it was true. Was that a strip club? Tyla"
44:06,000;44:10,780;"And Terry Glenn Wow, that would be an awesome night to be on"
44:10,780;44:13,720;"Imagine that can you imagine?"
44:13,720;44:17,280;"It's always the flight ones. That's like us Brown brothers really"
44:17,280;44:21,680;"I would probably be the Troy Brown if we're being honest"
44:21,680;44:25,080;"Yes, Greg's tie law since"
44:25,080;44:27,720;"Yeah"
44:27,720;44:34,000;"Because Greg Brown's one getting arrested for possession of access to the Canadian border. I guess I'll be the diva"
44:34,000;44:35,000;"Yeah."
44:35,000;44:40,000;"So that was 2000."
44:40,000;44:42,000;"Pretty entertaining."
44:42,000;44:45,960;"2001, we've kind of talked about it this season."
44:45,960;44:50,080;"He was arrested for assaulting the mother of his son."
44:50,080;44:52,000;"So that's not great."
44:52,000;44:55,800;"And then was eventually, you know, we've kind of talked about it through the season."
44:55,800;45:01,920;"Didn't play heart, heart maybe, not hurt, maybe just being hurt because he's not getting"
45:01,920;45:03,920;"paid and all that shit."
45:03,920;45:08,200;"eventually gets traded after this season."
45:08,200;45:11,240;"Spoiler alert to the Green Bay Packers"
45:11,240;45:14,200;"in exchange for a fourth round pick,"
45:14,200;45:18,120;"which turned into Jarvis Green and a 2003 conditional pick,"
45:18,120;45:20,880;"which turned into somebody called Bryant McNeil."
45:20,880;45:24,240;"Yeah, I didn't think you'd heard of him either."
45:24,240;45:25,320;"Nope."
45:25,320;45:28,160;"And as part of that deal, Glenn dropped a series"
45:28,160;45:29,600;"of grievances against Patriots,"
45:29,600;45:33,080;"which I think were kind of building throughout this season"
45:33,080;45:34,640;"that we've talked about a bit,"
45:34,640;45:38,140;"and ones that Bill Bellichech just kind of dismissed."
45:38,140;45:45,760;"- So he didn't play much because he had some injuries,"
45:45,760;45:51,920;"some knee injuries in 2002,"
45:51,920;45:55,400;"but then 2003 was traded to Dallas Cowboys,"
45:55,400;45:58,400;"like we talked about in exchange for 2004,"
45:58,400;46:00,080;"six round draft choice."
46:00,080;46:00,580;"Right."
46:00,580;46:03,760;"So you did play in Dallas."
46:03,760;46:04,880;"Imagine that."
46:04,880;46:06,720;"How about damn cowboys?"
46:06,720;46:09,880;"He was reunited with his former head coach Bill Parcells,"
46:09,880;46:12,600;"Dwayne Charles."
46:12,600;46:13,440;"And--"
46:13,440;46:14,800;"Oh, it gets better."
46:14,800;46:16,080;"You start with the law."
46:16,080;46:16,800;"Wait, wait, wait, wait."
46:16,800;46:18,000;"You're--"
46:18,000;46:19,440;"Can I ask you this?"
46:19,440;46:19,720;"How come--"
46:19,720;46:21,560;"Got a heading where you think it is."
46:21,560;46:24,840;"All right, but how come he gets in trouble with the law?"
46:24,840;46:28,720;"And I'm looking at like nowadays--"
46:28,720;46:34,600;"He's like, well, but like Tyree kill nowadays, like he's gotten into more trouble than that."
46:34,600;46:39,600;"I think some of the same stuff, but that was confirmed to me was getting out of college."
46:39,600;46:41,320;"How come he gets a pass?"
46:41,320;46:43,440;"Remember his kid stuff too?"
46:43,440;46:49,000;"No, but he's like present day have gotten like a pretty good pass from the cheese."
46:49,000;46:50,000;"The NFL."
46:50,000;46:51,000;"What is that?"
46:51,000;46:52,000;"I don't give him a pass."
46:52,000;46:53,000;"I hate that guy."
46:53,000;46:54,000;"He runs a 4240."
46:54,000;46:55,000;"Yeah, that's why."
46:55,000;46:58,000;"That's why they can catch a football."
46:58,000;47:03,760;"football. He puts up mad points in fantasy. Yeah, he does. But I can't believe that the"
47:03,760;47:09,400;"in this dad asses and seats. I guess because the Chiefs cut ties with one guy, they get"
47:09,400;47:18,480;"a pass for the other guy. Who do they cut ties with? The Karim hunt. Yeah, Karim hunt,"
47:18,480;47:27,400;"who is now playing for the Browns? I think you just got a new deal. Yeah. So, so be fast"
47:27,400;47:33,280;"and strong. And wow. So yes, it was reunited. Terrigiline reunited with"
47:33,280;47:37,800;"the former head coach, Bill Parcells, the other starting wide receiver for"
47:37,800;47:44,520;"that Dallas Cowboys team. Anybody want to guess? Joey Galloway. Oh,"
47:44,520;47:49,400;"Greg Brown nailed it in one. I got it. Nice. Yes. So playing with his old"
47:49,400;47:55,360;"Ohio state teammate, Joey Galloway. Terrigiline would lead the team with 52"
47:55,360;48:00,760;"catches 750 yards five touchdowns not too bad you contributed the team making the"
48:00,760;48:05,560;"playoffs for the first time since 99 now what did Parcels have to say about him"
48:05,560;48:16,320;"after that a bunch of times no I can't pick the groceries and then he left them"
48:16,320;48:19,460;"for the Eagles"
48:21,160;48:26,160;"Alright, so then 2005, guess who else here's reunited with Michael?"
48:26,160;48:33,160;"I'll give you a hint, it's a quarterback."
48:33,160;48:35,160;"It's true, blood cell."
48:35,160;48:36,160;"What?"
48:36,160;48:37,160;"Yeah, it's true, blood cell."
48:37,160;48:39,160;"And get this."
48:39,160;48:43,160;"They had 2005 reunited with the Boydrew Blood cell."
48:43,160;48:47,160;"63 catches 1100 yards, which was left since 1999."
48:47,160;48:48,160;"Yup."
48:48,160;48:49,160;"Seven touchdowns."
48:49,160;48:50,160;"Okay."
48:50,160;48:54,200;"18.3 yard per catch average, which was first in the NFC."
48:54,200;48:55,520;"Yeah, of course it was first."
48:55,520;48:56,200;"Wait a minute."
48:56,200;49:02,040;"How dare you skim over this and not apologize for putting me down about 10 minutes ago and"
49:02,040;49:03,520;"in other episodes."
49:03,520;49:06,560;"I won an apology man because for what?"
49:06,560;49:09,680;"If they stay together that whole time in their prime, they would have been a Hall of"
49:09,680;49:10,680;"Famers."
49:10,680;49:14,560;"Hey Greg, can we get a stat check on how many picks drew blood so through that year?"
49:14,560;49:15,920;"Yeah, that's fine."
49:15,920;49:16,920;"He was on five."
49:16,920;49:17,920;"He was on five."
49:17,920;49:18,920;"Yeah."
49:18,920;49:24,520;"Or just just how many pixies for us since you left the Patriots after you left the Patriots look it's a system to you"
49:24,520;49:27,220;"Gotta keep that in mind if you tell you what"
49:27,220;49:34,720;"Through 15"
49:34,720;49:42,460;"2002 then 12 16 17 okay. Well again. We don't know Bella check like I'm gonna fall a G&D. This is"
49:45,160;49:49,800;"I'm gonna accept this 2003 11 touchdowns 12 interceptions. Oh"
49:49,800;49:52,640;"Right, but he's older man. Come on"
49:52,640;49:55,240;"The price also doesn't know how to run offense"
49:55,240;50:00,840;"Dude 11 touchdowns in 16 games. That's kind of brutal dude 2005"
50:00,840;50:03,840;"Why have to touch down"
50:03,840;50:11,320;"He was feeling depressed that that year. I don't even want to go into it"
50:12,240;50:15,720;"Is it just brushing it over like at least give them some respect"
50:15,720;50:23,680;"Depressed yeah, he was feeling down that year and I can't really go into a big I should know about it as Patriots fans Jesus"
50:23,680;50:29,280;"So anyways, let's move on. I love it. Mike makes up facts"
50:29,280;50:34,280;"Podcast so much alright well take it as you will"
50:34,280;50:38,040;"So yeah, you had a great year in 2005 on the field"
50:38,040;50:41,440;"Off the field. He had another issue"
50:41,520;50:45,400;"issue, he was arrested for public intoxication and public"
50:45,400;50:47,520;"urination in a Jack in the Box parking lot."
50:47,520;50:48,840;"Who hasn't done that?"
50:48,840;50:49,860;"Well, that's what I mean."
50:49,860;50:51,120;"It's tough to judge that one."
50:51,120;50:54,720;"I haven't been arrested for that."
50:54,720;51:00,480;"2009."
51:00,480;51:05,440;"Well, you built you this is the law without the public urination."
51:05,440;51:06,880;"But yeah, really?"
51:06,880;51:08,840;"Intoxication, yes."
51:08,840;51:10,000;"Oh, yeah."
51:10,480;51:11,680;"It was a perfect storm."
51:11,680;51:15,620;"It was like Saturday, Saturday night, we got home late from a"
51:15,620;51:16,720;"side away game."
51:16,720;51:22,240;"It was, uh, there was a Snoop Dogg concert on campus."
51:22,240;51:22,640;"Oh, that's."
51:22,640;51:27,360;"And it was game seven of bulls and Celtics."
51:27,360;51:29,680;"Oh, that's serious."
51:29,680;51:30,400;"Unbelievable."
51:30,400;51:31,480;"So it was a perfect storm."
51:31,480;51:32,320;"Yeah."
51:32,320;51:33,880;"We cop didn't let it go."
51:33,880;51:34,360;"Right."
51:34,360;51:36,400;"And I don't hold myself accountable."
51:36,400;51:38,560;"Do you remember getting a recipe?"
51:38,560;51:39,480;"No."
51:40,200;51:43,920;"But I was apparently like me and my roommate were like wrestling in the street."
51:43,920;51:46,920;"Well, it only thinks one thing."
51:46,920;51:50,480;"Yeah, it was a wild ride in the morning."
51:50,480;51:51,080;"I tell you what."
51:51,080;51:52,000;"Oh, yeah."
51:52,000;51:52,600;"Yeah."
51:52,600;51:57,680;"I feel like you've told me about the drive home to campus from the police"
51:57,680;51:58,360;"station next morning."
51:58,360;51:59,960;"What do you tell the police officer?"
51:59,960;52:04,520;"Uh, I don't remember."
52:04,520;52:08,480;"So from what you told me, you were in the back of the cruiser."
52:09,080;52:11,560;"You were off campus at the police station."
52:11,560;52:13,560;"He was driving you back to campus."
52:13,560;52:17,200;"And he was hammered down in the passing lane."
52:17,200;52:17,800;"Oh, yeah."
52:17,800;52:18,960;"There was a guy in front of you that"
52:18,960;52:20,600;"wouldn't pull over or something."
52:20,600;52:23,840;"So you banged on the divider."
52:23,840;52:24,440;"With my hands."
52:24,440;52:25,240;"It was ass over."
52:25,240;52:27,880;"I got plenty of room back here."
52:27,880;52:29,800;"He's one of those chargers, too."
52:29,800;52:31,800;"And he was bombing."
52:31,800;52:37,240;"Greg Brown, ladies and gentlemen."
52:37,240;52:38,520;"What a bunch of misfits."
52:38,520;52:42,620;"I got to do that, you know, and they put you in the glass with the telephone thing."
52:42,620;52:44,020;"Oh, yeah."
52:44,020;52:45,360;"I got to do that."
52:45,360;52:45,720;"Yeah."
52:45,720;52:46,620;"Oh, it's awesome."
52:46,620;52:51,420;"When we talked to my roommate, he came to pick me up and I like put my hand on it."
52:51,420;52:54,820;"And I was like, put your hand on the window."
52:54,820;52:58,280;"Taking it seriously."
52:58,280;53:03,020;"We don't condone any of that."
53:03,020;53:07,180;"I mean, you don't anything, Greg does really."
53:07,620;53:09,660;"The only arrest in the Brown family, that's why he's"
53:09,660;53:11,460;"tiling and buses with the emails."
53:11,460;53:12,340;"Perfect."
53:12,340;53:13,980;"Nailed it. Yeah."
53:13,980;53:15,920;"Right."
53:15,920;53:17,660;"Brown, apparently is the black sheep of this family."
53:17,660;53:18,180;"Who knew?"
53:18,180;53:20,060;"Oh, we all knew."
53:20,060;53:22,660;"Fair enough."
53:22,660;53:26,780;"I had a when that cop brought him home, had a little talk with"
53:26,780;53:28,900;"him and mom in the dining room table."
53:28,900;53:30,700;"What?"
53:30,700;53:31,940;"We'll cut this part."
53:31,940;53:36,040;"Oh,"
53:36,820;53:39,880;"I was after when you mounted the chewy on the snowbag."
53:39,880;53:41,980;"No comment."
53:41,980;53:43,060;"Yeah."
53:43,060;53:44,240;"Okay."
53:44,240;53:47,920;"And that's a little chat about the decisions Greg's making in life."
53:47,920;53:48,740;"Hmm."
53:48,740;53:49,060;"Yeah."
53:49,060;53:51,900;"I remember having a fucking deal with that decision by digging the goddamn"
53:51,900;53:52,980;"van off of a snowbag."
53:52,980;53:55,820;"All right."
53:55,820;53:57,740;"So, yeah, but you're going to land."
53:57,740;53:59,500;"It wasn't a lot since then though, right?"
53:59,500;54:05,060;"Speaking of bad decisions, there wasn't much that happened after"
54:05,900;54:07,420;"2005 on the fields."
54:07,420;54:08,820;"He didn't play much after that."
54:08,820;54:10,460;"2009."
54:10,460;54:13,060;"He was arrested again for public intoxication in possession."
54:13,060;54:15,020;"Marijuana 2010."
54:15,020;54:17,440;"He was arrested for auto theft of a rental car."
54:17,440;54:20,460;"I don't know how that works."
54:20,460;54:22,260;"Is that what happens if you don't return it?"
54:22,260;54:23,460;"Yeah."
54:23,460;54:24,620;"I have always thought that."
54:24,620;54:29,060;"Like I guess I thought they just charge you the price of the car."
54:29,060;54:32,860;"Like they do with library books, but then they get on the Troy Brown in this"
54:32,860;54:33,300;"situation."
54:33,300;54:34,020;"So I have no idea."
54:34,820;54:38,900;"See, I heard a stand of comedians say that one time he was late for a flight and he just"
54:38,900;54:43,380;"like drove up to the terminal and just left it there and called the"
54:43,380;54:46,420;"called the place to his like, Oh, if you want your car, it's that terminal."
54:46,420;54:46,780;"See."
54:46,780;54:50,780;"That seems."
54:50,780;54:52,660;"And I was like, you know, smart."
54:52,660;54:54,980;"I was going to give you a shift for that, but that's actually clever."
54:54,980;54:55,340;"Yeah."
54:55,340;54:56,980;"You say, like, you get in trouble for it."
54:56,980;54:58,100;"So I was like, I should try that."
54:58,100;54:59,620;"He's running it or what?"
54:59,620;55:00,860;"Yeah."
55:00,860;55:01,180;"Yes."
55:01,180;55:02,300;"I mean, it was a standup bit."
55:02,300;55:03,420;"So he could be just making it up."
55:03,420;55:04,500;"That's true."
55:04,500;55:16,500;"So yeah, sadly, 2017, Terry Glenn died at the age of 43, calling a one vehicle rollover"
55:16,500;55:22,920;"traffic accident in 2017 in Irving, Texas near Dallas, which left his fiancee slightly"
55:22,920;55:26,720;"injured, so she was in the car."
55:26,720;55:31,900;"Bella checked though, when finding out about it said, ""I think he was deep down inside"
55:31,900;55:36,220;"good person with good intentions and a good heart. Obviously it's very unfortunate passing,"
55:36,220;55:46,780;"I mean it's just sad. It's a sad day, it's sad news. So kind of rough. He turns out there was,"
55:46,780;55:52,700;"as you can probably imagine, both alcohol and marijuana in his blood when that happened."
55:52,700;55:58,620;"So didn't really learn his lessons of the rest of the times he was arrested for all that shit."
55:59,660;56:19,660;"the kids did you say? Well, it's funny you bring that up. I was just about to give that he has seven children. Whoa. Yeah. Um, five women, not particularly happy either. Because when was this December 3rd, 2019."
56:19,660;56:27,260;"uh, Terry Glenn Jr. his son, uh, died of an apparent accidental overdose."
56:27,260;56:28,380;"He's 22."
56:28,380;56:32,380;"Why this is a good idea to explore?"
56:32,380;56:35,820;"Cause we needed to talk about Terry Glenn because he's such a big part of this."
56:35,820;56:36,780;"And I want you."
56:36,780;56:38,300;"I know we've given a lot of crap."
56:38,300;56:41,780;"So I kind of want to just kind of shed a human light on him."
56:41,780;56:47,700;"I know we get, try to be funny a lot of times, but like some of this shit, like he went through some, some rough stuff."
56:47,700;56:48,060;"So."
56:48,780;56:53,420;"Did you find in any of all the research that there was like a consistent person"
56:53,420;56:54,900;"trying to help them out throughout all this?"
56:54,900;57:02,180;"Um, his girlfriend, it seemed like was his, his person for that."
57:02,180;57:05,260;"Um, they, what is she?"
57:05,260;57:08,860;"She was a Dallas County law enforcement officer, I think."
57:08,860;57:14,020;"Um, and they started several like nonprofits together."
57:14,220;57:21,260;"Um, that would target like a domestic violence awareness and things, which I think probably"
57:21,260;57:27,340;"stemmed from the stuff that you had going on back in like 2001 when he was arrested for assaulting."
57:27,340;57:30,460;"Where is mom getting killed? I mean, that's DV right there."
57:30,460;57:35,420;"I mean that too. Yeah. So I mean, a lot of it kind of followed him throughout all this stuff."
57:35,420;57:42,620;"Well, that's a thing too. I mean, it's such a horrible start to life, you know, so, uh,"
57:43,500;57:48,220;"I don't know. It's a tough thing to shake. Yeah, especially with all the other baby. I mean, yeah, so"
57:48,220;57:52,460;"I don't know. I mean, I wonder if you try to get help. I don't know"
57:52,460;57:58,460;"what do you try to do, but that's extremely unfortunate. Yeah, that wasn't a lot about him"
57:58,460;58:04,300;"talking about his personal life. He was pretty buttoned up about that. He just like was not a"
58:04,300;58:09,580;"guy who would open up. He would try to do small, but it didn't really. I mean, Andy and I kind of"
58:09,580;58:15,180;"and went over a little bit of the mental health aspect of sports and then and now."
58:15,180;58:21,660;"So I won't go into it too much unless you guys want to share anything or chime in."
58:21,660;58:28,460;"But I will say that hopefully things are a little bit better for players to reach out without having"
58:28,460;58:35,020;"the stigma or issues that stem from that and just addressing this stuff. Because also on top of"
58:35,020;58:40,660;"of like dealing with a tragic past and you know, you have all this money and opportunity"
58:40,660;58:46,180;"that you might not have not had before. I got to imagine that it's tough to navigate alone,"
58:46,180;58:50,380;"never mind with, you know, issues stemming from childhood and whatnot."
58:50,380;58:51,380;"Yep."
58:51,380;58:52,380;"So."
58:52,380;58:56,380;"Can you imagine if a coach called one of his players she in this"
58:56,380;58:57,380;"thinage?"
58:57,380;59:02,420;"Yeah, that's a rough one. That's what I'm just saying. Hopefully, you know, things are"
59:02,420;59:07,520;"a little bit better for players to reach out and get the help that they need."
59:07,520;59:11,840;"Yeah, I mean, the whole mental health thing, it's definitely better these days, right?"
59:11,840;59:13,720;"I'd hope so."
59:13,720;59:19,340;"I mean, I don't know for all the way there, but yeah, definitely better than it was like 15 years ago."
59:19,340;59:21,560;"I did research about it too."
59:21,560;59:26,200;"Even things like CTE, like just understanding what it is and concussions and how they affect people."
59:26,200;59:31,280;"Well, the guy from the Cavs just came out and said he had anxiety."
59:32,240;59:34,840;"Yeah, which and like he got a pretty good reception."
59:34,840;59:36,600;"Kevin love Kevin."
59:36,600;59:37,640;"That's right."
59:37,640;59:38,140;"Yeah."
59:38,140;59:41,320;"Yeah, that's a good point."
59:41,320;59:44,400;"And I got to, I just got to think all that celebrity and you're going through"
59:44,400;59:45,400;"shit. Like, I don't know."
59:45,400;59:48,280;"I know that people, I mean, it's easy to say, like these guys make millions of"
59:48,280;59:49,160;"dollars and whatever."
59:49,160;59:53,480;"And we all have problems in our own way, but I can't imagine like having a camera"
59:53,480;59:57,120;"in my face, following me around, having all the money in the world to do whatever"
59:57,120;59:57,520;"I want."
59:57,520;01:00:02,520;"and then restrain myself when things don't feel that great."
01:00:02,520;01:00:04,240;"It's tough."
01:00:04,240;01:00:07,720;"- I think it comes with its own unique set of problems for sure."
01:00:07,720;01:00:08,560;"- Yeah."
01:00:08,560;01:00:10,440;"- Like you feel like no one understands it either, right?"
01:00:10,440;01:00:11,700;"Everyone's like, oh, you're super rich."
01:00:11,700;01:00:12,840;"Why you upset?"
01:00:12,840;01:00:13,680;"- Right, true."
01:00:13,680;01:00:16,720;"I mean, I don't know how comfortable people are"
01:00:16,720;01:00:18,360;"with reaching out to teammates and stuff too,"
01:00:18,360;01:00:20,640;"because there's that like bravado stuff."
01:00:20,640;01:00:21,640;"- Mm-hmm."

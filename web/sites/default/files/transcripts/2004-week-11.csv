00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,640;"I am not your mother."
00:18,640;00:27,000;"Welcome back to the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
00:27,000;00:29,240;"I am your host Gregory Brown."
00:29,240;00:32,800;"And with me today,"
00:32,800;00:35,680;"I have the two grunts of the podcast,"
00:35,680;00:38,120;"Andy Brown."
00:38,120;00:39,280;"How you doing, bud?"
00:39,280;00:41,800;"- Doing well, how are you, Greg?"
00:41,800;00:42,880;"I'm doing great."
00:42,880;00:44,760;"It feels good to be in charge."
00:44,760;00:46,640;"- Yeah."
00:46,640;00:48,000;"- Yeah, I know."
00:48,000;00:52,000;"Do I get a mute button to shut people up?"
00:52,000;00:54,160;"- Yeah, you're running the show, Greg."
00:54,160;00:55,640;"It's Freaky Friday episode."
00:55,640;00:56,640;"[laughter]"
00:56,640;00:57,940;"-Freaky Friday."
00:57,940;01:02,240;"So today, Andy missed a busy."
01:02,240;01:04,040;"Did not watch the game."
01:04,040;01:05,540;"-This is correct."
01:05,540;01:06,440;"-Meanwall."
01:06,440;01:07,440;"-Hey, hey, hey."
01:07,440;01:08,940;"-I watched the highlights."
01:08,940;01:10,440;"-We'll see."
01:10,440;01:12,840;"[laughter]"
01:12,840;01:17,740;"-Meanwall, I watched all 60 minutes of this football game."
01:17,740;01:18,840;"-God damn."
01:18,840;01:20,340;"-This is a first."
01:20,340;01:21,340;"-Mm-hmm."
01:21,340;01:22,140;"-No."
01:22,140;01:24,340;"This is a first regular season game maybe."
01:24,340;01:28,340;"No, that I have not watched in Grigmas."
01:28,340;01:30,340;"Yes, that's for sure."
01:30,340;01:32,340;"Easily."
01:32,340;01:34,340;"How the tides have changed."
01:34,340;01:37,340;"Indeed. Yeah."
01:37,340;01:42,340;"So Steve, how's your new year is going? New year. Same shit."
01:42,340;01:46,340;"I'm also the only non-COVID positive."
01:46,340;01:50,340;"That is a podcast today. Yeah. So far."
01:50,340;01:57,340;"Yeah, well, yeah. I honestly, my odds were on Greg getting it first because he seems to be the one who does the most shit."
01:57,340;01:58,340;"That's true."
01:58,340;02:05,340;"You're always like going places and doing stuff, traveling. I definitely thought you would have gotten it first."
02:05,340;02:07,340;"So I'm well impressed, Greg."
02:07,340;02:10,340;"Yeah, I live my life a quarter mile at a time, you know."
02:10,340;02:11,340;"This is what I mean."
02:11,340;02:12,340;"Yeah."
02:12,340;02:14,340;"You're also the most susceptible, dude."
02:14,340;02:16,340;"Do you think about the summer of theitis you had?"
02:16,340;02:21,040;"Mmm, but outside the eye the summer theitis. I've been pretty healthy"
02:21,040;02:25,380;"It's true. Yeah, I rarely get sick so"
02:25,380;02:30,860;"But I think I'm like McBrown when I get sick I get absolutely pathetic"
02:30,860;02:41,220;"Yeah, you are kind of a baby. Yeah, also unlike Andy. I didn't have symptoms. So clearly better brother here. Well, I don't know about that"
02:41,220;02:45,060;"That just means you didn't really get it. I"
02:45,740;02:50,980;"Went whole hog. I got I got full COVID none of this like oh tested positive, but I"
02:50,980;02:58,100;"Don't not show you symptoms. I got the full cold symptoms a full flu symptoms. I was out for two days"
02:58,100;03:02,020;"No, but I'm back. Oh you put it"
03:02,020;03:08,300;"What a handy-pandy. I remember this crack went from you get it because it's definitely a matter of time"
03:09,060;03:15,920;"Dude my immune system might I play in the dirt Andy alright my immune system has been through hell and back"
03:15,920;03:21,380;"Have you not seen the videos of me as a child literally sitting in a puddle playing cars in it? I?"
03:21,380;03:24,660;"invented playing in the dirt"
03:24,660;03:26,300;"Well"
03:26,300;03:28,300;"The results they otherwise"
03:28,300;03:36,140;"Buffalo is playing in the dirt at that's that's our base. That's pretty fucking good. Yeah, you only embrace the dirt Andy. I was"
03:36,140;03:37,140;"All right."
03:37,140;03:48,500;"Week 11 2004, Monday night football."
03:48,500;03:56,620;"The Patriots are at Arrowhead Stadium to take on the Dick Vermeil Kansas City Chiefs."
03:56,620;04:00,940;"We got some good Dick Vermeil squint in this game that, you know, when he's all flustered,"
04:00,940;04:05,300;"maybe a little, you know, you can squinting, you know."
04:05,300;04:11,300;"Oh, yeah. He's also noted cryer. Dick Vermeil."
04:11,300;04:14,300;"When did he cry? He cries all the time."
04:14,300;04:18,300;"It's like his reputation. No."
04:18,300;04:23,300;"Weepy Vermeil."
04:23,300;04:27,300;"Apparently some players like it and some hate it."
04:27,300;04:29,300;"Which one would you be?"
04:29,300;04:32,300;"I mean, I don't want to see my coach cry. That's kind of weird."
04:32,300;04:33,300;"Yeah, definitely."
04:33,300;04:41,820;"I'm all for like crying in like situations that call for crying, you know, but crying"
04:41,820;04:42,820;"frequently."
04:42,820;04:45,380;"Yeah, you get to get a hold of your shared, you know."
04:45,380;04:47,660;"Do you think tears of joy works?"
04:47,660;04:50,220;"Yeah, tears of joy are always fine."
04:50,220;04:51,220;"Yeah."
04:51,220;04:52,860;"But like, I'm sad tears."
04:52,860;04:55,460;"You just got to reserve those for the special moments."
04:55,460;04:59,060;"Yeah, Dick's all about the crying."
04:59,060;05:01,100;"It's it's a little too much."
05:01,100;05:06,740;"Hmm. The Patriots come into this game. They haven't won a game in Kansas City"
05:06,740;05:10,300;"since 1964. Fuck me."
05:10,300;05:15,460;"Oh, it's not. Apparently it's not even our head stadium either. So the old stadium."
05:15,460;05:19,900;"What do you mean the last time they won or this game? The last time the"
05:19,900;05:25,020;"Patriots won in Kansas City is that like some other memorial stadium or"
05:25,020;05:28,300;"something. 64 didn't like the Patriots start in the 1960s too."
05:29,100;05:31,340;"Yeah, they won their first season and never again."
05:31,340;05:34,780;"So the Chiefs of three and seven."
05:34,780;05:36,860;"So they had that good year last year,"
05:36,860;05:40,340;"pre-somes where they lost to the Colts,"
05:40,340;05:42,980;"right, and the playoffs and the shootout."
05:42,980;05:45,420;"So they had high expectations come into this year,"
05:45,420;05:47,580;"but they come into this game three and seven."
05:47,580;05:51,340;"Playing the nine and one Pat's."
05:51,340;05:54,460;"Pat's her three point favorites,"
05:54,460;05:56,900;"which I guess is kind of surprising,"
05:56,900;06:01,500;"giving their records, but I think they're probably better than their records suggest,"
06:01,500;06:05,580;"right? I think their offense was sick. Yeah. No bueno. And that was without Priest Holmes"
06:05,580;06:09,620;"today. You definitely noticed him missing there. Mm hmm. All right. So that's another"
06:09,620;06:16,020;"headline for this game is Priest Holmes last year's rushing leader touchdown leader."
06:16,020;06:22,100;"Yeah, some records back then too, right? Most of the season, I think it was. Mm hmm. Yeah."
06:22,100;06:26,860;"So he's injured for this game."
06:26,860;06:31,460;"Going against the Patriots who obviously we've talked about their cornerback issues."
06:31,460;06:35,620;"A lot of Troy Brown this one playing corner which is nice."
06:35,620;06:42,340;"Yeah, how is the Troy Brown interception last week?"
06:42,340;06:45,660;"Oh, or gasmic."
06:45,660;06:47,940;"Yeah, absolutely orgasmic."
06:47,940;06:48,780;"- This face."
06:48,780;06:51,620;"- I don't think I've ever seen him more excited"
06:51,620;06:54,380;"coming off a field than when he intercepted True Blood."
06:54,380;06:56,540;"- We also calculated how many balls he caught"
06:56,540;06:58,940;"from True Blood, so I don't remember what it was,"
06:58,940;07:01,380;"but it's plausible because I don't think they're not."
07:01,380;07:04,460;"- What about practice?"
07:04,460;07:06,420;"How'd you calculate that?"
07:06,420;07:07,260;"- We didn't think about it."
07:07,260;07:10,620;"- Oh, we did some rough back of the napkin math, you know."
07:10,620;07:11,460;"- Okay."
07:11,460;07:12,860;"(laughs)"
07:12,860;07:15,300;"Okay, some approximations."
07:15,300;07:21,440;"just real quick just to go back to your, your Chiefs being a good offense. I actually found"
07:21,440;07:29,100;"a thing the Chiefs scored 483 points this season in 2004. And that was the highest total"
07:29,100;07:32,600;"in NFL history for a team that finished the season with a losing record."
07:32,600;07:40,120;"Yeah, that's pretty impressive. That's hard to do scoring 483 points and finishing with a"
07:40,120;07:43,280;"losing record. Was there defense just that bad? Yeah."
07:43,280;07:45,200;"Was a fine worker."
07:45,200;07:48,920;"Seven and nine. Seven and nine. Yeah."
07:48,920;07:52,080;"He losses here. So I want to lose once more threats this season."
07:52,080;07:55,840;"Yeah. But it wasn't the offensive fault."
07:55,840;08:01,200;"They were first in yards and second in points for offense."
08:01,200;08:05,520;"And they were 31st in yards and 29th for points on defense."
08:05,520;08:09,800;"Yeah. I mean, Trent Greene threw four five hundred yards."
08:09,800;08:14,360;"Trent Green in 27 touchdowns. Those are manning ass numbers back then."
08:14,360;08:17,480;"We're Trent Green sucks though."
08:17,480;08:23,080;"Yeah, I know. This is what I'm saying. And even he succeeded in this Kansas City offense."
08:23,080;08:27,400;"Dick for me on those what he's doing. I'll send up on the comedy because this is peak him."
08:27,400;08:30,920;"The whole, yeah. He had 1200 yards and seven touchdowns."
08:30,920;08:33,880;"Led the team. This is the best season."
08:33,880;08:36,440;"Yeah. Don't check."
08:38,760;08:41,280;"Yeah, other notable players on this team."
08:41,280;08:43,200;"So obviously, Priest Holmes, but he's hurt."
08:43,200;08:43,680;"Yep."
08:43,680;08:47,960;"Um, Dante Hall, Tony Gonzalez."
08:47,960;08:50,480;"They're offensive line was ridiculous too."
08:50,480;08:51,640;"Oh, right."
08:51,640;08:51,960;"Yeah."
08:51,960;08:55,400;"You know, it's good when you actually recognize the names of the players."
08:55,400;08:57,720;"It doesn't have an often offensive line."
08:57,720;08:59,600;"Willie Rolfe, baby."
08:59,600;09:01,080;"Willie Rolfe."
09:01,080;09:03,720;"The Chris Birmingham used to call Willie Potrof, right?"
09:03,720;09:05,760;"Something like that."
09:05,760;09:06,440;"Yeah."
09:06,440;09:08,080;"Brian Waters."
09:08,080;09:10,080;"Well, shields."
09:10,080;09:11,080;"Yep."
09:11,080;09:13,080;"Those are all names I recognize, which is impressive."
09:13,080;09:16,080;"Doesn't Brian Waters play for the Patriots later in his career?"
09:16,080;09:18,080;"And then again, the Jets."
09:18,080;09:19,080;"Hmm."
09:19,080;09:20,080;"I don't know."
09:20,080;09:21,080;"Stat check."
09:21,080;09:27,080;"I'm here to take notes to ask questions that have you and you to stat check."
09:27,080;09:28,080;"Question."
09:28,080;09:29,080;"Yes."
09:29,080;09:30,080;"That check."
09:30,080;09:34,080;"And he played for New England in 2011."
09:34,080;09:36,080;"And then Dallas in 2013."
09:36,080;09:39,880;"He does not play for the Jets."
09:39,880;09:43,680;"Apparently 2012 on Pro Football Reference just says,"
09:43,680;09:46,880;"""Miss season refused to report."""
09:46,880;09:48,320;"Ooh, I like that."
09:48,320;09:49,680;"Didn't fucking show up in 2012."
09:49,680;09:50,840;"That was like, nah."
09:50,840;09:51,680;"Maybe he was here."
09:51,680;09:52,680;"That was an acclimated."
09:52,680;09:55,360;"2012."
09:55,360;09:57,600;"Yeah, didn't have his teed up."
09:57,600;09:58,440;"Yeah."
09:58,440;10:00,000;"(laughs)"
10:00,000;10:01,320;"MMR, get out."
10:04,160;10:09,840;"The Roger say calling the MVP the most valuable vaccinated player."
10:09,840;10:10,400;"Yeah."
10:10,400;10:11,720;"hilarious."
10:11,720;10:16,880;"It would be if it was most vaccinated player like like just stick with the MVP,"
10:16,880;10:17,720;"dude."
10:17,720;10:20,800;"Yeah, that's pretty funny though."
10:20,800;10:25,360;"Then you call the guy a bum to come back calling people bums."
10:25,360;10:27,320;"Yeah, that guy is a bum too."
10:27,320;10:28,720;"That's legit."
10:28,720;10:31,720;"So any other notables about the Chiefs?"
10:32,560;10:35,920;"Yeah. Um, their special teams coach,"
10:35,920;10:38,860;"shadow, she long time."
10:38,860;10:41,400;"That's why I just use coach back then."
10:41,400;10:44,680;"So the patient must have seen something in there and the chief special teams here"
10:44,680;10:47,840;"because in '09 they would sign him for nine years."
10:47,840;10:49,480;"Hmm."
10:49,480;10:52,760;"Maybe you're doing a terrible job of being Greg right now here,"
10:52,760;10:56,840;"remembering a bunch of facts here coming up with, you know, you've cuts like that."
10:56,840;10:57,440;"All right."
10:57,440;10:58,680;"How about this?"
10:58,680;11:00,640;"Then I'll be a Greg."
11:00,640;11:03,040;"conversation, you know, lead us down some weird places."
11:03,040;11:06,680;"- I got a deep dive for you and it has nothing to do with any"
11:06,680;11:10,400;"player on either of these teams, but the announcer, John Gruden."
11:10,400;11:12,480;"- John, man."
11:12,480;11:15,440;"- You told, well, you told me it was John Gruden."
11:15,440;11:17,600;"So I did a John Gruden deep dive."
11:17,600;11:18,440;"- Oh, perfect."
11:18,440;11:19,840;"Cause it was John Madden."
11:19,840;11:20,920;"- Good."
11:20,920;11:23,680;"So this, I am, I am killing it as Greg."
11:23,680;11:25,720;"- John Gruden still coaching that again, wasn't it?"
11:25,720;11:26,560;"- Yeah."
11:26,560;11:27,400;"- That's what I figured."
11:27,400;11:28,240;"- He was judging recently."
11:28,240;11:29,240;"- You told me."
11:29,240;11:31,640;"So should we talk about John Gruden?"
11:31,640;11:33,280;"- This is perfect."
11:33,280;11:34,920;"- You're doing a perfect job, Eddie."
11:34,920;11:36,480;"- I'm killing the Greg role right now."
11:36,480;11:39,120;"- We left third, I love it, that's perfect Greg."
11:39,120;11:42,960;"- So Gruden, let's talk about John Gruden,"
11:42,960;11:44,240;"'cause he's been in the news lately too,"
11:44,240;11:45,160;"so we'll get to that."
11:45,160;11:46,200;"But first we'll start,"
11:46,200;11:49,560;"born in Sandusky, Ohio,"
11:49,560;11:51,200;"which I feel like is,"
11:51,200;11:52,840;"if you were writing a movie,"
11:52,840;11:54,880;"is definitely foreshadowing Sandusky."
11:54,880;11:57,760;"- Can I put in for a second?"
11:57,760;11:59,000;"'Cause I came across this today,"
11:59,000;12:00,600;"which I thought was hilarious."
12:00,600;12:04,640;"Did you know that there is a biography on Sandusky"
12:04,640;12:08,000;"before all the allegations came out?"
12:08,000;12:09,240;"- What? - You wanna hear"
12:09,240;12:10,240;"what it's called?"
12:10,240;12:12,360;"- Oh, this is gonna be great."
12:12,360;12:16,480;"- It's called ""Touched"", the Jerry Sandusky story."
12:16,480;12:17,480;"- I can't make this shit up."
12:17,480;12:18,720;"- So where the God did?"
12:18,720;12:20,360;"So where the God?"
12:20,360;12:21,200;"- Very touched."
12:21,200;12:25,040;"- That's rough."
12:25,040;12:26,360;"- Yeah."
12:26,360;12:27,400;"- Oh boy."
12:27,400;12:29,840;"Yeah, 'cause apparently Dick Vermeil wrote like,"
12:29,840;12:32,320;"you know, like one of the intro quotes or whatever,"
12:32,320;12:34,240;"like talking about what a good guy he was."
12:34,240;12:35,080;"Yeah."
12:35,080;12:37,360;"- Yeah, the preface or whatever."
12:37,360;12:38,440;"- Jesus."
12:38,440;12:39,720;"- That's tough, yeah."
12:39,720;12:46,560;"- So we know that John Gruden has a brother Jay."
12:46,560;12:48,640;"Did you know he has another brother James"
12:48,640;12:51,080;"who is not in the football."
12:51,080;12:52,840;"His dad was in the football."
12:52,840;12:55,600;"Jay obviously like played football and coached."
12:57,080;13:01,360;"James, radiologist at Cornell Medicine."
13:01,360;13:04,240;"So black sheep of the family."
13:04,240;13:06,600;"He's one of the men that did it, right?"
13:06,600;13:07,120;"Yeah."
13:07,120;13:08,920;"Well, no, he's probably the one that makes the least amount of money."
13:08,920;13:11,440;"He's only a doctor."
13:11,440;13:15,720;"Yeah, but they ain't fucking finding his emails and putting them out on ESPN."
13:15,720;13:19,040;"Well, speaking of which ad did you hear the J."
13:19,040;13:20,080;"Grooden thing recently?"
13:20,080;13:25,760;"No, where they were some somebody was interviewing him about because he"
13:25,760;13:27,960;"used to be the coach of Washington."
13:27,960;13:31,260;"And so they're interviewing about the announcing"
13:31,260;13:32,800;"the new team name."
13:32,800;13:35,080;"And he said, ""I don't want to ruffle any feathers,"
13:35,080;13:37,400;"but they should have never changed a name in the first place."""
13:37,400;13:41,600;"- Bro, of all the takes."
13:41,600;13:43,160;"That's not the one."
13:43,160;13:44,240;"- I don't want to ruffle any feathers,"
13:44,240;13:45,800;"but I'm going to ruffle them anyways."
13:45,800;13:49,160;"- Yeah, and like using the ruffle the feathers thing too."
13:49,160;13:52,320;"- Oh, ruffle the feathers."
13:52,320;13:53,920;"Like that's a bit of a stretch, Andy."
13:53,920;13:56,220;"Well, hey, I'm just reporting what I believe."
13:56,220;13:57,220;"What do you think, buddy?"
13:57,220;14:01,340;"I think you just stay the fuck away from that."
14:01,340;14:04,060;"But you know, should have kept your word."
14:04,060;14:06,160;"Exactly."
14:06,160;14:07,600;"OK, cool, dude."
14:07,600;14:10,660;"You want to take back to what they're going to call them?"
14:10,660;14:11,620;"Admirals."
14:11,620;14:12,740;"I don't even know the options."
14:12,740;14:14,460;"It's going to be the admirals."
14:14,460;14:16,140;"I'm going a lot of--"
14:16,140;14:18,420;"there's a lot of smoke around admirals."
14:18,420;14:19,260;"Yeah."
14:19,260;14:21,260;"Yeah."
14:21,260;14:26,060;"or generals. I heard it was a military related, but I'm going hot. Well,"
14:26,060;14:30,020;"I want it to be hogs, but they're too incompetent to actually come into red"
14:30,020;14:30,380;"hogs."
14:30,380;14:32,700;"They're going to come up with something stupid or just something just really"
14:32,700;14:34,940;"lifeless. Red hogs should be good too."
14:34,940;14:39,060;"The hogs come on, man. It's it's perfect."
14:39,060;14:42,700;"That is perfect. Yeah. Because you could play into the history of the"
14:42,700;14:43,660;"the hogs."
14:43,660;14:48,500;"It's like football being like the hogmallows, you know, just like the beef"
14:48,500;14:49,820;"cakes. Like exactly."
14:50,260;14:51,820;"It would be perfect. Yeah."
14:51,820;14:54,900;"You could paint your bus like a trailer, you know?"
14:54,900;14:57,460;"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
14:57,460;14:59,020;"That'd be dope. Mm."
14:59,020;15:01,380;"You put just hay around everywhere."
15:01,380;15:05,500;"I just think about all like the stick you could do with it."
15:05,500;15:07,580;"Like it's like winking for touchdowns."
15:07,580;15:08,660;"Oh, hell yeah."
15:08,660;15:09,820;"Everything."
15:09,820;15:13,580;"Yeah, 100% coming to the pig pen."
15:13,580;15:14,660;"You don't want to come bright."
15:14,660;15:15,820;"No, you don't."
15:15,820;15:17,580;"You said no."
15:18,220;15:20,700;"That's not useless piece of crap."
15:20,700;15:25,900;"Oh, so the reason people were talking about how it was going to be the Washington admirals"
15:25,900;15:37,020;"is because if you go to washington admirals.com, it redirects to the Reskins or the Washington"
15:37,020;15:39,820;"football team website right now."
15:39,820;15:41,020;"Ooh."
15:41,020;15:48,700;"So, you know, like there's some smoke there, but other people were talking about how, you"
15:48,700;15:54,020;"know, anybody can direct any URL to anything."
15:54,020;15:57,020;"So I decided to test that out."
15:57,020;16:01,380;"So I registered, let me see if I can find it."
16:01,380;16:04,380;"Oh boy."
16:04,380;16:08,380;"And you can I just, I want to document a quick PPSLAP for saying the R word there."
16:08,380;16:09,380;"Yes."
16:09,380;16:10,380;"Appreciate that."
16:10,380;16:12,660;"- Thank you for-- - You're getting Andy again."
16:12,660;16:14,420;"Greg should be registering domains right now."
16:14,420;16:15,420;"You're great."
16:15,420;16:16,420;"- That's true."
16:16,420;16:20,060;"But it was, I believe it was worsenflowner.com."
16:20,060;16:22,700;"And if you go to that, it now redirects to"
16:22,700;16:26,540;"the washingtonfootball.com website."
16:26,540;16:27,380;"- So it does work."
16:27,380;16:30,540;"Anybody can point any website they want to."
16:30,540;16:31,900;"Yeah, so if you go to that-- - What is it?"
16:31,900;16:32,740;"Let me try."
16:32,740;16:38,860;"- Worstnflowner.com."
16:38,860;16:41,860;"And see if it works."
16:41,860;16:43,860;"Yeah, that's the one."
16:43,860;16:45,860;"Yeah, look at that."
16:45,860;16:46,860;"There you go."
16:46,860;16:49,860;"So that's a fun game that we can now play."
16:49,860;16:50,860;"Oh, yeah."
16:50,860;16:53,860;"There are a lot of things that we can redirect now to."
16:53,860;16:55,860;"Oh, wow. That. Yeah, that's it."
16:55,860;16:57,860;"It opens up a lot, right?"
16:57,860;16:59,860;"It opens up a lot of avenues."
16:59,860;17:00,860;"Yes. Yeah."
17:00,860;17:02,860;"So how about this?"
17:02,860;17:04,860;"If anybody has anything."
17:04,860;17:13,180;"Text us on the hotline, 603-505-8043, with what you would redirect and where you would"
17:13,180;17:16,020;"redirect it to."
17:16,020;17:17,020;"Small Dix incorporate."
17:17,020;17:20,020;"How many do you pay for this?"
17:20,020;17:21,740;"We'll like eight bucks."
17:21,740;17:22,740;"Eight bucks."
17:22,740;17:23,900;"That's worth it."
17:23,900;17:24,900;"For the year."
17:24,900;17:27,180;"That's the whole year of that joke."
17:27,180;17:28,180;"Love it."
17:28,180;17:32,900;"Speaking of jokes, John, we'll go back to John Gruden."
17:32,900;17:35,300;"up he was a Cleveland Browns fan which I think explains a lot."
17:35,300;17:40,660;"Eventually he became the head coach of not the Cleveland Browns with the Oakland Raiders."
17:40,660;17:47,700;"Went in 2000 went 12 and 4 before losing to the eventual Super Bowl champion Ravens"
17:47,700;17:53,380;"in the AFC Championship game and then the year after went 10 and 6 before losing to"
17:53,380;17:56,900;"the eventual Super Bowl champion New England Patriots in the game you might remember."
17:59,140;18:04,260;"And then after, I think it was after that year, he didn't get fired."
18:04,260;18:10,260;"You know, he actually, he got traded kind of similarly to the way Bella check was, to"
18:10,260;18:18,660;"the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, because Tony Dunge got fired and went obviously coach the Colts."
18:18,660;18:25,380;"And so the bucks, the bucks traded. Here it is."
18:27,220;18:31,300;"high stakes trade included Tampa vase 2002 and 2003 first round draft picks"
18:31,300;18:37,540;"2002 and 2004 second round draft picks and eight million dollars in cash to acquire"
18:37,540;18:44,580;"John Gruden. I guess Super Bowl have it so yeah so all they did was go to Zubo next year because"
18:44,580;18:49,620;"their defense was fantastic and then John Gruden retooled the offense because you know that was"
18:49,620;18:56,580;"his thing. Yeah those high fly and local raiders in the early 2000s so they meet in Zubo. It was"
18:56,580;18:59,380;"It was basically called the Gruden Bowl in 2002."
18:59,380;19:03,340;"And Gruden won, making him the youngest head coach"
19:03,340;19:05,580;"to win the Super Bowl at age 39."
19:05,580;19:09,340;"That would be surpassed by anybody now."
19:09,340;19:12,740;"The youngest."
19:12,740;19:13,980;"- As well, maybe."
19:13,980;19:14,820;"- Oh."
19:14,820;19:15,740;"- One of the hard boss."
19:15,740;19:16,580;"- No."
19:16,580;19:20,460;"It was a coach who previously served under Gruden"
19:20,460;19:23,980;"as the Bucks defensive backs coach, Mike Tomlin."
19:23,980;19:25,340;"- Mike Tomlin."
19:25,340;19:26,180;"- Right."
19:26,180;19:29,180;"Mike Tom is the youngest coach to win a Super Bowl."
19:29,180;19:30,020;"- How old is he?"
19:30,020;19:33,600;"- I'm guessing younger than 39, so probably 38."
19:33,600;19:38,380;"But the reason that the Bucks won Zoopol"
19:38,380;19:41,860;"over the Raiders, one of the main reasons,"
19:41,860;19:44,940;"other than one of the Raiders players going AWOL,"
19:44,940;19:46,080;"the night before the game,"
19:46,080;19:49,900;"was Gruden's prior knowledge of the Raiders."
19:49,900;19:53,700;"I quote, ""The most damaging piece of evidence"
19:53,700;19:55,980;"is NFL Films, Footage of Tampa Bay,"
19:55,980;19:57,940;"defensive back John Lynch telling his teammates"
19:57,940;20:00,060;"during the game that almost all the plays"
20:00,060;20:03,580;"ran by Oakland's offense were plays that Gruden,"
20:03,580;20:05,900;"who that week even played the part of Rich Ganon"
20:05,900;20:08,700;"by playing quarterback with the scout team offense,"
20:08,700;20:11,020;"specifically told them to look out for."
20:11,020;20:13,100;"Better still for the Buccaneers was that the Oakland"
20:13,100;20:15,500;"hadn't changed their audible calling signals"
20:15,500;20:17,340;"that Gruden himself had installed,"
20:17,340;20:19,100;"thus tipping off plays repeatedly."
20:19,100;20:23,100;"That's bad, guys."
20:23,100;20:26,100;"Well, yeah, that's the Raiders fault for not changing the offense when you left."
20:26,100;20:26,600;"Oh, yeah."
20:26,600;20:27,300;"That's what I mean."
20:27,300;20:28,200;"That's bad."
20:28,200;20:30,200;"And then you're playing the same guy."
20:30,200;20:32,000;"I can't install that offense."
20:32,000;20:33,200;"It's a Super Bowl, but still."
20:33,200;20:37,300;"How did nobody else catch on?"
20:37,300;20:38,300;"Is what I want to know."
20:38,300;20:39,500;"Good question."
20:39,500;20:42,800;"Because they're not taking practices."
20:42,800;20:43,400;"Yeah."
20:43,400;20:45,400;"So that's true."
20:45,400;20:46,500;"Love you in the other rooms."
20:46,500;20:49,300;"Steel and playbooks."
20:49,300;20:52,600;"Jim and Ed says that's right."
20:52,600;20:57,760;"The box of Finnish 7 and 9 and 5/11 the next two years because they were in cap"
20:57,760;21:02,280;"held because of it. And became the first team to have consecutive losing"
21:02,280;21:07,840;"seasons after winning Super Bowl. So John Gruden is the best at failing too."
21:07,840;21:13,920;"The low point was a Monday night game against the Colts who obviously were now"
21:13,920;21:17,720;"coached by Tony Dungy, who was his predecessor. And that was the game where"
21:17,720;21:22,480;"where the bucks were, yeah, 35, 14 in the fourth quarter"
21:22,480;21:25,680;"and still managed to lose 38, 35, remember that game?"
21:25,680;21:27,480;"Payman just went the fuck off."
21:27,480;21:29,280;"- Oh yeah, yep."
21:29,280;21:31,480;"- So then Gruden took a whole bunch of time off"
21:31,480;21:35,080;"until he was lured back in the NFL"
21:35,080;21:37,440;"with a 10 year, $100 million contract,"
21:37,440;21:39,680;"which we all remember in 2018."
21:39,680;21:44,840;"Part of that included a no trade clause"
21:44,840;21:46,600;"so that he couldn't get traded like he was"
21:46,600;21:49,160;"when he was the coach of the Raiders the first time."
21:49,160;21:52,920;"And then as Greg alluded to, in October, 2021,"
21:52,920;21:55,440;"this is the juicy bit, a league investigation"
21:55,440;21:56,840;"into the Washington football team"
21:56,840;21:59,600;"for workplace misconduct, uncovered emails"
21:59,600;22:03,440;"Gruden sent to then Washington General manager Bruce Allen,"
22:03,440;22:05,400;"where Gruden used racist, misogynistic,"
22:05,400;22:06,960;"and homophobic slurs."
22:06,960;22:09,440;"This is where it gets juicy."
22:09,440;22:12,160;"The emails were written between 2011 and 2018."
22:12,160;22:15,680;"So this isn't just like a one-off, this is what he does."
22:15,680;22:25,360;"The emails referred to NFL Commissioner Roger Gridel as ""afford"", ""bundle of sticks"", and ""Greg"","
22:25,360;22:30,400;"an anti-football pussy, a clueless anti-football pussy."
22:30,400;22:37,040;"You all say Gridel shouldn't have pressured the Rams to draft ""queers"" referring to Michael Sam,"
22:37,040;22:38,400;"the first openly gay player."
22:38,400;22:43,200;"Gruden said that players who protest the national anthem should be fired,"
22:43,200;22:46,480;"specifically referring to former 49 safety air greed."
22:46,480;22:50,080;"Grooden user racist stereotype to describe NFL PA executive"
22:50,080;22:54,800;"director, Damora Smith, which this is such a like a boomer"
22:54,800;22:59,960;"saying saying, dumb Boris Smith has lips the size of Michelin"
22:59,960;23:03,360;"tires misspelling Michelin, of course, because it's"
23:03,360;23:04,080;"stronger."
23:04,080;23:11,320;"Also, dumb Boris, like really, that's that yeah, that's that's"
23:11,320;23:13,240;"It's like a Facebook thing you'd see."
23:13,240;23:15,480;"It's great school at level."
23:15,480;23:16,240;"Yeah, it is."
23:16,240;23:17,120;"Dumb or is--"
23:17,120;23:19,480;"I think I got an elementary school."
23:19,480;23:23,160;"--rudin also called then United States Vice President Joe Biden"
23:23,160;23:24,680;"a nervous clueless pussy."
23:24,680;23:27,640;"Say it likes clueless pussy."
23:27,640;23:28,280;"But this is--"
23:28,280;23:29,680;"That one, that's sweet."
23:29,680;23:32,360;"Yeah, that one."
23:32,360;23:35,480;"That one tracks."
23:35,480;23:37,400;"Alan and others also received emails"
23:37,400;23:39,520;"from Gruden that contained topless photos of women,"
23:39,520;23:41,880;"including two Washington football team cheerleaders."
23:41,880;23:48,280;"Which when you combine that with all the cheerleaders stuff"
23:48,280;23:53,280;"for the Washington football team that went on is even worse."
23:53,280;23:56,800;"Grootn resigned on October 11th"
23:56,800;24:00,840;"in after details were released to the New York Times"
24:00,840;24:02,800;"or by the New York Times."
24:02,800;24:05,040;"And then he announced his intentions to sue the NFL"
24:05,040;24:07,420;"and Roger Goodell for exposing his scandals."
24:08,960;24:17,200;"And because of that, he was removed from the buccaneer ring of honor, where he'd been inducted in 2017 as a result of these emails."
24:17,200;24:21,520;"So, what?"
24:21,520;24:23,120;"It means old peepee slap."
24:23,120;24:23,760;"Oh, yeah."
24:23,760;24:25,360;"They gave him a big old peepee slap."
24:25,360;24:29,040;"He's a he's a sometimes a naughty boy."
24:29,040;24:29,560;"Yeah."
24:29,560;24:31,760;"He's a patsy."
24:31,760;24:33,360;"He is."
24:33,360;24:33,840;"Yeah."
24:33,840;24:35,980;"- The only one to be smeared by that"
24:35,980;24:38,680;"are caught up in that Redskins investigation"
24:38,680;24:40,480;"'cause that's where all the where came from."
24:40,480;24:41,920;"- So yeah, so my question is."
24:41,920;24:42,880;"- So that's gonna come up on this day,"
24:42,880;24:44,000;"it's kind of swept that shit on the rug"
24:44,000;24:45,400;"and they took down all this bullshit."
24:45,400;24:46,400;"- Yeah, take time."
24:46,400;24:50,000;"- Right, so why are they protecting"
24:50,000;24:55,440;"the Washington franchise so strongly?"
24:55,440;24:56,280;"- No idea."
24:56,280;24:57,840;"- And Dan Snyder specifically."
24:57,840;24:58,760;"- Right."
24:58,760;24:59,840;"- Like just Buddha's asking,"
24:59,840;25:02,200;"get somebody else in there who's less of a headache."
25:02,200;25:03,960;"to make you more money even."
25:03,960;25:07,640;"- Yeah, probably not that easy to just boot someone though."
25:07,640;25:10,920;"I mean, the NBA did it pretty badly, no?"
25:10,920;25:13,680;"- Yeah, Carolina Panthers had to do it."
25:13,680;25:15,360;"- Oh yeah, the Panthers too, right?"
25:15,360;25:17,360;"- I think he resigned though, didn't he?"
25:17,360;25:18,700;"- Maybe. - Maybe."
25:18,700;25:20,000;"- Well, yeah, that's true, I think he made it."
25:20,000;25:21,840;"- Same idea, the didn't respond to."
25:21,840;25:25,320;"- This shit he was saying was Larry."
25:25,320;25:26,880;"(laughs)"
25:26,880;25:28,240;"The jeans for I days."
25:28,240;25:29,080;"- Yeah."
25:29,080;25:29,920;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
25:29,920;25:31,080;"- We'd be like, oh, you--"
25:31,080;25:32,520;"that on this podcast."
25:32,520;25:34,440;"- You fill those jeans out."
25:34,440;25:37,560;"- Yeah, you must have to jump and get into those jeans, huh?"
25:37,560;25:38,720;"(laughing)"
25:38,720;25:39,880;"Creepy old man shit."
25:39,880;25:42,680;"- Terrible."
25:42,680;25:46,360;"- Which is nowhere near as bad as anything Dan said is done."
25:46,360;25:53,080;"- Yeah, I mean, even Groot, it's like 2011,"
25:53,080;25:54,920;"it's a different time."
25:54,920;25:56,440;"I mean, obviously it's awful shit,"
25:56,440;25:58,720;"but it's like he just comes off as like a dumb ass"
25:58,720;26:00,360;"more than like a malicious--"
26:00,360;26:01,800;"Oh yeah, definitely."
26:01,800;26:02,640;"Yeah."
26:02,640;26:04,520;"It's like a great insult, not like a--"
26:04,520;26:05,360;"Yeah."
26:05,360;26:06,200;"The original charter."
26:06,200;26:07,560;"The Domborus Smith."
26:07,560;26:08,920;"Yeah, it's like, come on, dude."
26:08,920;26:10,720;"You're fucking 10-year-old."
26:10,720;26:12,080;"Yeah, exactly."
26:12,080;26:12,440;"So yeah."
26:12,440;26:15,520;"John Gruden, unrelated to the game we're--"
26:15,520;26:16,560;"you ain't today."
26:16,560;26:17,520;"You're welcome."
26:17,520;26:19,040;"This was a John Madden game."
26:19,040;26:20,280;"Also, that was sweet."
26:20,280;26:21,680;"It is a John Madden game."
26:21,680;26:22,680;"Rest in peace."
26:22,680;26:23,840;"Rest in peace."
26:23,840;26:24,760;"Yeah."
26:24,760;26:26,920;"It's great to hear his voice, too."
26:26,920;26:28,720;"Did you watch the game, Steve?"
26:28,720;26:29,520;"Yeah."
26:29,520;26:30,360;"- Yeah."
26:30,360;26:33,560;"So I don't know if you picked up on this,"
26:33,560;26:36,240;"that I don't know where I heard it"
26:36,240;26:39,100;"or I might have read it in the recap of the game,"
26:39,100;26:42,600;"but did you hear about the Monday night controversy"
26:42,600;26:45,200;"commercial from the week before?"
26:45,200;26:47,960;"Torell Owens and Nicole,"
26:47,960;26:49,920;"Nicolette Sheridan?"
26:49,920;26:51,320;"- No."
26:51,320;26:53,480;"- So apparently this was like the,"
26:53,480;26:55,920;"when Desperate Housewives was coming out."
26:55,920;26:56,760;"- Yep."
26:56,760;26:57,600;"- Or just starting to get popular."
26:57,600;27:03,360;"So there was a commercial, like the intro to the game where they did like a dual advert"
27:03,360;27:09,640;"for the game and desperate housewives where one of the housewives shows up in a towel"
27:09,640;27:15,320;"in the locker room and Tio is there and she's like, ""Don't go on the field."
27:15,320;27:16,320;"Come stay with me."""
27:16,320;27:18,600;"He's like, ""No, I gotta go out there."
27:18,600;27:19,960;"I gotta go out there."""
27:19,960;27:24,560;"And then she like, it's like a backshot and she like drops the towel and she's like,"
27:24,560;27:26,120;"""I guess I'll stay."""
27:26,120;27:32,480;"No. Yeah, yeah. Wow. And like people were like losing their shit."
27:32,480;27:35,800;"Finally. I mean, it's 2004."
27:35,800;27:38,160;"This is a thousand. Yeah."
27:38,160;27:42,080;"And it's right after the Janet Jackson nipple gate, right?"
27:42,080;27:44,200;"Yeah. That was the last Super Bowl."
27:44,200;27:48,160;"So people who already had their antennas up for a bug and NFL."
27:48,160;27:49,080;"Already outraged."
27:49,080;27:51,320;"They're just looking for a reason to be outraged even more."
27:51,320;27:55,800;"Yeah. I wrote down some of the quotes of reactions from different public"
27:55,800;27:57,060;"figures in their pocket."
27:57,060;27:58,600;"Oh, I think I found it."
27:58,600;27:59,760;"You do you want to watch it"
27:59,760;28:00,560;"or first real quick?"
28:00,560;28:00,860;"Yeah."
28:00,860;28:01,060;"Yeah."
28:01,060;28:01,940;"Let me see this thing."
28:01,940;28:02,400;"All right."
28:02,400;28:04,600;"Let me, yeah."
28:04,600;28:07,360;"Let me share this real quick."
28:07,360;28:09,600;"Good job, fact check, boy."
28:09,600;28:11,240;"So what we do."
28:11,240;28:13,280;"What the hell?"
28:13,280;28:14,960;"Oh, are you still there?"
28:14,960;28:17,240;"What am I doing?"
28:17,240;28:18,520;"Am I sharing?"
28:18,520;28:19,040;"Yeah, I can see."
28:19,040;28:20,280;"Yeah, we can see it."
28:20,280;28:22,120;"Hey, look, I'm Greg."
28:22,120;28:23,880;"I'm going to go do a girl, Lou."
28:23,880;28:24,560;"All right."
28:24,560;28:25,640;"Can you hear it?"
28:25,640;28:30,640;"Yeah. Oh my. What are you doing?"
28:30,640;28:34,640;"Yeah. So now this is her taking off her towel."
28:34,640;28:38,640;"Oh, he looks down. It's miles."
28:38,640;28:40,640;"Look at the star."
28:40,640;28:45,640;"Yeah. Now that cut to the other two."
28:45,640;28:48,640;"How is wise watching that? Oh my."
28:48,640;28:51,640;"That."
28:51,640;28:56,640;"- That was a poorly done commercial and ridiculous."
28:56,640;29:02,240;"- You wanna hear some reactions?"
29:02,240;29:03,320;"- Yeah, yeah."
29:03,320;29:05,480;"- John McCain."
29:05,480;29:07,160;"- Oh, that should be good."
29:07,160;29:09,960;"- That disgraceful performance."
29:09,960;29:11,200;"- By whom?"
29:11,200;29:12,040;"- Both of them."
29:12,040;29:13,160;"- Terrible acting."
29:13,160;29:16,400;"- Lovey Smith, head coach of the Bears."
29:16,400;29:18,240;"Pretty close to pornographic."
29:18,240;29:21,040;"- I think that was the idea, Lovey."
29:21,040;29:26,040;"Pat Buchanan noted like Southern old man Republican."
29:26,040;29:28,400;"- Oh yeah."
29:28,400;29:31,080;"- A stinking thing for ABC to do."
29:31,080;29:41,160;"Tony Dungy, Mr. Christian values is pretty upset about it."
29:41,160;29:43,920;"He said we're negotiating a new contract."
29:43,920;29:46,640;"Maybe we don't consider ABC."
29:46,640;29:50,640;"So he's really trying to play some hardball there."
29:50,640;29:54,240;"And Dan Rooney, owner of the Steelers,"
29:54,240;29:56,960;"about the worst thing I've ever seen."
29:56,960;29:59,280;"(laughs)"
29:59,280;30:00,280;"- Oh, Dan."
30:00,280;30:01,420;"- I have a counterpoint."
30:01,420;30:04,520;"- You got a lot coming to you, dude."
30:04,520;30:08,360;"- I have a counterpoint to that though."
30:08,360;30:10,040;"Terrell Owens in that game."
30:10,040;30:14,640;"Eight targets, six catches, 134 yards, three touchdowns."
30:14,640;30:16,480;"They won 49-21."
30:16,480;30:18,200;"- Yeah, and he missed the first quarter."
30:18,200;30:19,040;"(laughs)"
30:19,040;30:20,040;"That's what I was there."
30:20,040;30:21,680;"because I'm late balls out. Good work."
30:21,680;30:29,400;"Yeah. No, it didn't. He got back. And it was just six minutes left and caught a 59 yard touchdown pass from the scoring."
30:29,400;30:31,840;"Didn't even take that long."
30:31,840;30:37,880;"Yeah. Also, they're like, oh, he's like the game starts in 10 minutes."
30:37,880;30:41,520;"I mean, you can't see it, but every single jersey is still in the locker."
30:41,520;30:45,840;"There's a green screen of like a locker."
30:46,720;30:49,280;"They're both green-screened in and they're trying to like mush it together."
30:49,280;30:50,160;"It's just really good."
30:50,160;30:53,560;"Yeah, it had everybody in Tizzy."
30:53,560;30:58,320;"It had people saying it was racist because it was a trope."
30:58,320;31:02,000;"And then it was racist because it was a white woman and a black man."
31:02,000;31:04,000;"So it was like, you got both angles there."
31:04,000;31:05,240;"It was a whole big thing."
31:05,240;31:06,640;"Everybody was pissed."
31:06,640;31:10,480;"Really hit the sweet spot."
31:10,480;31:10,760;"Yeah."
31:10,760;31:11,840;"I thought you knew you did it well."
31:11,840;31:12,720;"Everybody off."
31:12,720;31:15,240;"Yeah."
31:16,400;31:19,080;"So yeah, John Grudent or John, sorry, look at this."
31:19,080;31:19,960;"That's probably why."
31:19,960;31:21,280;"And John Madden"
31:21,280;31:24,080;"commentated for this game."
31:24,080;31:25,760;"I actually wrote down a quote here"
31:25,760;31:28,520;"that I think would really piss you off Andy."
31:28,520;31:29,640;"Yes."
31:29,640;31:32,160;"John Madden talking about the referee said,"
31:32,160;31:35,520;"Bill Levy, one of the best refs in the league."
31:35,520;31:37,840;"So not only is it a great commentator,"
31:37,840;31:39,720;"it's a great referee."
31:39,720;31:41,400;"And glad I missed this game."
31:41,400;31:42,200;"Yeah."
31:42,200;31:44,080;"You would have fucking had an aneurysm."
31:44,080;31:46,840;"(both laughing)"
31:46,840;31:49,960;"- Perfect."
31:49,960;31:53,080;"- Another jaw or another madnessm."
31:53,080;31:54,720;"They were talking about Belichick style,"
31:54,720;31:56,240;"and I think they were probably ahead of the curve here"
31:56,240;31:58,880;"talking about how he like always wears the sweater."
31:58,880;32:04,040;"He said Belichick looks like everybody's 11th grade"
32:04,040;32:06,120;"gym teacher, which I thought was pretty spot on."
32:06,120;32:06,960;"- Oh, dad on."
32:06,960;32:08,120;"- Oh, speaking of which,"
32:08,120;32:12,760;"I've been searching the internet for a toddler sized"
32:12,760;32:14,480;"Belichick hoodie can't find one yet."
32:14,480;32:15,600;"So if you find one, let me know."
32:15,600;32:16,440;"- Really?"
32:16,440;32:17,760;"- Yeah."
32:17,760;32:20,840;"- You just get a regular one and cut the sleeves off now."
32:20,840;32:22,400;"- Well, it's not for me, Gregory."
32:22,400;32:26,520;"- Yeah, but you can't just find a regular toddler-sized"
32:26,520;32:27,920;"sweatshirt."
32:27,920;32:28,920;"Not the right color gray."
32:28,920;32:30,320;"You know, you need that like dark gray,"
32:30,320;32:34,160;"the original Belichick gray."
32:34,160;32:35,000;"- Man, I feel you."
32:35,000;32:36,600;"- So if you find one, let me know."
32:36,600;32:39,920;"- Another Maddenism."
32:40,840;32:47,120;"a benched earthwind morland. Oh no. In the first quarter and he said earth wind got fired."
32:47,120;32:53,200;"I was not bad. Why is the Hall of Famer? That's a Birmingham. That's Birmingham. That's"
32:53,200;33:01,160;"great there. Yeah. That's not too shabby. Yeah. So, um, you want to talk about the game,"
33:01,160;33:07,320;"Steve? Want to give me your input? First play of the game or something like that. You see"
33:07,320;33:10,360;"sack by rookie Jared Allen."
33:10,360;33:11,700;"- Mm-hmm."
33:11,700;33:13,260;"- Oh, rookie Jared Allen, Jesus."
33:13,260;33:14,600;"- Yeah, rookie Jared Allen."
33:14,600;33:17,540;"- This is gonna be one of his first games."
33:17,540;33:19,680;"It's kinda crazy."
33:19,680;33:21,600;"- Well, he has 11th, I would think."
33:21,600;33:23,320;"- Yeah, crazy to see those guys so young"
33:23,320;33:25,720;"and then you see him coming before, you know?"
33:25,720;33:26,560;"- Yeah, yeah."
33:26,560;33:29,200;"- Why in the-- - I know."
33:29,200;33:30,320;"- 69 of 'em."
33:30,320;33:32,320;"(laughing)"
33:32,320;33:33,680;"- You hear about that?"
33:33,680;33:34,840;"- No, of course."
33:34,840;33:36,920;"- I get like an open to restaurant."
33:36,920;33:39,680;"I don't know, it might have been in Kansas City or Minnesota, one of the two."
33:39,680;33:46,280;"And he, like it was like all branded, like 69, because that was his number."
33:46,280;33:46,760;"Yeah."
33:46,760;33:52,680;"And I guess they're like logo or informal logo was, ""Wine 'em, Dynam, 69 'em."""
33:52,680;33:54,520;"Yeah."
33:54,520;33:56,800;"Well, so he was basically grog before grog."
33:56,800;33:57,800;"Oh, yeah."
33:57,800;33:59,920;"Motherfucker literally picked number 69."
33:59,920;34:01,640;"He had the mullet."
34:01,640;34:02,680;"Yeah."
34:03,960;34:07,560;"And I actually looked on his Wikipedia to see if he had done anything funny."
34:07,560;34:11,040;"And I saw legal issues and I was like, oh, hell yeah."
34:11,040;34:17,400;"Turns out they're the most typical Jared Aaron legal issues you could imagine."
34:17,400;34:18,360;"He's got three D.U."
34:18,360;34:19,240;"Eyes and that's it."
34:19,240;34:23,680;"I was waiting for a drunken disorderly, but yeah, that makes sense."
34:23,680;34:28,880;"Oh, it's tough though."
34:28,880;34:30,480;"I never remember him as a chief."
34:30,480;34:31,600;"I just remember him as a Viking."
34:32,200;34:34,560;"I remember the chief more than I'm making."
34:34,560;34:36,600;"No, I just remember his wife."
34:36,600;34:40,000;"And that he was just supposed to be one of the prolific trash"
34:40,000;34:41,560;"talkers, I believe."
34:41,560;34:43,080;"Jared Allen."
34:43,080;34:44,320;"Prolific what?"
34:44,320;34:45,520;"Trash talker."
34:45,520;34:47,080;"Oh, yeah."
34:47,080;34:48,680;"He was always miked up."
34:48,680;34:50,360;"Do you know what his celebration was?"
34:50,360;34:51,760;"Remember the--"
34:51,760;34:52,240;"No, no."
34:52,240;34:53,000;"What was it?"
34:53,000;34:55,120;"Remember?"
34:55,120;34:57,240;"He was doing every time he sacked."
34:57,240;34:58,320;"Yeah, what was it supposed to be?"
34:58,320;35:00,320;"I thought he used to be stirring the pot"
35:00,320;35:04,120;"And then like a hoot, but he's tie in the cattle."
35:04,120;35:05,840;"You know, what he's doing?"
35:05,840;35:06,640;"You tie a lot of."
35:06,640;35:08,200;"- I just like got it."
35:08,200;35:09,040;"- I just like got it."
35:09,040;35:11,520;"- They like roll his hands like a false start motion"
35:11,520;35:13,520;"and then throw it over a shoulder or something."
35:13,520;35:14,680;"He was doing out there."
35:14,680;35:17,160;"- That was a dick joke."
35:17,160;35:18,000;"- Number six."
35:18,000;35:18,840;"- He's pretty sweet."
35:18,840;35:20,600;"He's got a lot of personality."
35:20,600;35:21,840;"- Yes, for sure."
35:21,840;35:22,680;"- Yeah."
35:22,680;35:23,680;"- He is good."
35:23,680;35:25,840;"- He also had one season with 22 sacks."
35:25,840;35:26,680;"- Yeah, so I'm sorry."
35:26,680;35:28,080;"- Yeah."
35:28,080;35:33,460;"Second second most in a single season behind straight hand also TJ"
35:33,460;35:39,180;"Well, I might break that this year you see that yeah, what's he got no I think he's at like 21"
35:39,180;35:51,920;"Same with Cooper cup breaking the reception your eyes record. No shout out Cooper cup. He's about to win me a thousand dollars"
35:51,920;35:57,440;"Love that boy"
35:57,440;35:59,440;"They mean Jamar chase."
35:59,440;36:01,440;"We're not talking about phases."
36:01,440;36:04,440;"Come on, just let me tell you what my team is."
36:04,440;36:06,440;"I call them the Beatles."
36:06,440;36:12,440;"Cooper cup, Devante Adams, Jamar chase and Travis Kelsey."
36:12,440;36:14,440;"Like tell me that's not a act."
36:14,440;36:16,440;"That's a spot."
36:16,440;36:17,440;"Yeah."
36:17,440;36:19,440;"Mine was a Kyler Murray and CMC."
36:19,440;36:21,440;"Oh, yeah."
36:21,440;36:24,440;"And the wheels fell the fuck off like we can."
36:24,440;36:25,440;"Yeah."
36:25,440;36:28,760;"I mean, one league, it's a double keeper."
36:28,760;36:33,960;"I've had Seguan Barkley and Christian McCaffrey for like four straight years and they both"
36:33,960;36:35,680;"have fucked me every year."
36:35,680;36:36,680;"Every year."
36:36,680;36:39,320;"And then every season I'm like, well, you know, it's still loud."
36:39,320;36:40,320;"Yeah."
36:40,320;36:42,240;"There's a lot of potential and then they fucked me again."
36:42,240;36:43,400;"It's my fault now."
36:43,400;36:45,600;"It's my fault, you know, officially."
36:45,600;36:46,600;"Yeah."
36:46,600;36:47,600;"Yeah."
36:47,600;36:49,240;"All right."
36:49,240;36:50,720;"So Pat's come into this game."
36:50,720;36:53,320;"So we'll give you the final score."
36:53,320;37:00,120;"That's ended up winning this by eight points 27 to 19 probably not as close as the score indicates"
37:00,120;37:04,060;"It was pretty competitive through about three quarters"
37:04,060;37:08,240;"Obviously the Chiefs have a great offense, so they kind of have that firepower"
37:08,240;37:10,500;"But they're missing priest homes, which I think was a"
37:10,500;37:15,940;"Was a big part of this game and it was like a lot of talking points from the commentator, so"
37:15,940;37:22,700;"So I actually did I did a deep dive a little bit of a shallow dive on priest homes"
37:22,700;37:25,300;"before I did the John Geron thing."
37:25,300;37:26,460;"- Shabbat."
37:26,460;37:28,500;"- He's gotta be the most unlucky"
37:28,500;37:32,620;"or like underrated running back in the NFL, I think."
37:32,620;37:35,540;"- I got a question before you jump in."
37:35,540;37:37,980;"Do we know why his name's Priest?"
37:37,980;37:39,140;"Is that his name?"
37:39,140;37:39,980;"- Yes."
37:39,980;37:41,820;"- No, that his name is Priest Anthony Holmes."
37:41,820;37:43,580;"He's named Priest Holmes."
37:43,580;37:45,300;"He used to go by Anthony early though."
37:45,300;37:47,700;"Like he never, he didn't go by Priest until like,"
37:47,700;37:49,060;"I think he's in college."
37:49,060;37:50,380;"- Yeah."
37:50,380;37:52,980;"But he, is he religious?"
37:52,980;37:53,980;"- He's like, he's happy."
37:53,980;37:55,820;"- I'm assuming his family is."
37:55,820;37:58,940;"- Is that, or are they wanting to grow up to be a dittler?"
37:58,940;38:03,380;"- Well, raise in a military household apparently."
38:03,380;38:04,260;"- Oh, okay."
38:04,260;38:05,920;"- So yeah, a little bit."
38:05,920;38:09,980;"But in college, he took him a while,"
38:09,980;38:13,980;"but eventually got the starting job"
38:13,980;38:18,860;"in University of Texas, the starting running back,"
38:18,860;38:19,860;"that was killing it."
38:19,860;38:24,260;"And then missed the 95 season with knee injury,"
38:24,260;38:26,700;"allowing the emergence of future Heisman Trophy winner,"
38:26,700;38:29,260;"Ricky Williams to take over the starter."
38:29,260;38:30,940;"And, you know, never recovered."
38:30,940;38:36,620;"Then got drafted by the Ravens and started fourth"
38:36,620;38:39,580;"behind Ben Morris, Ernest Biner and J Graham."
38:39,580;38:44,220;"Eventually won the starting job a couple years later,"
38:44,220;38:46,500;"only, and then, you know,"
38:46,500;38:48,500;"had his first thousand-yard rushing"
38:48,500;38:52,500;"year season, including a 200-yard game."
38:52,500;38:57,620;"And then two years later, he was supplanted by"
38:57,620;39:00,140;"rookie running back to Mount Williams, which is why I got"
39:00,140;39:01,060;"trained to the Chiefs."
39:01,060;39:02,700;"- To Mount Lewis, right?"
39:02,700;39:04,580;"- Yeah, what do I say?"
39:04,580;39:05,980;"- Williams."
39:05,980;39:07,340;"- Oh, to Mount Lewis, yes, sir."
39:07,340;39:08,500;"- You guys are terrible with names."
39:08,500;39:09,660;"- Got Ricky on the brain."
39:09,660;39:13,700;"- Yeah, so he gets injured in college and Ricky Williams"
39:13,700;39:21,380;"six-hole form and then runs for a thousand yards in after beating out three guys. Four"
39:21,380;39:28,780;"actually because you behind Eric Tourette at one point. Remember Eric Tourette? I do."
39:28,780;39:32,580;"Runs for 200 yards and then gets replaced by rookie Jamal Lewis before going to the"
39:32,580;39:38,900;"Chiefs and setting records for touchdowns in a season and such."
39:38,900;39:42,580;"And then get injured in 2005."
39:42,580;39:49,740;"It was cut short by an injury to his spinal column from a tackle by Sean Merriman, which"
39:49,740;39:52,620;"sounds fucking terrible."
39:52,620;39:55,620;"Replaced by Larry Johnson, who would then take over."
39:55,620;39:58,460;"It's starting spot and you would never recover."
39:58,460;40:02,820;"Yeah, that was like an interesting part of this game too, because Larry Johnson's on this"
40:02,820;40:05,700;"team, but he wasn't playing."
40:05,700;40:08,660;"So they were starting Derek Blalock who sucked."
40:08,660;40:10,260;"Yeah, I remember Derek Blalock."
40:10,260;40:14,500;"It was like, yeah, he had like 10 caries for 20 yards at one point in the game."
40:14,500;40:19,500;"And the best part is this is peak Corey Dunich, who is the best running back we've had in"
40:19,500;40:20,500;"our lifetimes."
40:20,500;40:21,500;"Yeah."
40:21,500;40:22,500;"Yeah."
40:22,500;40:25,900;"But apparently for Mio hated Larry Johnson."
40:25,900;40:26,900;"Really?"
40:26,900;40:27,900;"Yeah."
40:27,900;40:32,380;"Like he didn't want to draft Larry Johnson, but he like wanted offensive player."
40:32,380;40:33,980;"And then they drafted him anyways."
40:33,980;40:42,020;"And then like he came in and they said, I saw a quote Vermeel said he needs to grow"
40:42,020;40:46,420;"up and take the diapers off because he wasn't like working hard enough in practice or something"
40:46,420;40:47,420;"to do."
40:47,420;40:48,420;"Yeah."
40:48,420;40:51,740;"So they show him he's like standing on the sidelines in these games and then he just"
40:51,740;40:53,100;"like didn't get any touches."
40:53,100;40:59,540;"But once play lock gets hurt, they have to play Johnson and then he just like tears"
40:59,540;41:00,540;"it out."
41:00,540;41:01,540;"Just goes off."
41:01,540;41:04,540;"And then for male STN, I'll talk to Zach and go back."
41:04,540;41:07,300;"(laughing)"
41:07,300;41:08,340;"- Goodness."
41:08,340;41:09,500;"- I love that."
41:09,500;41:10,320;"- Yeah."
41:10,320;41:12,340;"- I'm blue."
41:12,340;41:14,260;"- Madden had a great point, another plus"
41:14,260;41:15,860;"for the commentator's Andy."
41:15,860;41:18,300;"- Love it, it's John Madden, talk him up."
41:18,300;41:20,620;"- He was talking about how the Patriots"
41:20,620;41:22,140;"have replaced that bubble screen game"
41:22,140;41:24,580;"that they've always done, even the screen game"
41:24,580;41:25,980;"with just Corey Dillon."
41:25,980;41:26,820;"- Yeah, yeah."
41:26,820;41:27,660;"- Now they don't even need to run,"
41:27,660;41:28,860;"it's taken over that part of it often,"
41:28,860;41:31,260;"so not all Tom Brady's doing is sort of throwing it deep."
41:31,260;41:31,760;"Yeah."
41:31,760;41:33,260;"Yeah, actually."
41:33,260;41:34,260;"It's awesome to see."
41:34,260;41:36,140;"Corey Dillon is super good in this game."
41:36,140;41:38,700;"And recently, all these games he's been playing in this year,"
41:38,700;41:40,100;"he's just running over people."
41:40,100;41:42,220;"Didn't Corey Dillon fumble in this game?"
41:42,220;41:43,260;"Like late."
41:43,260;41:44,460;"Yep."
41:44,460;41:46,060;"Kind of kept him in it."
41:46,060;41:47,700;"Yeah, he scored twice."
41:47,700;41:49,260;"So this is actually interesting."
41:49,260;41:51,780;"This is first Monday Night Football game ever."
41:51,780;41:52,540;"Yeah."
41:52,540;41:54,100;"Because he's been on the bangle for so long,"
41:54,100;41:55,620;"we just don't play."
41:55,620;41:56,660;"It's awesome."
41:56,660;41:57,180;"Great."
41:57,180;42:00,260;"And he's at his like eight or ninth year at this point?"
42:00,260;42:01,020;"Yeah, probably."
42:01,020;42:01,860;"- Yeah, yeah."
42:01,860;42:03,940;"The twilight of his career."
42:03,940;42:05,660;"- Man, shitty teens, huh?"
42:05,660;42:06,900;"- It's not even shitty teens,"
42:06,900;42:08,300;"it's just teams no one cares about"
42:08,300;42:10,300;"'cause we still see the giants"
42:10,300;42:12,780;"and they're fucking terrible."
42:12,780;42:14,740;"- Yeah, at least once a year, if not twice."
42:14,740;42:18,540;"- Yeah, so he squared twice,"
42:18,540;42:21,860;"he had 26 carries, 98 yards, two touchdowns."
42:21,860;42:24,300;"He had a late fumble that like,"
42:24,300;42:28,140;"they could have put the nail in the coffin"
42:28,140;42:30,620;"and he fumbled inside the five."
42:30,620;42:34,180;"Yeah. He did good on that last day, the six men offense on there and they"
42:34,180;42:36,660;"chewed a bunch of time up and we'll see through him."
42:36,660;42:39,580;"So like right after I came back to him and he played pretty well in that"
42:39,580;42:43,780;"last drive, keep a field goal drive."
42:43,780;42:47,860;"But this offense is so balanced right now. Like, yeah,"
42:47,860;42:51,140;"it seems like they were getting like plays from everybody because like David"
42:51,140;42:52,860;"Patton still there."
42:52,860;42:56,060;"He had like a couple of big plays. Daniel Graham had plays."
42:56,060;42:59,700;"Dion Branch who came back first game since we"
42:59,700;43:04,100;"six catches 105 yards. You went off like you had a sick touchdown."
43:04,100;43:07,620;"Yeah, I haven't seen him in ages. Oh, yeah, that's already Dylan."
43:07,620;43:11,020;"So it's like they were kind of firing on all cylinders here."
43:11,020;43:16,060;"This is some of the peak offense of Patriots. Like I'm Brady, you know,"
43:16,060;43:18,860;"the balance like he said is really the important part."
43:18,860;43:20,740;"They're definitely better than the past game later on."
43:20,740;43:24,380;"They're never this good in the run game, you know, like Lawrence Moroni was"
43:24,380;43:27,580;"supposed to be this sort of back and just he just never was or anything like that."
43:27,860;43:37,020;"Yeah, I think it's because of Dylan because Dylan really like opens up a lot of things because they have to play that. Yeah, you can't just sell out for the passer or something like that."
43:37,020;43:38,220;"You can't respect that."
43:38,220;43:39,740;"He's a big boy."
43:39,740;43:41,380;"Yeah."
43:41,380;43:45,140;"He's like similar to a Mondra, like in the building."
43:45,140;43:46,420;"Mondra the giant."
43:46,420;43:48,220;"I think he's thicker than that."
43:48,220;43:49,100;"Oh, yeah."
43:49,100;43:51,460;"They're all word gigantic shoulder pads back then too."
43:51,460;43:52,700;"That's true to you."
43:52,700;43:55,300;"I love the way Remondra Stevenson runs."
43:56,260;44:00,100;"It was like he's falling down the entire run, but still ends up getting six or seven yards."
44:00,100;44:00,540;"Yeah."
44:00,540;44:02,340;"Just stumbling the entire way."
44:02,340;44:03,700;"The Garrett Blunt of man."
44:03,700;44:04,420;"Yeah."
44:04,420;44:10,660;"So defense did end up giving up 19 points, a couple big place."
44:10,660;44:15,260;"I think it's probably to do it with a tie law and Tyrone pool being out and then"
44:15,260;44:18,820;"they've benched earth wind and then Randall Gay got hurt."
44:18,820;44:20,900;"So then they brought her when to back out."
44:20,900;44:23,180;"No, it was a saunty that got hurt."
44:23,180;44:24,340;"Oh, was it?"
44:24,540;44:25,380;"- They had like, you were right,"
44:25,380;44:26,740;"and actually you could hear him like screaming,"
44:26,740;44:27,580;"it didn't sound good."
44:27,580;44:28,740;"I'm with that."
44:28,740;44:29,580;"- No point."
44:29,580;44:35,460;"- And then Gonzalez was kind of killing him too."
44:35,460;44:37,620;"- Well, they were like selling out to stop Tony"
44:37,620;44:39,220;"and leaving the corner sort of on islands"
44:39,220;44:40,460;"and they were just getting killed."
44:40,460;44:42,660;"He was just throwing over the top of him for big plays."
44:42,660;44:43,500;"- Mm."
44:43,500;44:46,220;"- And Gonzalez was still getting him too,"
44:46,220;44:48,060;"but they couldn't run the ball at all."
44:48,060;44:49,580;"And like the Yars for Carri was super low."
44:49,580;44:52,460;"I remember it seemed 1.9 yards for Carri."
44:53,820;44:55,940;"19 carries 58 yards."
44:55,940;44:56,780;"- No."
44:56,780;44:58,860;"- So they're shutting the run down."
44:58,860;44:59,860;"- Hot, great."
44:59,860;45:02,580;"- Johnny Morton, 107 yards receiving."
45:02,580;45:04,940;"Eddie Kennison 99 yards receiving."
45:04,940;45:07,100;"And Tony Gonzalez 86."
45:07,100;45:09,300;"- Was there any Dante Hall settings in this?"
45:09,300;45:14,180;"- No, he didn't like flash that much."
45:14,180;45:15,020;"They kicked it to him too."
45:15,020;45:16,820;"They weren't afraid of him."
45:16,820;45:19,580;"- That's surprising 'cause I think this might have been"
45:19,580;45:21,340;"peak Dante Hall as well."
45:21,340;45:23,140;"- I think that's what I'm trying to reach, 2004."
45:23,140;45:28,500;"comes off. 2004. They said he had three returns last year, actually."
45:28,500;45:36,580;"Yeah. 2003, he had two punt returns for touchdowns, two kick returns for touchdowns."
45:36,580;45:41,860;"2004, he had another two kick returns for touchdowns. And he had the most kick return"
45:41,860;45:47,620;"yards he's ever had, 1700. You enjoy stick. Human joystick. Ex-factor."
45:49,220;45:51,140;"So back to like the balance thing."
45:51,140;45:52,780;"I just remember that I did take it."
45:52,780;45:54,740;"They had a graphic on the game."
45:54,740;46:01,140;"So through the nine games so far, they have 11 players with a sack, 14 players"
46:01,140;46:06,060;"with a takeaway, 15 players with a reception and 11 players with a touchdown."
46:06,060;46:06,860;"Fucking."
46:06,860;46:07,260;"Yeah."
46:07,260;46:07,860;"Yeah."
46:07,860;46:12,060;"So the second team in the last 20 years with 10 plus players in each category."
46:12,060;46:13,540;"That's crazy."
46:13,540;46:18,020;"So, yeah, contributions from everywhere."
46:18,420;46:21,180;"Literally. Yeah. How does that stat hold up now?"
46:21,180;46:23,820;"It's a good question, Steve."
46:23,820;46:26,580;"I wish we had a stat check guy. Yeah."
46:26,580;46:28,660;"That's a tough stat check right there."
46:28,660;46:30,420;"Oh, yes. Sometimes not that easy, Andy."
46:30,420;46:33,060;"And people just throw shit and see what happens."
46:33,060;46:36,020;"Greg, ours are usually asking you to Google shit."
46:36,020;46:41,020;"You'll figure it out."
46:41,020;46:43,500;"Yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to do that."
46:43,500;46:45,660;"You use Twitter, you Twitter shit."
46:45,660;46:47,180;"I'm not going to do that."
46:47,180;46:47,940;"Just Twitter it."
46:47,940;46:49,580;"I'm not going to do it."
46:49,580;46:51,180;"That's being very good at Greg."
46:51,180;46:51,740;"Good job."
46:51,740;46:52,300;"Yes, he is."
46:52,300;46:54,300;"I'm saying you you welcome."
46:54,300;47:03,300;"Also, the Patriots tie the record for the consecutive games scoring first."
47:03,300;47:05,900;"Is the 15th straight game scoring first?"
47:05,900;47:06,740;"Yes."
47:06,740;47:08,020;"She's pretty impressive."
47:08,020;47:09,300;"Tie the record, right?"
47:09,300;47:11,220;"Broke the record."
47:11,220;47:12,420;"Oh, that broke the record?"
47:12,420;47:12,660;"OK."
47:12,660;47:13,940;"Damn."
47:13,940;47:16,060;"15 games in a row."
47:16,060;47:17,060;"Yeah."
47:17,060;47:19,060;"You guys got any other notes?"
47:19,060;47:22,380;"Well, I mean the game ended there with"
47:22,380;47:25,460;"a pretty sweet play"
47:25,460;47:28,940;"Their whole last drive was terrible because I did get the ball back with a couple minutes"
47:28,940;47:32,340;"Oh, I saw this sounds bad. Yeah, my eight points and they had a couple of"
47:32,340;47:35,660;"Their first down from the 20 or so with no timeouts"
47:35,660;47:40,500;"And then they just kind of squandered it and will he finish you with that pretty sweet sack"
47:42,260;47:49,520;"Buried him as we body the offensive lineman to one of those 15 yards this day and age sort of sex"
47:49,520;47:55,820;"No, yeah, yeah, I definitely fell on him body weight. Yeah, definitely a body weight file. Yeah"
47:55,820;47:59,340;"That's just ruining the game. I tell you what"
47:59,340;48:07,660;"Yeah, they need to like in the top change how many yards it is or something like or like give like"
48:07,660;48:10,580;"you know, they change it from like roughing the kicker to like"
48:11,220;48:16,980;"Contact with the kick like they need to do because they can't just keep giving away 15s for nothing, you know"
48:16,980;48:20,740;"On a judgment call it's the topic. What is the worst though?"
48:20,740;48:24,980;"Because they don't even know they don't they haven't even decided what tons I get to say just make it up as they go"
48:24,980;48:26,900;"No, yeah"
48:26,900;48:29,300;"Garbage, I wouldn't be surprised if they get rid of taunting"
48:29,300;48:33,620;"But they're not going to get rid of roughing the pastor so they need to figure it out. That's true"
48:33,620;48:38,100;"And right now they're just like they have no idea what they're doing. It's like anything flag"
48:38,820;48:40,820;"I'm sorry, are we complaining about the refs here?"
48:40,820;48:42,820;"I'm complaining about current day refs."
48:42,820;48:44,820;"You're doing a pretty good job Greg."
48:44,820;48:46,820;"I like the refs."
48:46,820;48:48,820;"We're complaining about the league, not the refs."
48:48,820;48:50,820;"You're doing a good job as B&D."
48:50,820;48:52,820;"It's not their fault."
48:52,820;48:54,820;"It's the rules fault."
48:54,820;48:56,820;"That's right. Not what the taunting is not."
48:56,820;48:58,820;"Making the up is a good one."
48:58,820;49:00,820;"You don't want to call taunting penalty, but you know,"
49:00,820;49:02,820;"ginger's right. It's a hard job."
49:02,820;49:04,820;"Cut that, cut them a break."
49:04,820;49:06,820;"They're humans."
49:06,820;49:09,220;"They're humans. This is part time. They should be"
49:09,220;49:12,020;"fine. He's the best referee in the league right now."
49:12,020;49:17,620;"Oh, believey. Oh, all right. He used to be a fireman."
49:17,620;49:21,860;"You see a fireman. Well, yeah, he's good under pressure."
49:21,860;49:26,100;"Has to John Mantle me. He's a fireman and then he retired."
49:26,100;49:29,620;"And now he's a referee, which was kind of interesting."
49:29,620;49:33,220;"That's very interesting. Thanks for that step."
49:33,220;49:35,220;"All right. Want to do best of worst? Yeah."
49:35,220;49:42,580;"He also, when he was talking about Larry Johnson, he said, they haven't, they haven't pulled the"
49:42,580;49:49,780;"cork on him yet. As in like, they haven't like let him play yet, which I thought was like,"
49:49,780;49:51,860;"you know, I don't heard anyone say that. I thought it was interesting."
49:51,860;49:52,900;"The game model did that."
49:52,900;49:54,580;"That's a wine stop there right there."
49:54,580;49:56,900;"He's a pretty well spoken guy."
49:56,900;49:58,100;"Oh, yeah, definitely."
49:58,100;49:58,740;"Yeah."
49:58,740;49:59,220;"Yeah."
49:59,220;50:02,180;"So you guys watch the documentary?"
50:02,180;50:02,980;"Not yet."
50:02,980;50:04,340;"It's on my list, though."
50:04,340;50:08,140;"Homework for next week. We'll loop back around and talk some some"
50:08,140;50:10,780;"Okay"
50:10,780;50:15,180;"All right, let's start with best and worse then I got a best on a mat in there"
50:15,180;50:19,620;"Give it to me Steve. They're talking about what Belichick looks at for employers"
50:19,620;50:21,620;"He knows like all like the intangible stuff"
50:21,620;50:26,820;"Then in like even on that list is how they interact with the equipment guy and John's like well"
50:26,820;50:29,140;"I never really cared about that but all the other stuff for sure"
50:29,140;50:32,300;"Yeah, that was funny"
50:32,300;50:39,420;"1000. One of my worst is Matt Light. He was just not good. He hasn't been good at all."
50:39,420;50:45,020;"This his entire career up for this point. He's not okay. He just struggles with speed"
50:45,020;50:49,260;"Rogers always has. How is it he is? You know, just like you saw Jared Allen earlier and"
50:49,260;50:51,980;"he's like, he's gonna be really good. And you can see that in Matt Light, but man, he sucks"
50:51,980;50:56,940;"at the beginning of his career. He struggled a bit. It was always against like certain"
50:56,940;51:01,980;"people too. Like he would have just a bad game where the entire game was terrible. But then"
51:01,980;51:05,660;"you don't hear from him for three weeks. But Frini would eat him up. Oh,"
51:05,660;51:10,220;"Frini would eat him up all the time. Oh, he was like, so bad. Yeah,"
51:10,220;51:14,620;"it's rough. I tell you speed rushers. That's best was a Tully"
51:14,620;51:22,540;"Benticane kick return. Oh shit. Yeah. And I said, Hey, that's a,"
51:22,540;51:26,500;"that's the guy Kelly credit card, swiped in the ass. Yeah."
51:30,180;51:30,820;"That's what I'm saying."
51:30,820;51:32,620;"We can get Tullion."
51:32,620;51:35,940;"So here is side of that story."
51:35,940;51:38,260;"Well, I mean, he shows up to house parties in Maine."
51:38,260;51:40,220;"So I don't think he's like--"
51:40,220;51:40,480;"I know."
51:40,480;51:41,900;"I just want to hear from his perspective."
51:41,900;51:42,260;"That's all."
51:42,260;51:48,540;"Tully."
51:48,540;51:51,180;"All right, you got some best of worse?"
51:51,180;51:52,500;"Andy, you're looking great."
51:52,500;51:53,380;"Greg is driving this."
51:53,380;51:54,140;"Get off."
51:54,140;51:54,980;"Greg is driving this."
51:54,980;51:57,620;"I'll give you some best of worse."
51:57,620;51:58,860;"Please learn it to one of each."
51:59,780;52:01,900;"[LAUGHTER]"
52:01,900;52:02,880;"My best is just--"
52:02,880;52:04,180;"He is going to watch the game, Greg."
52:04,180;52:05,720;"He doesn't even have one to give."
52:05,720;52:06,660;"My best--"
52:06,660;52:07,500;"You're making it up on the spot."
52:07,500;52:09,380;"We're flying about some random player."
52:09,380;52:09,760;"That's right."
52:09,760;52:12,580;"My best has nothing to do with this game."
52:12,580;52:16,440;"It's Dante Hall's YouTube highlights."
52:16,440;52:18,420;"That's true, those are electric."
52:18,420;52:18,780;"Those are."
52:18,780;52:20,880;"Yeah, we'll link him in the show notes."
52:20,880;52:21,900;"It's worth the watch."
52:21,900;52:23,700;"It's amazing."
52:23,700;52:24,300;"There's one--"
52:24,300;52:25,540;"The human joystick."
52:25,540;52:27,440;"The one where he runs backwards."
52:27,440;52:27,900;"Yeah."
52:27,900;52:29,660;"- Yeah, he has a big loop back around."
52:29,660;52:31,780;"- That one's better than kills."
52:31,780;52:36,780;"- Who else you got on that list of like best YouTube guys?"
52:36,780;52:38,820;"- Barry Sanders for sure."
52:38,820;52:40,220;"- Barry Sanders."
52:40,220;52:43,620;"- There's like a list of 100 best Barry Sanders run"
52:43,620;52:47,780;"and they're all like top runs from anybody else."
52:47,780;52:48,860;"It's like YouTube on."
52:48,860;52:49,860;"- It's not true."
52:49,860;52:51,020;"- He's got a 100 level."
52:51,020;52:53,820;"- What was the guy that played for the Saints"
52:53,820;52:56,620;"that won the highest minute USC?"
52:56,620;52:57,660;"Oh, Reggie Bush."
52:57,660;53:00,820;"Reggie Bush's calling chileights are ridiculous."
53:00,820;53:02,060;"I'm scared."
53:02,060;53:02,900;"Yeah. Yeah."
53:02,900;53:03,380;"Yeah."
53:03,380;53:04,980;"You just making people look silly."
53:04,980;53:08,100;"Actually Barry says that too."
53:08,100;53:11,460;"D.L. Lewis's calling chileights."
53:11,460;53:12,100;"Seeing good."
53:12,100;53:12,300;"Yeah."
53:12,300;53:14,180;"Those were dirty."
53:14,180;53:14,540;"See that?"
53:14,540;53:17,420;"That's a bit of a deep cut."
53:17,420;53:19,220;"Randy Moss viking."
53:19,220;53:20,180;"Randy Moss viking."
53:20,180;53:21,100;"Sileights are insane."
53:21,100;53:21,980;"Eddie, Eddie, Randy Moss."
53:21,980;53:22,640;"Hylights."
53:22,640;53:23,180;"Eddie, Eddie Moss."
53:23,180;53:24,700;"Even his college highlights are dirty."
53:24,700;53:33,440;"But there's something about the Vikings ones where it's just so raw, like the talent is so like like it just compared to the other players in the field."
53:33,440;53:42,020;"You're like, this guy is not in the same way. He's not here with. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can so fun to watch Lawrence Taylor to. I would say."
53:42,020;53:50,240;"Just just throw people around like rag dolls. Yeah. That's a good one. So yeah. I'll have to put a list together. I think."
53:50,660;53:54,580;"So who do we have we had Dante Hall, Reggie Bush at USC."
53:54,580;53:56,740;"- Hall, Reggie Bush."
53:56,740;53:59,180;"- D.O.S.C."
53:59,180;54:02,080;"- Neon Lewis, Dion Lewis."
54:02,080;54:05,460;"- Rainy Moss."
54:05,460;54:08,820;"Oh, Barry Sanders."
54:08,820;54:17,220;"- McGruff, what a, McGuffie, remember McGuffie?"
54:17,220;54:18,940;"- It was a hilarious nickname, right?"
54:18,940;54:19,900;"The French guy?"
54:19,900;54:22,480;"Isn't there your college quarterback?"
54:22,480;54:24,240;"That was like huge."
54:24,240;54:26,500;"Oh, you're talking about the hefty lefty."
54:26,500;54:28,040;"No, that's somebody there."
54:28,040;54:29,600;"That's Jared Lorenz and Lorenz."
54:29,600;54:31,600;"Let him on there because his highlights are hilarious."
54:31,600;54:32,600;"Yeah."
54:32,600;54:34,600;"[LAUGHTER]"
54:34,600;54:39,340;"And McGuffie was like this white kid from Texas that was like, it was like Pee Wee"
54:39,340;54:41,840;"football and he was just like dominant."
54:41,840;54:42,840;"Oh, that dude."
54:42,840;54:45,440;"This is like when YouTube first came out."
54:45,440;54:46,440;"Yes, he has."
54:46,440;54:47,440;"He has like super holes."
54:47,440;54:48,440;"Yeah."
54:48,440;54:49,440;"Oh, shit."
54:49,440;54:53,920;"You know that had a that he's the first guy to hurdle somebody, a defender."
54:53,920;54:56,560;"Sam, a guffy or something like that."
54:56,560;54:59,280;"Sam, a guffy."
54:59,280;55:01,360;"We're going to write it down and save and we'll find him."
55:01,360;55:04,800;"That one might not make the list of links, but we'll try."
55:04,800;55:06,280;"Just wait."
55:06,280;55:08,600;"You're going to watch it and be like, this one's topical."
55:08,600;55:09,520;"It's never seen it."
55:09,520;55:12,040;"You probably have."
55:12,040;55:12,960;"All right."
55:12,960;55:14,560;"Uh, my worst."
55:14,560;55:17,080;"It is best, Andy."
55:17,080;55:17,920;"Not bad, right?"
55:17,920;55:18,440;"No."
55:18,440;55:28,360;"Uh, my worst is, uh, just the fact that these chiefs are a losing team."
55:28,360;55:39,600;"They are, they joined the 1975 Buffalo bills as the only two teams in NFL history to score an average of at least 30 points per game and miss the playoffs."
55:39,600;55:42,680;"But that's, that's garbage."
55:42,680;55:44,240;"Do that's hard to do."
55:44,240;55:46,240;"Like how bad does your defense have to be?"
55:46,240;55:47,360;"Yeah."
55:47,400;55:51,640;"to miss a plan. And they were dumb too. Matt and kept saying that throughout the game where"
55:51,640;55:56,040;"it'd be like, we'd be like, well, that's why the Patriots are the Patriots. And that's why the"
55:56,040;56:00,200;"Chiefs said the Chiefs, because they like, like clearly have talent, but they just doing dumb"
56:00,200;56:03,080;"shit, you know, or like not tackling or whatever. Yeah,"
56:03,080;56:07,800;"the judges that yeah, yeah, that Deon branch run, especially like he ran through the whole"
56:07,800;56:11,960;"he's like, you can't let him run to your whole defense. Yeah, for the Daniel Graham one too. Yeah,"
56:11,960;56:12,960;"Yeah, there was a bunch of them."
56:12,960;56:14,280;"That was like, yeah."
56:14,280;56:15,280;"Yeah."
56:15,280;56:17,400;"Well, those, well, those Greg asked enough."
56:17,400;56:18,240;"That was good."
56:18,240;56:19,340;"Yeah, those are better."
56:19,340;56:21,520;"Yeah, you should do the ones like that more often."
56:21,520;56:22,360;"All right."
56:22,360;56:24,600;"I'm watching them a guffy mixtape right now."
56:24,600;56:25,720;"You remember them?"
56:25,720;56:27,160;"No, I've never seen them before."
56:27,160;56:28,000;"Okay."
56:28,000;56:30,160;"(laughs)"
56:30,160;56:31,480;"All right, my,"
56:31,480;56:35,080;"my worst"
56:35,080;56:39,520;"is the Patriots giving up the longest play"
56:39,520;56:41,720;"of Kansas City season."
56:41,720;56:44,020;"Oh, for Earth wind, more land."
56:44,020;56:45,360;"Oh, I saw the highlights."
56:45,360;56:46,200;"That was bad."
56:46,200;56:48,040;"It was like a 75 yarder."
56:48,040;56:53,680;"Keep on it."
56:53,680;56:55,800;"And say, Groot, Madna, another good point there, too,"
56:55,800;56:59,240;"where it was like there were collapsing on the middle"
56:59,240;57:00,840;"because they were so scared against Oz,"
57:00,840;57:02,040;"because you know, Belichick's always"
57:02,040;57:03,760;"trying to take away the best player."
57:03,760;57:06,800;"So he's like, when you do that, you leave the sidelines open."
57:06,800;57:09,720;"So they threw like a go route on the border."
57:09,720;57:11,240;"So that might be why it says good point."
57:11,240;57:15,720;"And my best is Earthwin, Morland's intro, because it's my"
57:15,720;57:16,260;"night football."
57:16,260;57:18,520;"So they do the like the so and so from so and so."
57:18,520;57:19,040;"Yeah."
57:19,040;57:24,840;"He said, Earthwin, Morland from one double A powerhouse, Georgia"
57:24,840;57:25,360;"Southern."
57:25,360;57:28,240;"The fuck yeah, dude."
57:28,240;57:28,760;"Rap them."
57:28,760;57:30,320;"Georgia Southern."
57:30,320;57:31,920;"They were a UNH."
57:31,920;57:33,160;"Yeah."
57:33,160;57:34,160;"Rival for a while."
57:34,160;57:35,040;"They were powerhouse."
57:35,040;57:36,080;"There's no doubt about it."
57:36,080;57:38,400;"Don't they run the triple option, I believe?"
57:38,400;57:39,400;"Probably."
57:39,400;57:40,300;"I believe that's their deal."
57:40,300;57:41,160;"Yeah."
57:41,160;57:45,640;"But they're like one of the best in the country at the triple option."
57:45,640;57:46,520;"Yeah."
57:46,520;57:53,780;"Apparently the, you know, Dion Sanders is coach of Jackson state."
57:53,780;57:54,600;"Yeah."
57:54,600;57:57,380;"You just got the number one recruit in the country."
57:57,380;57:58,000;"I heard that."
57:58,000;57:59,620;"I pay them, right?"
57:59,620;58:03,080;"Uh, no, I don't think so."
58:03,080;58:05,080;"I thought that was a year."
58:05,080;58:06,480;"So you like sold them on that."
58:06,480;58:08,180;"Oh, I thought I thought it."
58:08,180;58:13,180;"You can't pay him."
58:13,180;58:15,180;"You can pay him for his likeness now."
58:15,180;58:18,180;"So I thought he did like some of the barstools."
58:18,180;58:19,180;"School time."
58:19,180;58:21,180;"Oh, COVID."
58:21,180;58:22,180;"Good."
58:22,180;58:23,180;"I'm glad they can get paid."
58:23,180;58:25,180;"Should be more than comfortable."
58:25,180;58:26,180;"Damn right."
58:26,180;58:27,180;"That's right."
58:27,180;58:28,180;"You tell him Stevie."
58:28,180;58:29,180;"For free."
58:29,180;58:30,180;"What is this bullshit?"
58:30,180;58:31,180;"That's right."
58:31,180;58:34,180;"Student athletes."
58:34,180;58:35,020;"- I like it."
58:35,020;58:39,940;"- Greg, how much do you think you would have been paid?"
58:39,940;58:40,780;"- Me?"
58:40,780;58:43,980;"- I didn't, I wasn't worth a fucking nickel dude."
58:43,980;58:45,420;"- Greg, I had to pay them."
58:45,420;58:46,260;"- Yeah."
58:46,260;58:52,160;"I was very self aware that I was worth nothing to that school."
58:52,160;58:54,580;"- Fair enough."
58:54,580;58:55,620;"- Yeah."
58:55,620;58:57,700;"- You're worth something to me though, Greg."
58:57,700;58:59,260;"- That's all that matters, dude."
58:59,260;59:00,740;"- That's nice."
59:00,740;59:02,420;"- My love is priceless."
59:02,420;59:03,260;"- That's true."
59:03,260;59:08,100;"Well, that pretty much wraps it out, right?"
59:08,100;59:09,620;"You guys got anything else?"
59:09,620;59:10,620;"Any parting thoughts?"
59:10,620;59:14,580;"How do you think deepats are going to fare this week against the dolphins?"
59:14,580;59:16,300;"I have one parting thought."
59:16,300;59:17,300;"This is my definitely mixed tape."
59:17,300;59:18,300;"Not that good Greg."
59:18,300;59:20,220;"Yeah, but it's the first one Steve."
59:20,220;59:22,140;"It's like, what is that?"
59:22,140;59:25,940;"Casablanca where the movie actually blows, but it's like the first one that was actually"
59:25,940;59:26,940;"like modern."
59:26,940;59:28,740;"I guess you can see that."
59:28,740;59:31,580;"You can see some of the DCI recording stamps in this thing."
59:31,580;59:32,580;"Oh yeah."
59:32,580;59:35,820;"- Yeah, definitely haircut."
59:35,820;59:38,960;"And like, you know, how like when you used to watch them"
59:38,960;59:41,560;"before you realized that like just 'cause you're good at"
59:41,560;59:45,620;"like P-Wee doesn't make you good at pro, you know?"
59:45,620;59:48,900;"So you'd be like, dude, I'm a bald sky 'til he's in the weed."
59:48,900;59:50,420;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
59:50,420;59:52,760;"- And that was the first time you were like, oh wait."
59:52,760;59:53,860;"Now he sucks now."
59:53,860;59:55,220;"Everybody else grew up."
59:55,220;59:57,940;"- Yeah, that all caught up to him in size and speed."
59:57,940;59:59,300;"- Yeah, yeah."
59:59,300;01:00:00,660;"- Now he's mediocre."
01:00:00,660;01:00:02,180;"- Uh-huh."
01:00:02,180;01:00:04,300;"All right, what's next week, Greg?"
01:00:04,300;01:00:05,220;"- That's a good question."
01:00:05,220;01:00:06,300;"You tell me."
01:00:06,300;01:00:07,140;"- All right, we'll statue."
01:00:07,140;01:00:08,220;"- Oh, how's this not gonna happen?"
01:00:08,220;01:00:09,060;"- It's not gonna happen Friday, no."
01:00:09,060;01:00:09,900;"- Week 12."
01:00:09,900;01:00:13,020;"- Patre's hosting the Baltimore Ravens,"
01:00:13,020;01:00:15,820;"seven and three Baltimore Ravens."
01:00:15,820;01:00:17,580;"- Ooh, that sounds like a good game."
01:00:17,580;01:00:19,380;"- Brian Bilic."
01:00:19,380;01:00:20,700;"- You know, buddy."
01:00:20,700;01:00:22,020;"- That's exciting."
01:00:22,020;01:00:23,460;"- I don't remember these games."
01:00:23,460;01:00:27,580;"- All right, take us out, Greg."
01:00:27,580;01:00:30,180;"- Well, until next time,"
01:00:30,180;01:00:33,080;"I help you bitches stay safe and stay clean."
01:00:33,080;01:00:37,080;"Unlike my two fucking dumbass brothers here."
01:00:37,080;01:00:38,880;"Wear your mask."
01:00:38,880;01:00:41,280;"Get your booster."
01:00:41,280;01:00:43,580;"Don't be an idiot."
01:00:43,580;01:00:46,380;"Hey, light up."
01:00:46,380;01:00:48,380;"Hey, light up."

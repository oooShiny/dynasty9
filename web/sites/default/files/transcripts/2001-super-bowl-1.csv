00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:15,680;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,680;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:19,240;"I am not your mother."
00:19,240;00:28,320;"Welcome back to part two of a very special episode."
00:28,320;00:33,760;"Super Bowl episode. We thought this was such a special one. And because Matt Chatham talked"
00:33,760;00:39,360;"very long as he did, we thought we'd split this into two episodes. So this is episode two of the"
00:39,360;00:45,360;"Super Bowl 2001 Super Bowl. So thanks for coming back to us. We're going to take you to Sunday,"
00:45,360;00:53,920;"February 3rd, 2002 in Louisiana. Superdome is pre-Katrina. This is the old super."
00:53,920;01:00,960;"Your New England Patriots are facing the greatest show on turf in the second time this season."
01:00,960;01:06,640;"The first one didn't go the Patriots away and because of that these"
01:06,640;01:11,440;"Patriots are 14 point underdogs, the biggest underdogs I think in Super Bowl history."
01:11,440;01:15,680;"Wrong. That's true they're not the biggest underdogs."
01:15,680;01:18,000;"They're the biggest underdogs."
01:18,000;01:19,600;"Who's the biggest underdogs?"
01:19,600;01:21,760;"At this time. Yeah Greg who's the biggest underdogs?"
01:21,760;01:24,760;"I looked it up and there's some old one."
01:24,760;01:26,760;"It was 18."
01:26,760;01:27,760;"Really?"
01:27,760;01:28,760;"Yeah."
01:28,760;01:30,760;"Oh, the, uh, was that the Jo Neemoth one?"
01:30,760;01:32,760;"It might have been."
01:32,760;01:33,760;"I looked it up."
01:33,760;01:34,760;"Guaranteed victory."
01:34,760;01:36,760;"I know the biggest blowout was, I don't think."
01:36,760;01:39,760;"This is the, I was talking about upsets."
01:39,760;01:40,760;"Yeah."
01:40,760;01:43,760;"Jets called Super Bowl three 18 points spread."
01:43,760;01:44,760;"Wow."
01:44,760;01:47,760;"Didn't the only score like 18 points a game back then too?"
01:47,760;01:48,760;"Yeah."
01:48,760;01:51,160;"The final score is 16 to 7."
01:51,160;01:52,720;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:52,720;01:55,360;"Well, we're not going to ruin the final score by this one."
01:55,360;01:56,960;"And I mean, that's how you won."
01:56,960;01:58,360;"I think they're going to ruin that."
01:58,360;02:01,840;"[LAUGHTER]"
02:01,840;02:03,560;"So we've already talked about the Rams, really,"
02:03,560;02:06,280;"because we saw them in week 10."
02:06,280;02:09,360;"We've talked about how great their offense is."
02:09,360;02:10,840;"They have a solid defense."
02:10,840;02:13,360;"Yada, yada, yada."
02:13,360;02:16,200;"Nothing huge in that, I think."
02:16,200;02:17,680;"We should probably just get into this game,"
02:17,680;02:22,380;"because this was a game that I felt like I watched more releases than I have,"
02:22,380;02:26,380;"but I, there was a bunch of plays in here that were big plays that I completely forgot."
02:26,380;02:29,780;"Wait, can we, sorry, can we talk about Kurt Warner first?"
02:29,780;02:31,580;"Yeah, I don't know."
02:31,580;02:32,080;"Go T."
02:32,080;02:36,780;"Cause I, I went down to Kurt Warner rabbit hole."
02:36,780;02:37,780;"Oh, I don't know."
02:37,780;02:38,480;"I love you rabbit holes."
02:38,480;02:38,980;"Let's hear it."
02:38,980;02:43,580;"Hey, his story is ridiculous."
02:43,580;02:46,680;"It's crazier than Brady's without a doubt."
02:46,980;02:47,820;"- Really?"
02:47,820;02:48,660;"- Oh yeah."
02:48,660;02:49,500;"- I don't see it."
02:49,500;02:52,660;"- Just his rise, like he,"
02:52,660;02:54,380;"he was a third string quarterback"
02:54,380;02:57,020;"at the University of Northern Iowa."
02:57,020;02:58,860;"- The power and so."
02:58,860;02:59,700;"- So, yeah."
02:59,700;03:01,260;"- Yeah, Matt Chatham's,"
03:01,260;03:03,460;"I think the same conference."
03:03,460;03:04,300;"- I think they were, yeah."
03:04,300;03:05,140;"I think he talked about that."
03:05,140;03:06,500;"- So, one double A."
03:06,500;03:10,100;"He goes undrafted in 1994,"
03:10,100;03:11,680;"goes to the,"
03:11,680;03:14,580;"gets picked up for the Packers training camp,"
03:14,580;03:18,620;"competing with Brett Favre, Mark Brunel and Ty Detmer."
03:18,620;03:19,620;"Jesus."
03:19,620;03:25,140;"The coaches, Mike Holmgren, Steve Marryucci and Andy Reed."
03:25,140;03:27,900;"That's a fucking powerhouse."
03:27,900;03:28,220;"Yeah."
03:28,220;03:29,580;"All three agree he sucks."
03:29,580;03:30,140;"They cut him."
03:30,140;03:40,780;"So then famously after he got tied up, he's stuck in shells at a grocery store"
03:40,780;03:44,100;"for five, 50 an hour in Cedar Falls."
03:44,100;03:48,220;"- Boy, can you imagine anything more depressing?"
03:48,220;03:50,380;"- Yeah, cleaning pools."
03:50,380;03:53,860;"- Hey, that was like eight dollars an hour."
03:53,860;03:55,500;"- Doing it during a pandemic."
03:55,500;03:56,340;"- Yeah."
03:56,340;03:58,340;"- Oh, Jesus."
03:58,340;04:02,020;"So then he goes to the arena league."
04:02,020;04:03,820;"- Okay."
04:03,820;04:06,260;"- So in college too, as soon as he played a senior year,"
04:06,260;04:07,460;"lit it on fire."
04:07,460;04:10,340;"He goes to the arena league, lights it on fire."
04:10,340;04:13,860;"He like wins two arena balls."
04:13,860;04:17,380;"He's like first in the league and yards and touchdowns, all these stats."
04:17,380;04:20,640;"Um, he gets a tryout with the bears."
04:20,640;04:26,900;"And before he goes, he goes to this honeymoon before training camp gets bit by a"
04:26,900;04:31,580;"spider and can't compete at camp."
04:31,580;04:33,660;"Where did he go into the honeymoon?"
04:33,660;04:34,620;"I don't know."
04:34,620;04:35,660;"Australia."
04:35,660;04:36,900;"Gotta be Australia."
04:36,900;04:37,500;"Yeah."
04:37,500;04:39,020;"Something fuck off spider."
04:39,020;04:41,500;"I see sneaky."
04:41,500;04:43,220;"I think you know how he was super religious."
04:43,220;04:48,080;"This is just a theory, but he wasn't, you know, he's saving himself for marriage."
04:48,080;04:52,540;"I don't even know if that's true, but as soon as he busted and not instead of that,"
04:52,540;04:55,920;"like, you know, that like two minute moment of clarity you have."
04:55,920;04:56,520;"Yeah."
04:56,520;04:58,140;"He just had like a six month one."
04:58,140;05:01,320;"Just skip the bears."
05:01,320;05:02,800;"No, he's like, fuck this, dude."
05:02,800;05:03,640;"What am I doing?"
05:03,640;05:08,560;"That's my theory."
05:12,600;05:15,280;"So then he goes to NFL Europe,"
05:15,280;05:20,800;"players for the Amsterdam admirals with his backup Jake"
05:20,800;05:23,080;"D'Alone didn't know that either."
05:23,080;05:24,080;"Yeah."
05:24,080;05:25,080;"Yeah."
05:25,080;05:29,920;"He lights it on fire in Europe as well."
05:29,920;05:32,200;"So everywhere he goes, he's just fair."
05:32,200;05:33,080;"He wears it up. Yeah."
05:33,080;05:34,280;"He wears it up."
05:34,280;05:38,360;"He ends up with the Rams."
05:38,360;05:40,600;"They pick them up as their fourth string quarterback."
05:41,480;05:48,200;"And they put them up for the NFL expansion draft when the Browns were expansion."
05:48,200;05:50,040;"They were like, Nah, we don't want them."
05:50,040;05:57,520;"And then he somehow ends up being the backup because they like traded Tony"
05:57,520;05:59,840;"Banks and Willy, Steve and Bono."
05:59,840;06:00,600;"Yeah."
06:00,600;06:06,400;"And then Trent Green towards ACL and all of a sudden your starter is Kurt"
06:06,400;06:07,720;"Warner, 1999."
06:07,720;06:08,440;"Yeah."
06:08,920;06:09,760;"What does he do?"
06:09,760;06:13,680;"He throws for 4300 yards, 41 touchdowns,"
06:13,680;06:16,720;"65% completion percentage."
06:16,720;06:20,600;"Four, 14 touchdowns in his first four games."
06:20,600;06:23,080;"God, that's crazy."
06:23,080;06:23,560;"Yeah."
06:23,560;06:25,800;"When's, when's the MVP?"
06:25,800;06:28,560;"When's the Super Bowl and the Super Bowl MVP?"
06:28,560;06:30,640;"All in his first season in the NFL."
06:30,640;06:33,080;"Come on."
06:33,080;06:36,880;"Just a ridiculously meteoric rise."
06:36,880;06:38,760;"How was he when he first got a shot?"
06:38,760;06:39,760;"'cause I'd be human."
06:39,760;06:40,600;"- 45."
06:40,600;06:41,840;"- I'll surround, huh?"
06:41,840;06:42,680;"- Yeah, me."
06:42,680;06:44,920;"- Graduated college in '93."
06:44,920;06:46,720;"So."
06:46,720;06:49,180;"- Excuse me, I'm glad you're back."
06:49,180;06:50,180;"- It's late 20."
06:50,180;06:51,020;"- That's right."
06:51,020;06:51,860;"- Yeah."
06:51,860;06:52,760;"- Graduated 21."
06:52,760;06:53,920;"- Late 20s."
06:53,920;06:55,360;"- Yeah."
06:55,360;06:58,480;"- And then signs a seven year contract right after that year."
06:58,480;06:59,320;"- You got no shit."
06:59,320;07:00,320;"- Thank you."
07:00,320;07:02,200;"Imagine his wife, she must be like,"
07:02,200;07:03,960;"""God damn, I hit the jackpot."""
07:03,960;07:04,800;"(laughing)"
07:04,800;07:06,120;"- Finally, all that was worth it."
07:06,120;07:06,960;"- This is five last year."
07:06,960;07:08,440;"- You were making five 15 and a half,"
07:08,440;07:09,700;"I was a bad winner in this house."
07:09,700;07:10,800;"- Yeah, for real."
07:10,800;07:15,080;"And then the rest is kind of history."
07:15,080;07:19,720;"I mean, back to back MVP or two out of three years MVP."
07:19,720;07:21,240;"I mean, he lit it up in '01."
07:21,240;07:23,560;"So this is his third year in the league"
07:23,560;07:25,160;"and he's just been,"
07:25,160;07:27,520;"this is like, I think the height of his career."
07:27,520;07:28,360;"- Yeah."
07:28,360;07:29,200;"- Yeah."
07:29,200;07:32,840;"- I mean, he falls apart after this game,"
07:32,840;07:34,200;"but this is-"
07:34,200;07:36,360;"- Interesting, he's more than anything, right?"
07:36,360;07:40,520;"Yeah, that actually funny enough, it was a lot to do with the thumb."
07:40,520;07:42,720;"So you get the thumb injury in this game."
07:42,720;07:46,960;"And I think that carried them for like four years."
07:46,960;07:49,040;"Like stay remember, I don't even think you got it in this game."
07:49,040;07:50,600;"I think you got it at the beginning of the season."
07:50,600;07:51,000;"Yeah."
07:51,000;07:54,600;"So they were saying on the broadcast because in the last game of the year,"
07:54,600;07:56,720;"and it's he's still having issues right here."
07:56,720;08:00,040;"They're talking about him, like having some like rabby thing."
08:00,040;08:04,040;"But he's always squeezing so that he can like try to get the thumb up."
08:04,040;08:09,400;"like, it'll be better. Yeah. I know. Strangely, I know what you mean."
08:09,400;08:11,040;"Yeah, you know, I don't."
08:11,040;08:11,920;"He's."
08:11,920;08:16,880;"Springs, I'm guessing. Yeah. It was John Madden. So I'm pretty sure he actually said"
08:16,880;08:21,400;"grabby that that may have been verbatim. I'm going to go on record and say John Madden"
08:21,400;08:25,920;"was a better commentator than I remember. Love them. I wrote that down too. Yeah, let's"
08:25,920;08:30,800;"go there. John Madden, Pat Summerall. This was actually Pat Summerall's last ever game"
08:30,800;08:32,200;"that he did. Good."
08:32,200;08:37,880;"was good. That's from Roodle. Yeah. Yeah. He was awful. Well, you like start a"
08:37,880;08:41,680;"favorite sentence and then just not finish it. You're like, are you gonna say something?"
08:41,680;08:48,600;"That's the role thing was that he would fall for every trick play that any team. Yeah. Yeah. There's a"
08:48,600;08:54,200;"Patriots did what they've been doing all season with a direct snap to Kevin Falk. He's like, oh,"
08:54,200;08:57,440;"to high snap and the bug goes over pretty. Oh wait no."
08:57,440;09:05,080;"Well he's so like monotone too. And that that one play was the one where you could tell he was"
09:05,080;09:10,680;"actually surprised because he actually had some emotion. He did. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I was rough."
09:10,680;09:14,920;"But I agree with Stephen. I thought John Madden was a lot better than I remember because you remember"
09:14,920;09:19,080;"just like all the stupid shit that he says. Yeah. But when you actually listen to him,"
09:19,080;09:23,320;"like a lot of it is really good and really informative stuff. And you can see why he lasted"
09:23,320;09:24,320;"as long as he did."
09:24,320;09:28,840;"I remember mom saying that she liked him because when she was learning the game, he would explain"
09:28,840;09:29,840;"it."
09:29,840;09:31,440;"And sometimes he would like he dumb it down."
09:31,440;09:34,040;"So like stuff that like I'm like, yeah, no shit."
09:34,040;09:37,400;"But I remember that comment mom must have made years ago where she loved him because"
09:37,400;09:40,200;"he would explain to her when she had no idea that was going on."
09:40,200;09:41,200;"Right."
09:41,200;09:42,200;"Absolutely."
09:42,200;09:43,200;"Andy like jokes around too."
09:43,200;09:44,200;"Yeah."
09:44,200;09:45,640;"He was having a great time with it."
09:45,640;09:50,200;"When the rest are talking about that holding call and the guy like held his hand for like"
09:50,200;09:51,200;"10 seconds."
09:51,200;09:56,200;"You can see that part. He's like, he must got a good one. Look at his eyes."
09:56,200;09:59,600;"Goodness I,"
09:59,600;10:03,200;"because the referee was like, he had an point in which way he was going to do it."
10:03,200;10:05,200;"He's like, well, he doesn't know which way it's going,"
10:05,200;10:09,200;"but you can tell by the look in the referee's eyes, he's got a good one because they were wide open."
10:09,200;10:14,200;"He was too. They got to stand there with his eyes wide over just holding his fit."
10:14,200;10:16,200;"Oh, yeah. He did. He was, he was very quotable."
10:16,200;10:19,200;"Well, I mean, my impression coming away from it,"
10:19,200;10:23,040;"away from it because I've watched that final drive a ton is him like saying they shouldn't"
10:23,040;10:26,000;"go for it and then doubling down right and you're like on that."
10:26,000;10:30,360;"There's no anything but you look at from the big picture he's got a point where like they're"
10:30,360;10:36,560;"on the 17 they had no time to do whatever and some change left Brady's a rookie."
10:36,560;10:37,560;"See his logic now."
10:37,560;10:40,520;"Yeah they just gave up a touchdown in like a minute."
10:40,520;10:44,680;"And then halfway through you switch and he's like you know what never mind I'm on board"
10:44,680;10:45,680;"with this."
10:45,680;10:46,680;"Yeah."
10:46,680;10:47,680;"Yeah, when he's rock."
10:47,680;10:50,240;"Yeah, no, no, let's know."
10:50,240;10:51,240;"I'm back now."
10:51,240;10:53,840;"20 years later, I have changed my"
10:53,840;10:55,440;"I'm sure I know he said some."
10:55,440;10:57,760;"Like silly things, but they're not"
10:57,760;10:58,560;"very like stupid."
10:58,560;10:59,320;"Never wrong."
10:59,320;11:00,800;"Like you'd say for a Dan"
11:00,800;11:01,920;"founds, but they're not super"
11:01,920;11:02,600;"biased either."
11:02,600;11:04,000;"He didn't seem to be like crazy"
11:04,000;11:04,640;"biased."
11:04,640;11:06,240;"No, it was more just like excited"
11:06,240;11:07,880;"to to watch football again, kind"
11:07,880;11:09,560;"of like you see with Tony Romo"
11:09,560;11:09,960;"these days."
11:09,960;11:11,080;"We're just excited to see that"
11:11,080;11:11,840;"football be in the way."
11:11,840;11:12,440;"Well, that too."
11:12,440;11:13,760;"Yeah."
11:13,760;11:15,880;"It had that that like joyful"
11:15,880;11:20,480;"feeling to it to me. Also, this is the best Super Bowl logo of all time, in my opinion."
11:20,480;11:24,480;"I like people logos. I don't even remember them really, but this one."
11:24,480;11:25,600;"It's awesome."
11:25,600;11:31,200;"Oh, this was the peak and then they, they were kind of samey after this one."
11:31,200;11:34,520;"And then eventually they all got standardized and other the same thing every year."
11:34,520;11:37,520;"Yeah. I don't know why they do that either. It's stupid."
11:37,520;11:38,760;"Yeah."
11:38,760;11:42,240;"Yeah. Apparently it's supposed to be something different, too."
11:42,240;11:43,840;"What do you mean?"
11:43,840;11:44,840;"This almost."
11:44,840;11:49,800;"Yeah, they had a different logo and they were like, they, they'd sold some merchandise with"
11:49,800;11:50,800;"the old logo."
11:50,800;11:57,360;"And then obviously the, the 9/11 thing, there's a lot of patriotic themes around the Super Bowl."
11:57,360;11:59,200;"So they ended up changing it."
11:59,200;12:00,200;"That makes sense."
12:00,200;12:01,200;"Oh, I see."
12:01,200;12:02,200;"You mean?"
12:02,200;12:03,200;"Yeah."
12:03,200;12:04,200;"Yeah."
12:04,200;12:05,200;"Yeah."
12:05,200;12:06,200;"Just Google it."
12:06,200;12:07,200;"Yeah."
12:07,200;12:08,200;"Like a very New Orleans theme."
12:08,200;12:09,200;"Look at them."
12:09,200;12:10,200;"Yeah."
12:10,200;12:11,200;"I like the, yeah, I like the one they want better."
12:11,200;12:12,200;"Yeah."
12:12,200;12:13,400;"research this week."
12:13,400;12:15,560;"I watched the game, but"
12:15,560;12:19,040;"Wikipedia."
12:19,040;12:21,040;"Greg's also"
12:21,040;12:23,600;"he's like the brain man of"
12:23,600;12:23,960;"Patriots."
12:23,960;12:24,880;"So I just remember"
12:24,880;12:27,880;"now to watch him."
12:27,880;12:31,440;"Shout out Matt Chatham for"
12:31,440;12:33,280;"putting me onto the LA kiss"
12:33,280;12:34,360;"television show."
12:34,360;12:38,200;"Did I watched like five episodes"
12:38,200;12:39,200;"last night?"
12:39,200;12:40,680;"Yeah, and it's worth watching."
12:41,000;12:48,200;"Dude, I say I'm going to tell you something that it doesn't make me proud."
12:48,200;12:51,480;"Kelly cried."
12:51,480;12:53,840;"Excuse me."
12:53,840;12:56,520;"Kelly cried in episode three."
12:56,520;12:59,240;"Here's a like, sadness."
12:59,240;13:04,280;"Like, here's a joy when BJ Bell, the underdog made the team so he could play"
13:04,280;13:04,960;"with his brother."
13:04,960;13:07,760;"Kelly was."
13:09,320;13:11,240;"It's a clear sign you're on quarantine."
13:11,240;13:12,280;"It was not enough."
13:12,280;13:13,720;"Yeah, it really is."
13:13,720;13:16,120;"Well, I can hear in the background."
13:16,120;13:16,520;"Yell on that."
13:16,520;13:16,760;"Yeah."
13:16,760;13:17,200;"Oh, yeah."
13:17,200;13:17,520;"Yeah."
13:17,520;13:17,520;"Yeah."
13:17,520;13:19,760;"She she's a big cussard from down to."
13:19,760;13:21,840;"It was tears of happiness."
13:21,840;13:22,800;"He was a happiness."
13:22,800;13:23,120;"All right."
13:23,120;13:23,720;"So tears."
13:23,720;13:26,080;"We're a kiss football team."
13:26,080;13:29,520;"Hey, I do so."
13:29,520;13:33,760;"So we may have to in the future do a like a bi week episode or something."
13:33,760;13:34,720;"It's worth it."
13:34,720;13:38,760;"There's there's enough to talk about there to unpack as they say."
13:39,200;13:42,320;"And it's like a mini series of like a review each episode."
13:42,320;13:43,080;"Yeah."
13:43,080;13:45,000;"Well, maybe not that much."
13:45,000;13:46,680;"Yeah."
13:46,680;13:48,200;"Even better."
13:48,200;13:48,720;"All right."
13:48,720;13:49,480;"Do you have any more?"
13:49,480;13:52,360;"I had some some current Warner notes, actually."
13:52,360;13:53,440;"We got."
13:53,440;13:57,920;"So I noticed it in the last game, but they didn't talk about it."
13:57,920;14:01,520;"But he had this like he had that big long face mask, kind of like similar to"
14:01,520;14:02,440;"True Bledsos."
14:02,440;14:04,960;"Yeah, but then it had like an actual loop at the bottom."
14:04,960;14:05,960;"Yeah."
14:05,960;14:07,360;"Why the fuck does he have this?"
14:07,360;14:11,000;"I just like to hang his tie on or something."
14:11,000;14:13,360;"I don't understand why it's that extra thing,"
14:13,360;14:14,720;"but I actually talked about it in this game"
14:14,720;14:19,720;"where apparently his vocal chords got injured somehow."
14:19,720;14:20,840;"Didn't explain how it happened."
14:20,840;14:22,720;"I'm guessing he just got like a shot"
14:22,720;14:25,360;"to the neck or something, but he couldn't take it."
14:25,360;14:27,600;"(laughing)"
14:27,600;14:30,080;"It's post-knock clarity."
14:30,080;14:35,520;"But so they put that there while it was healing."
14:35,520;14:39,020;"So it wouldn't come because you apparently lost his voice for like a"
14:39,020;14:40,060;"weirdo, it's not a great thing."
14:40,060;14:43,300;"No, they had it there for that."
14:43,300;14:46,300;"And then they left it there so it wouldn't get fucking crazy injury to"
14:46,300;14:46,500;"get."
14:46,500;14:46,940;"Yeah."
14:46,940;14:49,300;"Does that even extend far enough down?"
14:49,300;14:53,740;"No, I think it did because he took a shot like directly in that spot from"
14:53,740;14:54,880;"really beginning at one point."
14:54,880;14:55,580;"Oh, yeah."
14:55,580;14:58,420;"We stayed in there late and just like, I think actually I'm going to"
14:58,420;15:02,740;"throw in the ball away, but like willing to get this top of his dome was"
15:02,740;15:04,380;"like right in his right in his chin."
15:04,380;15:06,580;"So maybe it did help."
15:06,580;15:09,140;"He did a lot of shots in this game."
15:09,140;15:11,700;"He took a lot of shots in this game."
15:11,700;15:13,980;"You know, but at one point they said it was 11."
15:13,980;15:17,620;"11 hits through three quarters on."
15:17,620;15:22,820;"And he was also at this point who"
15:22,820;15:26,460;"he was second in NFL history in attempts"
15:26,460;15:31,660;"without an interception in Super Bowl with 60."
15:31,660;15:36,540;"And then, procedure to throw two interceptions in the next 11 attempts."
15:36,540;15:37,500;"That's good."
15:37,500;15:40,380;"You know, spoiler alert."
15:40,380;15:48,060;"I'm assuming that's been broken since because people just actually throw more passes in"
15:48,060;15:49,260;"games in general."
15:49,260;15:52,540;"But I took a bunch of screenshots because there was a bunch of like"
15:52,540;15:58,060;"stats that they put up on the chevron at the bottom and they didn't make a lot of sense."
16:00,460;16:10,180;"Yeah, so I actually found a video when I was YouTube in this of home video reactions to this game from."
16:10,180;16:13,820;"Yeah, some people in like these Boston fans."
16:13,820;16:17,100;"And like the quality is what you'd expect."
16:17,100;16:20,220;"But, yeah, one of the things they brought up was like,"
16:20,220;16:23,180;"where the fuck are they pulling these stats from?"
16:23,180;16:27,100;"I swear to God, they're just throwing anything up there."
16:28,540;16:33,020;"It's true. Let me just give you a taste of some of them. So at the beginning, you know, when the"
16:33,020;16:39,900;"Rams started the ball, they showed the rankings of the offense and defense. The Rams offense was"
16:39,900;16:46,860;"best in the NFL. The Patriots defense somehow, 24th in the NFL. Yeah, I can stack that using for"
16:46,860;16:56,620;"that. Yards? Probably. Maybe. Even that. Yeah, 24 seems real low even for yards. Not sure what that"
16:56,620;17:04,860;"was. But then moments later they showed the Patriots defense have allowed one opening drive"
17:04,860;17:10,140;"touchdown in the last 26,000. That's a pretty good stat. Well, versus the right, yeah. But"
17:10,140;17:15,020;"there's a 24th ranked defense. I look quite gee, it's got to be a yard. And then on the opposite"
17:15,020;17:19,740;"side of them all, this was also surprising. They showed the same stat, but reverse Patriots offense"
17:19,740;17:26,380;"19th in the NFL, which feels about right. Yeah. You know, middle of the road kind of Rams defense,"
17:26,380;17:29,260;"Anybody want to guess where they ranked in the NFL?"
17:29,260;17:30,940;"Fit?"
17:30,940;17:33,020;"Higher."
17:33,020;17:34,460;"Really?"
17:34,460;17:36,540;"Third in the NFL."
17:36,540;17:39,180;"Yeah, they got to be using yards then because I don't know."
17:39,180;17:40,460;"It's got to be something like that."
17:40,460;17:41,500;"Yeah, I don't know what it is."
17:41,500;17:43,180;"So not great."
17:43,180;17:46,460;"Okay, there was a lot of, uh, I'll do some more later,"
17:46,460;17:48,380;"but there was a lot of, oh, this was one other one."
17:48,380;17:51,500;"The, the, the pages defense in the postseason,"
17:51,500;17:53,420;"they were showing that the defense special teams"
17:53,420;17:55,460;"and scored three touchdowns."
17:55,460;17:58,740;"And the Patriots offense had also scored three touchdowns."
17:58,740;17:59,540;"Yeah."
17:59,540;18:00,860;"Yeah, that makes sense."
18:00,860;18:05,780;"That dials move goes back to our three phases of the game."
18:05,780;18:07,740;"Defense wins championships."
18:07,740;18:08,220;"Yeah."
18:08,220;18:09,260;"Yes, it does."
18:09,260;18:12,220;"Can you name the five Hall of Famers"
18:12,220;18:15,220;"that started for the Rams in this game?"
18:15,220;18:17,580;"Oh, free us."
18:17,580;18:19,060;"Yep."
18:19,060;18:19,860;"Warner?"
18:19,860;18:21,060;"Yep."
18:21,060;18:22,900;"He's an Hall of Fame."
18:22,900;18:23,740;"Who's a left tackle?"
18:23,740;18:24,620;"Lando pace?"
18:24,620;18:25,620;"Yep."
18:25,620;18:26,820;"Wow."
18:26,820;18:27,620;"Fuck."
18:27,620;18:28,740;"And the Yes, Williams."
18:28,740;18:29,740;"Yes."
18:29,740;18:30,820;"Oh, wow."
18:30,820;18:31,660;"Well done, guys."
18:31,660;18:33,020;"I didn't think we'd get that."
18:33,020;18:34,140;"I don't think we'd get anything else."
18:34,140;18:34,780;"We got all that."
18:34,780;18:38,180;"Also, the white defensive back hall of fame"
18:38,180;18:39,860;"are Adam Archuleta."
18:39,860;18:40,380;"Yeah."
18:40,380;18:41,260;"Oh, yeah, he was."
18:41,260;18:44,860;"Just taking snaps gets you in the white defensive back."
18:44,860;18:46,100;"I mean, I'm in Jason C. Horner."
18:46,100;18:47,100;"Yeah."
18:47,100;18:49,100;"Well, gray-blind was sick, too."
18:49,100;18:50,300;"I love gray-blind."
18:50,300;18:50,800;"Yeah."
18:50,800;18:51,100;"I was--"
18:51,100;18:51,100;"I was--"
18:51,100;18:52,180;"--in this game."
18:52,180;18:53,660;"They're a good secondary."
18:53,660;18:55,660;"That's a pretty dope name too."
18:55,660;18:56,940;"Yeah."
18:56,940;18:58,740;"Because if you went by like Andre,"
18:58,740;18:59,660;"and not as cool,"
18:59,660;19:00,660;"like Andre."
19:00,660;19:02,580;"Don't drive the guy."
19:02,580;19:04,980;"I just kicked the timer."
19:04,980;19:06,180;"Yo Murphy."
19:06,180;19:07,380;"Yeah."
19:07,380;19:08,700;"I need to hear Berman."
19:08,700;19:09,860;"I tried to look up,"
19:09,860;19:12,540;"see if Berman had a,"
19:12,540;19:13,740;"like a prime time for this."
19:13,740;19:14,900;"I couldn't find it."
19:14,900;19:16,500;"Oh, yeah, I was looking for it too."
19:16,500;19:18,500;"And I couldn't find it either."
19:18,500;19:20,180;"Because a couple of my favorite"
19:20,180;19:22,180;"berman nicknames are in this"
19:22,180;19:24,400;"Ricky prol member"
19:24,400;19:26,400;"pral shampoo"
19:26,400;19:30,300;"And he said like Ricky pro shampoos is this way for a first down"
19:30,300;19:35,560;"Or as a here a keem when you still ah"
19:35,560;19:39,320;"Has a keem"
19:39,320;19:45,740;"My favorite permanence, oh"
19:45,740;19:48,700;"They're all my favorite. Yeah"
19:48,700;19:50,620;"- Yeah, do the genius."
19:50,620;19:51,700;"- He really has, yeah."
19:51,700;19:52,540;"- Well, all right."
19:52,540;19:54,500;"I mean, should we talk about this game a little bit?"
19:54,500;19:55,660;"- I guess."
19:55,660;19:56,940;"- Yeah, all right."
19:56,940;19:59,540;"So opening quarter, the Rams actually took the lead,"
19:59,540;20:00,380;"which I've forgotten."
20:00,380;20:01,620;"- It's the only lead they'd have."
20:01,620;20:02,460;"- Yeah."
20:02,460;20:05,020;"- Like the 50 yard field goal,"
20:05,020;20:07,460;"which at the time was the third longest field goal."
20:07,460;20:10,140;"And it was only the third field goal of over 50 yard."
20:10,140;20:11,740;"- Oh, they put up a whole bunch of stats on that."
20:11,740;20:12,860;"Like, yeah."
20:12,860;20:14,340;"That's the third longest field goal."
20:14,340;20:15,660;"I knew like that."
20:15,660;20:16,980;"- One of three 50 yard field goals."
20:16,980;20:19,740;"No shit if so turn on the still goal and it's 50 yards then"
20:19,740;20:22,980;"The other two are gonna be at least 50 water more"
20:22,980;20:28,920;"And then that was kind of all that had the paths didn't I started a bit slow I thought"
20:28,920;20:31,580;"Antoine Smith"
20:31,580;20:33,580;"I kept"
20:33,580;20:35,820;"like remembering him is more of a"
20:35,820;20:39,220;"The game changer in this season"
20:39,220;20:42,340;"But it felt like every game he would start off"
20:43,180;20:49,980;"Averaging like two yards of carry in the first half and then wear the team down and would eventually end up averaging four yards of carry"
20:49,980;20:54,340;"Yeah, you got nine two yards and five one one per carry"
20:54,340;20:59,260;"And I feel like this game was the same thing like he started off the first like probably quarter and a half"
20:59,260;21:02,960;"Yeah averaging like a yard of carry and then started"
21:02,960;21:08,100;"Wearing them down and bringing bigger runs. It's a derken re-effect"
21:08,100;21:12,180;"Yeah, exactly the same idea. We're gonna go right on. Yeah"
21:12,380;21:14,380;"Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna blend as well"
21:14,380;21:23,280;"Second quarter was probably the most it runs actually to open the second quarter missed a longer field of 52 yards"
21:23,280;21:28,100;"Wait, wait, wait, we're not doing best on worse for quarters. We're gonna do it by the half. Oh"
21:28,100;21:35,320;"Cheese why you got a best worst for every goddamn quarter. Yeah, of course. All right, you know what fucking let's do it. Oh good"
21:41,420;21:48,940;"You said we didn't do nothing in the first quarter. We set the tone. There's back plays where it's a bucket like absolutely laid lumber. Oh"
21:48,940;21:51,740;"Yeah, that one side line"
21:51,740;22:00,700;"Love laying lumber on the crossover right there through like a crosser like a shallow crosser Bruce and like long"
22:00,700;22:02,700;"It's right there and just like whipped them down"
22:02,700;22:09,340;"I don't know they were like they came out and they were just hitting people everywhere and the worst was first kick of the game was a"
22:09,340;22:11,340;"40-yard return"
22:11,340;22:13,120;"Yeah, that's how the Rams started."
22:13,120;22:15,540;"The Rams won the opening toss."
22:15,540;22:17,280;"The elected to receive the football"
22:17,280;22:19,040;"and then took the opening kick off out to the."
22:19,040;22:21,640;"- And then they punted it to like R1."
22:21,640;22:22,880;"- Or three actually, yeah."
22:22,880;22:27,180;"That was my best was Tom Brady's first snap"
22:27,180;22:29,400;"in a Super Bowl was from his own three yard line"
22:29,400;22:33,440;"and he decided to go empty backfield"
22:33,440;22:37,000;"and had him through a quick slant to who else?"
22:37,000;22:37,840;"Troy Brown."
22:37,840;22:38,680;"- Yep."
22:38,680;22:41,280;"his first ever play from scrimmage."
22:41,280;22:42,640;"It was pretty sweet."
22:42,640;22:45,040;"Yeah, you're going to best Greg."
22:45,040;22:48,200;"Well, I do. I didn't."
22:48,200;22:50,080;"I was kind of scared there because I don't"
22:50,080;22:52,600;"remember either of those plays that you just mentioned."
22:52,600;22:56,520;"I don't know if I just like zoned out for a bit, but."
22:56,520;23:02,760;"I don't know if this is in the first quarter, but Madden"
23:02,760;23:07,240;"or a summer all asked him as Madden if he had proud"
23:07,440;23:09,000;"Bourbon Street earlier in the week."
23:09,000;23:12,080;"I think that's a little bit of a blighter."
23:12,080;23:15,360;"It's like, I don't know if Prowl is the right word."
23:15,360;23:18,480;"But yes, I may have stopped there on Tuesday."
23:18,480;23:20,640;"Monday, on Tuesday."
23:20,640;23:21,200;"Yeah."
23:21,200;23:26,080;"I think that's all I had written down."
23:26,080;23:29,440;"We'll call it best and worst."
23:29,440;23:32,320;"The worst, the question was the worst."
23:32,320;23:33,800;"Answer was the best."
23:33,800;23:36,240;"Love it."
23:36,640;23:38,640;"I see. Do you have a worse? Did you do worse?"
23:38,640;23:39,640;"Oh, yeah."
23:39,640;23:42,520;"Yeah, before you turn it off just ridiculous to to yell."
23:42,520;23:43,840;"You can't get right to yell."
23:43,840;23:45,720;"Oh, also they came out as a team."
23:45,720;23:47,520;"They kind of set that whole bar."
23:47,520;23:48,040;"Yes."
23:48,040;23:50,520;"Like most people remember that, but."
23:50,520;23:52,080;"Yeah, I have a note in here."
23:52,080;23:54,360;"When did the crazy train intro start?"
23:54,360;23:55,840;"It was in place."
23:55,840;23:59,800;"I think we're playing crazy train on the intro in the Super Bowl."
23:59,800;24:01,160;"Yeah, I don't know."
24:01,160;24:04,440;"Apparently I didn't watch the first quarter."
24:04,440;24:09,960;"Well, the YouTube one that we I thought they came out to crazy train in my mind they did."
24:09,960;24:12,560;"Well fact check it."
24:12,560;24:18,640;"Also, there's a super bowl episode something never changed."
24:18,640;24:25,040;"Now there's some there's some controversy about when this game was to be played as"
24:25,040;24:27,160;"Matt kind of mentioned in the interview."
24:27,160;24:33,760;"Yeah, just because of the 9/11 they pushed everything back and I guess they"
24:33,760;24:38,800;"didn't do two weeks back then in between the conference game and the Super Bowl."
24:38,800;24:39,840;"I didn't think so."
24:39,840;24:45,920;"Because I always think of why wouldn't they just make the two weeks one week and then keep it the"
24:45,920;24:50,960;"same day, but they actually had to move this game back a week. Yeah, that's what I thought."
24:50,960;24:55,440;"Really? Yeah. So they must have only been doing one week at this point."
24:55,440;25:00,240;"And apparently there's all sorts of discussions around whether they should like"
25:00,960;25:05,960;"make the playoffs more compact, like play games midweek."
25:05,960;25:07,640;"Oh no shit."
25:07,640;25:10,100;"Like cut out a week of the season."
25:10,100;25:15,760;"'Cause there was like some automobile show already booked"
25:15,760;25:20,520;"and yeah, in the stadium for that weekend."
25:20,520;25:23,120;"Yeah, 'cause I remember like right after 9/11 happened"
25:23,120;25:27,040;"in the Boston Globe, there was articles talking about how"
25:27,040;25:29,120;"like even directly after this happened,"
25:29,120;25:33,440;"they were already like NFL was already on the phone with like the people like I think"
25:33,440;25:41,960;"it was the the metronome people. Superdome rather and they were like trying to convince"
25:41,960;25:49,440;"them to push the auto show. Huge thing. And so fucking Super Bowl. Yeah, exactly."
25:49,440;25:53,440;"But they don't beat it, you know, I'm trying to get a nasty feel there's somebody who's"
25:53,440;25:58,080;"literally like like a few days later talking about this and they're just like so. Yeah,"
25:58,080;26:07,380;"So apparently they gave them financial considerations and also they let them run free ads during"
26:07,380;26:08,380;"the Super Bowl."
26:08,380;26:09,380;"No shit."
26:09,380;26:11,980;"I don't know if it's for the cars or the..."
26:11,980;26:12,980;"Gotta be right."
26:12,980;26:13,980;"Show."
26:13,980;26:15,380;"Gotta be in the car manufacturer."
26:15,380;26:23,180;"If you gave me a chance to do a free ad during the Super Bowl, it would be so inappropriate."
26:23,180;26:25,180;"What would that look like?"
26:25,180;26:26,500;"Oh, it'd be awful."
26:26,500;26:27,500;"I know that."
26:27,500;26:29,740;"(laughing)"
26:29,740;26:33,740;"- I think like crowd moving the camera."
26:33,740;26:35,340;"- Yeah, I think tone deaf would probably"
26:35,340;26:37,140;"would probably be a good way to describe it."
26:37,140;26:39,660;"(laughing)"
26:39,660;26:41,100;"- Half your beard is shaved."
26:41,100;26:43,380;"- Yeah, exactly."
26:43,380;26:45,620;"- Greg Brown wearing a, yeah,"
26:45,620;26:48,580;"a thong that has an elephant trunk up in front"
26:48,580;26:50,300;"and you're just swinging it around in a circle"
26:50,300;26:51,580;"for 30 seconds."
26:51,580;26:53,620;"- Yeah, I googled the crazy train thing."
26:53,620;26:56,700;"There's a blog post by the guy who used to work"
26:56,700;27:00,260;"the Patriots that did all this. He said he did it 98."
27:00,260;27:00,620;"Yep."
27:00,620;27:04,340;"So it started and did start before that. Yeah. They used to come"
27:04,340;27:06,740;"out to jock jams. Are you ready for this?"
27:06,740;27:10,700;"This is not a ring a bell. Yeah."
27:10,700;27:14,900;"Also, did you know that Janet Jackson was supposed to perform"
27:14,900;27:19,540;"halftime? Really? What they pushed it? Yeah."
27:19,540;27:24,180;"People pushed you to come on, you know that. Yeah."
27:25,260;27:28,500;"I don't. It's a beautiful day."
27:28,500;27:32,300;"And the hat on the name scrolling on the middle."
27:32,300;27:34,020;"You remember that, Steve? Come on."
27:34,020;27:37,100;"Steve's just trying to be like too cool for pop culture right now."
27:37,100;27:39,260;"Now, Steve was in the bathroom taking a shit at this point."
27:39,260;27:41,580;"I just looked up who did crazy train."
27:41,580;27:44,180;"You kidding me?"
27:44,180;27:47,580;"I mean, imagine if this was..."
27:47,580;27:50,780;"They do all this America stuff and then..."
27:50,780;27:52,700;"So it's in terms of like..."
27:52,700;27:53,540;"- That's awesome."
27:53,540;27:54,820;"(laughing)"
27:54,820;27:56,160;"- And it's jacked."
27:56,160;27:57,160;"- Put the tone down."
27:57,160;27:59,000;"- It's hitting out."
27:59,000;27:59,840;"- Put a tribute."
27:59,840;28:01,340;"(laughing)"
28:01,340;28:03,520;"- Everyone's just like saluting around them."
28:03,520;28:06,500;"(laughing)"
28:06,500;28:08,040;"- Holy shit."
28:08,040;28:09,440;"- Tone deaf, you know?"
28:09,440;28:12,540;"(laughing)"
28:12,540;28:14,880;"- That seems to be the theme of this podcast episode."
28:14,880;28:17,620;"(laughing)"
28:17,620;28:19,180;"- Now we're actually gonna do this one again."
28:19,180;28:20,020;"Not gonna lie."
28:20,020;28:20,860;"- Yeah."
28:20,860;28:22,100;"- All right, second quarter."
28:22,100;28:23,420;"- It's gonna be a good thing."
28:23,420;28:25,160;"- We're all in a fight for playing safety"
28:25,160;28:27,500;"and laying lumber, literally on the first play."
28:27,500;28:28,340;"- Yep."
28:28,340;28:30,800;"- And Kurt won or take an absolute shot."
28:30,800;28:31,900;"- Well they were playing a big zone,"
28:31,900;28:34,020;"looks like he got us got a really deep drop."
28:34,020;28:37,020;"- Yeah, as long as like a 10 to a quarter thing,"
28:37,020;28:37,860;"we were dropping that."
28:37,860;28:39,720;"- Yeah, he looked at a place."
28:39,720;28:40,560;"- Yeah."
28:40,560;28:43,800;"- Back to the likes of Laura Maloy, he was still tarring."
28:43,800;28:45,560;"- We're an athlete though, huh?"
28:45,560;28:46,400;"- Right?"
28:46,400;28:47,240;"- Yeah."
28:47,240;28:50,040;"- Also Grant Winstrom looked pretty good."
28:50,040;28:51,080;"- He did."
28:51,080;28:52,080;"He was all on the stair."
28:52,080;28:54,440;"Yeah, I had forgotten about him, but he was a good player."
28:54,440;28:59,360;"He like they did like a zone blitz where he like dropped into coverage and covered Kevin"
28:59,360;28:59,720;"Falk."
28:59,720;29:00,400;"Yeah."
29:00,400;29:01,960;"You covered pretty well."
29:01,960;29:02,240;"Yeah."
29:02,240;29:02,680;"Yeah."
29:02,680;29:07,360;"Well, I thought there was a there was Richard Seymour was out there running down Marshall"
29:07,360;29:07,720;"Falk."
29:07,720;29:08,440;"Yeah."
29:08,440;29:12,200;"On one of those past plays where it looked like he was actually supposed to be in"
29:12,200;29:12,880;"coverage too."
29:12,880;29:17,160;"His Marshall Falk came out of the backfield and the guy that peeled off to cover him"
29:17,160;29:20,080;"was Richard Seymour, which doesn't seem particular."
29:20,080;29:22,400;"I mean, still got beat for like 10 yards, but definitely."
29:22,400;29:23,760;"Yeah, but he still ran his ass down."
29:23,760;29:26,000;"They look good doing it."
29:26,000;29:35,320;"Oh, I will say, if we're going to give him some shit, we got to give him some props for his sack."
29:35,320;29:40,680;"He literally takes the right guard and throws him aside like the guy is just a child"
29:40,680;29:43,760;"and then just runs straight after he's like a cartoon."
29:43,760;29:45,000;"Yes."
29:45,000;29:45,200;"Yeah."
29:45,200;29:47,280;"He's cartooned monster or something."
29:47,280;29:48,920;"He's just bigger than everybody else."
29:48,920;29:52,080;"He just looks like he's playing with like younger kids."
29:52,080;29:56,480;"It's like rock that same sort of like he's just too big to be what."
29:56,480;29:57,880;"Let's go back to the second quarter."
29:57,880;30:00,200;"So, um,"
30:00,200;30:02,840;"very you want to do your best, you want to do your best for this quarter?"
30:02,840;30:05,640;"Oh, I think we talk about the quarter."
30:05,640;30:09,640;"I think we'll leave that until we get to it."
30:09,640;30:11,280;"Because I think it's going to be Greg's."
30:11,280;30:12,560;"Um, yeah."
30:12,560;30:13,400;"So the, uh,"
30:13,400;30:18,840;"the Rams miss a 52 yarder and the Pats get the ball"
30:18,840;30:24,440;"at their own 41, which is by far the best starting field position because the two drives"
30:24,440;30:28,120;"before that they started their three and at their own ninth. So this is like their first"
30:28,120;30:34,680;"chance to actually get somewhere and they don't. They don't do dick."
30:34,680;30:41,400;"Not about what well Brady took a shot to to patent right? That probably should have been"
30:41,400;30:46,800;"picked off. Yeah, but that was on third down. But the there was defensive holding call on"
30:46,800;30:51,800;"So they got another chance and then they deck that as well."
30:51,800;30:52,800;"They punted."
30:52,800;30:56,800;"I don't know if you noticed, but this was the combined tackle on the punt."
30:56,800;30:57,800;"It was actually a great tackle too."
30:57,800;31:05,800;"I'll make pin the Rams deep, but to start the Rams starting deep was tackled by like"
31:05,800;31:09,800;"Reibel and also our friend Matt Chatham."
31:09,800;31:11,800;"On that next on coverage."
31:11,800;31:17,760;"this I only I would only notice as we talked to him but when you talk about how Brian Cox is like on plan on one foot"
31:17,760;31:22,920;"He's like yeah, I can't cover and I like literally it was like Cox on coverage"
31:22,920;31:27,840;"That's some weird stuff where he's like he goes out and like the white the cornerback spot"
31:27,840;31:31,120;"Yeah, he was out covering somebody out like out past the numbers"
31:31,120;31:35,000;"Like I was like a fuck run and he almost like chase him down from behind"
31:36,480;31:41,040;"Yeah, no, he was in there for more plays than I remember because I was keeping an aisle for him too"
31:41,040;31:43,100;"And he was in there for a lot of like short-running plays"
31:43,100;31:43,860;"You made some time"
31:43,860;31:49,260;"But it's like those things like you don't you wouldn't that play would not have registered at all for me without that sort of"
31:49,260;31:55,520;"knowledge, oh, yeah, yeah, that's that's kind of why I wanted to do this because you kind of you're able to watch these games in a"
31:55,520;31:57,520;"different light because I"
31:57,520;32:00,000;"thought that I would be"
32:00,000;32:01,200;"cooler"
32:01,200;32:06,080;"Headed watching these games and I think in some spots I am and I'm recognizing things like that"
32:06,080;32:12,160;"Well, I'll do boys, but I'm still like tensing up during something. It's almost like I'm not"
32:12,160;32:19,200;"I'm gonna be I'll be honest with you Andy. I'm not really well, you know what happens dude"
32:19,200;32:24,800;"I know but it's still like I can't help myself doing like every time the the random at the ball and"
32:24,800;32:29,140;"Then they got the ball into Fox hands like my whole body kind of tense attack them"
32:30,080;32:33,280;"Even though I know how this goes and I've seen this play before"
32:33,280;32:38,720;"Steve I'm with Andy here really I'm getting worked up on these games for sure"
32:38,720;32:44,960;"I can't help myself and then even some of the other games we've done earlier season like I don't remember them at all"
32:44,960;32:48,400;"Yeah, I thought it's like watching a brand new game for me. It's great"
32:48,400;32:56,080;"Yeah, I thought that too when I thought it would kind of like tone down as I start remembering these games more and more"
32:56,080;32:58,800;"But just it hasn't I don't know why but these ones are just so"
32:58,800;33:01,920;"reaction. Yeah. And there are parts of them I don't remember to."
33:01,920;33:04,880;"Well, let's talk about the part we do remember Greg Brown. You"
33:04,880;33:06,640;"want to walk us through this?"
33:06,640;33:11,240;"Yeah, well, you mean the greatest play in Patriots history?"
33:11,240;33:17,760;"Possibly the greatest, like 10 seconds of my life up to that"
33:17,760;33:18,120;"point."
33:18,120;33:21,080;"There's no possible about that."
33:21,080;33:27,120;"So obviously we're talking about the tie law pick six."
33:27,120;33:31,440;"- There are down three, nothing, right?"
33:31,440;33:32,280;"At the time?"
33:32,280;33:33,120;"- Yeah, three nothing."
33:33,120;33:34,880;"- Yeah, maybe you like it."
33:34,880;33:35,720;"- I haven't got anything."
33:35,720;33:38,240;"- Yeah, halfway through the second quarter."
33:38,240;33:41,160;"And actually looking back, it was very similar"
33:41,160;33:45,360;"to the high tower sac strip against Atlanta."
33:45,360;33:46,200;"- I thought that too."
33:46,200;33:48,080;"- Where you just saw Vray will come off the side"
33:48,080;33:49,800;"and you're like, dude, no one touched him."
33:49,800;33:50,880;"- And you just saw him coming?"
33:50,880;33:51,920;"- Yeah, yeah."
33:51,920;33:55,720;"And then one or just kind of floats one up there"
33:55,720;34:05,980;"and Ty catches it in stride and does the infamous like hand up as he's crossing and then like the dusting of the ground celebration."
34:05,980;34:06,480;"Yeah."
34:06,480;34:06,980;"Yeah."
34:06,980;34:09,580;"Absolutely iconic."
34:09,580;34:16,900;"I used to do that after every good thing I did."
34:16,900;34:21,160;"I could see you making the bed."
34:21,160;34:22,880;"It takes a crash out of the room."
34:22,880;34:24,860;"He's like he's dusting the floor."
34:25,140;34:32,780;"Dude, I want, I wanted that after intercourse with Kelly and she was like,"
34:32,780;34:34,220;"what the fuck are you doing?"
34:34,220;34:39,540;"Like I was doing it to be funny, but she didn't get the joke."
34:39,540;34:44,780;"Cause remember the shrine I used to have?"
34:44,780;34:49,420;"Well, there was a, there was like a tile, a lot of corner of the shrine."
34:49,420;34:50,500;"Of course it was."
34:50,500;34:53,940;"And we just like, we did it in there because it was funny to do."
34:53,940;34:57,720;"And then after I started like doing the dance and doing the floor and she's like,"
34:57,720;34:58,640;"what are you doing?"
34:58,640;35:01,900;"I was like, you wouldn't understand."
35:01,900;35:06,120;"Does she understand that?"
35:06,120;35:06,940;"Yeah."
35:06,940;35:07,920;"No, she gets it now."
35:07,920;35:09,320;"I show a better question."
35:09,320;35:10,660;"Does she listen to these podcasts?"
35:10,660;35:12,000;"Probably not."
35:12,000;35:13,880;"You for you."
35:13,880;35:18,840;"So yeah, that was a big part of my childhood depth play."
35:18,840;35:21,040;"You know, it's still in the park."
35:21,040;35:21,560;"Clearly."
35:21,680;35:26,400;"Yeah, being a tie law fan and for him to get a pick six in the Super Bowl."
35:26,400;35:29,120;"Yeah, you know, on the biggest stage."
35:29,120;35:34,080;"It was just it was and then he was so swaggy about it too."
35:34,080;35:35,880;"That was like, because that's what you loved about"
35:35,880;35:40,520;"Tyler was that confidence and it was pretty special."
35:40,520;35:42,160;"Huge momentum play."
35:42,160;35:43,600;"Yeah."
35:43,600;35:46,520;"But I do have a note here that's a personal foul these days."
35:46,520;35:49,080;"That's true."
35:49,080;35:50,120;"He got him in the head."
35:50,120;35:51,120;"Pretty good."
35:51,120;35:52,120;"Yeah, they were."
35:52,120;35:53,120;"They were horrible."
35:53,120;35:57,320;"That right tackle just totally blew it to forget who it was."
35:57,320;35:58,320;"And then he goes out for us."
35:58,320;36:02,600;"I think it was just, well, that was the right tackle who was their backup because they're"
36:02,600;36:04,160;"original when it got hurt earlier."
36:04,160;36:06,000;"No, this was his last play, they said."
36:06,000;36:07,000;"This is the last half."
36:07,000;36:08,000;"That's right."
36:08,000;36:09,000;"Yeah."
36:09,000;36:10,000;"Oh, no, you're right."
36:10,000;36:11,000;"You're right."
36:11,000;36:12,000;"You're right."
36:12,000;36:13,640;"But like if you watch the replays, you can see him turn inside and then he turns and looks"
36:13,640;36:16,800;"at him going, crushing the quarterback and he like claps his hands."
36:16,800;36:18,440;"They're like, Oh shit."
36:18,440;36:25,040;"that one up. Yeah. And there before. Bear with me. I'm looking"
36:25,040;36:28,220;"something up real quick. And then Pat Summer all was like,"
36:28,220;36:36,080;"interception. Return for a touchdown. Jesus, Pat. My"
36:36,080;36:38,720;"new goal. Six celebration. Pat Summer on the other hand,"
36:38,720;36:39,760;"fucking blows."
36:39,760;36:45,400;"It's like, fuck, a wake up dude. Yeah, game going on. If you"
36:45,400;36:47,860;"don't get hype for a pick six in a Super Bowl, like, what are"
36:47,860;36:54,100;"right? Yeah. That was the second ever pick six in the Super Bowl."
36:54,100;36:56,820;"Ooh, can we is the first one something we'd know?"
36:56,820;37:02,620;"Um, maybe it happened the year before."
37:02,620;37:06,500;"Oh, that's the Ravens transfer ball."
37:06,500;37:07,820;"I don't remember that too much."
37:07,820;37:09,100;"It is. Yeah, me either."
37:09,100;37:11,420;"Oh, there's the one year after too, right?"
37:11,420;37:13,500;"Because that dude from the Tampa Bay."
37:13,500;37:14,620;"Oh, yeah."
37:14,620;37:15,820;"Didn't he win ever?"
37:15,820;37:16,900;"Yeah, he won MVP."
37:17,340;37:18,340;"They were three."
37:18,340;37:21,980;"The year after Jesus."
37:21,980;37:26,900;"So it was Kerry Collins got picked six by Dwayne Starks."
37:26,900;37:28,700;"I vaguely remember."
37:28,700;37:33,180;"And then the year after Rich Ganon through three"
37:33,180;37:35,900;"interceptions that were two by Dwight Smith."
37:35,900;37:39,180;"And one by Derek Brooks."
37:39,180;37:41,900;"Wait, who won the MVP on the box?"
37:41,900;37:42,780;"I hear."
37:42,780;37:44,580;"It's gonna be Dwight, right?"
37:44,580;37:46,020;"You would think of it."
37:46,020;37:47,020;"down."
37:47,020;37:48,020;"I'm a cluster."
37:48,020;37:49,020;"I'm not."
37:49,020;37:52,420;"But, uh, tell me what I was even on profile reference."
37:52,420;37:53,420;"I'm not seeing it."
37:53,420;37:54,420;"Super BPL three."
37:54,420;37:55,420;"Dude, Jackson."
37:55,420;38:00,420;"Baltimore won the Super Bowl year before against the Giants."
38:00,420;38:01,420;"Yeah."
38:01,420;38:04,020;"I have no recollection of that."
38:04,020;38:07,060;"It was like the boring, most boring game of all time."
38:07,060;38:10,860;"That was, that was the one where they had that historic defense."
38:10,860;38:11,860;"Yeah."
38:11,860;38:12,860;"Trent Dilfer."
38:12,860;38:14,860;"That's the one, the one that everybody had."
38:14,860;38:16,140;"as the worst quarterback ever."
38:16,140;38:17,260;"Is Ed Reed around?"
38:17,260;38:18,100;"He's not, right?"
38:18,100;38:19,300;"No, not yet."
38:19,300;38:20,100;"Not yet."
38:20,100;38:21,100;"Ray Lewis was, though."
38:21,100;38:21,220;"Yeah."
38:21,220;38:23,660;"I think that was his rookie year, maybe."
38:23,660;38:28,140;"Oh, is this like Brian Bullaware era?"
38:28,140;38:29,580;"Is that a name?"
38:29,580;38:30,220;"No."
38:30,220;38:32,260;"You think Kyle Bullaware?"
38:32,260;38:34,660;"No, Bullaware, the linebacker?"
38:34,660;38:36,460;"Oh, yeah."
38:36,460;38:38,100;"I think that makes sense."
38:38,100;38:38,980;"OK."
38:38,980;38:40,180;"Rod Woodson, right?"
38:40,180;38:41,980;"That's what Rod Woodson are."
38:41,980;38:42,780;"Oh, yeah."
38:42,780;38:44,300;"Well, at least we finally got an exciting"
38:44,300;38:46,020;"as you were for that snooze first here."
38:46,020;38:47,020;"- Steve was right though."
38:47,020;38:50,900;"Dexter Jackson, the safety was the MVP."
38:50,900;38:52,620;"That's a full 37."
38:52,620;38:53,940;"Fuck is Dexter Jackson?"
38:53,940;38:55,500;"And why was he the MVP?"
38:55,500;39:01,380;"- I think maybe screwed up your first three pick sixes"
39:01,380;39:02,300;"in a Super Bowl."
39:02,300;39:04,460;"- No, it's true."
39:04,460;39:07,740;"- And a guy who had two of them didn't win the MVP."
39:07,740;39:08,740;"- This is correct."
39:08,740;39:11,380;"I mean, Dexter Jackson also had two interceptions."
39:12,380;39:19,380;"Steve, can you can you stat check Andy's stat check what we what do you think the odds were for Dexter Jackson Super Bowl MVP?"
39:19,380;39:21,580;"Oh, uh, rages."
39:21,580;39:25,380;"How rages. I can't think of another like safety. Maybe, uh,"
39:25,380;39:29,780;"I think a defensive player won the Ravens one as well, but like not since then."
39:29,780;39:33,180;"He he he'll just fall into the category other."
39:33,180;39:36,180;"Yeah, really."
39:36,180;39:40,380;"You know, they don't even put the they don't even put up numbers on those dudes"
39:40,380;39:45,780;"Yeah, you got a call to get"
39:45,780;39:53,900;"All right, so Pat's up 7 3 now. Yeah things are looking good"
39:53,900;40:01,100;"This is how we wanted it to go. Yeah, and this the defense in this quarter was on just shit"
40:01,100;40:05,820;"I don't know. I thought they were getting chunk plays, but we were making some solid ones."
40:05,820;40:08,460;"Not easily. Because after that,"
40:08,460;40:15,500;"Bruceky basically just stonewalled Falk on the second of one, like one on one."
40:15,500;40:16,300;"Yeah. Yeah."
40:16,300;40:17,260;"Absolutely. Just perfect."
40:17,260;40:18,620;"One back of a get in it."
40:18,620;40:22,780;"And then the next play, Lord of Maloya, almost got his own pick."
40:22,780;40:28,700;"Yeah, but they also on that drive had that fumbled snap that they turned into like 15 yards."
40:28,700;40:30,860;"Oh yeah, current water was cool, common collective."
40:30,860;40:32,060;"And I had another one here."
40:32,060;40:33,260;"He snapped, picks it up."
40:33,260;40:38,460;"Everybody liked the entire offense and defensive line just stopped."
40:38,460;40:41,820;"And then like he had all the time in the world was completed in the past."
40:41,820;40:43,580;"I wonder if anyone's ever tried to fake that."
40:43,580;40:44,940;"It's a fumble rooskey."
40:44,940;40:45,740;"Ballsy."
40:45,740;40:46,780;"I think I do."
40:46,780;40:47,260;"What do you think?"
40:47,260;40:49,180;"It's a fumble snap."
40:49,180;40:49,740;"Yeah."
40:49,740;40:51,660;"It's a fake a fumble snap."
40:51,660;40:55,420;"Well, you just have the guy, the center, keep it and go."
40:55,420;40:57,020;"That's what the fumble rooskey is, isn't it?"
40:58,140;41:00,620;"Yeah, but it's not like a fumble."
41:00,620;41:01,900;"You're not putting the ball in there, right?"
41:01,900;41:03,980;"Well, I think they changed."
41:03,980;41:04,940;"Didn't they change the rules?"
41:04,940;41:07,580;"We actually have to like exchange the possession."
41:07,580;41:08,460;"I think so."
41:08,460;41:09,420;"People couldn't do that."
41:09,420;41:11,260;"Yeah, that sounds for me."
41:11,260;41:11,820;"It makes sense."
41:11,820;41:13,580;"So then they pumped it away."
41:13,580;41:16,940;"Troy Brown calls fear catch with like nobody within 15 yards of them."
41:16,940;41:18,940;"For sure."
41:18,940;41:23,420;"He would make up for it."
41:23,420;41:26,380;"Then I got it like a football or not football."
41:26,380;41:27,180;"I wasn't quite sure."
41:27,740;41:28,740;"Oh, okay."
41:28,740;41:33,860;"I know which, if this has to be the one I'm thinking of too."
41:33,860;41:36,220;"They said, I think it was John Madden."
41:36,220;41:42,460;"He said, throw a guy a bone and then you throw him two bones in a row."
41:42,460;41:44,660;"It's actually not the one I think."
41:44,660;41:46,380;"No, not the one I was thinking of either."
41:46,380;41:49,660;"You, Andy, you have to have the one I have written down."
41:49,660;41:50,660;"I'll say it."
41:50,660;41:51,660;"All right, you said it."
41:51,660;41:57,660;"When he said, what do you think Tylah thinks when he sees 270 pounds of meat coming at him?"
41:57,660;42:01,460;"I had something else actually."
42:01,460;42:02,460;"What?"
42:02,460;42:03,460;"I heard that."
42:03,460;42:06,660;"I was like, there's no way anybody missed that."
42:06,660;42:11,460;"I don't even know his name because they were talking about the Rams full back."
42:11,460;42:14,060;"And man goes, his nickname is me."
42:14,060;42:15,060;"Yeah."
42:15,060;42:18,260;"Never heard anybody more excited about a nickname."
42:18,260;42:20,460;"Yeah, that was the same play."
42:20,460;42:21,460;"Yeah."
42:21,460;42:22,460;"I mean, that's a great thing."
42:22,460;42:23,460;"Yeah."
42:23,460;42:24,460;"Yeah."
42:24,460;42:26,860;"Now, Madam was talking about I don't even remember the situation."
42:26,860;42:33,900;"I like something to do with having his fingers moving under there or something like that."
42:33,900;42:38,940;"I think everything had to do with with Kurt Warner getting his thumb hurt."
42:38,940;42:42,540;"It's like, oh, you know, when you when you have your fingers under there, things can happen."
42:42,540;42:43,900;"Oh, fuck."
42:43,900;42:51,340;"Shimp. But to answer his question, I bet Tyler was thinking, well, that's not going to fit."
42:56,380;42:57,580;"I ran that down too."
42:57,580;43:02,860;"I don't know. I think I think Tai Law has enough swag to think that it would fit."
43:02,860;43:05,980;"I can make this work. Yeah, I can handle it."
43:05,980;43:07,900;"You want 70 pounds of meat? No problem."
43:07,900;43:10,140;"They did make the tackle too. Yeah, yeah."
43:10,140;43:13,420;"Meat. That's an old school football name."
43:13,420;43:16,220;"Such a nickname for a fucking fullback."
43:16,220;43:19,180;"If your fullback's not named meat."
43:19,180;43:24,940;"So then we'll what stalled out with the Brady on that stunt sack, which had no chance on."
43:24,940;43:28,540;"on it back there in like their two-minute drill if I remember right."
43:28,540;43:31,580;"Yeah, they see, yeah, because this is getting towards the end of the second quarter."
43:31,580;43:36,540;"So they start moving the ball a bit and then Warner hits Ricky Pearl,"
43:36,540;43:42,700;"who he is obviously the guy who made the comments about,"
43:42,700;43:47,260;"like a night of dynasty is born. That's him."
43:47,260;43:48,620;"People were talking about it."
43:48,620;43:50,220;"What?"
43:50,220;43:52,140;"Them being a dynasty."
43:52,700;43:57,420;"I know, but he's the one before the game starts turn to the camera goes tonight to Dynasty"
43:57,420;43:59,340;"Oh"
43:59,340;44:07,820;"Yeah, and then like every time you catch a ball you would fucking celebrate a whole lot for the fucking four string writers"
44:07,820;44:15,580;"Oh, it sounds like Andy doesn't like Ricky Pearl. Well, I thought that I hated Ricky Pearl because he killed us in this game and rewatching it"
44:15,580;44:19,980;"I'm like no, I must have been thinking about Hakeem because he killed us in this game"
44:20,860;44:23,860;"No, you were thinking Ricky Pearl because he scored the game time touchdown"
44:23,860;44:28,340;"That's how I I think that's it and maybe it was a Carolina game - I remember him pretty pretty good in there"
44:28,340;44:31,340;"But so either way he definitely hates the Patriots"
44:31,340;44:37,380;"Yeah, no, I think we'll get to that later because I think he does score against the patrons in the Super Bowl"
44:37,380;44:42,540;"When he's with the Panthers as well, but in this quarter he fumbled a fucking ball like a Joe. He did"
44:42,540;44:46,140;"Fumbled it because of"
44:46,340;44:52,340;"Or boy Antoine Antoine Harris, baby. Yep shout out the most underrated"
44:52,340;44:56,900;"MVP candidate on this team"
44:56,900;45:03,380;"He's made a couple big plays lately. He's a lot better than Taren Shaw. That's actually back weeks"
45:03,380;45:07,980;"Well, we've got injured right didn't shock it injured on that Roman Fiver hit in the first quarter"
45:07,980;45:12,900;"Highways out there somebody I don't remember who it was I'm pretty sure it was Shaw"
45:13,700;45:21,540;"Yeah, but they're only playing all these guys because they're going with that five DB. Yeah. Oh my god"
45:21,540;45:25,860;"There's a stat here somewhere there is it"
45:25,860;45:30,740;"So here we go. So the patient's defense tonight. This is halfway through the third quarter"
45:30,740;45:35,380;"How many times they've played different amounts of defensive backs on the field"
45:35,380;45:37,700;"So"
45:37,700;45:41,140;"Your normal four defensive backs, you know two cornerbacks two safeties"
45:41,540;45:47,700;"They did that 12 times, five defensive backs, which is a nickel, 10 times, six defensive backs,"
45:47,700;45:52,420;"which is a dime, which you don't see very often. They've done that 15 times, and they've even"
45:52,420;45:58,180;"rolled out seven defensive backs three times after the quarter. Like that was obviously the"
45:58,180;46:03,940;"gay plane was just put nothing but past defenders out there. And then as soon as somebody catches"
46:03,940;46:08,500;"the ball, fucking light them up. And it worked. And they were so tight in the line, they were"
46:08,500;46:10,820;"They're jamming them every single time. Oh, yeah."
46:10,820;46:18,580;"Not one of my, but there was one play where I saw it was a screenplay to the tight end or something,"
46:18,580;46:21,700;"but Marshall Falk was lined up in the backfield and he ran kind of like an out."
46:21,700;46:26,980;"And really, again, as you could tell, his assignment was Marshall Falk."
46:26,980;46:32,820;"So he saw Marshall Falk going out and he just ran straight at him to the point where the"
46:33,860;46:37,860;"left tackle, like went out to go block him and realized like he couldn't because"
46:37,860;46:42,420;"William because he's running away from him. And William again is probably like 10 yards in the"
46:42,420;46:47,860;"backfield just lit the fuck into Marshall Falk and knocked him like 10 yards back and then came"
46:47,860;46:53,780;"back to me. So you got to do? Yeah. And that was the game plan. But and it worked all through. But"
46:53,780;46:57,540;"it was like you could just see immediately he just made a beeline straight to Marshall Falk,"
46:57,540;47:02,260;"knocked his ass over and then came back to get to make the plan. It was fantastic."
47:02,260;47:11,620;"Yeah, and I think like, and it's part of the reason it's a 14 point spread by that turf makes a huge difference."
47:11,620;47:15,380;"Like obviously it's part of their team nickname."
47:15,380;47:20,420;"We got Jake so that this team is built."
47:20,420;47:30,820;"Yeah, this team is built to play on this surface and the Patriots are coming off like, yeah, coming off two wins to get there that are like slug fest."
47:30,820;47:33,420;"So you can kind of understand where that spread game from."
47:33,420;47:34,300;"Oh, yeah."
47:34,300;47:36,860;"Especially since when they played in the Patriots."
47:36,860;47:42,380;"In in Foxboro on the non turf and they still put it."
47:42,380;47:42,980;"Yep."
47:42,980;47:45,420;"Looks sloppy doing it, but they still hold away at the end."
47:45,420;47:45,860;"No problem."
47:45,860;47:48,380;"I didn't notice like everybody was bleeding, though."
47:48,380;47:49,900;"Probably from falling on that turf."
47:49,900;47:50,780;"Oh, yeah."
47:50,780;47:52,540;"You're playing on that stuff?"
47:52,540;47:53,340;"No."
47:53,340;47:54,620;"Oh, I'll put indoor on it."
47:54,620;47:57,100;"Indoor soccer for a while back in the day."
47:57,100;47:58,100;"Yeah."
47:58,100;48:00,220;"Fucking terrible."
48:00,220;48:06,460;"It was just like a thin layer of like carpet with like covering concrete."
48:06,460;48:07,900;"It's green carpet on concrete."
48:07,900;48:09,260;"Yeah, it's awful."
48:09,260;48:11,260;"Yeah, the stuff they got now is great though."
48:11,260;48:12,380;"Little rubber pellets."
48:12,380;48:13,340;"Yeah, better."
48:13,340;48:14,140;"Big thing."
48:14,140;48:17,420;"You find rubber pellets in place you didn't even know you had like three days later."
48:17,420;48:22,460;"But from a visual standpoint, the turf is pretty cool."
48:22,460;48:24,140;"The green turf."
48:24,140;48:24,540;"Oh yeah."
48:24,540;48:24,780;"Yeah."
48:24,780;48:29,180;"Like the Pat's field doesn't look great on TV now at July."
48:29,180;48:33,180;"But the colors were popping in this game."
48:33,180;48:36,460;"The blue dries is on the green grass."
48:36,460;48:37,980;"I don't quote grass."
48:37,980;48:40,140;"Dude, imagine if the Rams had their old school"
48:40,140;48:43,020;"yellow and blue."
48:43,020;48:45,900;"That would have been cool."
48:45,900;48:48,940;"Or even the Patriots red."
48:48,940;48:51,420;"First thing."
48:51,420;48:55,340;"Anybody else got an erection?"
48:55,340;48:57,740;"Yeah, that sounded hard with me unzipping my pants."
48:57,740;49:01,660;"- That's, (laughs)"
49:01,660;49:03,540;"- So I wear sweatpants of these."
49:03,540;49:05,620;"(laughs)"
49:05,620;49:08,020;"- Who wears pants?"
49:08,020;49:10,580;"- It's true."
49:10,580;49:11,660;"- I don't know where to go."
49:11,660;49:12,500;"- I'll do it also."
49:12,500;49:15,900;"I went down the LA Kiss rabbit hole."
49:15,900;49:20,900;"I found the most disgusting pair of sweatpants ever."
49:20,900;49:23,220;"- For sale?"
49:23,220;49:24,060;"- Yeah, yeah."
49:24,860;49:28,620;"It's just like a full-sized gene Simmons face"
49:28,620;49:33,820;"Oh, yeah, I just did it"
49:33,820;49:37,620;"Well, I got the kiss where like their faces are right above your dick. Oh"
49:37,620;49:44,140;"Yeah, they have some of the tackiest shit ever I heard like a animal moaning"
49:44,140;49:48,180;"Really"
49:48,180;49:50,260;"That's not true. Yes"
49:53,020;49:55,020;"Stevie getting hungry"
49:55,020;49:59,900;"It's all the poo brewing okay"
49:59,900;50:06,780;"All right, let's move this along a bit. Yeah, we'll cut this but I know"
50:06,780;50:13,100;"So that first once they get that fault ball back from Ricky Pearl dropped on the ground like a loser"
50:13,100;50:17,460;"That first like Troy bubble screen"
50:17,460;50:20,460;"Yeah, but again, this is where I was like John Madden sweet"
50:20,460;50:26,060;"He's talking about his first up quickness and like what makes him a good screen receiver makes him a great punter turner and"
50:26,060;50:29,460;"Yep, again, I was like man, John man's knows the stuff"
50:29,460;50:32,220;"Yeah, but that was a huge fly there"
50:32,220;50:34,700;"It was massive, but I thought"
50:34,700;50:41,300;"I need a bigger play. This is gonna be my I think it's third one and the page is like just outside field of orange and"
50:41,300;50:45,900;"Kevin Falk takes like the toss sweep out of the shotgun"
50:45,900;50:47,540;"around"
50:47,540;50:49,540;"left tackle and"
50:49,860;50:53,660;"And the, the left tackle is the guy that Matt like got injured."
50:53,660;50:55,460;"And this guy had just come in for this drive."
50:55,460;50:58,100;"And I don't even recognize his name."
50:58,100;50:58,620;"Yeah."
50:58,620;51:00,660;"I mean, Williams, something Williams."
51:00,660;51:01,860;"Yeah, something Williams."
51:01,860;51:09,260;"And he pulled out and he blocked two guys on that one play and sprung."
51:09,260;51:12,860;"Fuck, not only for the first down, but was he was able to get out of bounds."
51:12,860;51:13,860;"Yeah."
51:13,860;51:14,820;"We get down to five."
51:14,820;51:15,060;"Yeah."
51:15,060;51:15,740;"Yeah."
51:15,740;51:19,540;"And then like two plays later, the brain and patent touchdown in the corner there."
51:19,540;51:26,380;"Shades of the week before blood soda patent in that back corner falling away"
51:26,380;51:34,580;"My best was like that in like the live broadcast that's on YouTube. They had like a different camera angle for that. Oh"
51:34,580;51:37,420;"Yeah, they like"
51:37,420;51:44,260;"Like usual is from like the corner of the end zone. Yeah, and I was like set up perfectly watch like Brady's throw to him"
51:44,260;51:47,860;"Oh, yeah, it was the perfect angle for that bliggle. Yeah, absolutely"
51:48,900;51:52,820;"Like I don't know you see it from the replays you think it puts a lot more air under it"
51:52,820;51:58,180;"But it wasn't it's kind of a bullet. Oh, yeah, he hooked it in there. That was a tough catch though"
51:58,180;52:00,900;"Yeah, I think it's a better catch than it was a throw"
52:00,900;52:06,100;"Yeah, I agree with that and it was an awesome route like oh, yeah"
52:06,100;52:11,220;"Game those wiggle hips, you know"
52:11,220;52:17,220;"See you later pretty pumped it - yeah, yeah, that was that out and up"
52:17,780;52:20,980;"get the guy to bite and then get behind him. Perfect."
52:20,980;52:25,300;"Yep. David Patton's only catch of the game. Oh, sure it was. Mm hmm."
52:25,300;52:29,980;"Yeah, because Patton had another play, but it wasn't. It's true. He had the reverse."
52:29,980;52:33,620;"Yep. Tom Brady out front lead."
52:33,620;52:37,540;"Well, blocking. They did that like dance his way through the"
52:37,540;52:43,300;"fight. Getting in the fray. Not great, Tom. Not great."
52:43,300;52:49,100;"they had a stat or this is the Rams first time trailing by more than eight points all year."
52:49,100;52:51,100;"Yeah, that was great."
52:51,100;52:52,100;"Yeah, that was great."
52:52,100;52:54,900;"At the end of this, at the end of the half."
52:54,900;53:01,300;"One was that that was Tom Brady's first touchdown pass in the last 83 attempts."
53:01,300;53:02,300;"A bomb."
53:02,300;53:04,300;"Not great, but timely."
53:04,300;53:08,220;"Yeah, this is the first time that the Rams have trailed by more than eight points this"
53:08,220;53:12,060;"season at all."
53:12,060;53:17,340;"And then right out on the ensuing kickoff for this, it was the biggest Super Bowl fact,"
53:17,340;53:20,100;"the biggest halftime deficit overcome is seven points."
53:20,100;53:22,140;"Oh, yeah, they love to play."
53:22,140;53:25,260;"Oh, it's covered now at 14 to three."
53:25,260;53:30,620;"But you know, it's great and kind of sets the table for, you know, your 20 of this podcast."
53:30,620;53:35,460;"But well, also that, I mean, that fumble is huge."
53:35,460;53:39,580;"Like, I don't think people really talk about that play much."
53:39,580;53:41,940;"Antoine Harris fumble, but I mean,"
53:41,940;53:47,540;"Mass, 14, three, if the Rams go down a score there,"
53:47,540;53:49,780;"I mean, you're talking about being down at half."
53:49,780;53:51,700;"This is a whole different."
53:51,700;53:54,420;"Yeah, having still seven three."
53:54,420;53:55,340;"And it's anybody's game."
53:55,340;53:58,220;"Yeah, it's worse down for 14, three."
53:58,220;54:01,300;"You go into that locker room thinking we can win this fucking thing, you know,"
54:01,300;54:04,860;"especially since the pages get in the ball back, like to have to do that,"
54:04,860;54:07,820;"like score and then get the ball back and try again."
54:09,300;54:10,900;"Like, yeah, it's a whole moment."
54:10,900;54:13,440;"And even like, I don't know, the offense hadn't done anything."
54:13,440;54:17,360;"And even this whole game in the offense doesn't really do much until that last drive."
54:17,360;54:19,200;"That's true. Yeah."
54:19,200;54:20,300;"Yeah. Every single season."
54:20,300;54:21,300;"Yeah."
54:21,300;54:23,300;"Yeah, whole season. Never mind this game."
54:23,300;54:29,000;"I can't think of a game this season where I've been like, wow, this this offense is a wagon."
54:29,000;54:31,400;"The only one was the."
54:31,400;54:34,000;"Didn't watch it."
54:34,000;54:34,500;"Yeah."
54:34,500;54:35,500;"Yeah."
54:37,100;54:39,260;"I'm checking out. Watch any of the games."
54:39,260;54:40,980;"I'm gonna wag it at all."
54:40,980;54:43,540;"- Based on what you guys have been telling me."
54:43,540;54:47,900;"- Now Bray look good in the game again."
54:47,900;54:49,780;"And he rallied them down from a lot."
54:49,780;54:51,540;"And the bass just said fucking go sling it."
54:51,540;54:53,340;"And he threw it like 50 something times."
54:53,340;54:55,100;"- Slick it Tommy."
54:55,100;54:55,940;"- Yeah, exactly."
54:55,940;54:58,700;"It's just one of those like typical games."
54:58,700;55:01,100;"But speaking of underrated plays in this game,"
55:01,100;55:05,060;"I thought the ensuing kickoff was huge."
55:05,060;55:06,060;"- Yeah, I have that some."
55:06,060;55:08,820;"30 seconds left in the half still."
55:08,820;55:12,380;"And it's the Rams, and we've seen them do this"
55:12,380;55:14,100;"to the Patriots last time they played."
55:14,100;55:15,500;"What are they?"
55:15,500;55:16,940;"Right before the half just went down"
55:16,940;55:21,700;"and completed plays of like at least 20 yards,"
55:21,700;55:22,540;"a bunch of them."
55:22,540;55:23,900;"And I think they kicked a field goal"
55:23,900;55:26,980;"or scored touchdown like right before the half."
55:26,980;55:29,580;"Typical what you see the Patriots do these days."
55:29,580;55:30,420;"- Great."
55:30,420;55:32,820;"- But Vinotary, and they actually sent Marshall"
55:32,820;55:38,700;"fall back to return the kick to instead of yo Murphy and"
55:38,700;55:45,100;"Vinotary kicks it away from fog like right on the the sidelines."
55:45,100;55:48,060;"So that when he when fall catches it, his momentum takes"
55:48,060;55:50,340;"him out of bounds at the six, which you could just let it"
55:50,340;55:52,060;"bounce and it probably going out of bounds."
55:52,060;55:52,660;"Exactly."
55:52,660;55:55,460;"It was a super ballsy kick to do in the fucking Super Bowl."
55:55,460;55:58,820;"Because if he if he lets out bounce out of bounds, the"
55:58,820;56:01,380;"ranks of the ball to 40 and it's a completely different"
56:01,380;56:05,220;"things. It's not 30 seconds left instead of being at your own six and they just take a knee and go"
56:05,220;56:10,100;"into half. So two plays change this whole shape of this, the Super Bowl."
56:10,100;56:13,860;"Yeah, I don't think Marshall Falk was comfortable doing it."
56:13,860;56:17,860;"No, I don't think he returns kicks very often. You know what?"
56:17,860;56:21,780;"Someone needs to tell Mike Martz, do your job."
56:21,780;56:28,420;"And yo Murphy was good. He was a good guy. He had that 40 yard return to open the game."
56:28,420;56:30,180;"and I thought he actually forgot him."
56:30,180;56:31,380;"Pretty good spark."
56:31,380;56:33,980;"- And that's the whole theory behind it all is right?"
56:33,980;56:36,640;"Is like don't change things just"
56:36,640;56:37,980;"'cause this is an important game."
56:37,980;56:41,460;"Just do your job and Mike March is going, oh God."
56:41,460;56:42,460;"We need to do something here."
56:42,460;56:44,460;"- We're down 14th, we need a spark."
56:44,460;56:45,540;"- Yeah."
56:45,540;56:47,620;"No, don't do that."
56:47,620;56:49,960;"Just do your job."
56:49,960;56:53,460;"- You want to hear a quote from John Madden?"
56:53,460;56:54,460;"- Yeah."
56:54,460;56:56,780;"- This Patriots defense has done their job."
56:57,940;56:59,800;"Yeah. Why did you write that down?"
56:59,800;57:05,140;"Because it would be a fucking quote later on from Bill Balanchak."
57:05,140;57:06,260;"Okay. All right."
57:06,260;57:09,580;"I thought you were just writing down everything you've heard for the next"
57:09,580;57:10,900;"like 20 fucking years."
57:10,900;57:12,940;"How many pages you got over there, Andy?"
57:12,940;57:18,140;"Uh, I know you know, it's I have four pages and then I have all the screenshots."
57:18,140;57:18,700;"So it turns out."
57:18,700;57:22,020;"I know you send us your show notes."
57:22,020;57:22,900;"I never read them."
57:22,900;57:24,100;"I'd never read them either."
57:24,100;57:24,700;"I don't even know."
57:27,260;57:29,260;"I think my own notes. I have two and a half pages."
57:29,260;57:33,620;"I have a half a page on Kurt Warner and then nothing else."
57:33,620;57:39,020;"You didn't watch the game and somehow you're contributing."
57:39,020;57:41,420;"God damn it."
57:41,420;57:42,540;"Rain man."
57:42,540;57:44,500;"Yeah. Exactly."
57:44,500;57:45,700;"It's a good job. You're good at this."
57:45,700;57:47,300;"It's the only thing I am good at."
57:47,300;57:48,020;"That's right."
57:48,020;57:50,940;"We had our own little spark on the second half kickoff."
57:50,940;57:52,380;"Patrick Bass."
57:52,380;57:55,020;"Hell yeah. We're trying to that kickoff to the 30."
57:55,020;57:58,180;"Yeah, well, he was like dead to rights in the 15."
57:58,180;58:00,260;"Yeah, you just squirted out."
58:00,260;58:01,260;"Yeah."
58:01,260;58:02,700;"That's what I'm not wearing this year."
58:02,700;58:06,700;"Like this season, he has a better kicker turn than I ever imagined."
58:06,700;58:09,460;"Yeah, he's a little back too, right?"
58:09,460;58:10,420;"Technically."
58:10,420;58:10,940;"Was he?"
58:10,940;58:12,220;"Oh, he was a half-back."
58:12,220;58:13,500;"I think he was a running back."
58:13,500;58:14,980;"Yeah, but he was he was big."
58:14,980;58:16,740;"He was built like a brick ship host."
58:16,740;58:19,900;"Is that what a half-back is?"
58:19,900;58:22,740;"Somewhere between running back and a full-back?"
58:22,740;58:26,340;"I think half back was just originally a running back."
58:26,340;58:31,300;"Yeah, it was that position like they back in the, but you never made sense."
58:31,300;58:31,740;"Why is it?"
58:31,740;58:35,140;"I just I just invented a fucking perfect description, didn't I?"
58:35,140;58:36,460;"Love it."
58:36,460;58:37,220;"Sure."
58:37,220;58:39,540;"He's somewhere between a full bag and a running bag, right?"
58:39,540;58:42,380;"Patrick Pass, half back."
58:42,380;58:43,980;"Why don't you call him a half a half back?"
58:43,980;58:44,780;"He's a quarterback."
58:44,780;58:45,780;"There's a quarter back."
58:45,780;58:47,780;"I see what you did there, Steve."
58:49,780;58:53,220;"Yo, your mom so dumb she thought a quarterback was a refund."
58:53,220;58:59,460;"That was my go-to joke when I was a kid."
58:59,460;59:00,980;"Shocking."
59:00,980;59:07,380;"It doesn't really work when I say it's my brothers but you know, you got the point."
59:07,380;59:12,580;"Luckily we know mom doesn't listen to this even though we've been shouting right every fucking"
59:12,580;59:20,180;"up as a. Then they come out with a ton of Antoine. He was this is some of his best friends"
59:20,180;59:25,060;"the game here. Yeah. And then they actually I thought they were going for the dagger because"
59:25,060;59:29,780;"Brady tried to hit Pat and deep and Pat had like two steps on the guy and Brady just missed"
59:29,780;59:35,540;"him. Yeah. I didn't call them to call that play. Like Kona. Yeah. He did. Like this is"
59:35,540;59:38,980;"the time where you take a shot and that's exactly what happened. And I don't think it"
59:38,980;59:39,820;"- You can't kill the momentum."
59:39,820;59:40,640;"- You can't tap there."
59:40,640;59:41,740;"- It's where the touch on this game's over."
59:41,740;59:42,580;"It's like how--"
59:42,580;59:43,420;"- I feel like it can kill the momentum."
59:43,420;59:44,420;"I feel like they could have just kept"
59:44,420;59:48,460;"grinding it with David Patton."
59:48,460;59:51,420;"- Fuck was that?"
59:51,420;59:52,900;"- Mom's trying to video me."
59:52,900;59:56,020;"- She knows."
59:56,020;59:59,740;"- You know I'm a damn podcast, huh?"
59:59,740;01:00:00,580;"- Yeah."
01:00:00,580;01:00:01,420;"- You can do it."
01:00:01,420;01:00:03,260;"- You won't come on in the other way."
01:00:03,260;01:00:04,100;"- Answer it."
01:00:04,100;01:00:05,020;"- Answer it."
01:00:05,020;01:00:05,860;"- All right."
01:00:05,860;01:00:07,260;"I can video if you want."
01:00:07,260;01:00:08,860;"- You decline, mom."
01:00:08,860;01:00:10,660;"I just let her go to voicemail."
01:00:10,660;01:00:12,900;"(laughing)"
01:00:12,900;01:00:15,020;"- It's on the phone, can you?"
01:00:15,020;01:00:16,020;"- Yeah."
01:00:16,020;01:00:16,860;"- Mom!"
01:00:16,860;01:00:19,860;"- Oh God, we do this every time, don't we?"
01:00:19,860;01:00:20,700;"- Mom!"
01:00:20,700;01:00:21,540;"- Mom!"
01:00:21,540;01:00:24,180;"- Oh, she can't figure out the phone."
01:00:24,180;01:00:26,420;"- You can't figure out technology, that's a shocker."
01:00:26,420;01:00:27,940;"- Look at the verbi--"
01:00:27,940;01:00:29,340;"I can't hear you very well."
01:00:29,340;01:00:30,180;"(laughing)"
01:00:30,180;01:00:33,860;"- Oh, you're in the middle of a party of doing your thing!"
01:00:33,860;01:00:34,700;"- Hi, Mom!"
01:00:34,700;01:00:35,540;"- Hi, Mom!"
01:00:35,540;01:00:38,660;"- Oh my goodness, you're in the middle of it!"
01:00:38,660;01:00:39,660;"Yeah, we don't."
01:00:39,660;01:00:41,300;"So are you, mom."
01:00:41,300;01:00:43,260;"You're in the middle of a two."
01:00:43,260;01:00:43,560;"Yeah."
01:00:43,560;01:00:47,420;"You're just talking about how you never listened to us because you don't care."
01:00:47,420;01:00:51,140;"You keep saying you will, mom."
01:00:51,140;01:00:52,940;"You say you will."
01:00:52,940;01:00:57,860;"She'll figure out podcasts in the next 20 years."
01:00:57,860;01:00:59,540;"It'll be great."
01:00:59,540;01:01:04,580;"Riveting radio."
01:01:04,580;01:01:05,700;"Thanks, Bob."
01:01:05,700;01:01:06,540;"Yeah."
01:01:06,540;01:01:07,300;"I love you, mom."
01:01:07,300;01:01:10,380;"- Bye mom. - Bye mom."
01:01:10,380;01:01:11,780;"(laughing)"
01:01:11,780;01:01:13,220;"- That's great."
01:01:13,220;01:01:14,060;"- God damn it."
01:01:14,060;01:01:15,700;"- Finally got her on the podcast."
01:01:15,700;01:01:16,540;"- Yeah."
01:01:16,540;01:01:17,380;"- Yeah, right."
01:01:17,380;01:01:18,340;"- Four months."
01:01:18,340;01:01:20,260;"- How often do you call your mother, Steve?"
01:01:20,260;01:01:22,980;"- She calls him all the time."
01:01:22,980;01:01:26,540;"- That's a very 10 days maybe."
01:01:26,540;01:01:29,780;"- Oh, she calls me like every three days"
01:01:29,780;01:01:30,900;"and complains about you."
01:01:30,900;01:01:33,100;"So I figured it was more free."
01:01:33,100;01:01:34,620;"- She calls me everything and complains about you."
01:01:34,620;01:01:36,340;"- She was just calling me to tell me how much"
01:01:36,340;01:01:38,740;"a good, good boy. I am. That's the rest. Whoa."
01:01:38,740;01:01:43,220;"So it's funny."
01:01:43,220;01:01:50,680;"All right. Where were we? Antoine Smith just pound in the rock."
01:01:50,680;01:01:53,500;"Yeah. But I feel like they killed momentum by taking that shot"
01:01:53,500;01:02:00,060;"there. I know I kind of like. Yeah, I liked his rationale. What's"
01:02:00,060;01:02:05,180;"his name? John Mann. John Mann. You know, you're already up."
01:02:05,640;01:02:07,600;"They're expecting you to ground and pound."
01:02:07,600;01:02:09,120;"You're in good field position."
01:02:09,120;01:02:10,760;"And pounding was working."
01:02:10,760;01:02:12,280;"Yeah, they've been in the shot."
01:02:12,280;01:02:13,600;"They do like hit that."
01:02:13,600;01:02:15,800;"Play to Jay, our Edmund that loses three yards."
01:02:15,800;01:02:17,480;"Now it's third and 13 and like."
01:02:17,480;01:02:19,680;"They're not even in field goal range."
01:02:19,680;01:02:20,640;"And they end up punching it away."
01:02:20,640;01:02:23,000;"Yeah, but if he hits that, that was open."
01:02:23,000;01:02:24,240;"It was the right play call."
01:02:24,240;01:02:25,560;"Yeah, I just did next."
01:02:25,560;01:02:26,320;"I just missed it."
01:02:26,320;01:02:27,040;"Yeah."
01:02:27,040;01:02:33,240;"Brady Sneaky has been bad at the deep ball this season."
01:02:33,680;01:02:35,380;"I got way better at that than."
01:02:35,380;01:02:38,880;"Yeah, even like only couple seasons later."
01:02:38,880;01:02:39,240;"All."
01:02:39,240;01:02:39,640;"Yeah."
01:02:39,640;01:02:40,640;"In the Pittsburgh."
01:02:40,640;01:02:43,220;"Well, you guys crucified me on the Brady emergency episode"
01:02:43,220;01:02:45,220;"by saying it's never a great deep ball for our."
01:02:45,220;01:02:46,760;"That's true."
01:02:46,760;01:02:48,960;"He comes a great deep ball for me."
01:02:48,960;01:02:50,520;"He's always has never been the strength."
01:02:50,520;01:02:53,060;"I thought he was like, he becomes decent and pretty good."
01:02:53,060;01:02:54,560;"But that was never his game."
01:02:54,560;01:02:57,600;"You fucking listen here, Steve."
01:02:57,600;01:03:00,400;"How dare you?"
01:03:03,600;01:03:06,960;"- That's why I'm not like zone coverage."
01:03:06,960;01:03:09,360;"- We have another chat I'm citing right after this."
01:03:09,360;01:03:10,200;"- Yes."
01:03:10,200;01:03:14,000;"Not one of his better things."
01:03:14,000;01:03:14,840;"- No."
01:03:14,840;01:03:17,280;"- It's called for a fair catch interference"
01:03:17,280;01:03:20,600;"and please voraciously with a referee."
01:03:20,600;01:03:21,600;"- He didn't."
01:03:21,600;01:03:23,680;"It was very, very close though."
01:03:23,680;01:03:26,160;"- It was real close to that not being a didn't,"
01:03:26,160;01:03:28,280;"but yeah, yeah, it got away with it."
01:03:28,280;01:03:31,200;"So the Rams started their own 15"
01:03:31,200;01:03:33,640;"instead of further down the field than that."
01:03:33,640;01:03:39,280;"And this is where Warner just starts taking shots."
01:03:39,280;01:03:42,000;"Like they were still driving the ball,"
01:03:42,000;01:03:44,480;"but I think they made it to about midfield"
01:03:44,480;01:03:47,680;"and then he took three like real shots in a row."
01:03:47,680;01:03:50,160;"- Yeah, Big Rich got him real good on one."
01:03:50,160;01:03:53,000;"- Yeah, that was the one where he,"
01:03:53,000;01:03:56,400;"you just tossed the guard aside like he wasn't there."
01:03:56,400;01:03:58,640;"- And like the next play, Fyfer,"
01:03:58,640;01:04:01,200;"Cause I delayed safety, but some just absolutely blows up again."
01:04:01,200;01:04:01,760;"Yeah."
01:04:01,760;01:04:03,800;"He's a tough son of a bitch."
01:04:03,800;01:04:04,200;"Warner."
01:04:04,200;01:04:04,880;"Yeah."
01:04:04,880;01:04:06,000;"Oh, yeah."
01:04:06,000;01:04:08,720;"He was, he was just standing there taking it the whole time."
01:04:08,720;01:04:09,920;"He was bleeding from the channel."
01:04:09,920;01:04:10,560;"So it's a shit."
01:04:10,560;01:04:12,640;"It's like Warner."
01:04:12,640;01:04:13,320;"Yeah."
01:04:13,320;01:04:14,160;"How do I like them too?"
01:04:14,160;01:04:14,960;"Yeah."
01:04:14,960;01:04:18,440;"I want him to be the new Monday, uh, yeah, Monday night guy."
01:04:18,440;01:04:21,280;"I think he does the radio."
01:04:21,280;01:04:22,480;"Oh, does it?"
01:04:22,480;01:04:23,160;"Or Monday night."
01:04:23,160;01:04:23,640;"Yeah."
01:04:23,640;01:04:25,120;"He's pretty good."
01:04:25,120;01:04:26,160;"I'd better be good."
01:04:26,160;01:04:26,440;"Yeah."
01:04:26,440;01:04:26,960;"Yeah."
01:04:26,960;01:04:27,760;"He's certainly better."
01:04:28,120;01:04:33,040;"have a good grasp of how the game works, you know, to the Brett"
01:04:33,040;01:04:35,260;"Farriff. Maybe."
01:04:35,260;01:04:39,040;"There he's a good old boy. You can't tell me Brett Farriff is"
01:04:39,040;01:04:43,360;"in charismatic. That's probably true. Everybody loves Brett"
01:04:43,360;01:04:46,000;"Farriff. Yeah, he's going to ad lib the whole thing."
01:04:46,000;01:04:51,720;"You're gonna get a bunch of shit wrong too, but he also"
01:04:51,720;01:04:52,600;"got a bunch of shit right."
01:04:52,600;01:04:53,880;"I'm like, I"
01:04:55,880;01:04:58,560;"Yeah, I'm with times I gave his gunslayer."
01:04:58,560;01:05:03,680;"Oh, he just shows up in a Patrick Mahomes game."
01:05:03,680;01:05:05,400;"Yeah. Oh, God."
01:05:05,400;01:05:09,720;"He doesn't wear a suit. He just comes in his blue jeans."
01:05:09,720;01:05:14,240;"The blue jean tuxedo."
01:05:14,240;01:05:16,880;"Canadian tuxedo Andy."
01:05:16,880;01:05:17,560;"Yeah, whatever."
01:05:17,560;01:05:18,240;"Dead in Texas."
01:05:18,240;01:05:19,320;"What the fuck you want?"
01:05:19,320;01:05:20,920;"We don't tuxedo shame here."
01:05:20,920;01:05:22,800;"That's true."
01:05:22,800;01:05:24,840;"They're beating up on the wider receivers, too."
01:05:25,240;01:05:28,720;"There's that one play like it was weird like I guess it was part of their thing"
01:05:28,720;01:05:32,520;"But like the wide receivers hit the ground before they got tackled. Yeah"
01:05:32,520;01:05:35,200;"Madden even called that out. He's like yeah"
01:05:35,200;01:05:38,600;"Yeah, they do think where they get as far as they can then they just fall over like"
01:05:38,600;01:05:44,160;"Malloy just blows him up instead of like having him down"
01:05:44,160;01:05:48,000;"It wasn't like and I'm pretty sure that's illegal now, too"
01:05:48,000;01:05:51,280;"Yeah, and then it probably was legal then but"
01:05:52,600;01:05:54,240;"What is like the ass Mac?"
01:05:54,240;01:05:55,040;"It's like I'm sorry."
01:05:55,040;01:05:57,880;"And Chris just whips his ass."
01:05:57,880;01:05:58,960;"The accent right back."
01:05:58,960;01:05:59,680;"Yeah."
01:05:59,680;01:06:03,040;"Oh, yeah, that was great."
01:06:03,040;01:06:05,680;"Well, that that's the whole thing."
01:06:05,680;01:06:10,280;"Like I think they're getting in their heads by just being like overtly physical with the receivers."
01:06:10,280;01:06:11,280;"Yeah."
01:06:11,280;01:06:16,400;"And I think it was getting a Warner's head to because all the timing thrown off and he was running for his life at this point."
01:06:16,400;01:06:20,080;"And we had time a bunch too, but he couldn't find people open."
01:06:20,080;01:06:20,800;"So it wasn't like."
01:06:22,080;01:06:24,080;"I think that time was really thrown off."
01:06:24,080;01:06:26,480;"Yeah, and then the rush would eventually get to him and then he was"
01:06:26,480;01:06:32,080;"Hagging there's always a could to like hopefully somebody would get open. He would just start taking shots"
01:06:32,080;01:06:38,000;"You gotta think like those corners that they're just flooding the field with all played pretty well"
01:06:38,000;01:06:40,160;"It's a tough"
01:06:40,160;01:06:43,120;"Ask that's probably why Hakim did so well as you're asking"
01:06:43,120;01:06:45,840;"Wheatley and shawd"
01:06:45,840;01:06:48,160;"Our boy to kind try and cover him"
01:06:48,960;01:06:51,720;"Well, that's there. That's always been the patient's events of game plan to"
01:06:51,720;01:06:56,000;"take away your best options and have you beat them with your third guy, right?"
01:06:56,000;01:06:59,440;"But I mean, the third guy is awesome on this team too."
01:06:59,440;01:07:02,440;"It's true. Yeah. I mean, you could even make a case for Ricky"
01:07:02,440;01:07:04,080;"Pro as much as I do. Good."
01:07:04,080;01:07:05,160;"Why does he ever?"
01:07:05,160;01:07:07,800;"Like Trung candidate at the K touch towns."
01:07:07,800;01:07:10,680;"Right. Yeah. I read your notes, Andy."
01:07:10,680;01:07:12,520;"Just now."
01:07:12,520;01:07:14,240;"I read them."
01:07:14,240;01:07:16,640;"I was just giving you a hard time."
01:07:17,520;01:07:18,960;"I read them sometimes, but not."
01:07:18,960;01:07:20,560;"If you read them, you'd know you had six sessions."
01:07:20,560;01:07:21,160;"That's OK."
01:07:21,160;01:07:21,640;"Six?"
01:07:21,640;01:07:24,240;"That's still a lot for backup running back."
01:07:24,240;01:07:25,000;"Yeah."
01:07:25,000;01:07:28,480;"And he something about him being like a key for."
01:07:28,480;01:07:30,520;"Key for Sutherland character."
01:07:30,520;01:07:33,480;"His name sounds like a bad Fox TV drama."
01:07:33,480;01:07:33,920;"Yeah."
01:07:33,920;01:07:35,400;"He's a little one."
01:07:35,400;01:07:36,920;"That may be on Canada."
01:07:36,920;01:07:39,440;"The drunk candidate Tuesday nights at nine."
01:07:39,440;01:07:44,280;"Only on Fox."
01:07:44,280;01:07:44,800;"Yeah."
01:07:44,800;01:07:45,400;"Yeah."
01:07:45,400;01:07:47,680;"So yeah, this team is just a wagon, right?"
01:07:47,680;01:07:49,960;"You have to have a perfect game."
01:07:49,960;01:07:52,760;"Not only-- I mean, you see the game plan,"
01:07:52,760;01:07:55,720;"and I bet it's not that crazy to think of, right?"
01:07:55,720;01:07:56,760;"Get physical with them."
01:07:56,760;01:07:59,320;"A lot of teams probably thought that."
01:07:59,320;01:08:01,760;"But this is like--"
01:08:01,760;01:08:04,080;"I think the seven perfect execution, right?"
01:08:04,080;01:08:08,000;"You get turn over, opportunistic turnovers."
01:08:08,000;01:08:09,560;"You scored points on defense."
01:08:09,560;01:08:11,680;"You're hitting them at every opportunity."
01:08:11,680;01:08:13,640;"I mean, they're still gaining a decent amount of yards,"
01:08:13,640;01:08:14,120;"but--"
01:08:14,120;01:08:14,600;"Why?"
01:08:14,600;01:08:17,360;"you've held them to three points through three quarters."
01:08:17,360;01:08:21,000;"It's about as good as you can ask for."
01:08:21,000;01:08:22,520;"- You can run the ball."
01:08:22,520;01:08:23,360;"- Yeah."
01:08:23,360;01:08:24,440;"- Turn the clock a bit."
01:08:24,440;01:08:25,280;"- Yeah."
01:08:25,280;01:08:26,120;"- I mean, like Chad and said,"
01:08:26,120;01:08:27,440;"if they hadn't played them early in their year,"
01:08:27,440;01:08:29,280;"I bet they lose this game."
01:08:29,280;01:08:30,120;"- Yeah."
01:08:30,120;01:08:30,960;"- I said that too."
01:08:30,960;01:08:34,040;"In that game, I said it was the most important loss"
01:08:34,040;01:08:36,560;"of the Patriots dynasty."
01:08:36,560;01:08:39,120;"And I was laughed out of the room by Greg and Mike."
01:08:39,120;01:08:39,960;"- Yes, fair."
01:08:39,960;01:08:43,360;"- Well, I just disagree with anything you say."
01:08:44,560;01:08:53,400;"really hadn't noticed that hasn't been going off in fucking 30 years I'm just"
01:08:53,400;01:09:00,760;"I'm just testing you to see how strong your convictions are like any good"
01:09:00,760;01:09:11,060;"brother would do speaking of passing convictions the next"
01:09:11,060;01:09:13,060;"Brahms drive"
01:09:13,060;01:09:16,060;"Kurt Warner has picked off again my OTIS"
01:09:16,060;01:09:22,340;"Otis I've forgotten about this interception to be honest. I always forget about this one every time"
01:09:22,340;01:09:26,580;"I'm just done. This is like the the sleepy turnover like that, you know"
01:09:26,580;01:09:30,620;"Everyone remembers the Ricky Pearl fumble and the obviously tie-law pick six"
01:09:30,620;01:09:32,340;"Mm-hmm"
01:09:32,340;01:09:36,220;"Both out this, you know, Patriots are driving to tie the game and not"
01:09:36,220;01:09:38,060;"to win it"
01:09:38,060;01:09:39,380;"right, yeah"
01:09:39,380;01:09:45,060;"Because this turns into well, this was the the direct snap to fog that yeah"
01:09:45,060;01:09:50,220;"I pulled some raw but even before that the play before that or to play before they tried"
01:09:50,220;01:09:55,100;"Running back past with Kevin fog which I had completely forgotten about"
01:09:55,100;01:09:57,420;"didn't play at all and"
01:09:57,420;01:10:02,020;"Fulk the pressure was so great that he just had to like pull down and you get smart"
01:10:02,020;01:10:06,340;"Yeah, we discovered anyways. Did you see that angle? No?"
01:10:06,980;01:10:09,980;"Yeah, the guy was like strive for strive with the receiver"
01:10:09,980;01:10:15,220;"Yeah, and whoever that defensive end of was his name. He was he blew his block up and was right on flop to yeah"
01:10:15,220;01:10:16,340;"What is the name Greg?"
01:10:16,340;01:10:22,660;"Yeah, um space until yeah, you're the one that brought him up earlier as well. Uh, windstrom. Yeah"
01:10:22,660;01:10:27,060;"Yeah, he blew up playoff as well. But yeah, at least a"
01:10:27,060;01:10:31,300;"military field goals an hour at 17 3 going into the fourth quarter"
01:10:31,300;01:10:34,260;"So yeah without that"
01:10:34,260;01:10:37,260;"The Rams score two touchdown be down, which is exactly what happened"
01:10:37,260;01:10:42,220;"But I mean, I don't know if there are any more things to talk about in the third quarter do best and worse"
01:10:42,220;01:10:47,060;"Let's see you guys have some I blew up my best with that summer. I'll get in foil by that direct snap"
01:10:47,060;01:10:49,060;"I know that's my favorite"
01:10:49,060;01:10:57,100;"Yeah, let's jump into the fourth quarter. Yeah, cuz this is this is where it gets good"
01:10:57,100;01:11:00,500;"Well the Rams start kind of figuring it out"
01:11:01,380;01:11:07,180;"Well, yeah, all right, so good. I mean it ends good, but it starts does it well"
01:11:07,180;01:11:13,620;"It starts really good because really grams drive all the way down and they go in front of fourth and goal from the three"
01:11:13,620;01:11:17,360;"Even before that dude. He almost threw two pigs back to back plate"
01:11:17,360;01:11:20,740;"That he didn't see all"
01:11:20,740;01:11:23,340;"Ty almost had a pick"
01:11:23,340;01:11:25,340;"Yeah on the on the third down"
01:11:25,340;01:11:26,780;"It's got a fade and tie low."
01:11:26,780;01:11:28,460;"It only goes hands on it."
01:11:28,460;01:11:28,940;"And then--"
01:11:28,940;01:11:31,780;"Surprising went for it."
01:11:31,780;01:11:34,020;"You kind of had to at this point."
01:11:34,020;01:11:35,020;"Yeah, I guess."
01:11:35,020;01:11:36,340;"There was a wet touch down."
01:11:36,340;01:11:38,060;"It was kind of rarely."
01:11:38,060;01:11:40,020;"Yeah, I was right at the beginning of that at the quarter."
01:11:40,020;01:11:41,500;"But you down two touchdowns?"
01:11:41,500;01:11:43,740;"Yeah, 10 and a half."
01:11:43,740;01:11:45,340;"In this day and age, you probably"
01:11:45,340;01:11:47,140;"keep the field goal because there's a lot more scoring."
01:11:47,140;01:11:51,100;"But I think back then, might have been a different calculation."
01:11:51,100;01:11:51,980;"That's true."
01:11:51,980;01:11:53,300;"Maybe."
01:11:53,300;01:11:54,940;"but there's also a lot of scoring on both ends."
01:11:54,940;01:11:56,580;"So I think you go."
01:11:56,580;01:11:59,300;"Yeah, the fourth and goal from the three"
01:11:59,300;01:12:00,820;"worn out drops back to pass."
01:12:00,820;01:12:04,500;"Nobody's open, mainly because Lillian Agnes"
01:12:04,500;01:12:07,080;"has formed tackles."
01:12:07,080;01:12:09,380;"Marshall Falk coming out of the backfield."
01:12:09,380;01:12:11,260;"Within five yards."
01:12:11,260;01:12:12,420;"Oh, God, here we go."
01:12:12,420;01:12:13,260;"Five yards."
01:12:13,260;01:12:13,760;"Five yards."
01:12:13,760;01:12:14,780;"There we go."
01:12:14,780;01:12:16,700;"I can't actually tackle it, I don't think."
01:12:16,700;01:12:17,220;"Welcome to the--"
01:12:17,220;01:12:18,380;"He didn't like to give it a ground."
01:12:18,380;01:12:19,180;"Bins, dude."
01:12:19,180;01:12:20,180;"He tried."
01:12:20,180;01:12:21,740;"He involved them."
01:12:21,740;01:12:22,620;"Yeah, he involved them."
01:12:22,620;01:12:23,760;"somebody's in a five yard."
01:12:23,760;01:12:24,240;"So you can do it."
01:12:24,240;01:12:28,080;"If you want John, you can't hold people though, Steve."
01:12:28,080;01:12:29,000;"You can make contact."
01:12:29,000;01:12:30,000;"You can't hold them."
01:12:30,000;01:12:31,580;"They didn't call holding."
01:12:31,580;01:12:32,880;"Yes, it is."
01:12:32,880;01:12:33,320;"Yeah."
01:12:33,320;01:12:34,680;"I thought it was like PI or something."
01:12:34,680;01:12:36,040;"No, holding."
01:12:36,040;01:12:37,120;"Yeah."
01:12:37,120;01:12:41,160;"But the result of the play is Warner scrambles."
01:12:41,160;01:12:43,040;"Tries to die for the touchdown."
01:12:43,040;01:12:44,760;"If you want to call it scrambles."
01:12:44,760;01:12:46,920;"I was like, I was always."
01:12:46,920;01:12:48,480;"I was always a Warner."
01:12:48,480;01:12:51,240;"Who's faster, Brady Warner?"
01:12:52,200;01:12:54,200;"Oh, Jesus."
01:12:54,200;01:12:57,200;"Who's faster Brady Warner or Greg Brown?"
01:12:57,200;01:12:59,200;"Oh, I'm faster."
01:12:59,200;01:13:01,360;"Well, I don't know how to do that."
01:13:01,360;01:13:04,400;"We keep trying to get a guy at work to do a 40 yard dash"
01:13:04,400;01:13:06,800;"to see if you can beat Brady's combine time."
01:13:06,800;01:13:08,240;"You should make him do the triple jump."
01:13:08,240;01:13:14,160;"I can do the shuttle."
01:13:14,160;01:13:17,800;"The page only care about the three cone anyway."
01:13:17,800;01:13:20,720;"If you want to make a not athletic person look really"
01:13:20,720;01:13:27,400;"not athletic, make them do the triple G. Oh, yeah. It's like the least intuitive athletic"
01:13:27,400;01:13:31,000;"thing ever. So you just look like a fucking idiot."
01:13:31,000;01:13:35,760;"Maybe we should maybe we should have combine stats. I'll do it. We'll see if we can figure"
01:13:35,760;01:13:39,960;"that out. We'll do it. We're in North Carolina summer. Yeah, maybe the next time we're all"
01:13:39,960;01:13:44,280;"together. But that's bullshit ass flag should have been touched down, should have been game"
01:13:44,280;01:13:48,480;"over. So to talk about the jub. Except the fumble at the one yard, at the goal line and"
01:13:48,480;01:13:50,120;"runs it all the way back for Tysha."
01:13:50,120;01:13:52,780;"It would have been 24 to three."
01:13:52,780;01:13:54,400;"And then the game again is over."
01:13:54,400;01:13:55,680;"- Yeah, 10 minutes left."
01:13:55,680;01:13:58,520;"- Had a huge swing, 14 point swing."
01:13:58,520;01:14:00,320;"Rams get the ball back and a first down."
01:14:00,320;01:14:02,440;"That basically the one yard line."
01:14:02,440;01:14:05,160;"Two plays later, Kurt Warner, QB Snake,"
01:14:05,160;01:14:07,960;"goose them like we talked about."
01:14:07,960;01:14:11,120;"Then Aaron just ran straight out of the middle."
01:14:11,120;01:14:12,400;"Of course, a touchdown."
01:14:12,400;01:14:13,640;"And now it's a little bit close."
01:14:13,640;01:14:17,480;"- And Pat's arm roll is like, well, it just happened."
01:14:17,480;01:14:18,840;"(laughing)"
01:14:18,840;01:14:21,240;"Didn't realize it was a touchdown for like five seconds."
01:14:21,240;01:14:25,020;"- Which definitely let John Madden go on about gooshing."
01:14:25,020;01:14:28,720;"- And then this is where the Patriots offense,"
01:14:28,720;01:14:29,720;"they go three and out."
01:14:29,720;01:14:32,960;"Pretty much every drive."
01:14:32,960;01:14:34,440;"- I feel like that always happens, right?"
01:14:34,440;01:14:36,200;"We're like, I don't know."
01:14:36,200;01:14:38,400;"The play call doesn't get super conservative"
01:14:38,400;01:14:39,600;"and they just try a grind clock"
01:14:39,600;01:14:41,040;"and they just go three pounds and out,"
01:14:41,040;01:14:42,720;"three and out, three and out, three and out."
01:14:42,720;01:14:43,560;"- Not just with the Patriots,"
01:14:43,560;01:14:44,800;"just in general, I feel like."
01:14:44,800;01:14:46,440;"- Yeah, I know, yeah, in football."
01:14:46,440;01:14:50,520;"momentum, baby. Yeah, I think that has something to do with it."
01:14:50,520;01:14:54,360;"Yeah, once your be hole starts clenching. Yep. You start"
01:14:54,360;01:14:57,120;"getting conservative and you start getting conservative and"
01:14:57,120;01:15:01,440;"just like how you're running the plays. Even like execution,"
01:15:01,440;01:15:06,360;"right? You're like, you don't want to make the play that blows"
01:15:06,360;01:15:10,840;"it. Yeah. Wait, I mean, the past deep kept playing pretty well,"
01:15:10,840;01:15:15,320;"though. Well, playing defensively is pretty instinctual,"
01:15:15,320;01:15:21,400;"right? You just like run around. But if you're a tight window here, do I just let it rip or do"
01:15:21,400;01:15:27,080;"I check down? You know, right? Yeah. And so you in this game, this is where Brady would be checking"
01:15:27,080;01:15:33,000;"down. Yeah. Well, until I strive, he would. Yeah. Yeah. But at that point, you're not your your"
01:15:33,000;01:15:38,120;"tie game, you're not trying to contain that lead. You're just seeing what you can do on this last"
01:15:38,120;01:15:42,040;"drive and then whatever happens happens. But there's still that thing that Greg said, or you don't"
01:15:42,040;01:15:47,000;"to make that fatal mistake either. Now was John Madden's point of taking me because you don't make"
01:15:47,000;01:15:52,280;"that fatal mistake. That's true. They didn't. Nope. And yeah, because that's why I wasn't had a"
01:15:52,280;01:15:56,520;"conversation with Brady. They like, like we're going out, we're gonna fucking sling it. But it's"
01:15:56,520;01:16:00,360;"like Otis had made that pick and they hadn't got that three points, right? Yeah, of course, he's"
01:16:00,360;01:16:07,080;"gonna swing it. But it's even more impressive that he is slinging it to win it. Yeah. But yeah,"
01:16:07,080;01:16:10,920;"I mean, back to your point, I like the defense does do a decent job in this, but you can tell"
01:16:10,920;01:16:12,440;"I felt like getting gassed."
01:16:12,440;01:16:15,040;"Well, did they like blue curd up again?"
01:16:15,040;01:16:18,560;"Yeah, because they, uh, page go three and they punt and the ramp, I think,"
01:16:18,560;01:16:21,560;"had a holding call and moved him back to their own seven."
01:16:21,560;01:16:25,600;"So I really started this seven yard line drive down the field,"
01:16:25,600;01:16:30,120;"but not in like a typical Rams way where they just like were worn."
01:16:30,120;01:16:31,000;"It has a bunch of time."
01:16:31,000;01:16:32,520;"He's saying it back to just picking you apart."
01:16:32,520;01:16:34,000;"Like he was running for his life."
01:16:34,000;01:16:39,760;"Completing passes like you were kind of half expecting to be like shovel passing"
01:16:39,760;01:16:44,240;"left handed. But still managed to drive almost within field goal range. So we're getting kind of close."
01:16:44,240;01:16:50,720;"And so willy McGinnis comes out and puts it off to the drive with a huge sec."
01:16:50,720;01:16:53,120;"Huge sec. Of course, in the ramps to punt."
01:16:53,120;01:16:57,840;"Page, you got the ball. Well, willy celebration there too,"
01:16:57,840;01:17:00,800;"who you could tell was exhausted defense player."
01:17:00,800;01:17:01,840;"He's laying on his back."
01:17:01,840;01:17:02,880;"Thanks fucking God."
01:17:02,880;01:17:04,480;"At the ceiling. Yeah."
01:17:06,320;01:17:10,320;"Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, he knew that that was getting them off the field and getting"
01:17:10,320;01:17:15,440;"exactly. Yeah. It wasn't my pass get the ball at their own 20 with three and a half left. And"
01:17:15,440;01:17:19,200;"basically, I thought they were going to run free running plays, but they didn't. And then they"
01:17:19,200;01:17:25,440;"like burned a stupid timeout too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Like by the by this point, no neither team had"
01:17:25,440;01:17:29,360;"any time I was left. Yeah, which is baffling to me. They're just using them like whenever the"
01:17:29,360;01:17:35,680;"fuck they want. Yeah. No, some stat where the the Rams let the league in delay of game path for such"
01:17:35,680;01:17:40,480;"of what you would expect to be a well oil machine, you wouldn't expect them to have that many"
01:17:40,480;01:17:47,520;"filling-game calls. But it did feel like a little distrainted all the way. But the punt was probably"
01:17:47,520;01:17:52,240;"Ken Walters worse under the season. Can we say? Absolutely awful punt. I think they said it went"
01:17:52,240;01:17:57,920;"30 yards. And then they cut the Brad Seeley and he's like, what the fuck is that?"
01:17:57,920;01:17:59,400;"- Yeah."
01:17:59,400;01:18:04,400;"- The raps were totally like both."
01:18:04,400;01:18:06,040;"'Cause that was the wide idol."
01:18:06,040;01:18:07,960;"- I don't think it's all on the Patriots, but yeah."
01:18:07,960;01:18:12,160;"- Well, I mean, would they re-kick it or not, right?"
01:18:12,160;01:18:13,000;"At least take it."
01:18:13,000;01:18:14,880;"- Well, I think nowadays you can just take that"
01:18:14,880;01:18:15,720;"five yards back."
01:18:15,720;01:18:16,560;"- And tack it on."
01:18:16,560;01:18:17,400;"- Yeah."
01:18:17,400;01:18:19,040;"- I don't think it'd be that."
01:18:19,040;01:18:21,040;"- Well, the raps start at their own 45,"
01:18:21,040;01:18:22,280;"which is ridiculous."
01:18:22,280;01:18:23,920;"- Ridiculous."
01:18:23,920;01:18:26,680;"- And then I'm gonna, I'm gonna say now."
01:18:26,680;01:18:27,520;"- What?"
01:18:27,520;01:18:29,920;"minute 51 left. Yeah. Yeah."
01:18:29,920;01:18:32,040;"Because the paths manager run it down to it."
01:18:32,040;01:18:35,720;"Yeah. So I have the boss over three five."
01:18:35,720;01:18:37,400;"A couple of plays later."
01:18:37,400;01:18:38,920;"I'm just going to go out and say it."
01:18:38,920;01:18:41,720;"A legal offensive pass interference on this player's pick."
01:18:41,720;01:18:43,280;"Like, of course you are."
01:18:43,280;01:18:45,240;"Are you guys kidding me?"
01:18:45,240;01:18:46,560;"They call the little bit."
01:18:46,560;01:18:49,280;"Did it's only that name called it a pick."
01:18:49,280;01:18:52,280;"It's only a pick. It's a rub."
01:18:52,280;01:18:54,240;"No, you tell."
01:18:54,240;01:19:00,440;"there you mean to tell me if the Patriots ran that play on offense you'd be saying the same thing."
01:19:00,440;01:19:01,200;"Yeah."
01:19:01,200;01:19:04,680;"I'd be a nice to be celebrated a touchdown because it's going to call but I"
01:19:04,680;01:19:09,000;"mean it's only a pick if they like actively getting the way of the player."
01:19:09,000;01:19:10,040;"You did ran it."
01:19:10,040;01:19:11,840;"You're not so much."
01:19:11,840;01:19:12,600;"No, it was."
01:19:12,600;01:19:13,360;"It was played."
01:19:13,360;01:19:17,000;"We can tell us all alone so much so that the"
01:19:17,000;01:19:19,240;"because it's a bad play by turn Shaw."
01:19:19,240;01:19:23,040;"It was but it was still an illegal pick."
01:19:23,040;01:19:24,000;"No."
01:19:24,000;01:19:27,540;"I fucking I can't I can't believe you guys are bringing that up"
01:19:27,540;01:19:34,020;"Usually usually I can tell when you're gonna be like dog Patriots got shaft get on this one"
01:19:34,020;01:19:36,680;"Now that one never even crossed my mind"
01:19:36,680;01:19:46,220;"Yeah, I'm mad and called out he called it a little pick. Yeah, well you didn't say a little rub"
01:19:46,220;01:19:52,040;"It did well, he would have called it what it is once that illegal penalty"
01:19:52,040;01:19:57,440;"I don't know. He might have even got away with a little pick."
01:19:57,440;01:20:00,000;"Yeah, I feel I feel like tape, Steve."
01:20:00,000;01:20:02,800;"I feel like it was illegal, but it wasn't as"
01:20:02,800;01:20:06,800;"as focused on back in the day."
01:20:06,800;01:20:08,480;"They should never got called."
01:20:08,480;01:20:10,760;"Yeah, that's so I mean, it's a touchdown."
01:20:10,760;01:20:12,160;"I mean, it's a fucking page."
01:20:12,160;01:20:14,040;"It's a battle through that."
01:20:14,040;01:20:16,600;"But yeah, Ricky Pearl, the"
01:20:16,600;01:20:20,360;"he of Dynasty fame scores a touchdown."
01:20:20,880;01:20:22,640;"Shampoos is way into the end zone."
01:20:22,640;01:20:24,480;"- Shampoos, that's right."
01:20:24,480;01:20:26,400;"Proces way into the end zone."
01:20:26,400;01:20:29,520;"And now we've got ourselves a tag game"
01:20:29,520;01:20:32,600;"with how much time left under a minute."
01:20:32,600;01:20:34,960;"- Yeah, no, one 37."
01:20:34,960;01:20:36,960;"- Is one 32?"
01:20:36,960;01:20:39,080;"- So it took, yeah."
01:20:39,080;01:20:43,920;"It took them a total of like 24 seconds"
01:20:43,920;01:20:45,160;"to score that touchdown."
01:20:45,160;01:20:46,240;"(laughs)"
01:20:46,240;01:20:47,400;"- And three plays."
01:20:47,400;01:20:49,960;"- Three plays, 18, 11, and then 26."
01:20:49,960;01:20:54,480;"So that kind of puts in context what you're thinking of when Madden's like,"
01:20:54,480;01:20:56,120;"maybe they shouldn't be doing this."
01:20:56,120;01:20:56,920;"Yeah."
01:20:56,920;01:20:57,280;"Oh, yeah."
01:20:57,280;01:21:00,360;"You throw three in completions and then punt."
01:21:00,360;01:21:03,120;"They don't even need to get a touchdown."
01:21:03,120;01:21:05,160;"Yeah. Exactly."
01:21:05,160;01:21:08,240;"Well, like flip side to that is like if you go to overtime, like,"
01:21:08,240;01:21:10,240;"well, that's going to happen there too, right?"
01:21:10,240;01:21:11,160;"Right. Exactly."
01:21:11,160;01:21:11,560;"Yeah."
01:21:11,560;01:21:15,120;"That makes sense because it's like you just got, you got to win it now."
01:21:15,120;01:21:17,960;"You put your, you, you did everything right to get it to here."
01:21:18,440;01:21:20,560;"put yourself in a position to win this game."
01:21:20,560;01:21:23,240;"He can't back down now."
01:21:23,240;01:21:25,860;"Yeah, and I had a football, not football,"
01:21:25,860;01:21:27,920;"because he talked about that and he said,"
01:21:27,920;01:21:29,920;"you have to let them all hang out."
01:21:29,920;01:21:31,480;"Mm."
01:21:31,480;01:21:32,280;"Well, that is--"
01:21:32,280;01:21:33,440;"You all know what that means."
01:21:33,440;01:21:34,720;"That's a real one."
01:21:34,720;01:21:35,880;"Yeah."
01:21:35,880;01:21:36,920;"I let them all hang out."
01:21:36,920;01:21:38,840;"So does that mean that's what we're talking about there,"
01:21:38,840;01:21:39,360;"right?"
01:21:39,360;01:21:39,880;"Yeah, no."
01:21:39,880;01:21:41,320;"He's-- John Madden said you just"
01:21:41,320;01:21:43,320;"got to flop your cock and let's go."
01:21:43,320;01:21:44,600;"Just let him hang, maybe."
01:21:44,600;01:21:46,000;"But--"
01:21:46,000;01:21:47,360;"I've never really--"
01:21:47,360;01:21:51,760;"Whenever I hear that term, I think like saggy titties in my head."
01:21:51,760;01:21:53,320;"So not what."
01:21:53,320;01:21:55,320;"Well, I mean, yeah, that's the female."
01:21:55,320;01:21:58,160;"Well, them hang out."
01:21:58,160;01:21:59,440;"I mean, your balls."
01:21:59,440;01:21:59,920;"Yeah."
01:21:59,920;01:22:02,240;"Is that what they're doing?"
01:22:02,240;01:22:03,880;"You just pull them around your cock and"
01:22:03,880;01:22:07,720;"I'll let everything hang out, but it's mainly focusing the ball."
01:22:07,720;01:22:09,320;"Cause I'll do that."
01:22:09,320;01:22:09,800;"Swang."
01:22:09,800;01:22:12,360;"That means the teacher's gonna win."
01:22:12,360;01:22:12,840;"I'll do it."
01:22:12,840;01:22:15,840;"Although I think for a win."
01:22:16,160;01:22:20,440;"Did I ever tell you about the time that before Kelly and I were dating when"
01:22:20,440;01:22:23,060;"I was at her apartment when she wasn't there?"
01:22:23,060;01:22:24,200;"Because we were friends, obviously."
01:22:24,200;01:22:27,560;"And she had left her laptop open."
01:22:27,560;01:22:34,560;"And I pulled my nutsack out of my jeans and it threw the zipper."
01:22:34,560;01:22:40,800;"And I took a photo with her computer and made her background just a"
01:22:40,800;01:22:43,040;"full-size picture of my nuts."
01:22:43,040;01:22:45,040;"There you go."
01:22:45,040;01:22:50,040;"So she opened her computer in class."
01:22:50,040;01:22:52,040;"Oh no!"
01:22:52,040;01:22:55,040;"That was just staring at my big old bag of nuts."
01:22:55,040;01:23:00,040;"We were all squirrel brain there."
01:23:00,040;01:23:01,040;"Oh man."
01:23:01,040;01:23:05,040;"And then we found love and we got married."
01:23:05,040;01:23:09,040;"Which is not false."
01:23:09,040;01:23:12,040;"So Ben, to the biggest drive of, yeah."
01:23:12,040;01:23:15,040;"That's a really handy to haul."
01:23:15,040;01:23:16,040;"Right."
01:23:16,040;01:23:25,040;"Well, before that, we gave Mike March shit about putting Falkback there for the"
01:23:25,040;01:23:29,040;"pitch to the exact same thing with Troy Brown, you're trying to kick off."
01:23:29,040;01:23:31,040;"Oh, back to the 17 yard line."
01:23:31,040;01:23:32,040;"Yeah."
01:23:32,040;01:23:34,040;"And he was in nine seconds, just run around."
01:23:34,040;01:23:35,040;"Yeah, coaching."
01:23:35,040;01:23:36,040;"Yeah."
01:23:36,040;01:23:37,040;"All right."
01:23:37,040;01:23:38,040;"You're just going to go out there."
01:23:38,040;01:23:43,140;"We do not agree. Yeah, I mean like I said Patrick pass surprisingly a good return"
01:23:43,140;01:23:45,780;"It wasn't like they weren't getting nothing out of the return game right"
01:23:45,780;01:23:52,580;"Or if you're gonna do something like that have a play in your back pocket like maybe I maybe I don't know"
01:23:52,580;01:23:59,280;"Maybe there was something like you need handles punts right and he's got that short here quickness like"
01:23:59,280;01:24:02,820;"That makes more sense than taking Marshall Falcon be like alright"
01:24:02,820;01:24:05,840;"We need a spark Marshall go out there to turn this kick like what?"
01:24:06,800;01:24:09,700;"For the first one, I mean, it's done up before."
01:24:09,700;01:24:11,400;"Yeah, it wasn't first ever."
01:24:11,400;01:24:12,400;"Kick, kick, kick."
01:24:12,400;01:24:18,360;"Was there a play in an important game where the Pats tried this and they did like one of"
01:24:18,360;01:24:19,360;"those reverse ones?"
01:24:19,360;01:24:21,760;"That was vaguely."
01:24:21,760;01:24:26,040;"Maybe we'll get to that somewhere down the road, but I expected that to be coming and"
01:24:26,040;01:24:27,800;"then it like failed miserably."
01:24:27,800;01:24:28,600;"Just, yeah."
01:24:28,600;01:24:29,600;"Yeah."
01:24:29,600;01:24:32,600;"I mean, this is similar, but it's I looked at it."
01:24:32,600;01:24:34,560;"I didn't seem like they had a plan, you know?"
01:24:34,560;01:24:35,760;"Yeah."
01:24:35,800;01:24:40,320;"Marshall Falk returned one punt in 2000 one in 2004"
01:24:40,320;01:24:43,680;"Not one kick returns. Yeah"
01:24:43,680;01:24:46,440;"Where for the Colts?"
01:24:46,440;01:24:51,580;"Now this is entire career stats three returns. Wow. We're going college"
01:24:51,580;01:24:55,240;"San Diego State using Aztec"
01:24:55,240;01:24:58,480;"He was"
01:24:58,480;01:25:01,240;"One pro football focus"
01:25:02,080;01:25:03,080;"They have a college one."
01:25:03,080;01:25:05,320;"They do not have an arena football one."
01:25:05,320;01:25:06,320;"Damn."
01:25:06,320;01:25:08,320;"I learned that the other night."
01:25:08,320;01:25:11,480;"Andy, it sounds like you're going to do it."
01:25:11,480;01:25:14,440;"What am I going to do?"
01:25:14,440;01:25:19,040;"He had two kick returns in college."
01:25:19,040;01:25:22,440;"Sorry, I submitted this one."
01:25:22,440;01:25:23,440;"Yeah."
01:25:23,440;01:25:26,800;"So when John Madden said he'd done it before, he meant once."
01:25:26,800;01:25:27,800;"Yes."
01:25:27,800;01:25:31,600;"John man just got stat checked 20 years later"
01:25:31,600;01:25:38,880;"But I'm with you Greg I feel that it was overthinking it right just put Patrick pass back there. He's done. Yeah"
01:25:38,880;01:25:45,040;"That's what he does every day. It wasn't surprise or if you're gonna have a something like have something like unique"
01:25:45,040;01:25:47,740;"You know like a Frank Y check"
01:25:47,740;01:25:53,640;"I got a workout. I worked out. I started on the 6th Troy start on the 17th 11 yards better. Yeah"
01:25:53,640;01:25:56,760;"and once you so"
01:25:56,840;01:25:58,840;"What's your favorite play on this last drive?"
01:25:58,840;01:26:01,720;"Another"
01:26:01,720;01:26:04,920;"Wow, what's your favorite place obviously Troy Brown what's your son?"
01:26:04,920;01:26:07,720;"The intentional grounding they didn't call"
01:26:07,720;01:26:10,440;"Yeah"
01:26:10,440;01:26:14,800;"He was out of the pocket. I do you say that I don't know if he was"
01:26:14,800;01:26:17,920;"In that general"
01:26:17,920;01:26:23,480;"Go route down there, but he wasn't that close"
01:26:24,440;01:26:27,240;"It was 41 seconds. They're on the 30"
01:26:27,240;01:26:34,840;"Like it's getting like you don't have a lot of light there and then he dumps it again to JR for the third time in a row"
01:26:34,840;01:26:40,360;"This is the one where he like makes a guy miss and like barely gets out of bounds like pummels"
01:26:40,360;01:26:47,560;"Yeah for the first down. Yeah. Yeah, he stays in bounds there like we're kind of fucked over the 40 and the clock is ticking"
01:26:47,560;01:26:53,760;"Yeah, yeah, and like you you'll see that like type of play"
01:26:53,760;01:27:00,160;"maybe like once a season and like just randomly in college or NFL and every time I see it I go"
01:27:00,160;01:27:08,880;"that's the JR Redmond play. Or more often you'll see the guy doesn't get it about like tries to"
01:27:08,880;01:27:12,960;"get a couple more yards and gets like three more yards to waste 30 seconds doing it. Yeah,"
01:27:12,960;01:27:18,240;"but it is a smart move to do that little like dank if you think you can get back out of bounds"
01:27:18,240;01:27:20,880;"Because that player, that defense is playing you right."
01:27:20,880;01:27:22,440;"Thinking you're walking out."
01:27:22,440;01:27:22,960;"Right."
01:27:22,960;01:27:23,320;"Oh, yeah."
01:27:23,320;01:27:24,960;"A lot of them get out of bounds."
01:27:24,960;01:27:25,720;"Yeah."
01:27:25,720;01:27:26,720;"This part moved."
01:27:26,720;01:27:27,360;"Yeah."
01:27:27,360;01:27:28,240;"Yeah."
01:27:28,240;01:27:31,400;"So I do that twice because Troy Brown and the same thing on that deeper"
01:27:31,400;01:27:35,560;"cross gets the ball, gets as many hours as you can going forward and then just"
01:27:35,560;01:27:36,200;"steps out of bounds."
01:27:36,200;01:27:36,840;"Yep."
01:27:36,840;01:27:38,440;"But always running towards."
01:27:38,440;01:27:42,000;"I thought a sneaky big play was the one after that though, because they're."
01:27:42,000;01:27:46,360;"I think that puts them at the 36 after Troy Brown's catch."
01:27:46,360;01:27:47,280;"Yeah."
01:27:47,280;01:27:54,180;"So now I think it would have been a 52 or 53 yard field goal, Madam was saying or something."
01:27:54,180;01:27:57,600;"And so then they still run one more play."
01:27:57,600;01:28:01,220;"Brady finds Wiggins, his redemption because he dropped a big one earlier."
01:28:01,220;01:28:02,720;"Yes, he did."
01:28:02,720;01:28:04,160;"That almost got picked."
01:28:04,160;01:28:05,680;"He batted it straight up."
01:28:05,680;01:28:08,520;"Scared the shit out of me."
01:28:08,520;01:28:13,800;"So Wiggins for 60 yards down to the 30 and then the iconic Brady spiking the ball and"
01:28:13,800;01:28:15,600;"catching one hand and just holding it there."
01:28:15,600;01:28:18,400;"We're very commentating from John Madden there."
01:28:18,400;01:28:21,680;"Yes, yes. Iconic commentary too."
01:28:21,680;01:28:23,200;"Yeah, walk me through it."
01:28:23,200;01:28:26,400;"I said like what Brady did just gave me chills or something like that."
01:28:26,400;01:28:27,600;"Oh yeah, I gave him goosebumps."
01:28:27,600;01:28:30,240;"That gave me goosebumps."
01:28:30,240;01:28:32,160;"It actually did. It gave me goosebumps."
01:28:32,160;01:28:32,960;"Yeah."
01:28:32,960;01:28:38,800;"I think he said something like what that kid right there just did."
01:28:38,800;01:28:40,080;"Yeah."
01:28:40,080;01:28:42,480;"Because he was a kid."
01:28:42,480;01:28:42,880;"Yeah."
01:28:42,880;01:28:43,840;"It was. Yeah."
01:28:43,840;01:28:45,440;"And then there's only one more play left."
01:28:45,440;01:28:48,480;"And that's an iconic call."
01:28:48,480;01:28:50,800;"It doesn't have to put in those."
01:28:50,800;01:28:52,880;"Dude, I have it up right now."
01:28:52,880;01:28:56,000;"Oh, I'm through my headphones though."
01:28:56,000;01:28:59,600;"Yeah, no, I'll, uh, I'll plug it in here and post."
01:28:59,600;01:29:01,040;"Can we do our best impression?"
01:29:01,040;01:29:02,560;"Give it to me."
01:29:02,560;01:29:05,840;"It's good."
01:29:05,840;01:29:06,880;"It's good."
01:29:09,680;01:29:13,840;"Kick is on the way and it is good. It's good."
01:29:13,840;01:29:16,640;"And then they're all just like laughing maniacally in the background."
01:29:16,640;01:29:19,480;"Dude, his voice isn't fired up on you."
01:29:19,480;01:29:25,520;"Set to go."
01:29:25,520;01:29:26,360;"Set all down."
01:29:26,360;01:29:28,960;"I fall down kick up kick is on the way"
01:29:28,960;01:29:56,040;"Our Super Bowl champions so electric yeah, I just got just the"
01:29:56,040;01:30:02,840;"like the first part of that, like brings you back to childhood, like listening to games in the car."
01:30:02,840;01:30:03,340;"Yeah."
01:30:03,340;01:30:05,840;"We used to always call out the hash mark."
01:30:05,840;01:30:06,340;"Yeah."
01:30:06,340;01:30:08,640;"It was to be like left to right or, you know, like,"
01:30:08,640;01:30:10,240;"this is the best radio commentator."
01:30:10,240;01:30:13,240;"I remember you would paint that picture immediately."
01:30:13,240;01:30:15,740;"I mean, just like visualize it when you're not."
01:30:15,740;01:30:18,240;"I never like paid any attention to it."
01:30:18,240;01:30:20,740;"I always do."
01:30:20,740;01:30:24,240;"Oh, yeah, because I always used to try picture in my mind."
01:30:24,240;01:30:26,840;"I never really paid attention to either Greg."
01:30:26,840;01:30:27,840;"Yeah."
01:30:27,840;01:30:32,600;"I mean, it was cool like filler noise that like now looking back is nostalgic, but I never"
01:30:32,600;01:30:33,600;"was like, all right."
01:30:33,600;01:30:34,600;"Okay."
01:30:34,600;01:30:36,080;"So I'm a near hash left to right."
01:30:36,080;01:30:37,080;"Yeah."
01:30:37,080;01:30:38,080;"You know, I never did."
01:30:38,080;01:30:42,680;"But I never realized I did it until he retired and the new guy was so he started doing it"
01:30:42,680;01:30:46,960;"and he doesn't do that and started driving me nothing like what's going on?"
01:30:46,960;01:30:47,960;"Like where's the ball?"
01:30:47,960;01:30:48,960;"I don't understand."
01:30:48,960;01:30:49,960;"What down is it?"
01:30:49,960;01:30:52,120;"How like what's it down in distance?"
01:30:52,120;01:30:58,440;"Sneaky cool like starting a game on the radio and then like you get to your house and you start watching it on TV"
01:30:58,440;01:31:01,960;"Yeah, I'm doing like this is what not what I have pictured in my head at all"
01:31:01,960;01:31:05,080;"Exactly"
01:31:05,080;01:31:08,680;"Some games are we would mute the tv and put the radio in front of it"
01:31:08,680;01:31:13,240;"Oh so much better. Yeah, also I'm at again. I saw this on that youtube video"
01:31:13,240;01:31:15,400;"I just watched on the gill and gino call"
01:31:15,400;01:31:19,480;"Charles johnston not even excited. Oh, yeah"
01:31:20,520;01:31:22,200;"really cuts to him while people."
01:31:22,200;01:31:25,520;"Just like Japanese the camera for some reason."
01:31:25,520;01:31:25,960;"Yeah."
01:31:25,960;01:31:28,200;"Well, he was listening to Pat Summer all's call."
01:31:28,200;01:31:29,160;"So."
01:31:29,160;01:31:32,480;"And it is good."
01:31:32,480;01:31:34,760;"The Patriots are Super Bowl champions."
01:31:34,760;01:31:36,800;"Unbelievable."
01:31:36,800;01:31:40,520;"He did say unbelievable, but in the lead in the most"
01:31:40,520;01:31:42,520;"believable tone you could."
01:31:42,520;01:31:46,680;"Oh, good."
01:31:46,680;01:31:49,320;"I think that was a thing, though."
01:31:49,320;01:31:53,800;"Wasn't it like the monotone play by play people?"
01:31:53,800;01:31:54,800;"Probably."
01:31:54,800;01:31:55,080;"Yeah."
01:31:55,080;01:31:59,680;"Cause I think, uh, let's Joe Buck is trained in similar."
01:31:59,680;01:32:00,640;"Yeah."
01:32:00,640;01:32:04,360;"Fashion, you know, where they're supposed to like maintain, like not."
01:32:04,360;01:32:05,880;"People are what's going on."
01:32:05,880;01:32:06,160;"Yeah."
01:32:06,160;01:32:06,560;"Right."
01:32:06,560;01:32:06,760;"Yeah."
01:32:06,760;01:32:09,240;"And the color guy, not Gil Santos though."
01:32:09,240;01:32:09,400;"Huh?"
01:32:09,400;01:32:13,600;"I mean, he had it together."
01:32:13,600;01:32:14,120;"Yeah."
01:32:14,120;01:32:18,120;"The best part is like he has it for like the first 10 seconds of that."
01:32:18,120;01:32:20,040;"And then he's like, fuck this."
01:32:20,040;01:32:22,000;"I'm so brave."
01:32:22,000;01:32:27,360;"And right."
01:32:27,360;01:32:29,280;"The people in the background just going nuts."
01:32:29,280;01:32:30,920;"They were like in the studio with them."
01:32:30,920;01:32:31,320;"Yeah."
01:32:31,320;01:32:31,840;"Oh, yeah."
01:32:31,840;01:32:32,680;"That was the best part."
01:32:32,680;01:32:33,680;"You can hear everybody."
01:32:33,680;01:32:37,120;"So good."
01:32:37,120;01:32:39,160;"And Y-Packs him runs down."
01:32:39,160;01:32:40,200;"Does the snow angel?"
01:32:40,200;01:32:40,520;"Yeah."
01:32:40,520;01:32:41,920;"It's just breaking your right."
01:32:41,920;01:32:42,880;"It brings you right back."
01:32:42,880;01:32:46,800;"I remember like standing up and punching the ceiling so hard"
01:32:46,800;01:32:49,720;"that are like shredded my knuckles on the popcorn ceiling."
01:32:49,720;01:32:51,960;"I think dad to the same thing."
01:32:51,960;01:32:52,560;"Yeah."
01:32:52,560;01:32:55,680;"Because every time I talk, he's still the first thing he talks about"
01:32:55,680;01:32:56,880;"is scraping his back."
01:32:56,880;01:32:59,880;"You should have been a set of balls on Adam and Terry, huh?"
01:32:59,880;01:33:01,000;"Yeah."
01:33:01,000;01:33:02,120;"One hundred thing."
01:33:02,120;01:33:05,200;"48 yard, that could have been a 50 something."
01:33:05,200;01:33:06,360;"Yeah."
01:33:06,360;01:33:11,720;"With a with a stat on the screen that says has never missed a field goal in a dome."
01:33:11,720;01:33:15,800;"And he just says, fuck you, buddy."
01:33:16,200;01:33:17,960;"God damn right, I have it."
01:33:17,960;01:33:20,840;"And then they bring that set up every single time it kicks in a dome too."
01:33:20,840;01:33:21,640;"Yeah."
01:33:21,640;01:33:22,200;"Yeah."
01:33:22,200;01:33:28,360;"Another stat that I forgot was the New England Patriots early in the fourth quarter,"
01:33:28,360;01:33:32,040;"they sort of stat their 11-0 record when leading after three quarters."
01:33:32,040;01:33:39,240;"So the Patriots were 12-0 after leading in their franchise history."
01:33:39,240;01:33:41,480;"I think it was that season."
01:33:45,240;01:33:50,380;"I think I thought I heard him say that Brady was the youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl at that point"
01:33:50,380;01:33:57,560;"Talk about how times have changed, huh? Yeah, I don't think that's the stuff. Yeah"
01:33:57,560;01:34:00,900;"I'm the oldest right. We've got both bookends to that record"
01:34:00,900;01:34:05,800;"Yeah, he does it anymore. It's definitely I think it's big Ben now"
01:34:05,800;01:34:09,920;"To win the youngest to win a Super Bowl. Oh"
01:34:09,920;01:34:13,460;"Really? Yeah, that's a pretty sick"
01:34:14,400;01:34:17,020;"Like book into your career though, right?"
01:34:17,020;01:34:22,120;"The youngest quarterback to win a Super Bowl at the time and then the oldest to win a Super Bowl at the time like that."
01:34:22,120;01:34:24,620;"That kind of speaks to Brady's legacy, right?"
01:34:24,620;01:34:26,920;"And it's still going if we're on it."
01:34:26,920;01:34:27,780;"It's 2020."
01:34:27,780;01:34:30,000;"What the fuck him?"
01:34:30,000;01:34:31,600;"Yeah, he was 25 when he..."
01:34:31,600;01:34:34,080;"He had barely raped his first woman at that point."
01:34:34,080;01:34:36,300;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:36,300;01:34:38,000;"Oh, damn."
01:34:38,000;01:34:39,700;"We'll cut that part."
01:34:39,700;01:34:41,200;"Yeah."
01:34:41,200;01:34:45,640;"I just like my mind instinctively goes to rape when I hear the name Ben Roth is"
01:34:45,640;01:34:54,400;"pretty. All right, so let's do some best and worst. Greg, what are your best and"
01:34:54,400;01:35:04,960;"worst of this game? Can I phone a friend? Yes. Andy, what are your best?"
01:35:04,960;01:35:06,640;"Let me, you guys go first."
01:35:06,640;01:35:07,760;"I haven't thought of, I haven't."
01:35:07,760;01:35:09,160;"- All right, all right."
01:35:09,160;01:35:11,760;"Um, I'm going to talk about most things."
01:35:11,760;01:35:14,960;"Uh, a couple of my favorite small things."
01:35:14,960;01:35:18,560;"Uh, Troy Brown, when David Patton scored his touchdown,"
01:35:18,560;01:35:21,060;"was so busy celebrating, they showed a picture"
01:35:21,060;01:35:23,080;"of Troy Brown going and getting the football"
01:35:23,080;01:35:26,440;"and like carrying it back to the sideline for, uh,"
01:35:26,440;01:35:28,520;"for Patton so he could keep it."
01:35:28,520;01:35:31,000;"Which just feels like such a typical Troy Brown."
01:35:31,000;01:35:33,760;"And then also, uh, they did the #interview"
01:35:33,760;01:35:35,400;"with Bill Belichick."
01:35:35,400;01:35:39,000;"Like, so what looks like a half adjustment, do you think we need to make?"
01:35:39,000;01:35:42,240;"Like, stay out of long yardage on offense."
01:35:42,240;01:35:43,560;"And that was it."
01:35:43,560;01:35:44,760;"Ron Pitt."
01:35:44,760;01:35:47,760;"That was one of those interviews where he's like, I know this is going to suck."
01:35:47,760;01:35:51,520;"I'm going to ask him one question and then send it back up."
01:35:51,520;01:35:53,200;"Yeah."
01:35:53,200;01:35:56,320;"That's somewhere outside he's gotten easier to talk to."
01:35:56,320;01:35:58,560;"Billy Belichick has gotten easier to converse with."
01:35:58,560;01:36:00,360;"That was a little bit."
01:36:00,360;01:36:01,520;"Jesus."
01:36:01,520;01:36:06,160;"And then my worst was the broadcast, the little"
01:36:06,160;01:36:07,640;"anography in the corner."
01:36:07,640;01:36:10,880;"Whenever it was fourth down, the fourth down in distance"
01:36:10,880;01:36:13,320;"marker would show as yellow."
01:36:13,320;01:36:15,720;"So it showed up every after every third down play,"
01:36:15,720;01:36:18,480;"it showed up as yellow, which is exactly where they put the flag"
01:36:18,480;01:36:21,200;"on the field marker as well in yellow."
01:36:21,200;01:36:23,160;"So every third down play, I thought there was a--"
01:36:23,160;01:36:27,400;"Oh, that's good lead into my worst."
01:36:27,400;01:36:32,040;"is like that feeling when your team,"
01:36:32,040;01:36:35,000;"like this is the Tabaki Jones in reference to that,"
01:36:35,000;01:36:37,280;"the Touchdown could call back,"
01:36:37,280;01:36:40,120;"that feeling when your team makes a huge play"
01:36:40,120;01:36:42,000;"and you hear the announcer go,"
01:36:42,000;01:36:44,120;"oh there's a flag in the field and you're just like,"
01:36:44,120;01:36:45,560;"fuck, you know."
01:36:45,560;01:36:48,280;"There's nothing, it's really the worst feeling ever"
01:36:48,280;01:36:50,080;"'cause you go from the highest of highs"
01:36:50,080;01:36:52,400;"down to the lowest of lows, you know?"
01:36:52,400;01:36:53,760;"- Sounds true, yeah."
01:36:53,760;01:36:56,760;"- And you're just like sitting there hoping and praying"
01:36:56,760;01:36:58,320;"that it's not against your team."
01:36:58,320;01:36:59,680;"And you're like yelling at the TV,"
01:36:59,680;01:37:01,280;"like, just tell us what the fuck it is."
01:37:01,280;01:37:04,680;"You know, you're losing patience immediately."
01:37:04,680;01:37:06,280;"There's been two seconds you're already yelling"
01:37:06,280;01:37:08,680;"at the rats like, figure it out."
01:37:08,680;01:37:12,600;"- I was like, let me see this replay."
01:37:12,600;01:37:13,920;"Let me see this replay."
01:37:13,920;01:37:14,760;"- Yeah."
01:37:14,760;01:37:15,600;"- How much I mean?"
01:37:15,600;01:37:17,360;"- You're like preemptively mad at the rest."
01:37:17,360;01:37:18,680;"- Dude, that was within five yards."
01:37:18,680;01:37:19,520;"- Yeah."
01:37:19,520;01:37:20,440;"(laughing)"
01:37:20,440;01:37:21,280;"Exactly."
01:37:21,280;01:37:23,480;"- Okay."
01:37:23,480;01:37:24,800;"- All right, my best."
01:37:24,800;01:37:29,080;"It's just the image seared in my mind."
01:37:29,080;01:37:32,080;"I think this is Antoine Smith."
01:37:32,080;01:37:32,900;"- Yes."
01:37:32,900;01:37:34,000;"- When they show that back screen"
01:37:34,000;01:37:36,080;"and he's like high stepping onto the field"
01:37:36,080;01:37:37,960;"with his helmet in his hand."
01:37:37,960;01:37:42,400;"I always, that's like burned in my mind, in my memory."
01:37:42,400;01:37:43,440;"Yeah, it's just, I don't know."
01:37:43,440;01:37:46,480;"It's just a cool unique reaction."
01:37:46,480;01:37:49,360;"- Yeah, and Bellatrack hugging Laura Malloy."
01:37:49,360;01:37:50,200;"- Yeah."
01:37:50,200;01:37:53,560;"- That's pretty cool."
01:37:53,560;01:37:54,400;"- Yeah."
01:37:54,400;01:37:55,400;"Yeah."
01:37:55,400;01:37:59,680;"There were a lot of images that were like seared in my memory from this game."
01:37:59,680;01:38:00,680;"Oh, god, yeah."
01:38:00,680;01:38:03,720;"Like obviously him catching the ball with the one hand."
01:38:03,720;01:38:04,720;"Yeah."
01:38:04,720;01:38:10,680;"You know, even kill Santos's call, like those certain like things that just, you'll probably"
01:38:10,680;01:38:11,920;"never forget, right?"
01:38:11,920;01:38:12,920;"Oh, yeah."
01:38:12,920;01:38:13,920;"Yeah."
01:38:13,920;01:38:14,920;"Never."
01:38:14,920;01:38:17,360;"I mean, if I haven't forgot it in 20 years, I can't imagine that."
01:38:17,360;01:38:18,360;"Yeah."
01:38:18,360;01:38:19,360;"Yeah."
01:38:19,360;01:38:21,360;"Although I've done a fair amount of drugs, so."
01:38:21,360;01:38:23,480;"I mean, you're the one really working at."
01:38:23,480;01:38:25,320;"So you still don't remember it."
01:38:25,320;01:38:26,360;"All right, Steve."
01:38:26,360;01:38:27,720;"What's your best and worst?"
01:38:27,720;01:38:32,000;"My worst outside of listening to Pat's ""sum roll"" was--"
01:38:32,000;01:38:34,880;"you can never tell me timeouts are left on it either."
01:38:34,880;01:38:35,840;"Yeah."
01:38:35,840;01:38:36,840;"Right?"
01:38:36,840;01:38:39,040;"Because everyone was just throwing time routes around really"
01:38:39,040;01:38:42,080;"nearly, and you're like, well, how much time out was that?"
01:38:42,080;01:38:44,360;"And nowadays, all the on-screen graphics"
01:38:44,360;01:38:46,280;"will tell you how much timeouts they have left."
01:38:46,280;01:38:46,780;"Yeah."
01:38:46,780;01:38:48,440;"That's why I was trying to get down in distance."
01:38:48,440;01:38:49,680;"All season, it wasn't like that."
01:38:49,680;01:38:53,040;"of them just had like timeouts left. Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree."
01:38:53,040;01:39:00,000;"And then the best is just like rewatching the game. If you got two"
01:39:00,000;01:39:03,360;"hours, a little under two hours, it's definitely worth it. Just"
01:39:03,360;01:39:05,520;"because there's so many little pieces in there. It's like, man,"
01:39:05,520;01:39:07,520;"if that had gone differently or that had gone differently,"
01:39:07,520;01:39:09,520;"this whole thing would have been different. And it's just awesome to"
01:39:09,520;01:39:13,440;"experience the whole thing again. Yeah, it's better than highlights,"
01:39:13,440;01:39:17,840;"because you get like that feeling of the flow of the game, like even the way the"
01:39:17,840;01:39:20,080;"the announcers are talking about things where they're like,"
01:39:20,080;01:39:23,360;"oh, the rims, you know, they could get back into this game."
01:39:23,360;01:39:26,920;"And you're like, I remember feeling that anxiety at the time."
01:39:26,920;01:39:28,840;"- Especially we've all watched that last drive, right?"
01:39:28,840;01:39:31,240;"So like everyone knows played by playing last drive"
01:39:31,240;01:39:32,960;"but to like watch all the other players"
01:39:32,960;01:39:34,640;"enough to it's definitely worth it."
01:39:34,640;01:39:35,840;"- Yeah, it really is, yeah."
01:39:35,840;01:39:38,040;"- Yeah, just to remember the feeling"
01:39:38,040;01:39:42,320;"before that last drive, it makes it just feel that."
01:39:42,320;01:39:45,400;"Well, I think we've done a solid job"
01:39:45,400;01:39:49,080;"on this two part Super Bowl special episode."
01:39:49,080;01:39:52,200;"- Yep, covered it like Tylah, covered Isaac Bruce."
01:39:52,200;01:39:53,640;"- Oh, girl."
01:39:53,640;01:39:55,280;"- All the way to the end zone."
01:39:55,280;01:39:57,080;"(laughing)"
01:39:57,080;01:40:01,840;"- There was one play there when he like broke on Bruce's,"
01:40:01,840;01:40:05,160;"he ended up tripping, but it looked like he knew"
01:40:05,160;01:40:09,200;"what Bruce was running before he did."
01:40:09,200;01:40:13,680;"And the filming practice thing did cross my mind at the time."
01:40:13,680;01:40:14,520;"(laughing)"
01:40:14,520;01:40:16,880;"It's like there's no way anybody's that good."
01:40:16,880;01:40:20,600;"- It's a tie law."
01:40:20,600;01:40:22,880;"Yes, I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt."
01:40:22,880;01:40:26,200;"- And Dre blinded that later on in the game too."
01:40:26,200;01:40:28,240;"- Yeah, I'm not cross-air or that's slant."
01:40:28,240;01:40:29,680;"- No, I'm not on that slant play."
01:40:29,680;01:40:31,160;"We knew what was coming."
01:40:31,160;01:40:32,560;"So maybe, maybe it's the other way around."
01:40:32,560;01:40:34,720;"Maybe Marshall Falk is so upset about this"
01:40:34,720;01:40:36,600;"'cause he knows that--"
01:40:36,600;01:40:38,040;"- Gills it constantly."
01:40:38,040;01:40:39,440;"- Actually did film it."
01:40:39,440;01:40:40,280;"- Yeah."
01:40:40,280;01:40:41,280;"- He just assumed everybody's doing it."
01:40:41,280;01:40:49,480;"It's like those like pastors that like preach about hating gays and then they're banging, you know, yeah, they're caught in the choir boys on the side."
01:40:49,480;01:40:49,680;"Yeah."
01:40:49,680;01:40:51,520;"And that's bathroom with their stance."
01:40:51,520;01:40:55,680;"He, Hoth, Doth, protest too much."
01:40:55,680;01:40:56,880;"Me says or some shit."
01:40:56,880;01:40:59,280;"I definitely butcher that."
01:40:59,280;01:41:01,680;"You guys know it?"
01:41:01,680;01:41:02,480;"Yeah."
01:41:02,480;01:41:03,000;"Yeah."
01:41:03,000;01:41:04,320;"No, I think you're close enough."
01:41:04,320;01:41:06,560;"The lady Doth protest."
01:41:06,560;01:41:07,680;"Something."
01:41:07,680;01:41:09,240;"Steve, you got it?"
01:41:09,240;01:41:10,160;"Nope."
01:41:10,560;01:41:12,480;"No, you know what I'm talking about."
01:41:12,480;01:41:13,280;"I know you're talking about."
01:41:13,280;01:41:13,560;"I don't know."
01:41:13,560;01:41:14,560;"What?"
01:41:14,560;01:41:15,120;"Cool."
01:41:15,120;01:41:16,160;"I don't get close enough."
01:41:16,160;01:41:18,160;"I just butchered that."
01:41:18,160;01:41:23,480;"I'll take it."
01:41:23,480;01:41:25,520;"Yeah, we'll put it in post edit."
01:41:25,520;01:41:26,520;"Yeah."
01:41:26,520;01:41:28,080;"OK."
01:41:28,080;01:41:31,040;"Is this a royal way you're going to do this for me?"
01:41:31,040;01:41:31,800;"I'm glad I'm doing this."
01:41:31,800;01:41:32,160;"You're right."
01:41:32,160;01:41:34,120;"I have no-- I said this all the time."
01:41:34,120;01:41:35,160;"Like, cut that out."
01:41:35,160;01:41:37,920;"I have no control over what's getting cut."
01:41:37,920;01:41:40,120;"Andy does it all."

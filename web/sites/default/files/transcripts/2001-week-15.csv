00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:16,000;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:16,000;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:20,840;"I am not your mother."
00:20,840;00:29,080;"Welcome to week 15 episode 15 of the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
00:29,080;00:33,440;"Going back and we're still in the 2001 season getting towards the end of the regular season,"
00:33,440;00:34,440;"boys."
00:34,440;00:35,440;"How you feeling?"
00:35,440;00:36,440;"Good."
00:36,440;00:37,440;"It's been a marathon."
00:37,440;00:38,440;"Yeah."
00:38,440;00:39,440;"You see you still with me so far?"
00:39,440;00:40,440;"Well, every so often, sure."
00:40,440;00:42,440;"Yeah, that's true."
00:42,440;00:45,120;"Mike, Mike Morissant has been here pretty much every week."
00:45,120;00:46,120;"Yeah."
00:46,120;00:49,320;"I don't think being Greg of both been on one for like five weeks."
00:49,320;00:55,520;"I think you're right. Yeah, it has been a while. No, we had a couple weeks ago, didn't we? Ah, fucking. I don't know."
00:55,520;01:00,720;"Just trying to hold down the fort here. Yeah. Yeah. What will we do without you, Mike?"
01:00,720;01:07,800;"I mean, you've done it a couple of times already, so yeah, I think you'll be just fine."
01:07,800;01:15,040;"You have to resort to be called there. Oh, Jesus. A lot of me are you saying that?"
01:15,040;01:21,920;"That's true. Now you've gone and done it. Yeah. Stevie hates you already. So that's"
01:21,920;01:27,920;"fine. I'm gonna keep poking that bear. I don't know. It's like one of my favorite"
01:27,920;01:34,520;"pastimes is poking bears. Should he try to maybe butter you up a little bit? Oh, that"
01:34,520;01:42,680;"might work. Battering. Battering. Alright. Yeah. I mean, Steve does have a history of"
01:42,680;01:50,880;"like his pastime being angering people for fun and theoretically profit but"
01:50,880;01:54,640;"only actually make any money off of it to you well unless Connor was paying like"
01:54,640;02:02,480;"ten thousand dollars for the spot. Oh wow. You know the offer is there. Yeah."
02:02,480;02:07,240;"We'll have to see what his response is. I'm also interested."
02:07,240;02:11,160;"All right well that's that's quite a start. In fact if you want to pay any"
02:11,160;02:12,600;"It was $10,000."
02:12,600;02:17,160;"Any one of you out there can have a spot on this podcast."
02:17,160;02:19,440;"We're not too proud."
02:19,440;02:22,240;"I'll give it up for an episode for sure."
02:22,240;02:22,720;"Oh, yeah."
02:22,720;02:25,200;"Oh, just for one episode, you're 10 grand an episode."
02:25,200;02:27,800;"Oh, wait, 10 grand for the entire thing."
02:27,800;02:29,040;"Are you kidding me?"
02:29,040;02:30,040;"I don't know."
02:30,040;02:31,800;"We're worth more than that, baby."
02:31,800;02:33,160;"OK."
02:33,160;02:37,760;"I mean, someone's got to make money on this podcast."
02:37,760;02:40,560;"This has been a rollercoaster so far for me."
02:40,560;02:41,560;"I'm all over the map."
02:41,560;02:42,360;"Good."
02:42,360;02:46,240;"How has it been, um, you know, wrangling this whole thing and putting it together?"
02:46,240;02:49,160;"I mean, you do a little bit more work than the rest of us, I guess."
02:49,160;02:52,480;"So it's been a lot, but it's fine."
02:52,480;02:56,200;"I just don't eat lunch at work anymore."
02:56,200;03:00,280;"I sit there and I read the boss and glove of archives instead."
03:00,280;03:05,280;"Well, that shows commitment because my source has told me that Greg didn't show"
03:05,280;03:08,280;"up today because he is eating right now."
03:08,280;03:10,480;"He's eating right now."
03:10,480;03:14,040;"Yeah, so I don't think you can make the podcast."
03:14,040;03:15,040;"Oh, that's important."
03:15,040;03:18,880;"Yeah, I can see how you would skip something like this for eating."
03:18,880;03:19,880;"Right."
03:19,880;03:22,360;"But you, you game playing ahead of time."
03:22,360;03:23,680;"So that props to you."
03:23,680;03:28,880;"Yeah, I do tend to eat before we record this Thursday at 8 PM."
03:28,880;03:29,880;"Right, right."
03:29,880;03:35,880;"I mean, eating at 8 PM for me is too late anyway, so I don't know what is problem this."
03:35,880;03:38,880;"But I mean, to be fair, he didn't pull the Steve Brown and just leave halfway through"
03:38,880;03:40,800;"We were to start making dinner, so."
03:40,800;03:42,000;"- Hey, that was one time."
03:42,000;03:44,320;"- I didn't make time. - Make time."
03:44,320;03:46,280;"- I'll have to see if-- - To the bar."
03:46,280;03:48,120;"- Oh, all right."
03:48,120;03:50,280;"Well, in that case, changes the whole thing."
03:50,280;03:56,800;"All right, well, speaking of drinking,"
03:56,800;03:58,880;"let's get in this football game."
03:58,880;03:59,880;"- All righty."
03:59,880;04:03,200;"- Yeah, so this is actually one that I was excited"
04:03,200;04:04,800;"like going into it, looking forward to it,"
04:04,800;04:07,800;"because this was the dolphins coming to visit"
04:07,800;04:14,680;"Foxboro Stadium. The last game, the last regular season game regardless at Foxboro Stadium, and they had a whole"
04:14,680;04:20,600;"shindig around it, which we'll get into. But the dolphins who had beat the piss out of the"
04:20,600;04:25,000;"Patriots earlier in the season, I believe that was just a me and Mike game. Is that right, Mike?"
04:25,000;04:30,520;"It's all blur at this point. A long time ago. I think it was just here on me on that one. And"
04:30,520;04:34,920;"I believe at the end of it, we said it was a game that we would be fine never watching again."
04:35,480;04:37,000;"Oh, that one. Yeah."
04:37,000;04:38,480;"I'm really fondly."
04:38,480;04:43,880;"Yeah. All I can really remember is Brady fumbling the ball and having"
04:43,880;04:48,640;"it kick back in the end zone for dolphins touchdown and Troy Brown fumbling"
04:48,640;04:52,720;"the punt because it was the only mistake he's made this season."
04:52,720;04:54,480;"Yep."
04:54,480;04:56,480;"But this game would be different."
04:56,480;04:57,440;"Yeah."
04:57,440;04:58,920;"No, the ones are fun kicks."
04:58,920;05:00,480;"That's true. Yeah."
05:00,480;05:02,080;"There's a whole bunch of shit going on."
05:02,680;05:05,440;"But just to kind of recap like we did before,"
05:05,440;05:06,680;"I talked about the dolphins a bit,"
05:06,680;05:07,680;"but we'll go over it again."
05:07,680;05:14,180;"This was the game for the AOC, the lead in the AOC East."
05:14,180;05:19,360;"And of course, Patriots were not splitting anything"
05:19,360;05:21,600;"saying that they win this game, because everybody knows"
05:21,600;05:22,760;"at this point how this goes."
05:22,760;05:24,640;"But dolphins would actually finish 11 and 5,"
05:24,640;05:27,360;"and also still make the playoffs, along with the jets"
05:27,360;05:28,200;"from the AOC East."
05:28,200;05:31,400;"So all three of those guys will make the playoffs this year."
05:31,400;05:34,640;"I mean if you remember a couple weeks ago the Patriots also beat the Jets so"
05:34,640;05:41,680;"They were kind of sitting pretty in the driver's seat at this point and there was a whole bunch of"
05:41,680;05:45,080;"Talk about playoff predictions and all this stuff"
05:45,080;05:52,360;"More straight at this point. I believe yeah, I believe this is this is win number four in a row"
05:52,360;05:55,760;"To just about finish out the season"
05:55,760;05:57,880;"The dolphins"
05:57,880;06:02,960;"Like we said make the playoffs, but they lose in the wild card to the Ravens because obviously don't win the division"
06:02,960;06:05,160;"They lost this game and that puts them game behind"
06:05,160;06:09,800;"Head coach was Dave one stab we talked about the man the myth mustache"
06:09,800;06:13,180;"Let's see he actually played the Patriots tough again"
06:13,180;06:15,440;"It's just recap"
06:15,440;06:19,120;"He went four and five against New England, but he actually lost the last four of those games"
06:19,120;06:21,280;"so"
06:21,280;06:27,840;"Started off strong and faded down the stretch just like I wonder I know he had a terrible season the year after"
06:27,840;06:33,040;"this, but I wonder why he never really had another shot again, because his record wasn't"
06:33,040;06:34,040;"too bad overall."
06:34,040;06:35,040;"It's true."
06:35,040;06:39,960;"Yeah, he was this year and the year before, he was both 11 and five and they made the"
06:39,960;06:44,520;"playoffs and then nine and seven and 10 and six the two years after that, which is still"
06:44,520;06:45,520;"pretty good."
06:45,520;06:46,520;"All right."
06:46,520;06:47,520;"Yeah."
06:47,520;06:48,520;"So he did better than I thought."
06:48,520;06:49,520;"Yeah."
06:49,520;06:50,800;"But then in '04, he started off one and eight before he got fired."
06:50,800;06:51,800;"I'm pretty sure."
06:51,800;06:53,360;"Oh, that's what it was."
06:53,360;06:54,920;"And I think he went to college."
06:54,920;06:57,400;"He was coaching, he was coaching Pitt, I think."
06:57,400;07:07,400;"I don't know if he was the coach at the time that Dion Lewis was there, but I know Dion Lewis was from Pitt. I'm not sure if they overlapped it up."
07:07,400;07:10,400;"But if they did, juicy fact."
07:10,400;07:13,400;"That check. We don't are stackers."
07:13,400;07:15,400;"I got it."
07:15,400;07:17,400;"All right."
07:17,400;07:24,600;"with. All right. Quarterback was J. Feedler. Feedler on the roof that we talked about a few times"
07:24,600;07:31,080;"because me and Mike talked about them during the game and then we talked about them again in week."
07:31,080;07:37,560;"I was a sixth swing Gregory watched the wrong game and had a whole page of J. Feedler notes."
07:37,560;07:45,080;"Mike, I don't think you were there for that, but J. Feedler was voted. I can't remember the exact"
07:45,080;07:50,840;"specifics, but he was the second best Jewish quarterback in the history of football."
07:50,840;07:52,120;"Oh, wow."
07:52,120;07:52,960;"Wait a minute."
07:52,960;07:57,200;"It says the first, I know Brigham Young, Steve Young."
07:57,200;08:00,880;"No, actually, I don't know if he's Jewish, but I know he went to"
08:00,880;08:01,280;"Brigham."
08:01,280;08:03,800;"It was Sid Luckman, I believe it was."
08:03,800;08:05,560;"Right?"
08:05,560;08:06,280;"Spicy."
08:06,280;08:07,000;"Yeah."
08:07,000;08:12,960;"So, yeah, so Greg had a whole bunch of Jewish factor on Jay Feudler, because"
08:12,960;08:16,880;"apparently that's what he was known for was being Jewish and being good football, according to Greg."
08:16,880;08:18,080;"Interesting."
08:18,080;08:21,120;"Yeah, he was actually, I thought he was really good in this game."
08:21,120;08:22,600;"Surprisingly."
08:22,600;08:25,480;"Yeah, I think he threw for like 300 yards and"
08:25,480;08:27,600;"didn't throw pick."
08:27,600;08:28,480;"Yeah."
08:28,480;08:32,320;"And was kind of the only thing that they had going for them on offense."
08:32,320;08:35,600;"And he finished the season pretty good."
08:35,600;08:37,920;"He had three, just over 3000 yards and"
08:38,600;08:40,080;"Toy Touchdown's 19th inception."
08:40,080;08:45,360;"So kind of about the same, but I believe he actually outplayed"
08:45,360;08:48,760;"Peyton Manning in this season, which is hard to say."
08:48,760;08:50,560;"You know, I was looking at it."
08:50,560;08:51,600;"There's a reception ratio."
08:51,600;08:54,720;"What's in terms of like these like touchdown and deception ratios?"
08:54,720;08:57,840;"I feel like even though it's pretty jarring looking at this now,"
08:57,840;09:03,680;"I feel like for that era, it was kind of the norm a little bit."
09:03,680;09:05,480;"Like, you know, what to have as picked."
09:05,480;09:08,520;"So like all these guys that were pretty well known"
09:08,520;09:10,800;"and at the top of the league had a ton."
09:10,800;09:11,840;"And then there's a drop off."
09:11,840;09:14,920;"So now like the, it's kind of normal"
09:14,920;09:18,160;"to see a guy throw eight picks a year, right?"
09:18,160;09:20,520;"Which used to be crazy."
09:20,520;09:22,040;"Why do you think that is?"
09:22,040;09:23,800;"Is it because of the lax rules"
09:23,800;09:26,480;"or are people just getting better?"
09:26,480;09:31,360;"- Yeah, I think the rules have definitely shifted"
09:31,360;09:32,680;"to focus more on the offense,"
09:32,680;09:34,680;"especially in the passing game."
09:34,680;09:37,600;"with the lack of contact that defensive backs"
09:37,600;09:41,920;"can have nowadays and how much things get negated"
09:41,920;09:43,680;"by penalty and all that sort of stuff,"
09:43,680;09:45,560;"especially like defensive holding penalties"
09:45,560;09:47,440;"and passing affairs and all that."
09:47,440;09:52,440;"So that focus I think has skewed the interception numbers"
09:52,440;09:56,680;"but I also think that offenses have got more creative"
09:56,680;09:59,600;"with the short passing game is what it seems like to me."
09:59,600;10:03,080;"So they're throwing, I mean, just look at true breeze"
10:03,080;10:07,320;"is 70 something percent completion percentage every year now."
10:07,320;10:12,480;"And he's throwing these really accurate short passing games that are kind of"
10:12,480;10:16,240;"Brady and the page's offense kind of it felt like they started."
10:16,240;10:17,520;"Yeah."
10:17,520;10:20,240;"I suppose you probably go back to like the Joe Montana,"
10:20,240;10:22,120;"West Coast offense days as well a little bit."
10:22,120;10:25,280;"But I think with all these like wide receiver,"
10:25,280;10:29,600;"bubble screens and those quick short passes, it almost replaced the running game."
10:30,080;10:31,140;"The Patriots kind of."
10:31,140;10:35,320;"Tucked the heart and ran with, but going back to your point, Mike."
10:35,320;10:38,480;"Brady even this year, you know, the guy who you don't think of"
10:38,480;10:42,320;"throwing in his options was 18 touchdowns, 12 interceptions on the season."
10:42,320;10:43,080;"Right."
10:43,080;10:45,080;"So he was almost like one to one as well."
10:45,080;10:48,800;"And this was considered a good year for quarterback the way he played."
10:48,800;10:50,280;"Yeah, no, it's interesting."
10:50,280;10:53,120;"I mean, yeah, I was just looking at that."
10:53,120;10:57,120;"And I mean, you have like a guy like a golf who's like putting up crazy numbers"
10:57,120;10:59,740;"and people nowadays are like, I don't know if he's like that great"
10:59,740;11:02,140;"quarter back or whatever. So it is interesting."
11:02,140;11:09,660;"Right. Yeah. Yeah. Because I think that even that season, uh, when the Rams went to the Super Bowl,"
11:09,660;11:16,380;"that Rams offense, I think was like a top 10 scoring offense of all time,"
11:16,380;11:20,700;"like in the history of the NFL and people said, like, yeah, I don't know if crop's that good."
11:20,700;11:26,060;"Yeah. Right. Because both both the chiefs and the Rams were both top 10 all time offenses"
11:26,860;11:31,500;"that season, which is why they they played that game against each other. It was like"
11:31,500;11:39,980;"54 53 or something. Yeah, I get it. It's crazy. It was nuts. I will say the breeze. You got to"
11:39,980;11:43,820;"give him props though, because I know he's doing the short game, but I mean, he'll throw the long"
11:43,820;11:49,580;"ones in here and there still. Oh, yeah. I think he's done four years in a row of over 70% I was"
11:49,580;11:52,860;"reading so it's something like this I'm pretty cool."
11:52,860;12:01,260;"Where for comparison, Drew Bledsoe's completion percentage in 2001 was 63.9%."
12:01,260;12:03,580;"That's actually higher than I thought."
12:03,580;12:07,820;"I know. Yeah. Drew Bledsoe's for comparison was 60.6."
12:07,820;12:16,620;"All right. But the one passer on here who had the highest passer rating, which I think will actually segue"
12:16,620;12:19,420;"well into what we can talk about next is Kevin Falk."
12:19,420;12:24,300;"100% completion percentage, one for one for 23 yards."
12:24,300;12:30,980;"So let's, uh, let's talk about his, is a passer rating, if you will,"
12:30,980;12:36,020;"because I think this was the, you could probably say that even though it was early,"
12:36,020;12:38,980;"it was the kind of turning point of the game."
12:38,980;12:39,820;"It felt like to me."
12:39,820;12:41,500;"So what did you think, Steve?"
12:41,500;12:42,540;"For sure."
12:42,540;12:46,020;"I mean, it was not the same play as in the Philly Super Bowl."
12:46,020;12:53,260;"we lost. I look like it to the opposite side of the field and that spoiler alert might be"
12:53,260;12:59,900;"the worst part of this game for me. Really? It reminded me of what Steve is talking about."
12:59,900;13:04,740;"And brought back memories. Yeah, because I actually had a similar feeling because I saw"
13:04,740;13:10,500;"it. So we'll just set it up for those who haven't actually seen it. But it was kind of"
13:10,500;13:14,300;"the actually part of it was the direct snap to Kevin Falk that we've seen more than I"
13:14,300;13:15,860;"I remember this season, especially."
13:15,860;13:16,940;"That's sad."
13:16,940;13:17,900;"Yeah."
13:17,900;13:19,660;"In this, in this season, it really is."
13:19,660;13:24,100;"I mean, you see them pull it out like even the falcon Super Bowl."
13:24,100;13:24,420;"Yeah."
13:24,420;13:28,820;"As last one I can remember the direct snap to the, the running back on the shotgun."
13:28,820;13:30,180;"But this came to a"
13:30,180;13:32,300;"Yeah, by Brady in the air to sell it."
13:32,300;13:33,180;"Exactly."
13:33,180;13:33,580;"Yeah."
13:33,580;13:37,580;"Brady will jump like the ball went over his head and doesn't fool anybody."
13:37,580;13:41,580;"So we did that and Kevin fall got the ball and started like running a sweep to his"
13:41,580;13:46,500;"right and then stopped him through it back to Brady on the left side of the field wide"
13:46,500;13:51,380;"open and have a quote what Brady said about this play."
13:51,380;13:53,300;"Where is it?"
13:53,300;13:54,820;"Where is it?"
13:54,820;13:58,940;"It was, oh yeah, Tom Brady on the play."
13:58,940;14:02,620;"He was he was wide fucking open and had the whole half of the field to himself."
14:02,620;14:10,180;"And it's a quote was I turned a touchdown into a 23 yard gain, which is so Tom Brady."
14:10,180;14:11,700;"It was a pretty tough catch though."
14:11,700;14:12,700;"Yeah."
14:12,700;14:14,100;"He looked pretty good."
14:14,100;14:14,860;"Yeah."
14:14,860;14:20,060;"And I'm pretty sure, correct me if I'm wrong, but this is the only time that"
14:20,060;14:21,220;"play has ever worked."
14:21,220;14:23,140;"It's the only time Tom Brady's caught that ball."
14:23,140;14:26,460;"Well, what's his career numbers and catches?"
14:26,460;14:29,060;"Wait a minute."
14:29,060;14:30,980;"Didn't try a Brown toss and one as well."
14:30,980;14:35,620;"Also potentially against the Dolphins or I might be mixed games."
14:35,620;14:38,180;"I can't remember another Tom Brady catch."
14:39,060;14:41,220;"So I can remember a couple or he's missed them."
14:41,220;14:44,260;"But I don't remember this one before I watch this game."
14:44,260;14:45,740;"So let's see."
14:45,740;14:49,420;"He has two other catches."
14:49,420;14:51,700;"Yeah, I think one of them was from Troy Brown."
14:51,700;14:52,540;"If I'm mistaken."
14:52,540;14:56,460;"Um, you might be mistaken because."
14:56,460;14:57,220;"All right."
14:57,220;14:57,940;"Whatever never mind."
14:57,940;15:01,380;"Gradually one catch in 2015 and one in 2018."
15:01,380;15:03,980;"Yeah, I was the 2018 one."
15:03,980;15:04,580;"I'm pretty sure."
15:08,020;15:10,300;"The one in 2015 was for 36 yards."
15:10,300;15:11,660;"I don't remember this play at all."
15:11,660;15:13,540;"It doesn't say who it was by, but."
15:13,540;15:15,100;"36 yards."
15:15,100;15:15,780;"That's his longest."
15:15,780;15:16,340;"It's not bad."
15:16,340;15:17,860;"So yeah, he has completed twice."
15:17,860;15:23,100;"But I remember more recently against Tennessee that he heard his knee on."
15:23,100;15:24,460;"It wasn't the same the rest of the season."
15:24,460;15:24,740;"Yep."
15:24,740;15:26,380;"It was that game."
15:26,380;15:27,140;"You were at that game."
15:27,140;15:27,620;"See, right?"
15:27,620;15:28,100;"You and Greg."
15:28,100;15:28,940;"Yep."
15:28,940;15:29,980;"Yeah."
15:29,980;15:30,580;"That sucked."
15:30,580;15:34,700;"I was like, Greg, it's like fourth quarters, like three minutes left."
15:34,700;15:35,380;"Let's just go."
15:35,380;15:37,980;"And he's like, no, you're not to sit here and take your licking."
15:37,980;15:43,980;"the game's real fans don't need till the game's over regardless."
15:43,980;15:48,980;"Uh huh. That's fair. I get it. Yep."
15:48,980;15:55,980;"So, but this one actually did work and it was last drive of the first quarter."
15:55,980;15:57,980;"Up seven."
15:57,980;16:03,980;"They hadn't actually scored yet. No, this was the one that, yeah, this, this set it up."
16:03,980;16:08,380;"And then Antoine Smith ran it in the first by the second quarter"
16:08,380;16:14,580;"With Richard Seymour as a fullback. That's right. Yes, Richard Seymour leading the way"
16:14,580;16:18,060;"But yeah, the second quarter was really"
16:18,060;16:22,340;"All that was it was well the action happened"
16:22,340;16:26,940;"I thought because you know you had that touchdown that that started literally the first play of the drive and"
16:26,940;16:30,700;"Then the pages went on to score a couple more touchdowns"
16:31,100;16:38,820;"One was Brady hitting his backup full-back Patrick pass for the touchdown, which there was a quote"
16:38,820;16:46,100;"By the comment is that you either you catch it is it a football or not football? No, I don't think so"
16:46,100;16:48,980;"So therefore Mike didn't catch it. I got it"
16:48,980;16:55,340;"Although I will say Greg Gumbo and Phil Sims on this one. So I think yeah, yeah kind of making a jump in"
16:56,500;17:01,080;"What is it popularity? Yeah moving on up in the the the ladder of"
17:01,080;17:03,480;"competent"
17:03,480;17:04,400;"commentators"
17:04,400;17:06,400;"commutation"
17:06,400;17:11,220;"Commentation that is a real word. Yeah, but I don't know who was it said it because I don't give a fuck"
17:11,220;17:13,900;"But they basically said"
17:13,900;17:16,540;"Patrick pass more like Patrick catch"
17:16,540;17:20,060;"Wow"
17:20,060;17:22,320;"Yeah, wait a minute who"
17:23,180;17:29,740;"You know this might be completely off base here, but I'm remembering a one of the worst fun goals I've ever seen in my life"
17:29,740;17:35,420;"It was a hamstring issue running back drops the ball and"
17:35,420;17:40,900;"Patriots fumble it away was that a Patrick pass moment. I think that was"
17:40,900;17:44,900;"Ridley wasn't it was it really against the bills?"
17:44,900;17:52,260;"I don't think so he was like running with the ball and like strained his hamstring and just dropped the ball and just dropped it"
17:52,260;17:55,060;"Instead of just going to the ground, he just drops the ball."
17:55,060;17:56,300;"I don't know."
17:56,300;17:58,460;"We might be thinking about different was it against the bills?"
17:58,460;18:04,140;"I think it might have been really also like a run up the middle."
18:04,140;18:05,500;"I'm going to look this up."
18:05,500;18:10,460;"I want to say that's really if that's why Patrick Pass stuck out of my mind."
18:10,460;18:14,060;"So if that's wrong, oh, all right, maybe, you know, good for him."
18:14,060;18:19,540;"Literally the only Patrick Pass highlight I remember is this specific touchdown."
18:19,540;18:21,100;"Get out of here."
18:21,100;18:26,100;"Yeah, I don't know why, but every time I hear Patrick pass, this is the play that comes to mind."
18:26,100;18:29,260;"I don't know why this stuff is not mine."
18:29,260;18:32,460;"It definitely is Patrick pass pulling a hand me."
18:32,460;18:33,540;"Is it really?"
18:33,540;18:35,140;"Yeah, 2005."
18:35,140;18:36,100;"Oh, shit."
18:36,100;18:39,220;"You have to post that in chat so we can all watch it and comment."
18:39,220;18:39,420;"Yeah."
18:39,420;18:42,900;"So when we get to that game, we'll revisit this."
18:42,900;18:43,700;"Oh, all right."
18:43,700;18:45,180;"Yeah, that sounds fantastic."
18:45,180;18:46,940;"Something wants forward to."
18:46,940;18:50,340;"Is that who I think it is?"
18:50,700;18:56,700;"Oh, okay. Oh, did you have your nice little meal? You feeling better now?"
18:56,700;19:00,220;"Nice little tummy. Am I tummy?"
19:00,220;19:09,660;"Nice shrimp gumbo. It was delicious. Mike, you'd be proud of me. Did you know yourself?"
19:09,660;19:15,820;"I sure did. Wow. Did you turn into a fine young man? I'm always proud of you."
19:16,380;19:22,460;"I'm young woman. Hey, he wasn't saying that about you when you weren't here. What?"
19:22,460;19:30,460;"You track. I don't remember what I said. I'm gonna have to just plead the fifth on this one."
19:30,460;19:34,540;"I apologize if I said anything. We can play with tape if you want, Greg. I'm sure we can get it"
19:34,540;19:39,740;"back for you. Look, it's all everything's a blur, Greg. It's all fun. It's all fun."
19:39,740;19:44,220;"Black status. Black status. It's a freaking condition, dude."
19:46,140;19:48,140;"You're a condition"
19:48,140;19:59,400;"Starts bringing up how we grew up in Lawrence and tough guy shit tough guy shit Lawrence Massachusetts man. All right, it's it's it ain't it ain't you know"
19:59,400;20:03,300;"Family headroom. Okay. I am up in down"
20:03,300;20:08,580;"Salem New Hampshire either. I'm just saying that's what I'm saying old new ball game. All right"
20:08,580;20:11,580;"Nice and I made it out of that town"
20:11,580;20:15,700;"And my parents are Portuguese, bro"
20:15,700;20:18,540;"So, I mean, it was a lot."
20:18,540;20:19,380;"- Sure."
20:19,380;20:22,060;"(laughing)"
20:22,060;20:22,900;"- So tough."
20:22,900;20:24,940;"So tough."
20:24,940;20:26,780;"- You're giving me flashbacks here."
20:26,780;20:28,100;"- Oh, do share."
20:28,100;20:31,840;"- Give us your favorite Lawrence moment."
20:31,840;20:33,620;"- My favorite Lawrence moment."
20:33,620;20:36,180;"I learned-- - For the most memorable."
20:36,180;20:40,900;"- I would say I learned how to break out/snake out,"
20:40,900;20:43,040;"'cause babysitter would lock us on the porch"
20:43,040;20:44,980;"to keep us contained."
20:44,980;20:48,380;"And she was really good at what she was doing."
20:48,380;20:52,820;"And at eight years old, I learned how to,"
20:52,820;20:57,060;"I came up with this way to get off of the porch"
20:57,060;21:00,140;"and kind of just do my thing on my own."
21:00,140;21:02,620;"And she wouldn't check on us for like five hours."
21:02,620;21:07,620;"So every day, I would kind of sneak out of the apartment."
21:07,620;21:11,140;"And I taught my sister and cousins how to do this."
21:11,140;21:13,540;"And we'd just kind of fro like at eight years old"
21:13,540;21:19,900;"the street warrants. What was that?"
21:19,900;21:26,620;"He's raising hell? I don't know. I mean, we learned a lot, but I don't know if I did"
21:26,620;21:32,900;"much of the hell raising myself. But it was good times, you know, it was a fond memories."
21:32,900;21:37,100;"And you know, she's the best. She's still with us, by the way."
21:37,100;21:40,540;"So your sister or the babysitter?"
21:40,540;21:41,740;"The babysitter."
21:41,740;21:43,220;"Oh, OK."
21:43,220;21:45,100;"Good, I guess."
21:45,100;21:46,420;"Yeah, she was--"
21:46,420;21:48,420;"She was still babysitting."
21:48,420;21:49,180;"She's not."
21:49,180;21:50,300;"I did see her recently."
21:50,300;21:52,660;"She went back to Portugal."
21:52,660;21:54,900;"And she's doing fine."
21:54,900;21:58,420;"She had a little bit of a problem with the drink"
21:58,420;22:00,260;"when she took care of us as well."
22:00,260;22:01,700;"Wow."
22:01,700;22:02,780;"I think that's gotten better."
22:02,780;22:05,340;"So good for her."
22:05,340;22:06,580;"I'm proud of her."
22:06,580;22:07,580;"there."
22:07,580;22:09,420;"I'm proud of a lot of people today."
22:09,420;22:11,780;"You are, aren't you?"
22:11,780;22:13,020;"Just sharing that pride."
22:13,020;22:15,100;"I love it."
22:15,100;22:21,620;"When was the first time you broke out of your house, Andy?"
22:21,620;22:23,940;"Just now tonight, I'm recording this."
22:23,940;22:28,540;"This is some pirate radio shit I'm recording in the passenger seat of my car."
22:28,540;22:29,540;"Oh shit."
22:29,540;22:31,180;"That's why you sound so good."
22:31,180;22:32,180;"I know."
22:32,180;22:35,540;"The acoustics in here, they're great."
22:35,540;22:41,860;"else have a sneaking out story. No, mom just let us do whatever we want. I know your mom's"
22:41,860;22:51,300;"your mom's pretty cool. You do whatever you want. I got one with the house we grew up"
22:51,300;22:58,100;"and had a loft bedroom. So it's like climb up a little ladder. In the loft there was like"
22:58,100;23:04,140;"a little attic space. You pull off the door and you can get to like the you know the water"
23:04,140;23:09,900;"heater and all that crap. And of course you just smoked weed in there because it was perfect."
23:09,900;23:19,580;"Yeah, you like blow the ash into the insulation. Yeah, oh yeah. Perfect."
23:19,580;23:27,580;"You're good. But then they had to go up there to check on something at one point."
23:29,180;23:36,380;"contractor there and they like climb up and open the door to it and like there's like a"
23:36,380;23:41,900;"lawn chair and a bean bag and oh wow. Is that what I'm doing? I'm dead."
23:41,900;23:47,260;"Who's pissed about the lawn chair because it was her favorite one?"
23:47,260;23:51,980;"Well I was gonna say what was she like she seems like she would be kind of like"
23:51,980;23:56,860;"understanding of the whole situation. Yeah well and I was the last I was the youngest of the four"
23:56,860;23:59,060;"So by that time she'd given up on like"
23:59,060;24:05,860;"Raise us given up all hope on Greg. Well explains a lot really"
24:05,860;24:10,980;"Yeah, I came back freshman year college for like winter break"
24:10,980;24:17,400;"We were smoking up there and mama. Well, we're like, I don't know. We've been real idiots"
24:17,400;24:20,900;"Thought like yeah, no one will be able to hear us or smell this blunt"
24:20,900;24:26,260;"Open the loft and mom was like it's a part of our bedroom. So she's like fuck. Are you doing up there?"
24:26,260;24:27,100;"- Oh my God."
24:27,100;24:28,420;"- I remember it had come down."
24:28,420;24:31,260;"(laughing)"
24:31,260;24:34,260;"- He goes, ""What are you doing up there?"""
24:34,260;24:36,260;"We were like, ""Nothing."""
24:36,260;24:38,260;"She goes, ""What are you doing?"""
24:38,260;24:40,260;"(laughing)"
24:40,260;24:42,260;"- Has she ever done that?"
24:42,260;24:43,260;"- You in there?"
24:43,260;24:44,260;"- Has she ever worked?"
24:44,260;24:45,260;"- Or Corey?"
24:45,260;24:46,260;"- I was, yeah."
24:46,260;24:48,260;"- Has she ever done that herself, do you think?"
24:48,260;24:49,260;"- No."
24:49,260;24:50,260;"- No."
24:50,260;24:51,260;"- Wow."
24:51,260;24:53,260;"- What, smoked up in the loft now?"
24:53,260;24:55,260;"- No, smoked up in general."
24:55,260;24:56,260;"up in general."
24:56,260;24:58,260;"Not real kids, I think, probably."
24:58,260;25:00,260;"Yeah, she said she was a teenager."
25:00,260;25:01,260;"Yeah."
25:01,260;25:04,260;"Yeah, she was a bit of a wild child, I guess."
25:04,260;25:05,260;"Hey."
25:05,260;25:06,260;"Slow have been told."
25:06,260;25:09,260;"And I will find out from her when we eventually have her on the podcast."
25:09,260;25:11,260;"I'm not going to put words in my brows mouth."
25:11,260;25:12,260;"That's fair."
25:12,260;25:17,260;"No, I'm not going to put words in my brows mouth."
25:17,260;25:19,260;"I was a speaking of hi."
25:19,260;25:24,260;"Let's talk about some of these kickoffs in the second quarter."
25:24,260;25:28,020;"quarter. Well, I see what yeah, Mike has to say about the"
25:28,020;25:32,980;"punting. Well, I thought that Miami's punting was atrocious."
25:32,980;25:37,740;"Um, so bad. So bad. I mean, I think one of them traveled like"
25:37,740;25:44,140;"10 or 15 yards. I think it was 16. Okay, 16. Yeah. Oh my god."
25:44,140;25:49,500;"Yeah, pretty pretty rough. Um, you haven't here. Miami drove to"
25:49,500;25:53,060;"the 50 and punted from the 50 and the Pat started at their own"
25:53,060;26:01,260;"34. Yeah, no, it was not pretty. The whole kicking game was interesting, though, because"
26:01,260;26:06,580;"I was writing. I mean, the first one, the military kicks into the end zone. And I commented,"
26:06,580;26:10,260;"you know, I wrote like a note that like that was insane, because we haven't seen that all"
26:10,260;26:16,620;"year, that actually bounced into the end zone. But then they all started to kind of land,"
26:16,620;26:21,980;"every kickoff was landing at the 30 or 40. And I was like, what the hell is going on?"
26:21,980;26:25,300;"But I started picking up on, and I think the announcer's touched on this a little bit,"
26:25,300;26:31,500;"that I think they were using the sun to the, their advantage to kind of create issues."
26:31,500;26:36,160;"Yeah, I couldn't tell if it was the sun or if it was like a wind issue too, because it"
26:36,160;26:38,900;"did seem to be the time they were- See, you don't think it was intentional?"
26:38,900;26:40,140;"I think the kickoffs were."
26:40,140;26:42,180;"I don't think the 16-yard punt was."
26:42,180;26:43,180;"Right, right."
26:43,180;26:44,180;"That was terrible."
26:44,180;26:49,380;"But it felt like every time they were kicking from right to left is when the pages were"
26:49,380;26:52,180;"doing the short kickoffs and the puns were failing."
26:52,180;26:54,620;"Because it was the dolphins"
26:54,620;26:57,060;"punting in the first quarter when they were going that direction"
26:57,060;26:59,780;"is when the two bad puns were."
26:59,780;27:02,660;"And then as soon as the page is scored"
27:02,660;27:05,700;"was in the second quarter and that's when they started in the kickoffs,"
27:05,700;27:07,740;"which we hadn't, you know, we've only ever seen the first one."
27:07,740;27:10,300;"But yeah, they were doing these like,"
27:10,300;27:15,140;"like you said, really high kickoffs that would land at the"
27:15,140;27:18,780;"like the jets or the excuse me, the just the dolphins,"
27:18,780;27:26,100;"like 30 35 yard line. And one of those, I think you might be"
27:26,100;27:29,520;"right that maybe the sun did play into it because you could tell"
27:29,520;27:32,460;"that the guys were having trouble fielding it. Because one,"
27:32,460;27:34,920;"they're supposed to be blocking anyway, so they're not used to"
27:34,920;27:39,480;"fielding kicks. But then to it also, they were struggling with"
27:39,480;27:43,220;"either the wind or the sun, it was hard to tell. So one of those"
27:43,220;27:46,500;"things where I'm viewing it as like, Oh, Belichick is a genius."
27:46,520;27:54,880;"Of course he came up with this and your maybe bringing to the table that it was coincidental,"
27:54,880;27:55,880;"perhaps."
27:55,880;27:56,880;"Yeah, Wendy."
27:56,880;27:58,560;"Well, I think it might be a bit of both."
27:58,560;28:01,960;"I think, I mean, the patients are playing at home."
28:01,960;28:03,120;"Hey, shut the fuck up."
28:03,120;28:04,120;"You shut up late."
28:04,120;28:05,120;"What?"
28:05,120;28:10,800;"You can send it a son and then you can catch the ball."
28:10,800;28:12,600;"It was fucking windy."
28:12,600;28:14,000;"Wait, you're going in and out."
28:14,000;28:16,000;"I don't know if everybody else is here in this."
28:16,000;28:19,000;"Yeah, your audio sucks."
28:19,000;28:22,280;"Hey, you put words in my mouth that I wasn't actually going to say."
28:22,280;28:26,440;"So how about let me say it?"
28:26,440;28:31,240;"Oh, now you won't let people talk, Andy?"
28:31,240;28:34,320;"Well, if you shut up on time, I'll let you talk."
28:34,320;28:35,360;"Do that."
28:35,360;28:36,360;"Yeah?"
28:36,360;28:37,360;"Yeah?"
28:37,360;28:38,360;"Oh."
28:38,360;28:39,720;"Yo, time out."
28:39,720;28:42,160;"Yeah, I get like your audio sucks."
28:42,160;28:44,200;"Come on now."
28:44,200;28:45,680;"It's better."
28:45,680;28:46,840;"Is it better now?"
28:46,840;28:47,340;"Yeah."
28:47,340;28:50,840;"All right, back to what I was saying."
28:50,840;28:52,280;"Andy, you're an idiot."
28:52,280;28:55,180;"All right, Connor."
28:55,180;28:56,180;"Go ahead."
28:56,180;28:57,580;"So this is the page is home field."
28:57,580;28:58,820;"I'm sure they practice on this."
28:58,820;29:02,020;"I'm sure they I'm sure they know what happens on windy days."
29:02,020;29:11,500;"So I'm not saying they're purposely trying to get these kicks to to lands on a specific guy who's known for not catching it or some bullshit like that."
29:11,500;29:18,540;"But I'm pretty sure that they had something in place where if you're kicking into this end zone and the winds blowing and we've seen"
29:18,540;29:23,440;"Punts failing that they had been in the first quarter instead of trying to boot into the end zone"
29:23,440;29:25,920;"Let the guy get a run up at it and catching it at the 25"
29:25,920;29:30,720;"Just kick it straight up and like basically poo should so they can't return for touchdown and make a"
29:30,720;29:34,440;"Forward guy catch it instead. I disagree"
29:34,440;29:36,440;"I don't care."
29:36,440;29:39,720;"What do you earth a and let them let them let them let them."
29:39,720;29:40,720;"Awesome son."
29:40,720;29:41,720;"Let them say it."
29:41,720;29:43,720;"What do you have on your mind Greg?"
29:43,720;29:45,080;"You want to hear my rebuttal?"
29:45,080;29:46,080;"Yeah."
29:46,080;29:50,480;"There was a 14 mile an hour wind and it was windy."
29:50,480;29:51,480;"That's it."
29:51,480;29:52,480;"That's strong."
29:52,480;29:53,480;"Right, but yeah."
29:53,480;29:56,480;"That's why you got Greg."
29:56,480;30:02,520;"This podcast where anything that happens, Belichick is a genius, you know?"
30:02,520;30:03,520;"Yeah."
30:03,520;30:05,520;"Yeah, it's just windy"
30:05,520;30:16,200;"I was thinking that you know he didn't orchestrate it, but my role is definitely to"
30:16,200;30:20,880;"Play the devil's advocate in my thinking here and you know what?"
30:20,880;30:23,680;"Not a genius"
30:23,680;30:27,760;"Yeah"
30:27,760;30:31,960;"If I agree with you, you know, you've done something wrong. Well, he brings up a good point"
30:31,960;30:36,120;"It was the wind dude 14 mile an hour wind. I know is the wind"
30:36,120;30:39,320;"Don't want to bring it up. I did no"
30:39,320;30:43,320;"Literally the first on the bring of the way"
30:43,320;30:50,600;"I think I'll check didn't actually saw the first couple of punts get caught up"
30:50,600;30:57,480;"Yeah, and if you I remember looking out of their show in Romeo, Cornell are Charlie Weiss and like they're like blocking out the Sun"
31:01,480;31:03,360;"All right, sorry, Greg, I can't do it."
31:03,360;31:04,800;"I think I did it on purpose."
31:04,800;31:08,680;"Well, then that Turk is doing an offer."
31:08,680;31:09,160;"It's too."
31:09,160;31:11,200;"Whoa."
31:11,200;31:13,320;"No matter."
31:13,320;31:19,840;"Well, I have heard that Matt, Matt Turk has been described as a genius by some folks in the league."
31:19,840;31:21,320;"Yeah."
31:21,320;31:23,280;"Some people are saying."
31:23,280;31:26,680;"Yeah, some people I've heard people talk about Matt Turk."
31:26,680;31:27,760;"That's his name."
31:27,760;31:29,840;"(laughs)"
31:29,840;31:33,040;"Nailed it."
31:33,040;31:36,600;"- He's got a good situation though though."
31:36,600;31:38,280;"You know, he already looks like a dork"
31:38,280;31:43,280;"and then he's got that stupid downward angled face mask."
31:43,280;31:47,080;"- I think we talked about it in the first dolphins game."
31:47,080;31:48,440;"I think it was just me and Mike though,"
31:48,440;31:50,360;"where the top of the face mask kind of like"
31:50,360;31:52,120;"does that little loop up too."
31:52,120;31:53,720;"So he just always looks surprised."
31:53,720;31:56,880;"But it's just because of a face mask."
31:56,880;31:58,760;"It looks like a dog that's surprised."
31:58,760;32:01,600;"You know, whereas eyebrows are all bunched up at the top,"
32:01,600;32:03,400;"but it's his helmet."
32:03,400;32:06,420;"- Yeah, I hate when kickers do that."
32:06,420;32:09,680;"Like, you already look like an idiot, your kicker."
32:09,680;32:11,880;"Like, just wear a regular helmet."
32:11,880;32:13,000;"- Yeah, I don't understand it."
32:13,000;32:14,660;"I kind of wish kickers would wear like"
32:14,660;32:16,560;"linebacker helmets."
32:16,560;32:17,960;"You know what I mean?"
32:17,960;32:19,440;"- Like the tip is actually with a,"
32:19,440;32:21,760;"with a, like a black dog."
32:21,760;32:24,880;"- How intimidating would that be?"
32:24,880;32:25,960;"Because you look at the guy,"
32:25,960;32:34,320;"like this guy never misses. Yeah. I just love the the kickers that look like Jack. I mean,"
32:34,320;32:40,880;"there's one in every every 10 years. So there's one that pops up. Yeah. That's true. The"
32:40,880;32:44,840;"do you get a punter though, I feel like. Oh, that could be it. Although, Jana Kousky was"
32:44,840;32:51,640;"pretty pretty big. He was more hefty than anything though. All right, that's true. Was"
32:51,640;32:57,640;"this year at the combine that was like had the most reps on the"
32:57,640;32:59,760;"Oh, and the bench press. Yeah. Oh, yeah."
32:59,760;33:01,520;"25 or something ridiculous."
33:01,520;33:05,640;"Yeah. And then he run like some crazy 40 as well, I thought."
33:05,640;33:08,840;"Yeah, I think he's a pretty athlete. Yeah."
33:08,840;33:10,080;"That's what I yeah."
33:10,080;33:12,960;"I love to see him as like a linebacker and a kicker."
33:12,960;33:17,000;"Like Vinoteary. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly."
33:17,000;33:21,080;"You know, you save a spot for something else and you put him on the field all the time."
33:21,440;33:23,320;"That's not bad. I'm surprised."
33:23,320;33:27,120;"And there are more like hybrid kicker punters though."
33:27,120;33:29,560;"I thought the same."
33:29,560;33:31,480;"Like have one guy do the bold jobs."
33:31,480;33:35,200;"Is it that different of a skill set?"
33:35,200;33:36,800;"I imagine probably is."
33:36,800;33:39,400;"And Mackenzie would like a word."
33:39,400;33:41,600;"I know. Well, yeah, I'm curious."
33:41,600;33:44,880;"Somebody who's kicked balls a lot in my life."
33:44,880;33:47,040;"I can understand that they're different skill sets,"
33:47,040;33:50,040;"but are they that different where you can't do both?"
33:50,040;33:54,280;"Hmm. I mean, I always think it's funny when they have the kicker and the punter"
33:54,280;33:58,920;"But then the punter or a third kicker is doing like kick-offs. Yeah. Yeah"
33:58,920;34:01,840;"Well, yeah, the Patriots had started to do that didn't they? They had"
34:01,840;34:04,680;"Ryan Allen kicking off or something like that"
34:04,680;34:09,720;"In certain games a couple years ago. Maybe a couple. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
34:09,720;34:13,080;"They're they're punter doing the kick"
34:13,080;34:15,480;"Right, right"
34:18,920;34:24,280;"So like obviously some people say it's like the easiest problem football is being the"
34:24,280;34:27,040;"Hunter kicker"
34:27,040;34:33,920;"What do you what would your preference be as far as like longevity money?"
34:33,920;34:39,820;"You know how people respect you what position on a football team"
34:39,820;34:44,860;"Or all of them any position"
34:45,720;34:47,280;"Oh, backup quarterback for sure."
34:47,280;34:49,240;"We need exactly."
34:49,240;34:53,840;"You're the most popular guy if the starter doesn't do any if the"
34:53,840;34:55,800;"starter is not playing well, because you're the one that everyone"
34:55,800;34:57,560;"also put in because it's a change of pace."
34:57,560;34:59,360;"You don't actually have to do anything."
34:59,360;35:01,920;"You just stay on a whole to fucking clipboard and you get"
35:01,920;35:03,880;"and pay quarterback money instead of like punter money."
35:03,880;35:06,640;"So even as a backup, you get paid more than the starting kicker, right?"
35:06,640;35:09,000;"They can't be practiced."
35:09,000;35:10,840;"Yeah, the red shirt."
35:10,840;35:14,120;"And if you actually do get into the game and you suck, they don't"
35:14,120;35:15,520;"expect anything from you anyway."
35:15,520;35:17,520;"Yeah, like I was the backup bucket."
35:17,520;35:20,960;"Yes. Yeah. Yeah."
35:20,960;35:23,000;"Atrix made a career of it."
35:23,000;35:25,280;"That's true. Well, he actually starts a bunch of games."
35:25,280;35:27,280;"Who was it that?"
35:27,280;35:31,640;"It's a Chase McDaniel's or someone like that who had made some ungodly"
35:31,640;35:35,760;"amount of money made like a hundred million dollars as a back like a career"
35:35,760;35:38,040;"backup. Was it him?"
35:38,040;35:40,440;"It was someone like that."
35:40,440;35:43,640;"There's a bunch of these guys, though, like Matt Liner, for instance,"
35:43,640;35:47,160;"That guy still, you know, he was still playing so fairly recently."
35:47,160;35:50,240;"Is he still playing Matt liner?"
35:50,240;35:51,920;"Stat check."
35:51,920;35:54,040;"I don't know, but that guy's made bank."
35:54,040;35:54,480;"All right."
35:54,480;35:55,960;"And you never really did anything."
35:55,960;35:57,000;"Yeah."
35:57,000;36:00,560;"Long snapper is a close second, though."
36:00,560;36:03,120;"Yeah, but that's a lot of pressure, though."
36:03,120;36:03,920;"Yeah."
36:03,920;36:06,800;"I'd rather be a punter because that's a lot of pressure."
36:06,800;36:11,320;"Feels like it's just like a muscle memory thing that you can nail every time."
36:11,320;36:12,920;"How come you?"
36:13,240;36:16,020;"Have you guys seen like the trick guys like on YouTube?"
36:16,020;36:17,200;"Yeah."
36:17,200;36:19,960;"Like how come those guys don't don't ever make a team?"
36:19,960;36:22,280;"I know they get tryouts, but how come they never get signed?"
36:22,280;36:24,780;"They suck at kicking."
36:24,780;36:28,840;"Yeah, because they're not very good at the actual kicking because they spent"
36:28,840;36:30,440;"too much time practicing the."
36:30,440;36:33,920;"But what about like that dude that was like booming like 60 yard field"
36:33,920;36:35,200;"goals like one after another?"
36:35,200;36:37,240;"Like does that guy ever get a shot?"
36:37,240;36:38,440;"Past try them out."
36:38,440;36:39,160;"Yeah."
36:39,160;36:40,960;"I did actually try them out this year."
36:40,960;36:41,320;"Yeah."
36:41,720;36:43,520;"And, uh, press."
36:43,520;36:45,040;"Here we had is getting hurt."
36:45,040;36:45,560;"Yeah."
36:45,560;36:46,160;"Oh, damn."
36:46,160;36:47,960;"All right."
36:47,960;36:51,520;"I mean, do most kickers just come up through like school?"
36:51,520;36:52,920;"And that's it."
36:52,920;36:53,840;"That's the farm system."
36:53,840;36:56,920;"Because like, even a couple of kickers"
36:56,920;37:00,400;"that I guess are entering this draft,"
37:00,400;37:02,120;"their percentages are not that great."
37:02,120;37:04,320;"So how can you tell if that's going to translate into the NFL"
37:04,320;37:06,280;"with like, you know--"
37:06,280;37:08,800;"Well, I'm not quite sure how that works."
37:08,800;37:11,520;"But I think getting this year was lower overall anyway."
37:11,520;37:13,520;"I don't know what the hell happened."
37:13,520;37:16,520;"But nobody could get field goals if you're a team like."
37:16,520;37:17,840;"- Dude, I'm like a..."
37:17,840;37:20,800;"- I think they're camps where they have like camps"
37:20,800;37:25,800;"where, you know, all these like high profile prospects go"
37:25,800;37:27,800;"and like how you perform at that, like,"
37:27,800;37:30,040;"affects your draft status more than like email."
37:30,040;37:30,880;"- Oh, all right."
37:30,880;37:31,880;"- No kidding."
37:31,880;37:33,200;"- That would make sense."
37:33,200;37:34,360;"- Yeah."
37:34,360;37:35,640;"- Yeah, how do you guys feel about,"
37:35,640;37:38,120;"I don't know if you guys have watched any of the XFL,"
37:38,120;37:39,760;"but since we're talking about kickers,"
37:39,760;37:43,760;"How do you, I know that they're trying to be a little bit more tame this time around,"
37:43,760;37:48,800;"but they obviously change up a lot of things. What do you think about the NFL trying out some"
37:48,800;37:55,920;"of the stuff that they're doing if you guys are familiar? So I've only caught bits and pieces."
37:55,920;38:01,120;"I know that the kickoffs are different. Right. And that seems I could take it to leave it."
38:01,120;38:07,280;"It's not a big enough difference that it makes. I mean, it seems like less people would get hurt,"
38:07,280;38:10,460;"But it also seems like there'd be an opportunity for a big play."
38:10,460;38:13,880;"That seems like there's less opportunity for a big play, though, from the feel of it."
38:13,880;38:19,320;"You think so? Because once they cross the threshold, it's pretty much a wide open field."
38:19,320;38:22,060;"Yeah, that's true, but nobody ever seems to."
38:22,060;38:26,180;"I know. I haven't seen it yet, but I think it happened once and it was on a trick play."
38:26,180;38:27,900;"All right."
38:27,900;38:31,380;"But I think the extra point thing is interesting."
38:31,380;38:32,620;"Yeah."
38:32,620;38:34,300;"No more kicking an extra point."
38:34,500;38:44,400;"you either get one point, which is like a play from the two yard line, two points as a five yard line and three points as a play from the 10 something like that."
38:44,400;38:45,400;"Yes, I'm like that."
38:45,400;38:46,900;"That's more interesting to me."
38:46,900;38:47,600;"Yeah."
38:47,600;38:51,260;"Yeah, I just wonder I'm curious like what that's going to do to the like scores."
38:51,260;38:58,440;"Like is it going to make it a closer game because you could always like throw up a Hail Mary with like a three or is it going to be that it's going to be out of hand?"
38:58,440;38:59,800;"More blowouts."
39:00,600;39:06,400;"Probably the closer game because I feel like coaches still aren't going to go for three every time"
39:06,400;39:11,480;"If you're scoring you know what I mean? Yeah, just because it's hard to score from the 10"
39:11,480;39:17,300;"But it gives you more of a chance actually crawl back in if you do start hitting those three point conversions"
39:17,300;39:22,480;"I was wondering though like one point is from the what you're saying the two and then two points is like from the four"
39:22,480;39:24,040;"I mean is there that much of a difference"
39:24,040;39:30,060;"I guess like it kind of cuts out running plays on the four. Yeah, I don't think there's that much difference and I'm surprised more"
39:30,060;39:32,400;"Or coaches don't go for it."
39:32,400;39:34,880;"Just go for two regardless in that situation."
39:34,880;39:37,280;"Yeah, I thought the same thing though."
39:37,280;39:42,640;"I mean, I do think that bringing back kicks on extra points was a good idea."
39:42,640;39:45,000;"I think it kind of adds a little more drama."
39:45,000;39:47,360;"But yeah, I didn't mind that system."
39:47,360;39:49,040;"And same thing with overtime rules."
39:49,040;39:52,760;"I mean, I know that there's, you know, overtime in the NFL, I think is way better than it"
39:52,760;39:56,800;"was around the 2001 season."
39:56,800;39:59,400;"I think it's a lot better now where everyone at least gets a shot"
39:59,400;40:05,840;"Potentially, but what do you think about the sort of college football XFL style?"
40:05,840;40:10,480;"Is the XFL the same as college football? I don't actually know what they're over there. It's almost like that"
40:10,480;40:14,600;"It's like I think everyone gets five possessions to try to score from like whatever yard line"
40:14,600;40:20,320;"And then it's kind of like a shoot out type of format where if it's tied then they just go into sudden death"
40:20,320;40:22,960;"I see"
40:23,280;40:29,040;"I mean, I think they all end up in sudden death anyway eventually so it's at the end of the day how much different is"
40:29,040;40:35,880;"I think it's more about like drawing an excitement and also like not hurting people because I know you don't want to play"
40:35,880;40:42,560;"Another 15 minutes if everyone's exhausted. I guess I guess I mean yeah, either way is fine by me to be honest"
40:42,560;40:45,120;"That's fair"
40:45,120;40:48,020;"Polish football crushes NFL overtime"
40:48,020;40:51,360;"In terms of excitement. Yeah, it's way better"
40:52,040;41:00,080;"Yeah, I think so too. I have a question. Oh, yes. Why is there not more female kickers in the NFL?"
41:00,080;41:03,380;"You tell us you get us in trouble here"
41:03,380;41:10,840;"Yeah, that's a good point Andy, what do you think that?"
41:10,840;41:18,960;"Generally, right if we look at how the game has evolved over the last 20 years or so Kelly"
41:19,360;41:26,440;"You'll understand that when you need to kick a a football you need a lot of muscle in your leg"
41:26,440;41:36,420;"And you know with with just the the natural advantages that men have over women and in both like bigger brains and bigger muscles"
41:36,420;41:46,360;"It really makes it so that they're better kickers. I'm a little surprised you got through that as far as you did without laughing"
41:48,560;41:51,640;"I think it's when you guys are talking about the difference like"
41:51,640;41:58,540;"The game has evolved a ton like the TDI and T's ratio is a good example, but kicking really hasn't but if you look at like"
41:58,540;42:01,760;"percentages of like made kicks"
42:01,760;42:04,440;"in this season versus the last season"
42:04,440;42:07,080;"Like across the whole NFL"
42:07,080;42:08,920;"That's probably pretty similar"
42:08,920;42:14,520;"Like why is the rest of the NFL advanced and come so far in the offensive side of things and kicking is stagnated"
42:15,520;42:18,200;"I think has gotten more accurate actually over the years"
42:18,200;42:21,600;"closer kicks have but"
42:21,600;42:29,640;"People are the misses are now from like over 45 yards instead of over 35 yards. You know what I mean?"
42:29,640;42:33,080;"Well, but I'm I'm still curious what"
42:33,080;42:36,000;"Kelly what what do you think?"
42:36,000;42:40,800;"Because men are afraid that women will do a job better than them"
42:42,640;42:46,140;"Now I have a question though because Carly Lloyd was bringing this up, right?"
42:46,140;42:49,380;"And she's amazing great soccer player"
42:49,380;42:52,220;"but she was"
42:52,220;42:53,500;"potentially gonna give the"
42:53,500;42:59,380;"gonna be given the opportunity to try out and then she declined. She said she'd think about it and she kind of waffled and then"
42:59,380;43:02,740;"she kind of said that she didn't think that she should do it, so"
43:02,740;43:07,700;"She's the biggest proponent right now for female kickers. So what do you think about her response?"
43:07,700;43:10,980;"I"
43:10,980;43:15,580;"Don't agree with it because if you're gonna come out and say all that stuff and you gotta fall through I"
43:15,580;43:17,420;"agree"
43:17,420;43:19,420;"But typical woman"
43:19,420;43:27,060;"Kick them right now. Oh"
43:27,060;43:29,620;"Show my female kickers can do I"
43:29,620;43:38,220;"Think I need to know more about the story because if she's saying and maybe not because she wants to keep playing soccer and"
43:38,620;43:41,940;"Stay there then okay, but she said that she"
43:41,940;43:45,380;"She thinks that women can kick as well as men"
43:45,380;43:52,460;"But that the physical nature of getting hit by a guy of that weight and speed might not be the greatest thing"
43:52,460;43:55,180;"That's loosely translated, but that's what she was getting at"
43:55,180;44:02,500;"I mean, I think that's fair. Right. But now here's a more interesting question. I think why aren't there?"
44:02,500;44:05,420;"female coaches"
44:05,420;44:08,060;"Isn't there one there is well there is now"
44:08,060;44:12,880;"But I mean like a head coach it's taking taking what a hundred years to get to this point well"
44:12,880;44:15,220;"Systematic sexism isn't it?"
44:15,220;44:19,040;"They weren't allowed to they were allowed to be coaches growing up so"
44:19,040;44:24,860;"They didn't have the opportunities so you're not seeing any similar to a lot of like the tech field too"
44:24,860;44:32,940;"There's not a lot of right, but I think that's because that takes out the physical element and I don't see any reason why"
44:32,940;44:36,780;"Yeah good school going up there kind of"
44:36,780;44:41,700;"of shepherded towards other things just by, you know,"
44:41,700;44:43,700;"societal norms and things like that."
44:43,700;44:44,980;"- No, you said Kelly?"
44:44,980;44:46,580;"- No, you don't have to earn your right"
44:46,580;44:47,940;"to get to a head coach."
44:47,940;44:49,940;"- You do."
44:49,940;44:51,820;"But that's what I mean."
44:51,820;44:53,740;"It's like, I'm surprised that it took this long"
44:53,740;44:56,620;"for women to have the opportunity to even climb the ladder."
44:56,620;44:59,260;"- Not surprised."
44:59,260;45:00,340;"- What was that?"
45:00,340;45:01,180;"- I'm not surprised."
45:01,180;45:03,260;"It's a man run well, a woman."
45:03,260;45:04,100;"- A white man?"
45:04,100;45:04,940;"- Yeah, yeah."
45:04,940;45:06,500;"- I know."
45:06,500;45:10,600;"I mean, how many non-white males are there coaching the NFL?"
45:10,600;45:14,220;"- Well, I also think like the Rooney rule is like a joke"
45:14,220;45:17,600;"because the fact that they have to even instill a rule"
45:17,600;45:20,660;"that minority coaches have to interview is ridiculous."
45:20,660;45:22,900;"Like that shouldn't even have to be a thought."
45:22,900;45:26,860;"It should be whoever's the best can get the job, right?"
45:26,860;45:27,700;"- Right."
45:27,700;45:28,520;"- Why?"
45:28,520;45:30,700;"- They make a Rooney rule for women."
45:30,700;45:31,540;"Like, they make a--"
45:31,540;45:32,860;"- A Rooney rule."
45:32,860;45:34,780;"(laughing)"
45:34,780;45:36,220;"Kelly, we got there at the same time."
45:36,220;45:37,220;"I like it."
45:37,220;45:38,220;"I like it."
45:38,220;45:43,820;"You're a really one woman for every head coaching job."
45:43,820;45:46,260;"OK, I'm going to go have fun, guys."
45:46,260;45:47,140;"All right, thanks."
45:47,140;45:48,140;"Good talk."
45:48,140;45:49,140;"Hi."
45:49,140;45:51,140;"Bye."
45:51,140;45:55,380;"All right, so speaking of kicks, do"
45:55,380;45:57,980;"you want to talk about this kickoff in the second quarter"
45:57,980;46:00,180;"of the Patriots Dolphins game?"
46:00,180;46:01,980;"Oh, it's an interesting episode."
46:01,980;46:03,260;"It sure is."
46:03,260;46:07,540;"So what happened was we talked about it at Nauseam earlier,"
46:07,540;46:09,980;"but the Patriots doing a high short kickoff"
46:09,980;46:11,300;"often struggled with the first one"
46:11,300;46:13,420;"and actually fumbled the cycle one"
46:13,420;46:16,420;"after the Patriots kicked the field goal."
46:16,420;46:20,300;"So they recover that kick and then drive down"
46:20,300;46:22,020;"and kick another field goal."
46:22,020;46:27,020;"And now it's 20 to three at the half Patriots."
46:27,020;46:29,860;"- Aw genius move, my valid check."
46:29,860;46:33,100;"- You know what, if you wanna start a Patriots doubters"
46:33,100;46:34,540;"Podcast you're more than welcome."
46:34,540;46:35,980;"Yeah."
46:35,980;46:36,460;"Yeah."
46:36,460;46:42,100;"But backtracking, if there is no roomy rule, do you think that you think that"
46:42,100;46:46,540;"minority coaches get an opportunity or is it just all white all the time?"
46:46,540;46:47,700;"That's crazy."
46:47,700;46:51,420;"I mean, it's probably all whites all the time."
46:51,420;46:52,460;"That sucks."
46:52,460;46:57,660;"That's kind of what we do as a white male society as a Portuguese man."
46:57,660;47:01,140;"I don't know whether that follows in, but everybody should be given an opportunity."
47:01,140;47:01,500;"All right."
47:01,900;47:04,460;"Yeah, are you considered white or are you"
47:04,460;47:11,340;"I it's always been a gray area non white for me in my life. It depends on the group that I'm hanging out in, I guess, and how they view me."
47:11,340;47:15,580;"Mike, yeah, remember I got rebuttal."
47:15,580;47:27,660;"The percentage of like black coaches or minority coaches in the NFL is like roughly it's actually slightly more than the overall population in the United States."
47:27,660;47:31,420;"You're talking like percentage? Yes. Oh, really?"
47:31,420;47:35,300;"when you say that they're actually represented?"
47:35,300;47:37,580;"- I don't know, I don't know the numbers or whatever."
47:37,580;47:41,180;"I just know that in the last maybe 10 years,"
47:41,180;47:42,900;"minority coaches have been given opportunities,"
47:42,900;47:44,420;"but before that, that's partly probably"
47:44,420;47:46,980;"because of the Rooney role, but before that,"
47:46,980;47:48,540;"it was pretty much nonexistent."
47:48,540;47:53,220;"- Yeah, and I think the counter argument is you have,"
47:53,220;47:56,060;"the players are a lot more diverse"
47:56,060;47:59,420;"and then the most popular coach isn't,"
47:59,420;48:01,340;"which is kind of suspect, but."
48:01,340;48:04,420;"- There were some owners too."
48:04,420;48:07,660;"- There's certainly more white people in America"
48:07,660;48:08,940;"than there are black people,"
48:08,940;48:10,940;"so it kind of makes sense statistically"
48:10,940;48:14,020;"that you'd have more qualified white coaches than."
48:14,020;48:16,580;"- Yeah, but then what about like all the owners are white?"
48:16,580;48:19,620;"And I know that that comes from money and like history"
48:19,620;48:20,780;"and like where they came from"
48:20,780;48:22,540;"and what opportunities they were given,"
48:22,540;48:25,380;"but that's that like a good indication of the population."
48:25,380;48:27,500;"- Correct."
48:27,500;48:30,780;"I guess you can rule for buying a football team."
48:30,780;48:31,900;"Yeah, I know."
48:31,900;48:34,100;"I was going to say, I guess he can't really boot owners."
48:34,100;48:36,700;"That depends on how racist they are, I guess."
48:36,700;48:38,260;"That's true."
48:38,260;48:42,900;"Or if they make their employees show up in in jeans on Friday,"
48:42,900;48:43,900;"so whatever the hell it was."
48:43,900;48:45,260;"Oh, yeah."
48:45,260;48:47,900;"My name is Jerry Richardson, the Panthers."
48:47,900;48:50,020;"Wait, what?"
48:50,020;48:52,700;"They get the old owner, the Panthers."
48:52,700;48:55,100;"He was kind of like a sketchy old man and a bunch of stories"
48:55,100;48:57,100;"I'm trying to come out so they made him sell the team."
48:57,100;48:58,100;"Oh."
48:58,100;49:00,100;"He was making for a dream Friday's."
49:00,100;49:01,100;"Yeah, that's right."
49:01,100;49:02,100;"Yeah."
49:02,100;49:04,100;"So like, I look at the girls' butts or something like that."
49:04,100;49:05,100;"What?"
49:05,100;49:06,100;"Yeah."
49:06,100;49:08,100;"I think that that was like the stuff that started to come out."
49:08,100;49:09,100;"What is going on?"
49:09,100;49:10,100;"You're like, that's cool."
49:10,100;49:11,100;"It's cool."
49:11,100;49:12,100;"He's selling the team."
49:12,100;49:13,100;"He's selling the team."
49:13,100;49:14,100;"It's cool."
49:14,100;49:15,100;"We don't need any more of these stories."
49:15,100;49:16,100;"Yeah."
49:16,100;49:17,100;"Typical NFL shit."
49:17,100;49:18,100;"Wow."
49:18,100;49:20,100;"It is like I'm by the team and shirt off."
49:20,100;49:21,100;"He didn't."
49:21,100;49:22,100;"He did it."
49:22,100;49:25,140;"He did a not qualified to run an NFL team."
49:25,140;49:29,140;"Mark posted about that, didn't you, Greg?"
49:29,140;49:29,940;"About P.D."
49:29,940;49:34,340;"Try to get the money to get a little by the Carolina Panthers."
49:34,340;49:36,140;"That would have made you some good television."
49:36,140;49:40,020;"Like he called them the North Carolina Panthers."
49:40,020;49:40,980;"It's something like that."
49:40,980;49:46,260;"Whoops, not a great start."
49:46,260;49:50,740;"Well, there's that why the Clippers don't know the Lakers."
49:51,380;49:59,140;"Yeah, clipper is yeah clipper. Yeah. He was super racist. Yeah, we've seen out too. He was"
49:59,140;50:10,020;"you know, it's true. It's also super racist. Yeah, also true. Yeah, I don't know. I don't"
50:10,020;50:16,100;"know what I am anymore. But I'm gonna start putting down American and Azorian in the other"
50:16,100;50:22,260;"that one. Oh, he's Zorian nice. Yeah, not even Portuguese just a Zorian. Well, I'd be my"
50:22,260;50:28,980;"family from the a's or is nobody even knows where that is. So I do. I know. I know, right? And he's"
50:28,980;50:37,940;"a great, great man. I actually know a lot of a's or is really? Yeah. All right. Well,"
50:37,940;50:44,180;"company Mike, the one you interview. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, the guy that interviewed me was"
50:44,180;50:49,940;"he's wearing you're right yeah half the damn place was well I didn't like how"
50:49,940;50:54,100;"you what was that damn place is it about the place it was about the people in"
50:54,100;50:59,420;"the place I didn't like that all called porta how am I supposed to keep my"
50:59,420;51:04,540;"part whoa I don't like this at all dude here on some"
51:04,540;51:12,300;"that I straighten up. Holy crap. What's going on? I'm furious. Mike's fault saying,"
51:12,300;51:18,280;"Oh, not the back track. I know. I was going to be two second joke. I pulled its back so"
51:18,280;51:25,180;"well and everything talking about kickers. I apologize. Up in flames. First time I apologize."
51:25,180;51:31,420;"I can be the last statement. If we just do football or not football, Mike, I got a few"
51:31,420;51:35,820;"If you want to get to them. Yes. Should we talk about how the game ends?"
51:35,820;51:39,300;"You hold you that? All right. Fine. It's whatever you want to Andy."
51:39,300;51:42,660;"You want it's off the rails today. Sure is."
51:42,660;51:49,700;"All right. The Patriots won 20 to 13. The other race he was that close was because"
51:49,700;51:54,380;"the dolphins who are touched down in garbage time at the end was under"
51:54,380;51:58,700;"all right. It was garbage time, but then it slowly became like"
51:59,660;52:02,500;"not garbage time. It got very close at the end I felt."
52:02,500;52:05,420;"Yeah, Pat's had a chance to put this game away and they really didn't"
52:05,420;52:06,900;"don't want to"
52:06,900;52:07,420;"be the"
52:07,420;52:12,340;"path after after the half just started running clock like in the third quarter"
52:12,340;52:13,260;"just running clock."
52:13,260;52:17,060;"Did you watch it? Yeah."
52:17,060;52:19,500;"Old thing. I did."
52:19,500;52:21,980;"And I got off the airplane today. Yep."
52:21,980;52:24,580;"All right. So so should we ask Greg if you watched it?"
52:24,580;52:26,620;"Oh, well, you want"
52:26,620;52:27,620;"comedy?"
52:27,620;52:33,940;"the quote. Yeah, hit me with a quote from your binder, of"
52:33,940;52:34,420;"course."
52:34,420;52:39,900;"When the guy said Patrick pass was Patrick catch on his"
52:39,900;52:40,260;"touch."
52:40,260;52:43,460;"Yeah, we talked about that. We did that."
52:43,460;52:48,260;"But that still proves my point that I watched it, right? Because"
52:48,260;52:50,900;"there was no highlights on the YouTube machine."
52:50,900;52:53,380;"Yeah, this game didn't exist on the internet."
52:53,380;52:57,380;"Exactly. So the only way I would have known that quote is if I"
52:57,380;53:00,380;"actually clicked on the link and watched the whole game."
53:00,380;53:01,640;"That's fair."
53:01,640;53:06,200;"Although it was not about in the boss and glove right after."
53:06,200;53:11,120;"No, I actually looked and it was like, oh, the second quarter was all the touchdown."
53:11,120;53:12,380;"So I watched the second quarter."
53:12,380;53:14,880;"That's one way to do it."
53:14,880;53:17,760;"But you miss you miss the, the Brady play."
53:17,760;53:22,260;"But right back on I saw that I saw that."
53:22,260;53:23,060;"Oh, okay."
53:23,060;53:23,560;"Very good."
53:24,680;53:28,040;"Well, yeah, the end of the game though is getting a little bit too close for comfort."
53:28,040;53:30,360;"And this was like a must win essentially."
53:30,360;53:33,800;"They had to win the division the following week."
53:33,800;53:35,960;"They have to win that game too, right?"
53:35,960;53:37,560;"So it was all down to the wire."
53:37,560;53:41,920;"And for some reason, for a game that was a blowout in the last eight minutes, I think"
53:41,920;53:43,320;"it got pretty close."
53:43,320;53:47,520;"I mean, it went down to a on side kick and the dolphins."
53:47,520;53:50,160;"Dude, that was like for an unsuccessful kick."
53:50,160;53:53,240;"That looked like one of the best on side kicks I've seen."
53:53,920;53:55,920;"It was well executed, but it was before..."
53:55,920;54:02,020;"I actually know this was the first time I remember seeing"
54:02,020;54:05,160;"the Patriots do their patented"
54:05,160;54:09,280;"on-sized kick-recover where they have all the guys on the side,"
54:09,280;54:11,680;"but everybody except for one goes and blocks,"
54:11,680;54:14,360;"and then the one guy, the hands guy has to catch it."
54:14,360;54:16,120;"Oh, it's genius."
54:16,120;54:17,140;"But..."
54:17,140;54:18,480;"Hands guy."
54:18,480;54:20,240;"It's Fred Coleman."
54:20,240;54:21,840;"Fred Coleman, right?"
54:21,840;54:22,440;"Who is that?"
54:22,440;54:24,440;"the big play against the jet."
54:24,440;54:28,440;"His only catch. And this was his only other play of the season."
54:28,440;54:31,440;"And he caught it and he got lit the fuck up."
54:31,440;54:33,440;"He took the shot."
54:33,440;54:36,440;"The backup like defensive end or something like that."
54:36,440;54:40,440;"Some huge dude had a running start and just crushed him."
54:40,440;54:44,440;"He'd think they would put Patrick Ketch back there for the hands team."
54:44,440;54:46,440;"Oh, I don't know."
54:46,440;54:48,440;"We'll revisit him in 2005."
54:48,440;54:49,440;"Believe me."
54:49,440;54:51,440;"Mike Scott thoughts."
54:51,440;54:53,440;"Yeah"
54:53,440;54:55,440;"That's a rules change"
54:55,440;55:00,640;"What do you guys think of that instead of the on-site's kick doing that fourth and 17?"
55:00,640;55:06,880;"I'm tired because at this point nobody recovers on tech. I know it's kind of a lame thing"
55:06,880;55:13,440;"2017 I'm fine with it. Yeah, I think it's cool. It's better. It is now"
55:13,440;55:16,680;"Yeah for sure"
55:16,960;55:21,480;"How many games can you remember against the Saints or against Cleveland most recently"
55:21,480;55:23,720;"where the Patriots recovered it?"
55:23,720;55:25,520;"It's a really exciting thing."
55:25,520;55:29,720;"Yeah, like Andy said, after the rules changes, it doesn't happen to him."
55:29,720;55:30,720;"It's lame."
55:30,720;55:31,720;"It's lame."
55:31,720;55:36,840;"I read one stipulation to the rule that I thought was brilliant too."
55:36,840;55:39,360;"You don't want it to be like a pass interference."
55:39,360;55:41,360;"It gives you the first down."
55:41,360;55:47,620;"So treat the 17 yard line to gain as like an end zone."
55:47,620;55:49,380;"So if there's a penalty beyond it,"
55:49,380;55:53,540;"you just get one play from a fourth and one from that spot."
55:53,540;55:54,540;"Oh, all right."
55:54,540;55:55,540;"Oh, I see."
55:55,540;55:57,700;"So it's not a converted."
55:57,700;56:01,580;"But it gives you a second chance."
56:01,580;56:02,080;"Right."
56:02,080;56:04,480;"So you can't just do the Joe Flacco,"
56:04,480;56:06,500;"hook it down, drag it down to the one yard line,"
56:06,500;56:08,500;"or path with appearance."
56:08,500;56:08,900;"Yeah."
56:08,900;56:10,580;"Clever."
56:10,580;56:12,580;"Yeah, I think it's not bad."
56:12,580;56:15,140;"- Good, 'cause I've seen people hate on it."
56:15,140;56:17,420;"I'm like, you guys are just lame"
56:17,420;56:18,940;"if you don't want that rule."
56:18,940;56:21,920;"- Dude, I just, I like, especially most of the games, right,"
56:21,920;56:23,340;"are not for the Patriots, right?"
56:23,340;56:24,900;"So if you just happen to be watching a game"
56:24,900;56:26,540;"and you have no vested interest,"
56:26,540;56:28,780;"I just wanna see something fun and exciting."
56:28,780;56:31,540;"It's pretty lame when like the anticipation builds"
56:31,540;56:33,200;"and the announcer's trying to make it exciting"
56:33,200;56:35,100;"and then it like kind of just patters out of bounds"
56:35,100;56:36,180;"or into somebody's hands."
56:36,180;56:38,100;"I'm like, yeah, it's lame."
56:38,100;56:39,540;"- Yeah, I agree."
56:39,540;56:40,620;"So yeah, all right."
56:40,620;56:42,620;"So I mean, that ends the game."
56:42,620;56:46,500;"Patriots recover the on-size kick, which starts a scuffle."
56:46,500;56:50,140;"But Pats end up being able to kneel it at the ends"
56:50,140;56:52,100;"and Bellatreck gets--"
56:52,100;56:55,060;"[INAUDIBLE]"
56:55,060;56:55,980;"What?"
56:55,980;56:58,700;"Go over the playoffs."
56:58,700;57:00,100;"It wasn't actually official."
57:00,100;57:01,860;"Yeah, it wasn't guaranteed yet."
57:01,860;57:05,140;"But they have their bi-week next week in week 16."
57:05,140;57:07,700;"Yeah, well, because this game was played on the Saturday"
57:07,700;57:09,020;"and the two other games it mattered"
57:09,020;57:14,940;"were on the Sunday. And I think if either the dolphins, sorry, the jets or the"
57:14,940;57:19,340;"Ravens lost the pages being the playoffs, but the jets beat the Colts and the"
57:19,340;57:21,940;"Ravens beat the Bengals. So it didn't happen there one more week."
57:21,940;57:26,700;"All right. Regardless, Balachek still got his Gatorade bath at the end of the game."
57:26,700;57:27,860;"He did."
57:27,860;57:33,180;"And I was a little, little smile on his face again, before he sold his soul."
57:33,180;57:36,260;"So excited. Yeah. Given people bear hugs."
57:36,580;57:37,420;"- Yup."
57:37,420;57:40,580;"- Guys, I feel like we're making the playoffs here."
57:40,580;57:43,600;"Like I didn't think we'd last 16 years."
57:43,600;57:44,940;"(laughing)"
57:44,940;57:45,780;"- I'm winning, yeah."
57:45,780;57:48,180;"- That's a fair point."
57:48,180;57:49,740;"- So I guess the question is,"
57:49,740;57:51,300;"where's my Gatorade bath?"
57:51,300;57:54,660;"- I think it's potentially in the wine episode,"
57:54,660;57:56,700;"which we'll address later if we get to it."
57:56,700;57:58,780;"- Yeah, that's still on the table."
57:58,780;58:01,660;"We're figuring out the specifics of that."
58:01,660;58:03,180;"- Right."
58:03,180;58:04,300;"But yeah, no, you're right, man."
58:04,300;58:09,260;"I mean, uh, uh, it's been a pleasure, uh, connecting with you guys again."
58:09,260;58:12,940;"It was a good idea, Andy, to talk about the pets and connect with you guys."
58:12,940;58:15,460;"Cause life happens and then it's tough to get in touch."
58:15,460;58:17,020;"So it was a good idea."
58:17,020;58:19,460;"You may get to like this is the last episode."
58:19,460;58:20,020;"We serve."
58:20,020;58:21,860;"We're going to go to the game left."
58:21,860;58:22,340;"Well, we're at the right."
58:22,340;58:23,680;"We're going to go buy a week, man."
58:23,680;58:24,940;"You know, that's fair enough."
58:24,940;58:25,180;"Yeah."
58:25,180;58:26,500;"Mentally prepping."
58:26,500;58:29,580;"Oh, good Lord."
58:29,580;58:29,820;"All right."
58:29,820;58:32,460;"So, uh, let's do football, not football."
58:32,460;58:33,020;"Do you have any?"
58:33,340;58:40,340;"I do have a few man and some of them I think that they're just throwing it up to me."
58:40,340;58:41,340;"You know what I'm saying?"
58:41,340;58:42,340;"Yeah."
58:42,340;58:46,340;"Greg Gumbel, Phil Simms, they're new on the scene for us."
58:46,340;58:47,340;"Haven't heard them yet."
58:47,340;58:48,340;"Right."
58:48,340;58:52,540;"And there's a couple similar ones, but the way that they word it, I'm just like, come"
58:52,540;58:56,340;"on guys, I know what this is at this point, but you're just making it hard on me."
58:56,340;58:57,340;"Oh, that's here."
58:57,340;58:58,340;"All right."
58:58,340;58:59,340;"First one."
58:59,340;59:02,340;"Well, is that Greg's prime."
59:02,340;59:03,500;"- Oh, yeah."
59:03,500;59:06,180;"All right, so I don't know if you guys picked up"
59:06,180;59:07,900;"on some of these, but--"
59:07,900;59:09,060;"- Endowed it."
59:09,060;59:11,660;"- All right, Charlie Weiss, the offensive,"
59:11,660;59:14,220;"so they're talking about Brady here."
59:14,220;59:16,980;"Charlie Weiss, the offensive coordinator."
59:16,980;59:18,620;"He says he brought me in his office"
59:18,620;59:20,500;"and he gave me a tongue lashing."
59:20,500;59:22,620;"So it kind of snapped him out of everything"
59:22,620;59:25,060;"and I think Tom Brady feels good because of him."
59:25,060;59:26,820;"That's kind of crazy, right?"
59:26,820;59:28,020;"- That's, yeah."
59:28,020;59:29,980;"I mean, what is a tongue lashing?"
59:29,980;59:31,140;"- I don't know."
59:31,140;59:33,220;"Can we Google that?"
59:33,220;59:33,720;"What is it?"
59:33,720;59:35,020;"Tonga lashing?"
59:35,020;59:35,520;"Yeah."
59:35,520;59:36,300;"What's a tongue lashing?"
59:36,300;59:37,500;"Because he says he gets a tongue lashing."
59:37,500;59:40,320;"And then all of a sudden he felt like really good."
59:40,320;59:43,660;"You want me to give you the ASMR version of what Google"
59:43,660;59:44,940;"saying here?"
59:44,940;59:45,500;"ASMR."
59:45,500;59:46,000;"OK."
59:46,000;59:48,620;"Is that the whispering stuff?"
59:48,620;59:49,300;"Yeah."
59:49,300;59:50,220;"All right."
59:50,220;59:51,220;"Yes."
59:51,220;59:53,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
59:53,220;59:55,220;"[CLAPPING]"
59:55,220;59:56,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
59:56,220;59:57,220;"Fuck was that?"
59:57,220;59:58,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
59:58,220;59:59,220;"I'm fucked."
59:59,220;01:00:00,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:00:00,220;01:00:01,220;"What was that?"
01:00:01,220;01:00:05,220;"Did you have it like queued up to Greg?"
01:00:05,220;01:00:06,220;"Yeah."
01:00:06,220;01:00:07,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:00:07,220;01:00:08,220;"Yeah."
01:00:08,220;01:00:09,220;"What?"
01:00:09,220;01:00:10,220;"What was that?"
01:00:10,220;01:00:12,220;"Was that you make that noise?"
01:00:12,220;01:00:14,220;"Oh, it was Google dude."
01:00:14,220;01:00:15,220;"Statching."
01:00:15,220;01:00:16,220;"What?"
01:00:16,220;01:00:17,220;"Really?"
01:00:17,220;01:00:18,220;"Yeah."
01:00:18,220;01:00:19,220;"Can we hear it again?"
01:00:19,220;01:00:20,220;"Yeah."
01:00:20,220;01:00:23,220;"So football and not football."
01:00:23,220;01:00:24,220;"Give it to us again."
01:00:24,220;01:00:27,220;"Don't let me get to know more time."
01:00:27,220;01:00:29,140;"No."
01:00:29,140;01:00:43,140;"See, I had a different experience when I Google tongue lashing."
01:00:43,140;01:00:50,740;"The definition here is that it's a noun is allowed or severe"
01:00:50,740;01:00:56,980;"scolding. So I don't but after after Greg's experience that he shared with us, I don't"
01:00:56,980;01:01:03,140;"I don't know who to believe so. I think this is a gray area. Two words tongue-lashing or one?"
01:01:03,140;01:01:09,140;"I think it's two. Yeah, I think it is two. It looks hyphenated to me."
01:01:09,140;01:01:15,940;"I mean, if that's if that's not gray area, I don't know what it is. Yeah, I think you're right"
01:01:15,940;01:01:28,940;"though because yeah Greg's findings is very persuasive. It's overwhelming. Yeah that was the yeah that was great. Thank you for looking that up. I appreciate that."
01:01:28,940;01:01:33,940;"That's great. Holy shit."
01:01:33,940;01:01:35,940;"All right, well next one"
01:01:35,940;01:01:43,740;"And I get what this is I think but I think that there was a little like weird tinge about the referee that they were talking about"
01:01:43,740;01:01:48,420;"But one of the announcements said a referee would like to look at it from every angle"
01:01:48,420;01:01:51,300;"Ooh girl, right"
01:01:51,300;01:01:53,820;"Was he under that hood thing - when he was talking about him? I"
01:01:53,820;01:01:59,820;"Think so that's all you wonder what they're looking at under there because when they come out there. They're rarely"
01:01:59,820;01:02:02,660;"Talking about what they were showing on the TV"
01:02:03,180;01:02:09,800;"Right, so they get their own angles right like that what we see I guess but own angles of what of it?"
01:02:09,800;01:02:18,680;"I don't know. I don't know if I don't want you to Google's anymore. I'm a little scarred by the last fact check to be completely honest"
01:02:18,680;01:02:21,840;"So we're just gonna put this in the football want to move on"
01:02:21,840;01:02:26,680;"All right. Yeah, I think so. I think they might be talking about different angles of the play"
01:02:26,680;01:02:30,660;"Yeah, all the different camera angles that they've captured, you know, okay"
01:02:30,660;01:02:46,720;"All the secret cameras that they have especially especially in Fox"
01:02:46,720;01:02:52,600;"though the XFL it's interesting that they're like trying to do another different thing where it's like full transparency you can see"
01:02:52,600;01:02:56,100;"What the referee sees you can like no show a conversation"
01:02:56,100;01:03:02,700;"Yeah, they'll show a freaking coach say a play and then they'll show what that play is right after I'm like"
01:03:02,700;01:03:05,340;"That's isn't that the epitome of like science feeling or whatever"
01:03:05,340;01:03:07,920;"kind of yeah"
01:03:07,920;01:03:09,920;"so"
01:03:09,920;01:03:12,980;"What is that guys want to get into some science dealing?"
01:03:12,980;01:03:21,980;"I mean, the Red Sox, they probably stole some signs, but I'm okay with it."
01:03:21,980;01:03:22,980;"Yeah."
01:03:22,980;01:03:25,980;"Steve, you ain't cheating."
01:03:25,980;01:03:26,980;"You ain't trying."
01:03:26,980;01:03:29,980;"Oh, classic paths, Dan."
01:03:29,980;01:03:31,980;"Yeah, everyone's doing it."
01:03:31,980;01:03:34,980;"Cheatreats and all that shit."
01:03:34,980;01:03:37,980;"But I'm a asterisk."
01:03:37,980;01:03:38,980;"I can donate."
01:03:38,980;01:03:45,500;"I'm also I'm also a huge fan of all the Astros players getting beat every time they go up to the plate too"
01:03:45,500;01:03:50,940;"Because I wanted to test your homemorism"
01:03:50,940;01:03:53,220;"if you"
01:03:53,220;01:03:59,740;"Get like pissed when people say the Patriots achieve and then you get like you judge other franchises for cheating"
01:03:59,740;01:04:02,540;"Then you're not being consistent. Oh, yeah"
01:04:02,540;01:04:07,060;"Her pat fans like rag on you since like to come on"
01:04:07,700;01:04:12,760;"Yeah, I think that's it's funny if you could get away with that long. I mean that's hilarious"
01:04:12,760;01:04:20,420;"Exactly and the trash can thing that's genius dude. It's genius cuz no nobody recognizes the trash can that was doing it"
01:04:20,420;01:04:23,880;"You know what I think it's funny about the whole thing. They do not give a fuck"
01:04:23,880;01:04:28,900;"They don't give a shit"
01:04:28,900;01:04:32,180;"Apologies that they keep come out and give in be like well, I'm sorry you're offended"
01:04:34,300;01:04:35,300;"nicely done."
01:04:35,300;01:04:38,460;"My favorite part is the Yankees, man."
01:04:38,460;01:04:43,260;"They just keep whining about how they lost two years and eroded them to the Red Sox."
01:04:43,260;01:04:44,260;"And I think it's hilarious."
01:04:44,260;01:04:45,260;"Yeah."
01:04:45,260;01:04:50,900;"And there's also like so much smoke around the fact that like all these former Astros,"
01:04:50,900;01:04:54,900;"like people that were involved in it when they're in Houston are on the Yankees as well."
01:04:54,900;01:04:57,420;"It's like, I don't know how clean you are."
01:04:57,420;01:05:00,740;"So maybe stop throwing those rocks in that glass house of yours."
01:05:00,740;01:05:01,740;"Yeah."
01:05:01,740;01:05:05,620;"Remember the song, ""Member Doug, Doug, Funny?"""
01:05:05,620;01:05:06,620;"Oh yeah."
01:05:06,620;01:05:07,620;"Yeah."
01:05:07,620;01:05:09,700;"Remember his song, ""Banging on a Trash Can?"""
01:05:09,700;01:05:10,700;"Oh yeah!"
01:05:10,700;01:05:14,500;"Every time I hear about it, I think that song."
01:05:14,500;01:05:15,500;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:05:15,500;01:05:16,500;"That's the stream, man."
01:05:16,500;01:05:22,100;"That should be every other opponent's walk-up song to the--"
01:05:22,100;01:05:24,100;"Oh, now they're at bat."
01:05:24,100;01:05:26,860;"Or as a reliever you come out to that?"
01:05:26,860;01:05:28,540;"Dude, it's hilarious."
01:05:28,540;01:05:31,260;"I just think, like, talking about the Yankees."
01:05:31,260;01:05:32,980;"So let's say A rod, right?"
01:05:32,980;01:05:35,300;"Mr. steroids, his band from baseball."
01:05:35,300;01:05:37,180;"And now he's like a beloved celebrity."
01:05:37,180;01:05:38,780;"He's with JLo."
01:05:38,780;01:05:41,780;"We're just cutting through the 15 years of hate"
01:05:41,780;01:05:43,300;"and just going right to that point."
01:05:43,300;01:05:44,300;"Yeah."
01:05:44,300;01:05:45,900;"It's hilarious."
01:05:45,900;01:05:48,060;"Yeah."
01:05:48,060;01:05:48,900;"Who cares?"
01:05:48,900;01:05:52,740;"- Good for this moment."
01:05:52,740;01:05:55,660;"- Not all, you know, in reality,"
01:05:55,660;01:05:56,500;"we shouldn't cheat."
01:05:56,500;01:05:58,020;"It's all about the integrity of the game."
01:05:58,020;01:05:59,060;"This is all in jest."
01:05:59,060;01:06:00,580;"Okay, for all those out there,"
01:06:00,580;01:06:03,940;"i believe in organized sports i believe in the youth of america"
01:06:03,940;01:06:05,740;"and what's keep every game"
01:06:05,740;01:06:09,300;"clean thank you you know what the xfl should do"
01:06:09,300;01:06:12,620;"they should allow performance enhancing drugs"
01:06:12,620;01:06:13,900;"and all of them"
01:06:13,900;01:06:15,780;"uh... what they have that"
01:06:15,780;01:06:18,700;"let's see what the the human body can do"
01:06:18,700;01:06:21,100;"when he just put all the other the fuck"
01:06:21,100;01:06:24,060;"i think they tried that in spurts"
01:06:24,060;01:06:26,900;"throughout history it would end up being like uh..."
01:06:26,900;01:06:31,400;"What was that which T.H. Mute Ninja Turtles movie was it the second one with the ooze?"
01:06:31,400;01:06:33,740;"Oh, oh, yeah."
01:06:33,740;01:06:36,720;"And those like huge fucking monster things."
01:06:36,720;01:06:38,560;"Fox steady and beep off."
01:06:38,560;01:06:39,200;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:39,200;01:06:40,100;"I think it was, wasn't it?"
01:06:40,100;01:06:40,460;"Yeah."
01:06:40,460;01:06:41,440;"Yeah."
01:06:41,440;01:06:44,200;"It's also called the 1970s Pittsburgh Steelers."
01:06:44,200;01:06:45,280;"Oh, good point."
01:06:45,280;01:06:45,880;"Yeah."
01:06:45,880;01:06:47,160;"We're the American gladiators."
01:06:47,160;01:06:48,440;"Oh, I love them."
01:06:48,440;01:06:52,720;"All all beloved franchises."
01:06:52,720;01:06:54,200;"What's the next I felt waiting for?"
01:06:54,680;01:06:58,180;"Yeah. And if you're trying to entertain the people, like give us"
01:06:58,180;01:07:01,920;"Yeah, I want to see 70 yard field goals. I want to see some guy"
01:07:01,920;01:07:04,680;"kicking a field goal from his own 30 yard line. Like that's"
01:07:04,680;01:07:05,880;"fucking legit."
01:07:05,880;01:07:09,960;"I don't we don't condone any of this. We don't condone stereo"
01:07:09,960;01:07:11,880;"ideas. It's it's"
01:07:11,880;01:07:16,120;"sounds like the real way to me right there, Mike. The what?"
01:07:16,120;01:07:19,280;"That's the real way right there. I can do it all this shit."
01:07:19,280;01:07:21,080;"All right. I personally"
01:07:22,600;01:07:24,920;"Yeah, yeah, all right. You got more football."
01:07:24,920;01:07:28,960;"No, I do, but this one is this one's BS because we've already talked about the whole."
01:07:28,960;01:07:33,400;"I already know what the whole is, but now these guys tell me that J.R."
01:07:33,400;01:07:35,960;"Redmond squirts through a hole. Come on."
01:07:35,960;01:07:39,160;"They're just they're messing their playing with your mind, Mike."
01:07:39,160;01:07:41,400;"No, I know. And like Steve's like brought it up."
01:07:41,400;01:07:42,960;"Or is like we've already talked about the pocket."
01:07:42,960;01:07:48,200;"We've talked about the whole, but football or not football because that's that's they're just come on."
01:07:48,200;01:07:51,240;"I think at this point, they know you're listening."
01:07:51,440;01:07:55,160;"So that I think this one is actually intentionally not football, even though"
01:07:55,160;01:07:57,840;"because they've they've kind of"
01:07:57,840;01:08:00,440;"lulled you into the football side of this."
01:08:00,440;01:08:02,680;"And now they've seen how far they can take it."
01:08:02,680;01:08:04,160;"So I'm going to say this is not football."
01:08:04,160;01:08:07,040;"Yeah. Why would you need to say squirts through a hole?"
01:08:07,040;01:08:09,560;"So human beings don't squirt."
01:08:09,560;01:08:11,680;"Right. Well, not like that."
01:08:11,680;01:08:13,400;"You scamper through all."
01:08:13,400;01:08:17,200;"I've heard that squirting ain't nothing but pain."
01:08:17,200;01:08:19,640;"Oh, I pee through the hole."
01:08:19,720;01:08:21,440;"Are you talking about certain like videos?"
01:08:21,440;01:08:22,840;"That sounds like comfortable."
01:08:22,840;01:08:24,520;"Dude, I've heard that rumor too."
01:08:24,520;01:08:25,520;"It's addressing right now."
01:08:25,520;01:08:26,080;"Right now."
01:08:26,080;01:08:28,000;"Yeah, Jack."
01:08:28,000;01:08:29,520;"You're dead."
01:08:29,520;01:08:33,840;"Yeah, Google that on Kelly's work computer."
01:08:33,840;01:08:38,640;"We'll just leave it at that."
01:08:38,640;01:08:40,520;"But I have heard those rumors as well."
01:08:40,520;01:08:43,000;"It says."
01:08:43,000;01:08:45,640;"So that leads me to the next one then."
01:08:45,640;01:08:47,040;"OK."
01:08:47,320;01:08:50,160;"As a linebacker, he makes it so hard."
01:08:50,160;01:08:51,520;"And why they put the so on there?"
01:08:51,520;01:08:53,040;"That's what I wonder."
01:08:53,040;01:08:55,280;"He makes it so hard."
01:08:55,280;01:08:58,920;"Yeah, that's a context one, but I don't know if I can help you that."
01:08:58,920;01:08:59,880;"This is what I'm saying, man."
01:08:59,880;01:09:01,880;"I'm getting almost frustrated because it's like,"
01:09:01,880;01:09:03,520;"you're so blatant."
01:09:03,520;01:09:05,800;"It's like, what are we doing here?"
01:09:05,800;01:09:08,640;"But anyways, I got--"
01:09:08,640;01:09:12,560;"I don't know, but you may be the only person"
01:09:12,560;01:09:17,400;"to watch a 20 year old football game and get sexually frustrated."
01:09:17,400;01:09:21,240;"I don't know. Whoa, I wasn't even referring to anything sexual."
01:09:21,240;01:09:26,880;"I disagree. Oh, dude, I don't know what you're doing over there."
01:09:26,880;01:09:29,840;"But I'm just getting frustrated. That's it."
01:09:29,840;01:09:34,680;"Fun lash and life. Yeah. Well, now I think about it."
01:09:34,680;01:09:40,320;"The whole new light. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. That's that's a sound I won't"
01:09:40,320;01:09:46,600;"ever be able to unhere. What's the point of ASMR thing? Well, that was pretty good."
01:09:46,600;01:09:55,920;"Yeah, I got into that ASMR thing. Yeah, I'm all set, I think. No, I think that's it. We're the first like progressive ASMR Patriots podcast on"
01:09:55,920;01:10:02,520;"the earth. Oh, we might be the first to ever have done that. You're right. The first sports ASMR part. Yeah, maybe"
01:10:02,760;01:10:08,520;"We should have an ASMR segment. I don't know. Okay. Okay."
01:10:08,520;01:10:11,280;"Squirting ASMR."
01:10:11,280;01:10:16,680;"Oh, Jesus Christ."
01:10:16,680;01:10:22,280;"Oh my God, that was interesting."
01:10:22,280;01:10:25,080;"It's just you peeing into a toilet."
01:10:30,040;01:10:31,840;"Oh, it's a really rapidly."
01:10:31,840;01:10:33,400;"Yeah, I can go last two."
01:10:33,400;01:10:34,040;"Let's just let's."
01:10:34,040;01:10:36,400;"Oh, it's got two more."
01:10:36,400;01:10:37,800;"I got two more."
01:10:37,800;01:10:38,920;"All right."
01:10:38,920;01:10:40,320;"Easy one, I think."
01:10:40,320;01:10:46,120;"Fuck."
01:10:46,120;01:10:47,240;"Steve's just making me laugh."
01:10:47,240;01:10:48,520;"All right."
01:10:48,520;01:10:53,760;"The penalty helps the Dolphins come out of their own end."
01:10:53,760;01:10:57,600;"The penalty helps the Dolphins come out of their own end."
01:10:57,600;01:11:05,920;"I got nothing. Oh, actually no. Okay. All right. All right. I think this is football."
01:11:05,920;01:11:09,720;"I think their own end is probably their own end of the field probably. They were probably"
01:11:09,720;01:11:14,320;"backed up against the end zone. Would that make sense? Yep. Their end zone. Oh, why would"
01:11:14,320;01:11:20,280;"they say? Okay, that makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Again, I wrote like the scenario of like"
01:11:20,280;01:11:24,320;"the dolphins and the penalty, but I guess I got to like just write the context of it."
01:11:24,320;01:11:26,060;"It's always seems to be our context."
01:11:26,060;01:11:27,620;"The more details the better."
01:11:27,620;01:11:28,580;"- All right."
01:11:28,580;01:11:30,780;"So the last one, this is about Chambers,"
01:11:30,780;01:11:32,980;"which he was a rookie, right?"
01:11:32,980;01:11:34,380;"This year? - Yeah."
01:11:34,380;01:11:35,780;"- So he was coming into his own."
01:11:35,780;01:11:38,740;"I thought he was doing a pretty good job"
01:11:38,740;01:11:40,060;"when he was given an opportunity,"
01:11:40,060;01:11:42,820;"but this comment is about him."
01:11:42,820;01:11:43,820;"And the announcers were saying,"
01:11:43,820;01:11:46,020;"the running back went through the middle."
01:11:46,020;01:11:49,300;"That made the middle open up and Chambers fills it in."
01:11:49,300;01:11:51,740;"What does that mean?"
01:11:53,380;01:11:54,380;"I don't know."
01:11:54,380;01:11:57,060;"Middle of what I wonder."
01:11:57,060;01:11:58,060;"No idea."
01:11:58,060;01:12:00,460;"Maybe, maybe it's the field."
01:12:00,460;01:12:02,620;"Oh, ah, oh, I remember this play."
01:12:02,620;01:12:03,620;"I don't know why."
01:12:03,620;01:12:10,180;"Probably because I heard it and thought this might be on football."
01:12:10,180;01:12:12,180;"But it was, who was it?"
01:12:12,180;01:12:14,180;"It was Chambers in the running back, right?"
01:12:14,180;01:12:15,180;"Yeah."
01:12:15,180;01:12:21,700;"And so they're saying that Chambers ran through the middle, I think, of the field and he threw"
01:12:21,700;01:12:29,860;"the coverage of the defenders, which allowed the running back to fill the middle or the"
01:12:29,860;01:12:33,660;"other way around. I think it was the other way around. Either way. So chambers filled"
01:12:33,660;01:12:40,580;"the middle of the field where the defenders weren't there anymore. Oh, okay. Got it."
01:12:40,580;01:12:46,020;"Ooh, we escaped. Yeah, no. Yeah, yeah. That one was football. You remember it though."
01:12:46,020;01:12:50,000;"I do. I don't know why I remember that place specifically for all that that"
01:12:50,000;01:12:50,940;"commentation."
01:12:50,940;01:12:57,180;"Well, thank you guys as usual. Oh, no, thank you."
01:12:57,180;01:13:00,380;"I mean, this one, I enjoyed this one thoroughly."
01:13:00,380;01:13:01,060;"So thank you."
01:13:01,060;01:13:02,620;"You learned a lot."
01:13:02,620;01:13:04,860;"Can I do my best?"
01:13:04,860;01:13:09,220;"Do you're what? Yeah. Yeah, we'll do best and worse now, Greg, if you want to go first."
01:13:09,220;01:13:15,220;"I'm just going to, I didn't have any, but while Mike was finishing his, I just"
01:13:15,220;01:13:24,100;"started googling dog. My best is skater Valentine. I love him."
01:13:24,100;01:13:33,340;"He was blue, wasn't he? He was. Yeah. And obviously, my worst is Roger"
01:13:33,340;01:13:40,020;"Clots. Why? Because he looks a Zorian. That's dude. You're cut off,"
01:13:40,020;01:13:48,580;"man. He's really really much orange hair. What color should we make this guy? Cause"
01:13:48,580;01:13:54,980;"it's the bad guy. You know, like, it's just go green to be safe. That's a great show though."
01:13:54,980;01:13:59,620;"That's ready. What's green? I don't know. I lost all respect for that show after they went"
01:13:59,620;01:14:05,060;"episode where he tells Doug that he burned down the science building and instead of like walking"
01:14:05,060;01:14:08,300;"over and verifying it. He's like, now I have to go on the run."
01:14:08,300;01:14:09,500;"Yeah."
01:14:09,500;01:14:14,740;"You held that a thing for a while, because I've heard you say that"
01:14:14,740;01:14:16,820;"for Steve. Yeah. Really? Yeah."
01:14:16,820;01:14:22,460;"That's hilarious. I have opinions like that about certain TV shows as well."
01:14:22,460;01:14:26,220;"Yeah. I can't think of my laptop my head, but I yeah, I've got some hot"
01:14:26,220;01:14:30,620;"takes like that. All right, Steve, let's let's hear your best and worst"
01:14:30,620;01:14:33,860;"preferably from the football game and not Doug funny, but you know, do you?"
01:14:34,340;01:14:37,340;"Yeah, we already covered the dog funny the best it was"
01:14:37,340;01:14:40,780;"Patrick catches touchdown"
01:14:40,780;01:14:43,580;"Mm-hmm. Well how Tom Brady was just"
01:14:43,580;01:14:46,420;"Flipping out you"
01:14:46,420;01:14:53,500;"The comment is like wow look how crazy Brady is right now"
01:14:53,500;01:15:00,780;"When was the last time you saw that like head-budding Brady pop up? Yeah, I feel like like this last year"
01:15:00,780;01:15:03,100;"He didn't really get a lot of that out of him, right? He's too old"
01:15:03,740;01:15:08,140;"Think he had one on some of the rookies first scores usually doesn't like"
01:15:08,140;01:15:15,840;"Patrick's first touchdown. Yeah of his career his only touchdown screen, maybe I'll start check that way"
01:15:15,840;01:15:20,380;"Do you know dude? He's stuck around the patch for a while. Yeah, he's around. I don't know"
01:15:20,380;01:15:24,220;"I don't have a lot of worse. I guess the first roughing the passer call of the year"
01:15:24,220;01:15:30,460;"I mean"
01:15:30,460;01:15:33,660;"still penalty, but like I've seen some absolutely brutal hits."
01:15:33,660;01:15:35,300;"I don't even know if it would be though."
01:15:35,300;01:15:39,020;"You just he hit him and then just like finished the hit to the ground."
01:15:39,020;01:15:39,460;"Yeah."
01:15:39,460;01:15:43,100;"And today's day is definitely would be like the weight rule, whatever it is."
01:15:43,100;01:15:47,260;"I don't, but he'd be even just like a clean tacky, put his helmet"
01:15:47,260;01:15:49,420;"in his chest and just like tackle them."
01:15:49,420;01:15:50,620;"Yeah."
01:15:50,620;01:15:52,100;"He like, but he landed on top of him."
01:15:52,100;01:15:53,260;"You're not allowed to do that anymore."
01:15:53,260;01:15:54,860;"Yeah, true."
01:15:54,860;01:15:59,660;"But like there's a like crackback block on one of Troy Brown's reverses."
01:15:59,660;01:16:01,620;"that was absolutely brutal that they didn't call."
01:16:01,620;01:16:03,140;"Like, I don't know."
01:16:03,140;01:16:04,220;"Yeah, I thought that too."
01:16:04,220;01:16:05,420;"Yeah."
01:16:05,420;01:16:09,300;"And another best was a career high rushing yards for Antoine"
01:16:09,300;01:16:10,460;"on one leg."
01:16:10,460;01:16:11,300;"Yeah."
01:16:11,300;01:16:11,800;"Yeah."
01:16:11,800;01:16:12,780;"So you got injured, like what?"
01:16:12,780;01:16:14,580;"Halfway through the second quarter or something?"
01:16:14,580;01:16:16,220;"They said, I think I wrote down."
01:16:16,220;01:16:20,340;"It was a contusion on his lower leg."
01:16:20,340;01:16:24,540;"And even with that, like he would limp after every play"
01:16:24,540;01:16:27,220;"and like come off after every run he had."
01:16:27,220;01:16:28,660;"He'd still take a swim."
01:16:28,660;01:16:31,060;"And he ran for 118 yards in the first half."
01:16:31,060;01:16:34,740;"And he finished with, oh, they're like 160 or something like that."
01:16:34,740;01:16:35,620;"Something ridiculous."
01:16:35,620;01:16:37,300;"Yeah, I was like 158, I think."
01:16:37,300;01:16:37,740;"Yeah."
01:16:37,740;01:16:37,780;"Yeah."
01:16:37,780;01:16:38,340;"Yeah."
01:16:38,340;01:16:41,020;"So yeah, he was an absolute animal in this game."
01:16:41,020;01:16:45,900;"Yeah, I think Brady only like cleared 100 yards passing."
01:16:45,900;01:16:50,940;"So yeah, I think they had more rushing yards and passing yards in this game."
01:16:50,940;01:16:51,540;"I read."
01:16:51,540;01:16:57,940;"So, but just a fact check that that was Patrick Pass is only"
01:16:57,940;01:17:07,540;"touchdown catch of his go kidding. Wow. Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. Oh, we had one in the playoffs. So he has one more to get."
01:17:07,540;01:17:18,260;"Where Greg go? 2004. Before before is in from his 2005 mic. So, wow, all right, we've got a few Patrick pass highlights look forward to apparently."
01:17:18,260;01:17:19,740;"I'm digging."
01:17:19,740;01:17:22,620;"Do you think the nats are going to make the same joke?"
01:17:22,620;01:17:25,860;"Oh, 100% be hilarious."
01:17:25,860;01:17:27,500;"100%"
01:17:27,500;01:17:30,980;"All right, Mike, you're best at worst."
01:17:30,980;01:17:32,060;"All right."
01:17:32,060;01:17:35,780;"So I was going to say headbudding Brady, but that's been said."
01:17:35,780;01:17:40,460;"So I will go with one is like kind of an uneventful play, but like I thought it was"
01:17:40,460;01:17:42,380;"awesome, but Brady got blasted."
01:17:42,380;01:17:48,620;"He was blindsided and then somehow he like he lost the football and it like"
01:17:48,620;01:17:51,420;"magically bounced into his hands again, like some golden moment."
01:17:51,420;01:17:51,700;"Yeah."
01:17:51,700;01:17:53,420;"I thought that was awesome."
01:17:54,500;01:17:59,800;"That was the, yeah, the cornerback coming off the edge and you just had like a free run at Tom Brady's back."
01:17:59,800;01:18:00,800;"He didn't even see him."
01:18:00,800;01:18:01,700;"He didn't feel nothing."
01:18:01,700;01:18:03,700;"But somehow it was like right there."
01:18:03,700;01:18:04,500;"What was that?"
01:18:04,500;01:18:07,000;"Matt Light just didn't even try to block him."
01:18:07,000;01:18:07,700;"Right."
01:18:07,700;01:18:08,400;"Even see him."
01:18:08,400;01:18:08,700;"Yeah."
01:18:08,700;01:18:16,000;"But I thought that was cool because he managed to have the wherewithal to security even though he got killed."
01:18:16,000;01:18:24,400;"And it's my other top moment was a bell check almost skipping on the field at the end of the game."
01:18:24,400;01:18:28,000;"I mean, if you look back, he's like kind of frolicking almost."
01:18:28,000;01:18:31,640;"Yeah, he was literally running up to, I think it was Matt Leiter, one of the offensive"
01:18:31,640;01:18:36,240;"linemen, like giving him a huge hug and that ran over to Brady and gave him a hug"
01:18:36,240;01:18:37,920;"so hard, he almost knocked his helmet off."
01:18:37,920;01:18:40,240;"Like he was, he was excited."
01:18:40,240;01:18:42,200;"Yeah."
01:18:42,200;01:18:51,000;"So and then the worst I touched on was seeing that Brady reception because it"
01:18:51,000;01:18:56,060;"did remind me of the Super Bowl, and I can't help but think that maybe if one play went"
01:18:56,060;01:19:00,300;"the other way, the Pats would have had three in a row, the elusive three in a row."
01:19:00,300;01:19:01,300;"It's true."
01:19:01,300;01:19:02,300;"That's true."
01:19:02,300;01:19:03,300;"So it's heartbreaking."
01:19:03,300;01:19:05,140;"That's fair enough."
01:19:05,140;01:19:08,780;"And for those who aren't Pats fans and are listening for some reason, I understand that"
01:19:08,780;01:19:13,420;"it sounds shitty that I just said that."
01:19:13,420;01:19:17,660;"But those are to be expected when you're listening to the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
01:19:17,660;01:19:18,660;"Right."
01:19:18,660;01:19:23,520;"Regardless of what Greg has to say. All right, I don't work right when but if I was him"
01:19:23,520;01:19:27,000;"I would say well, it was a good 10 years where the paths didn't quite make it happen"
01:19:27,000;01:19:29,000;"But we'll leave that for another day"
01:19:29,000;01:19:31,600;"Yeah, all right guys, Greg is done"
01:19:31,600;01:19:36,200;"All right, my best and worse my best I had a couple"
01:19:36,200;01:19:40,380;"They're kind of two people Troy Brown of course"
01:19:40,380;01:19:45,520;"he had a reverse that he ran it was on the second play from scrimmage and"
01:19:46,600;01:19:49,380;"He was running to the right and it just fell apart"
01:19:49,380;01:19:54,300;"So he did what he does and actually cut it back again the other way and"
01:19:54,300;01:19:57,260;"as Steve Brown"
01:19:57,260;01:20:00,020;"alluded to earlier"
01:20:00,020;01:20:06,540;"He was trying to get around the edge and wasn't gonna make it because it was like a backside defensive line or something until"
01:20:06,540;01:20:08,080;"Wiggy"
01:20:08,080;01:20:12,460;"Tremaine Wiggins came to the rescue and absolutely just lit some dude up from the side"
01:20:13,140;01:20:18,860;"And I'm pretty sure Troy Brown got the first down we're getting nine yards on a horse as he does"
01:20:18,860;01:20:20,020;"So what he does?"
01:20:20,020;01:20:23,780;"So they had a hell of a year like I know we've talked about it, but"
01:20:23,780;01:20:30,380;"He was at this point vying for what most receptions in a season by a paths player"
01:20:30,380;01:20:33,020;"he broke"
01:20:33,020;01:20:36,220;"In this game he broke"
01:20:36,220;01:20:38,980;"Terry Glenn's record for"
01:20:39,900;01:20:46,460;"Receptions by a receiver. I think right was not a first. Yeah, and then he needed a couple more"
01:20:46,460;01:20:51,340;"To break Ben Coates's record of 96. I think it was"
01:20:51,340;01:20:58,620;"So I don't remember if he did or not so you get a commentators talk about his eyes"
01:20:58,620;01:21:01,580;"Yeah, I look for guy"
01:21:01,580;01:21:05,820;"Shave a machine called well. Oh, I miss that one"
01:21:05,820;01:21:09,980;"I don't know if he's scared or if he's just seeing the field really well or something like that"
01:21:09,980;01:21:15,940;"And he does run when he runs. He looks like he's scared, but oh yeah his eyes are so huge"
01:21:15,940;01:21:23,820;"Wait, did he ever make a pro bowl? Does anybody know? I feel like he was in the running for the pro bowl this year, right?"
01:21:23,820;01:21:29,580;"But if the guy can't make it with like almost a hundred receptions over a thousand yards and being a master on"
01:21:29,580;01:21:33,420;"punt returning which I know there are separate categories, but I"
01:21:33,860;01:21:38,020;"Don't think he did he did make it this year. This is the"
01:21:38,020;01:21:40,860;"Oh, that's awesome. All right"
01:21:40,860;01:21:45,220;"Guys in Patriots history"
01:21:45,220;01:21:53,460;"We're gonna hold in oh he's a dollar. Yeah"
01:21:53,460;01:21:59,620;"Logan gets crazy eyes. He sure does I think like that was like Caldwell's thing"
01:22:00,220;01:22:06,220;"Yeah, we call well always had them that was the thing dude, but isn't it I've always been told that it's like that could be a thyroid issue"
01:22:06,220;01:22:08,220;"So I concerned a little bit"
01:22:08,220;01:22:12,900;"Yeah, okay, I don't know"
01:22:12,900;01:22:18,820;"Stat check that please don't and if it's wrong, can we scrap that from?"
01:22:18,820;01:22:21,900;"Terrify those these stat checks now"
01:22:21,900;01:22:23,900;"What do you want me to put?"
01:22:23,900;01:22:32,600;"Yes, I'm a thyroid thyroid"
01:22:32,600;01:22:42,860;"Guys is hyper thyroidism"
01:22:42,860;01:22:50,380;"All right, so that's my only concern because I know you know it becomes a thing"
01:22:50,380;01:22:52,380;"But I hope he I hope he's okay"
01:22:52,380;01:22:57,000;"You people here. No, I think when we get to that that"
01:22:57,000;01:23:02,300;"That era will have to a deep dive in a reshape called look I feel like he's led an interesting life"
01:23:02,300;01:23:05,640;"Well, it's definitely been interesting"
01:23:05,640;01:23:10,060;"Yes, someone Molly. Yeah"
01:23:10,060;01:23:19,420;"Yeah, exactly we talked about that a couple weeks ago. Yeah with Joe horn. Yeah, you was a lookout we said"
01:23:19,420;01:23:25,980;"Oh, it's that's a well without so he's I'm just repeating what was said in earlier"
01:23:25,980;01:23:32,340;"party and the I don't know for it speaking of Troe Brown's record. He was asked before"
01:23:32,340;01:23:37,460;"the game. What do you thought about it? And so the quote was with nine receptions entering"
01:23:37,460;01:23:42,300;"this very important game Saturday. Brown needed one more catch to pass. Eric Len's 90 catches"
01:23:42,300;01:23:47,180;"in 96 with the second highest season reception total. And he needed seven to break the all"
01:23:47,180;01:23:50,380;"time record of 96 that by Ben Coates. And that's about his"
01:23:50,380;01:23:53,660;"possible eight brown said, what's the record for the most wins?"
01:23:53,660;01:23:56,460;"Can we get it? I guess we can't do it this year, but we can tie"
01:23:56,460;01:23:56,900;"it right."
01:23:56,900;01:24:01,580;"I don't understand that though. Like always a team player."
01:24:01,580;01:24:04,860;"Yeah, it's like, at least wants to win. Yeah. But like, what does"
01:24:04,860;01:24:08,020;"that mean though? Like, can we, we, he's, what was that last bit"
01:24:08,020;01:24:11,380;"that he said? Like, we can get the most wins, right? Yeah,"
01:24:11,380;01:24:13,860;"what's the record for the most wins? I think it seems for"
01:24:13,860;01:24:16,980;"the Patriots. Yeah. Oh, all right. That makes more sense."
01:24:16,980;01:24:20,060;"Yeah, I didn't quite get it out of context."
01:24:20,060;01:24:23,300;"I'm a statistic and turn it into a wheat statistic."
01:24:23,300;01:24:24,340;"Exactly."
01:24:24,340;01:24:25,660;"It's a team."
01:24:25,660;01:24:26,780;"Team lives."
01:24:26,780;01:24:27,300;"That's interesting."
01:24:27,300;01:24:29,020;"What was the most wins written team history?"
01:24:29,020;01:24:29,540;"Do we know that?"
01:24:29,540;01:24:32,700;"Are we really going to go down those roads?"
01:24:32,700;01:24:32,940;"Yeah."
01:24:32,940;01:24:33,940;"No."
01:24:33,940;01:24:37,260;"OK, because I think we all know it's a team."
01:24:37,260;01:24:42,660;"No, I mean, at that point, I don't know off top of my head."
01:24:42,660;01:24:43,620;"Right."
01:24:43,620;01:24:45,060;"I'm not looking that up."
01:24:45,060;01:24:45,540;"All right."
01:24:45,540;01:24:46,060;"Sure."
01:24:46,460;01:24:48,460;"fair enough now fucking looking at it up."
01:24:48,460;01:24:50,060;"Look down. It's 12."
01:24:50,060;01:24:52,560;"Oh shit. All right."
01:24:52,560;01:24:56,980;"When this day, the Patriots don't go 12 and four."
01:24:56,980;01:24:58,540;"Everyone's losing their shit."
01:24:58,540;01:25:00,980;"I know. I think it may be 11."
01:25:00,980;01:25:03,500;"It might be 11 because they were 11 and 5 11."
01:25:03,500;01:25:06,900;"96. They went 11 and 5."
01:25:06,900;01:25:11,340;"86 and 85 when the ones who rolls are both 11 and 5."
01:25:11,340;01:25:15,060;"Wow. That's 11 and 5 and 78."
01:25:15,060;01:25:22,060;"They did not have many double digit win seasons just in general."
01:25:22,060;01:25:23,060;"Steve's right."
01:25:23,060;01:25:26,060;"It's very different nowadays."
01:25:26,060;01:25:29,060;"We'll have 11 straight games for like 20 years."
01:25:29,060;01:25:31,060;"I think you might be right."
01:25:31,060;01:25:34,060;"Every year except 2002."
01:25:34,060;01:25:35,060;"Yeah."
01:25:35,060;01:25:40,060;"2002 is the last time the page didn't win double digit games."
01:25:40,060;01:25:41,060;"It's crazy."
01:25:41,060;01:25:51,820;"Yeah, so my other best was to Bucky Jones and how bone rattling his his work is he forced"
01:25:51,820;01:25:57,660;"two farmers just on receivers who actually caught the ball and turned and met him and"
01:25:57,660;01:26:00,420;"it was like a car car car crash."
01:26:00,420;01:26:05,300;"And he just the first one he hit the guy and the guy fumbled him and it was like it was"
01:26:05,300;01:26:08,020;"a bang bang playing the guy just caught the ball and he got hit."
01:26:08,020;01:26:14,220;"But the second one was in the fourth quarter and it was Lamar Smith the running back who had run all over them back in"
01:26:14,220;01:26:21,180;"Week what three or four whenever it was and it was one-on-one and it was like literally on like the one or two yard line"
01:26:21,180;01:26:25,020;"And he he hit to Bucky Jones and it looked like he hit a parked car"
01:26:25,020;01:26:29,940;"Because he just he hit him and he just stopped like all his momentum stopped except for the football"
01:26:29,940;01:26:36,620;"And he just like he just went flat as a board and fell the fuck over and it was such a like old-school"
01:26:37,060;01:26:40,100;"Patriots hit they usually you don't see that anymore because nobody does it"
01:26:40,100;01:26:43,740;"But Torpy Jones all-time name"
01:26:43,740;01:26:47,300;"Patriot on the all-time name list"
01:26:47,300;01:26:50,500;"To Bucky Jones"
01:26:50,500;01:26:52,220;"cats and more"
01:26:52,220;01:26:56,900;"Yeah, also a good one ferret colons, but my worst was"
01:26:56,900;01:27:02,620;"I don't know if you guys saw this it was coming back from commercial and it was because this was a"
01:27:03,300;01:27:07,920;"December 22nd, I think was this game. So it was a couple days before Christmas and we do all this is a Christmas stuff"
01:27:07,920;01:27:15,380;"And they had all the dolphins players and Dave Wandsat wishing everybody a Merry Christmas. Oh, yeah, and"
01:27:15,380;01:27:17,540;"the I"
01:27:17,540;01:27:24,680;"Don't know if it was the the recording of what but Dave Wandsat his voice sounds exactly like the big dude from Mike and Molly"
01:27:24,680;01:27:26,900;"the actor"
01:27:27,300;01:27:27,800;"Oh yeah."
01:27:27,800;01:27:30,300;"It was a really like a higher pitch voice for a big dude."
01:27:30,300;01:27:31,000;"Yeah, dude."
01:27:31,000;01:27:33,900;"I didn't write it down because I figured out whatever,"
01:27:33,900;01:27:35,100;"but I had the same thought."
01:27:35,100;01:27:37,100;"I was like, whoa, I whatever."
01:27:37,100;01:27:39,000;"That voice doesn't match."
01:27:39,000;01:27:39,400;"Right."
01:27:39,400;01:27:40,700;"It was very bizarre."
01:27:40,700;01:27:42,300;"Yeah, it was so weird."
01:27:42,300;01:27:43,300;"Might have been the recording."
01:27:43,300;01:27:44,000;"I don't know."
01:27:44,000;01:27:44,700;"Oh, yeah."
01:27:44,700;01:27:50,600;"So maybe we'll have to look up some Dave one step videos."
01:27:50,600;01:27:51,100;"I'm sorry."
01:27:51,100;01:27:52,100;"The more."
01:27:52,100;01:27:57,100;"No, no, no, no, no."
01:27:57,100;01:28:04,860;"I think we've survived yet another episode."
01:28:04,860;01:28:10,300;"Before Gregory decides to bring us down a dark, dark hole."
01:28:10,300;01:28:16,900;"I think we should probably call this a gap."
01:28:16,900;01:28:20,580;"I mean, it's part of a pocket."
01:28:20,580;01:28:22,900;"I guess what else have we learned?"
01:28:22,900;01:28:26,940;"Before Greg squirts us through the dark hole."
01:28:26,940;01:28:35,820;"to bring this mercifully to an end. So next week is technically a bi-week for the Patriots."
01:28:35,820;01:28:40,420;"I think they probably will figure out if they are in the playoffs, depending on some other"
01:28:40,420;01:28:47,420;"results maybe. I don't know. But after that, it will be heading to Carolina. North Carolina"
01:28:47,420;01:28:53,020;"Greg South Carolina, where's the Carolina pant is located? North North Carolina. Come on,"
01:28:53,020;01:28:59,660;"and rise up to face me one in 14 Carolina Panthers who they're supposed to play week"
01:28:59,660;01:29:04,300;"two until 9/11 happens. So maybe we'll revisit that conversation because we all know how"
01:29:04,300;01:29:10,460;"Mike feels about it. How do I feel about it? We already know. But we can get into it in"
01:29:10,460;01:29:15,420;"depth. This sounds like you're twisting my words, my friends. I'm not twisting anything."
01:29:15,420;01:29:19,140;"I'm not I'm not putting any words in your mouth. We're just gonna know we get there."
01:29:19,140;01:29:24,380;"You're gonna see a different me moving forward. Believe me. Okay, I can't I can't even wait."
01:29:24,380;01:29:29,580;"So until then, thank you for joining us. Thank you for laughing this long."
01:29:29,580;01:29:33,900;"It's been the Patriots. Don't see podcasts. We'll see you next week. Bye guys."
01:29:33,900;01:29:35,900;"Bye."
01:29:35,900;01:29:36,740;"Bye."

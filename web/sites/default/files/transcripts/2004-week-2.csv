00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,200;"I am not your mother."
00:18,200;00:29,160;"Alright, welcome back to the Page of St"
00:29,160;00:33,920;"one of the games I just had no memory of and rewatching it. You can kind of see why"
00:33,920;00:37,000;"But"
00:37,000;00:39,000;"We have with me today"
00:39,000;00:42,120;"Steve Brown the best brother maybe"
00:42,120;00:47,600;"In podcast terms. Yes. Yes. Yes brother Greg Brown is"
00:47,600;00:51,240;"Baby sitting"
00:51,240;00:53,840;"Repeat guest"
00:56,240;00:57,880;"- In Anthony's desk, Connor."
00:57,880;00:59,280;"- Yeah, what does it call him, Connor?"
00:59,280;01:02,800;"Yeah, so he's babysitting, so he can't be here for this."
01:02,800;01:06,280;"But Steve, you have brought a friend along"
01:06,280;01:07,120;"to have him introduce-- - Yeah, keep trying"
01:07,120;01:08,440;"to be friends from other teams,"
01:08,440;01:10,780;"so we have our buddy Jared joining us"
01:10,780;01:12,480;"because of big Arizona Cardinals fan."
01:12,480;01:14,880;"- So he's-- - He's huge and proud."
01:14,880;01:17,920;"- Yeah, he is the big Arizona Cardinals fan."
01:17,920;01:18,920;"- The only one I know."
01:18,920;01:20,760;"- Shocking."
01:20,760;01:24,200;"- Well, Jared, thanks for joining us."
01:24,200;01:29,440;"Yeah, it's a pleasure to kind of step outside of, you know, you know, your comfort zone"
01:29,440;01:31,680;"and join another team's podcast."
01:31,680;01:33,000;"This will be a first for me."
01:33,000;01:37,960;"So excited to get into the weeds with you and explain to Pat's nation that we're not the"
01:37,960;01:40,880;"biggest joke of a franchise that everyone thinks we are."
01:40,880;01:42,760;"Well, we're in the same division as the bill."
01:42,760;01:44,520;"So we were on your side."
01:44,520;01:45,520;"Yeah."
01:45,520;01:46,520;"Okay."
01:46,520;01:49,920;"You should see bills fans right now."
01:49,920;01:54,080;"They are living their best life because they won the AFC East for the first time in 20"
01:54,080;01:55,080;"years."
01:55,080;01:56,080;"Yep."
01:56,080;01:57,080;"And they don't know what to do with it."
01:57,080;01:58,080;"It's fantastic."
01:58,080;02:03,000;"I'm sure there's a comp to how us and Phoenix are as sons fans about how we just defeated"
02:03,000;02:05,040;"the Lakers in the first round of the playoffs."
02:05,040;02:10,360;"And I'm sure Lakers fans are looking at us very similarly to how you guys look at Bill's"
02:10,360;02:11,360;"fans."
02:11,360;02:13,760;"So I kind of empathize a little bit with them."
02:13,760;02:16,640;"But everyone in Boston is happy about that."
02:16,640;02:17,640;"So go Phoenix."
02:17,640;02:18,640;"That's true."
02:18,640;02:27,840;"everybody. Go everybody else. Yeah. Nice. All right. So Jared, just to get an idea of,"
02:27,840;02:34,000;"I guess how did you become a Cardinals fan? We've probably had a question on my mind."
02:34,000;02:41,440;"Yeah. Well, to start, I'm born and raised in Phoenix. And the Cardinals arrived from St."
02:41,440;02:47,560;"Lewis when I was two years old. They came to the Valley of the Sun, played at Sun"
02:47,560;02:55,440;"Devil Stadium. My parents, big football fans, my mom grew up in Chicago, so she"
02:55,440;03:01,280;"was we were coming off a few years past, a few years ahead of the Cardinals coming"
03:01,280;03:06,280;"to Arizona. We watched the Chicago Bears in one of the greatest, you know, seasons"
03:06,280;03:14,840;"ever from a football team. And then my dad is from New York, but was not a Giants or Jets fan."
03:14,840;03:19,800;"He had a lot of family in Miami, so you guys won't be pleased to know that he's he actually was a"
03:19,800;03:30,120;"Dolphins fan. Yeah, right. Yeah, I think it is. I think it's way better personally. But so,"
03:30,840;03:38,360;"You know, a lot of us in Arizona still to this day, there isn't really a true, you know,"
03:38,360;03:44,600;"contingent of people who are from Phoenix. There's just, you know, my generation and younger is"
03:44,600;03:50,360;"really the first, you know, full fledged, you know, bigger population of people who are actually"
03:50,360;03:55,560;"from the Phoenix or from Arizona, like Phoenix area. So you get a hodgepodge of random people"
03:55,560;04:00,040;"that'll come through. So I'm sure you guys, when you watch this game back, you heard how many New"
04:00,040;04:03,340;"New England Patriots fans were at Sun Devil Stadium that day."
04:03,340;04:05,740;"That was like that every single week of the season."
04:05,740;04:08,040;"And so the Cardinals moved into their new stadium."
04:08,040;04:09,940;"But how did I become a Cardinals fan?"
04:09,940;04:12,640;"I was born and raised in Arizona."
04:12,640;04:16,700;"My dad and mom were big football fans and they jumped in on season tickets"
04:16,700;04:19,740;"immediately because they were NFL fans."
04:19,740;04:23,380;"And they stuck with it."
04:23,380;04:26,040;"I grew up going to those games in Sun Devil Stadium."
04:26,040;04:29,940;"I will say that this game in particular being 89 degrees"
04:29,940;04:35,340;"in September, like talk about like golden opportunity for the Patriots."
04:35,340;04:40,140;"To give you some perspective, we had, uh, we set a record last year for most"
04:40,140;04:44,460;"consecutive days over a hundred and ten degrees in Phoenix last year."
04:44,460;04:46,820;"And I know, right?"
04:46,820;04:50,260;"And it bled into October of last year."
04:50,260;04:55,660;"So it's so for it to be 89 degrees in September for the Patriots, it was"
04:55,660;04:58,260;"basically like a nice little vacation."
04:58,540;05:01,540;"- The broadcast said, ""Hoo, 109 on the field,"
05:01,540;05:03,660;"unseasonably cool."""
05:03,660;05:05,940;"- No, really though, that was a thing."
05:05,940;05:09,020;"Like you'd have guys passing out on the sidelines"
05:09,020;05:12,580;"because when you were kicking off at like two o'clock"
05:12,580;05:14,380;"on a Sunday at Sun Devil Stadium,"
05:14,380;05:17,900;"and it was outside, it was 105 degrees out"
05:17,900;05:22,900;"on the field with no roof or no way to hide from the sun."
05:22,900;05:26,340;"It would touch down to like 125, 130,"
05:26,340;05:28,140;"and they were full pads."
05:28,140;05:29,300;"like it's just brutal."
05:29,300;05:30,420;"So and of course,"
05:30,420;05:31,660;"the Cardinals are wearing their,"
05:31,660;05:34,740;"they're all whites, which they were white at home all the time."
05:34,740;05:37,460;"Yeah, which used to piss Cowboys fans off because, you know,"
05:37,460;05:39,180;"the Cowboys prefer to wear white."
05:39,180;05:43,020;"But so yeah, so I grew up."
05:43,020;05:45,140;"The same thing, actually. Yeah. Yeah."
05:45,140;05:47,700;"Yeah. So they just to help with the heat."
05:47,700;05:51,940;"So I'm one of the few, the proud local,"
05:51,940;05:53,740;"born and raised in Phoenix."
05:53,740;05:57,260;"I am extremely loyal to local teams."
05:57,620;06:01,700;"And up until maybe the last decade,"
06:01,700;06:04,980;"the Cardinals didn't really give a lot to root for."
06:04,980;06:08,060;"But actually, to give you a little launching pad"
06:08,060;06:11,420;"into this game in this season, the draft class going"
06:11,420;06:14,740;"into this season, easily the best draft class"
06:14,740;06:17,860;"in the history of the Phoenix/Arizona Cardinals."
06:17,860;06:21,700;"And I would argue maybe a top 50 draft class"
06:21,700;06:23,860;"ever in NFL history."
06:23,860;06:26,180;"We could have that debate for another day."
06:26,180;06:32,440;"But you're looking at, you're looking at, you know, four guys, three guys that made multiple"
06:32,440;06:38,800;"pro bowls, four guys that got big time contracts, a plug in place starting center, right out"
06:38,800;06:39,800;"of the gates."
06:39,800;06:44,660;"So it was, it was, it was kind of a launch pad for the core team that made it to their"
06:44,660;06:48,340;"first Super Bowl, you know, several years later against the Steelers."
06:48,340;06:49,340;"Right."
06:49,340;06:52,980;"So because this was the Larry Fitzgerald draft."
06:52,980;06:53,980;"Yep."
06:53,980;06:54,980;"It was."
06:54,980;06:56,540;"- This whole class of stack,"
06:56,540;06:58,540;"'cause they were talking about how they skipped over"
06:58,540;07:00,940;"Rivers and Rothaceberger to draft Fitzgerald."
07:00,940;07:01,780;"- Right, yeah, that's all."
07:01,780;07:03,820;"- So that's gonna be my question, yeah."
07:03,820;07:06,180;"How do you feel about that?"
07:06,180;07:08,500;"- So there's a whole story behind this."
07:08,500;07:13,420;"If you wanna go back to the week 17, the year before,"
07:13,420;07:16,380;"the Cardinals were playing against the Minnesota Vikings."
07:16,380;07:19,820;"And the Vikings, if they win, they're in the playoffs."
07:19,820;07:22,180;"If they lose, they somehow are out."
07:22,180;07:24,380;"The Cardinals had literally nothing to play for"
07:24,380;07:26,460;"rather than if they lose, they get the number one pick"
07:26,460;07:27,900;"and they can draft Eli Manning."
07:27,900;07:30,140;"And at the time, you guys remember what Peyton Manning"
07:30,140;07:32,860;"was in the NFL, 'cause you guys had the rivalry going."
07:32,860;07:36,300;"Getting Peyton's brother was a big deal."
07:36,300;07:40,740;"And so Josh McCown and his first opportunity really"
07:40,740;07:43,220;"in that stretch of games to be a starter,"
07:43,220;07:46,820;"the Cardinals stay around and they end up throwing"
07:46,820;07:50,260;"the Hail Mary to Nate Pool in the back of the end zone,"
07:50,260;07:52,940;"the force out play to win the game."
07:52,940;08:00,940;"knocked the Vikings out of the playoffs. It basically ended the Colpeper Moss era in Minnesota"
08:00,940;08:07,420;"because what Moss knocked shortly later went over to Oakland before he went and played with you guys"
08:07,420;08:12,700;"and then Dante Colpeper was never the same. So it basically ended that great stretch of Vikings"
08:12,700;08:18,540;"teams. I was actually at that game and it was very conflicting because everyone there,"
08:18,940;08:22,860;"Everyone like like even the Vikings fans that were trying to talk smack to us all game"
08:22,860;08:28,540;"We were just like we don't really care because we're gonna get Eli and then we'll beat you next year, you know like so"
08:28,540;08:37,180;"What transpires is they lose the number one pick and which in the most Cardinals fashion they would pull out a remarkable"
08:37,180;08:44,220;"Game ending pale Mary play but the result of it isn't to go anywhere or do anything with it"
08:44,220;08:46,540;"it was actually had an adverse effect."
08:46,540;08:47,660;"But if you remember correctly,"
08:47,660;08:49,500;"even if they got the number one pick,"
08:49,500;08:52,580;"you know, Eli Manning didn't want to play for San Diego."
08:52,580;08:54,940;"San Diego had the number one pick and draft that year."
08:54,940;08:57,180;"And there was that big deal that they wanted to swap"
08:57,180;09:00,340;"with the Giants because the Manning family"
09:00,340;09:01,940;"wasn't going to play in San Diego."
09:01,940;09:03,460;"Well, if he wasn't going to play in San Diego,"
09:03,460;09:06,700;"he sure as hell wasn't going to play in Phoenix, right?"
09:06,700;09:08,020;"- That's really true."
09:08,020;09:10,060;"- So the way I look at it is,"
09:10,060;09:12,540;"yeah, missing out on Eli"
09:12,540;09:15,100;"because of a Hail Mary ended up being unfortunate."
09:15,100;09:18,740;"Philip Rivers ended up having a phenomenal career,"
09:18,740;09:23,580;"but Larry Fitzgerald is going down"
09:23,580;09:27,580;"as the greatest athlete in the history of Arizona sports."
09:27,580;09:30,980;"And maybe that's not saying much for some,"
09:30,980;09:33,340;"but he's one of the greatest wide receivers ever"
09:33,340;09:34,180;"to suit it up."
09:34,180;09:37,020;"And in fact, you could argue that if he actually had"
09:37,020;09:40,040;"a competent quarterback for a good chunk of his career,"
09:41,060;09:44,720;"he would be smashing Jerry Rice's records right now."
09:44,720;09:47,740;"He's not that far off from some of them,"
09:47,740;09:52,180;"but if he had had actual, not Kevin Cobb"
09:52,180;09:54,060;"throwing to him for a number of years."
09:54,060;09:54,900;"- Josh McCall."
09:54,900;09:57,900;"- And all the, the who's of quarterbacks"
09:57,900;10:00,660;"that aren't named Kurt Warner or Carson Palmer,"
10:00,660;10:03,960;"you could argue that he would be smashing Jerry Rice's records"
10:03,960;10:06,500;"and could be going down as the greatest wide receiver ever"
10:06,500;10:07,700;"to play the game."
10:07,700;10:11,420;"So I absolutely no regrets."
10:11,420;10:13,860;"I think if you asked any Cardinals fan,"
10:13,860;10:16,940;"they would be thrilled to end up with Larry"
10:16,940;10:19,080;"over either of those quarterbacks."
10:19,080;10:23,540;"And it's gonna be sad, you know,"
10:23,540;10:25,500;"as they're recording this podcast,"
10:25,500;10:27,380;"he hasn't announced if he's retiring yet,"
10:27,380;10:30,500;"but a lot of science point too, he's going to,"
10:30,500;10:32,900;"but who knows, he might be back."
10:32,900;10:34,420;"- He's a rumor every year in New England"
10:34,420;10:35,820;"that he's gonna sound the Patriots,"
10:35,820;10:36,900;"but we're gonna try for him."
10:36,900;10:38,660;"- It was out there."
10:38,660;10:39,500;"- Every year."
10:39,500;10:42,380;"Now that rumor is that he's gonna end up on the bucks"
10:42,380;10:44,020;"with Bruce Arians."
10:44,020;10:46,140;"But yeah, there was that rumor for a long time"
10:46,140;10:48,740;"ever since they did that Randy Moss experiment, right?"
10:48,740;10:51,420;"And they guys, they set incredible records"
10:51,420;10:54,140;"throwing the Brady Moss relationship."
10:54,140;10:56,180;"But looking at that draft class,"
10:56,180;10:58,060;"like Carlos Danzvi, Pro Bowl linebacker,"
10:58,060;11:01,660;"Darnell Docket was an incredible detackle"
11:01,660;11:03,460;"even though he's a nut job."
11:03,460;11:06,060;"Steponovic was a fourth round pick."
11:06,060;11:10,980;"He was started week one at center and Antonio Smith was a huge piece on that team that"
11:10,980;11:15,660;"made that run to the Super Bowl that played the Steelers and ended up getting a huge contract"
11:15,660;11:19,780;"with the Texans and had a great career with them too."
11:19,780;11:23,820;"So this draft class wasn't sanely good."
11:23,820;11:27,820;"And so it's just you look back at this team and it's just interesting to recall that group."
11:27,820;11:35,260;"Yeah, I think this draft in general, we look back on it and the first round of this draft"
11:35,260;11:37,940;"had like almost all pro ballers."
11:37,940;11:39,260;"It was ridiculous."
11:39,260;11:40,980;"The whole draft was complete."
11:40,980;11:42,740;"That being said, like the starting defense"
11:42,740;11:43,740;"for the Cardinals in this game,"
11:43,740;11:46,140;"I was like, there's so many no-bodies on here."
11:46,140;11:47,700;"And they had those eyes and they just got them."
11:47,700;11:48,860;"So they weren't even starting yet."
11:48,860;11:49,940;"Yeah, but they were good."
11:49,940;11:52,460;"Yeah, this defense seemed like it was the strength"
11:52,460;11:53,940;"of this team too though."
11:53,940;11:54,780;"It was."
11:54,780;11:57,500;"I mean, Adrian Wilson is going to be like in the ring of honor"
11:57,500;12:00,540;"for the Cardinals if he, you know, isn't already great safety."
12:00,540;12:02,260;"I know he had a tough year with you guys"
12:02,260;12:04,260;"at the end of his career, but he's,"
12:04,260;12:08,960;"He's an all-time great from Cardinal's standpoint."
12:08,960;12:12,020;"Kyle Vandenbosch was a really good defensive end"
12:12,020;12:14,660;"for the Cardinals who came from that Nebraska program,"
12:14,660;12:16,140;"the Blackshirts."
12:16,140;12:20,060;"Dwayne Starks won a Super Bowl with the Ravens."
12:20,060;12:24,580;"And I already mentioned Docket, Danzby and Antonio Smith."
12:24,580;12:26,860;"And even Ronald McKinnon, who played middle linebacker,"
12:26,860;12:28,220;"had a really good NFL career."
12:28,220;12:30,380;"So this defense was really good."
12:30,380;12:33,180;"The problem was they just weren't good against the run."
12:33,180;12:35,760;"And I think you guys saw that in the very first quarter"
12:35,760;12:37,800;"with Corey Dillon running wilds,"
12:37,800;12:41,920;"that the problem was they couldn't get themselves off the field"
12:41,920;12:43,680;"because stopping the run was tough."
12:43,680;12:45,360;"Their pass defense was really good"
12:45,360;12:48,100;"and the pressure they'd get on quarterbacks was great,"
12:48,100;12:49,220;"but they couldn't stop the run."
12:49,220;12:51,440;"And that was the problem with that team this year."
12:51,440;12:52,280;"- Yeah."
12:52,280;12:56,560;"And even the announcer at the beginning of the game,"
12:56,560;12:59,120;"when the Patriots first got on the field,"
13:00,120;13:04,520;"That's something about how the one of the Arizona linebackers"
13:04,520;13:07,800;"like, oh, we're going to we're focusing on stopping the run."
13:07,800;13:10,240;"So they're just not going to be able to run it."
13:10,240;13:15,920;"And then I think Dylan had like 31 yards on that first"
13:15,920;13:19,640;"drive alone alone had 51 by the end of the first quarter."
13:19,640;13:25,000;"He was like, you ended with maybe not 32 carries, 158 yards,"
13:25,000;13:26,280;"which he could have had a touchdown."
13:26,280;13:28,360;"They got called back on an absolute bullshit penalty."
13:28,360;13:32,000;"Yeah, which they called twice, but we'll save them."
13:32,000;13:32,840;"Referee."
13:32,840;13:35,280;"Good day for fantasy managers, for sure."
13:35,280;13:36,280;"Absolutely."
13:36,280;13:37,880;"Back in 2004."
13:37,880;13:40,000;"Yeah, Corey Dillon, what a pluck."
13:40,000;13:43,600;"Another one of those guys that the Patriots have gotten"
13:43,600;13:48,040;"for years that you just get after they have some great careers"
13:48,040;13:50,800;"with bad teams and just grab them to have a couple more"
13:50,800;13:54,440;"great years before they sail off into the sunset."
13:54,440;13:57,040;"Should have been Julio."
13:57,040;13:57,560;"All right."
13:57,560;13:59,560;"- Should've been for the carals. - They're a couple of them, don't you?"
13:59,560;14:01,560;"- Right how we talked about this, Gerald."
14:01,560;14:02,560;"- Yep."
14:02,560;14:03,560;"- No doubt."
14:03,560;14:08,280;"- But, yeah, they actually said that when he went over 150, that this was the eighth time"
14:08,280;14:11,560;"in his career that he had a game with at least 150 yards."
14:11,560;14:13,560;"- They also said he had the Cardinals."
14:13,560;14:17,560;"Yeah, well maybe it was, yeah, it was a Cardinals gash like 220 yards once."
14:17,560;14:19,560;"- Yeah, 216, when he was with the game."
14:19,560;14:21,960;"- Yeah, when he was at the Bengals, I remember that game."
14:21,960;14:22,960;"He set records."
14:22,960;14:23,960;"- Yeah."
14:23,960;14:27,460;"- Yep, there's, I think there's a few of those records that have Cardinals' defense."
14:27,460;14:28,780;"defenses on the other side of it."
14:28,780;14:38,080;"But I mean, it's either that or the Browns because who was it that we did a Browns game"
14:38,080;14:42,460;"last year, Priest Holmes, just Priest Holmes."
14:42,460;14:44,540;"It may have been."
14:44,540;14:47,860;"I thought it was the Ravens guy back back in those days."
14:47,860;14:48,860;"Who wasn't safe?"
14:48,860;14:50,860;"I don't even know your kind of name."
14:50,860;14:51,860;"Jamal Adam Jamal."
14:51,860;14:53,260;"What's the name?"
14:53,260;14:54,260;"Lewis."
14:54,260;14:55,260;"Yeah."
14:55,260;15:01,900;"The the Browns linebacker the day before said I did like called him up called up Jamal Lewis and so I dare you to run it"
15:01,900;15:08,500;"We're gonna be on you all day and was like trash talking them and so then Jamal Lewis the next day ran for like"
15:08,500;15:11,060;"250 yards on them. Yeah"
15:11,060;15:14,140;"200 yards in both games against the balance that's"
15:14,140;15:18,380;"After going down 200 yards. Yeah tough look"
15:19,020;15:25,900;"Stood out to me watching this game though is just a reminder of some of the random ass wide receivers that were on the Patriots"
15:25,900;15:31,260;"That just had great careers for just the Patriots and then no one else David Patton D on branch"
15:31,260;15:37,700;"Like that was that was back at the time where it was like how are they able to even move the ball with these guys who are barely?"
15:37,700;15:41,740;"You know six feet tall and don't look like they're the fastest guys in the world either"
15:41,740;15:47,580;"Just it doesn't it does it defies science with it with the success that they had"
15:48,300;15:49,140;"It's all steam."
15:49,140;15:49,700;"They had that."
15:49,700;15:52,500;"Although in this game, neither of those guys in any."
15:52,500;16:00,540;"I think Branched got hurt on what may have been the play of the game just from like a."
16:00,540;16:08,140;"A podcast perspective, I guess, where the Patriots get the ball back at."
16:08,140;16:15,740;"Oh, so actually no, though, drive before there's like a few seconds left and the Cardinals are going for a field goal."
16:16,380;16:22,860;"It's like a 50 yard. Yeah, because Neil Rackers is already kicked to one from 51 one from 52 and citizens 58"
16:22,860;16:24,420;"They're like, you know what? Fuck it. Let's give it a shot"
16:24,420;16:28,980;"You're trying about right and it got blocked so the patient of the ball like the 40 yard line"
16:28,980;16:30,260;"And they're like, all right"
16:30,260;16:34,380;"Let's try it and so they tried like the quick screenplay to try like get a few yards if they get in"
16:34,380;16:40,780;"Filgo range and it was dropped by I think it was David Gibbons and"
16:41,740;16:43,660;"David Givens, there's another good name."
16:43,660;16:44,460;"Yeah, exactly."
16:44,460;16:46,140;"Would do nothing on any other team."
16:46,140;16:47,140;"You got hurt."
16:47,140;16:47,940;"Hey, come on."
16:47,940;16:49,300;"He went to the Redskins and got hurt."
16:49,300;16:50,140;"That's my guy."
16:50,140;16:51,500;"So I didn't go to the Titans."
16:51,500;16:52,420;"Sorry, Steve."
16:52,420;16:54,380;"Look at the Titans."
16:54,380;16:57,340;"But yeah, so the field goes against blocks."
16:57,340;16:59,340;"The pass gets the ball and they run one play"
16:59,340;17:01,020;"and they think the half is over."
17:01,020;17:02,700;"And so everybody starts like filing off the field"
17:02,700;17:03,820;"and the refs like, no, no, no, no."
17:03,820;17:05,380;"There's one second left."
17:05,380;17:06,940;"So everybody has to file back on the field"
17:06,940;17:08,540;"because, you know, refs are dickheads."
17:08,540;17:10,460;"And then the page is like, you know what?"
17:10,460;17:11,460;"Fuck it. We're doing Hail Mary."
17:11,460;17:14,900;"So they throw a Hail Mary and it looked like the play was actually supposed to be"
17:14,900;17:22,660;"David Gibbons jumps up and bats it back down to Troy Brown weirdly and it almost worked except it got intercepted by"
17:22,660;17:30,740;"a cardinal linebacker. I don't remember who it was and he's like, you know, fuck I'm returning this so he takes off down field tries to return it and"
17:30,740;17:34,740;"This is probably a good time to introduce"
17:34,740;17:40,660;"Commentators Don Kricky and Steve Tasker. I'd say they're the JV team, but I don't know what's lower than that because"
17:40,660;17:43,100;"Well, we're used to work."
17:43,100;17:44,660;"Can we, while you introduce him,"
17:44,660;17:46,340;"can we talk about how when they intro"
17:46,340;17:48,000;"Dwayne Starks in the starting lineup,"
17:48,000;17:51,180;"Steve Tasker calls, says Dwayne Starks played for the,"
17:51,180;17:54,720;"won a Super Bowl with the Baltimore Colts in 2002."
17:54,720;17:59,540;"That was a worth making note of for me."
17:59,540;18:02,100;"Cardinals fans are used to the B, C and D teams"
18:02,100;18:03,740;"when it comes to telecasts."
18:03,740;18:05,660;"So, you know, a lot of times."
18:05,660;18:06,580;"- The power of the barrel, yeah."
18:06,580;18:08,620;"- A lot of times you mute,"
18:08,620;18:11,140;"especially when Cardinals are on CBS beat teams,"
18:11,140;18:14,220;"because not very often does the CBS teams,"
18:14,220;18:17,820;"you know, groups go and do NFC games."
18:17,820;18:21,380;"So, and that goes back decades now."
18:21,380;18:24,300;"So, there was a few of those where it was like,"
18:24,300;18:26,540;"what is he even talking about right now?"
18:26,540;18:28,100;"- I thought they were good."
18:28,100;18:29,300;"All right, well,"
18:29,300;18:30,140;"(laughing)"
18:30,140;18:31,260;"- Got two counts, scrambles."
18:31,260;18:35,060;"- They couldn't even agree on how to pronounce"
18:35,060;18:36,140;"Josh McCown's name."
18:36,140;18:38,980;"- No, yeah, they did, this pronounce his name a lot."
18:38,980;18:41,060;"- Oh, and then they go back to the right pronunciation,"
18:41,060;18:43,060;"then they go back to Macauen."
18:43,060;18:43,900;"- Macauen?"
18:43,900;18:45,060;"- Where you getting these from?"
18:45,060;18:46,460;"- He's been playing for 30 years,"
18:46,460;18:47,560;"of course he's not to say his name."
18:47,560;18:49,780;"This is like Josh Macauen's third start,"
18:49,780;18:50,700;"but they got it right."
18:50,700;18:52,340;"And then they went off of it to Macauen,"
18:52,340;18:54,020;"and then they went back to Macauen."
18:54,020;18:56,060;"- Either way, so he's scrambling, right?"
18:56,060;18:58,100;"He's rolling out right, he's got nothing,"
18:58,100;19:01,900;"just throw the ball away, he's like, nope, it's 39,"
19:01,900;19:03,540;"I have nine yards ago, there's five guys"
19:03,540;19:05,100;"that are probably gonna try and do it anyways,"
19:05,100;19:07,500;"and they say, well, you have to admire his courage"
19:07,500;19:08,980;"if not his discretion."
19:08,980;19:10,620;"(laughing)"
19:10,620;19:11,940;"That's great."
19:11,940;19:15,020;"Yeah, but so during this return,"
19:15,020;19:17,580;"to go back to the Hail Mary play,"
19:17,580;19:19,940;"this line macro size is gonna run"
19:19,940;19:22,300;"probably like 110 yards, trash court touchdown."
19:22,300;19:26,900;"And for some reason, I don't know"
19:26,900;19:28,620;"like what happened off the player or whatever it was,"
19:28,620;19:30,380;"'cause the way that they had the view of it"
19:30,380;19:32,340;"was like from the back of the end zone,"
19:32,340;19:34,980;"like running out of away from the camera."
19:34,980;19:36,980;"And all of a sudden, one of the Patriots offensive lineman comes"
19:36,980;19:40,980;"hammering out of like diving from off screen and just clips"
19:40,980;19:44,980;"Dion branch at the knees and he goes up and over and lands directly on"
19:44,980;19:45,980;"his back."
19:45,980;19:46,980;"And that's super hard."
19:46,980;19:48,980;"And palm and taters at this point."
19:48,980;19:52,980;"I think it was probably Steve Tasker was bullshit about how it was an"
19:52,980;19:54,980;"illegal block."
19:54,980;19:57,980;"Completely missing the fact that it was his own teammate, so it was not"
19:57,980;19:58,980;"a block."
19:58,980;20:01,980;"And he was just like, you know, he was like, you know, he was like,"
20:01,980;20:03,980;"missing the fact that it was his own teammate. So it's not a."
20:03,980;20:09,420;"Like that should be a penalty. Like they yeah, they call the other penalty that should be a penalty too."
20:09,420;20:18,380;"Until he finally I think somebody must have told him or something at the at the fourth quarter when they were showing it. Like as the game was wrapping up and they're doing the highlights."
20:18,380;20:27,420;"So maybe this is by no means allowing you know saying that that's okay from a commentary standpoint."
20:27,980;20:31,220;"has someone who's spent time in the press box"
20:31,220;20:34,700;"at Sun Devil Stadium, it is really high up there."
20:34,700;20:39,700;"Like it is a really tall press box."
20:39,700;20:43,700;"And I'm sure with technology back in 2004,"
20:43,700;20:45,420;"the monitors that they were looking at"
20:45,420;20:47,900;"were probably the size of, you know,"
20:47,900;20:50,420;"maybe the small screen that we're looking at"
20:50,420;20:52,820;"to see each other, that isn't the main screen."
20:52,820;20:56,660;"So in the moment, I can see where maybe he could have made"
20:56,660;20:58,740;"that error until seeing the replay."
20:58,740;21:01,620;"But the fact that he stuck with it after seeing the replay"
21:01,620;21:04,980;"should ruin the competency of this--"
21:04,980;21:06,140;"- Well, the whole reason."
21:06,140;21:10,260;"- Jared, stop trying to reason with Andy"
21:10,260;21:11,460;"on commentator's data."
21:11,460;21:12,380;"(laughing)"
21:12,380;21:14,420;"- Well, the problem is, the problem is,"
21:14,420;21:17,060;"before I got into the world, I'm in now"
21:17,060;21:20,020;"with how Stephen and I know each other is in the golf world,"
21:20,020;21:23,620;"I was in the media and broadcasting for about 10 years."
21:23,620;21:26,300;"And so I worked, I worked behind the scenes"
21:26,300;21:29,460;"and part of TV productions and some of those"
21:29,460;21:32,940;"were at Sun Devil Stadium for random games."
21:32,940;21:36,700;"So, but Steve Tasker calling the Baltimore Ravens,"
21:36,700;21:40,260;"the Baltimore Colts, it was a good one for me."
21:40,260;21:41,500;"Right when I heard him say that, I was like,"
21:41,500;21:43,260;"oh, this is gonna be a great game."
21:43,260;21:44,500;"This is gonna be a good one."
21:44,500;21:47,380;"- And then after the Patriots scored there for a touchdown,"
21:47,380;21:49,780;"halfway through the first quarter,"
21:49,780;21:53,300;"they go to Steve and his pearls of wisdom were,"
21:53,300;21:55,060;"oh, Arizona's gonna have to start throwing the ball,"
21:55,060;22:01,540;"catch up. Like, bro, you're down seven point seven. Nothing in the first quarter. I think"
22:01,540;22:06,380;"you can stick to your game plans, still. Yep. Yep. No doubt. No doubt. Very worried about"
22:06,380;22:11,660;"that too. But, you know, and, and, you know, maybe, maybe Denny Green heard him because"
22:11,660;22:15,700;"what Josh McCown started throwing it like crazy and threw a couple picks, not long after"
22:15,700;22:20,820;"that. Josh McCown, that season got a really quick hook. You know, for a guy that had such"
22:20,820;22:27,260;"a long NFL career. With so many teams, you would have thought that with how much Denny"
22:27,260;22:31,860;"Green didn't like the guy that he wouldn't have made it past that season. They ended"
22:31,860;22:36,420;"up going to Sean King. Remember he played with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a while"
22:36,420;22:42,900;"after Trent Dilfer. Denny Green went to Sean King for a majority of that season. Josh McCown"
22:42,900;22:46,780;"got the quick hook. Cardinal career ended and his incredible career with just about"
22:46,780;22:51,260;"every NFL team happened kind of all Ryan Fitzpatrick now."
22:51,260;22:52,260;"Right."
22:52,260;22:54,260;"Came from there."
22:54,260;23:01,020;"Yeah, Josh McCown on this season, 2500 yards, 11 touchdowns, 10 interceptions."
23:01,020;23:02,020;"He wasn't that bad."
23:02,020;23:04,620;"He was kind of talented."
23:04,620;23:07,980;"Problem was Cardinals had a horrible offensive line."
23:07,980;23:11,660;"It was the Cowboys that discovered that Leonard Davis would be better at playing guard than"
23:11,660;23:13,740;"a tackle."
23:13,740;23:19,380;"But they wrote out Leonard Davis, who was a former top five pick out of Texas at tackle"
23:19,380;23:20,780;"for years."
23:20,780;23:24,060;"And he was, I think, among the league leaders and fall starts."
23:24,060;23:28,980;"And he was just covering the blind side of these quarterbacks and they just had no chance."
23:28,980;23:31,140;"Yeah, it did seem that way."
23:31,140;23:34,540;"Yeah, Mike Braille coming off that end every time."
23:34,540;23:37,220;"Can we spend some?"
23:37,220;23:38,220;"Go ahead, Steve."
23:38,220;23:41,080;"The Cardinals touchdown score in this game."
23:41,080;23:43,560;"the most famous name in the game except for Tom Brady."
23:43,560;23:45,280;"Mr. Emmett."
23:45,280;23:46,160;"We talked about it."
23:46,160;23:47,640;"Didn't you?"
23:47,640;23:50,200;"I don't even really remember him being on the Cardinals."
23:50,200;23:50,560;"Definitely."
23:50,560;23:53,640;"If you said Emmett Smith as a Cardinals score is a touchdown in the game against"
23:53,640;23:55,800;"the Patriots, you go, are you sure that sounds?"
23:55,800;23:56,000;"Yeah."
23:56,000;24:03,200;"So yeah, Emmett Smith, he was a one of many professional athletes who like many"
24:03,200;24:07,120;"like to retire coming to the state of the state of Arizona."
24:07,120;24:10,840;"A lot of professional athletes like to move to Arizona to finish their"
24:10,840;24:17,560;"careers ahead of their retirement. There's a long list of people across all professional sports,"
24:17,560;24:21,240;"you know, the sons, the Diamondbacks, the Cardinals have had more than their fair share."
24:21,240;24:26,600;"But the Emmett Smith era was weird because everyone hated him here."
24:26,600;24:34,280;"The Cardinals and the Cardinals and Cowboys up until a few years before that were in the same"
24:34,280;24:39,080;"division. When the Cardinals first moved to the Valley, they did not take them out of the NFC East."
24:39,080;24:43,320;"It wasn't until I think the late 90s that they finally..."
24:43,320;24:44,480;"- Too, wasn't it?"
24:44,480;24:45,980;"- Yeah, I forgive me."
24:45,980;24:46,820;"I don't know the..."
24:46,820;24:47,820;"- Same time that the courts..."
24:47,820;24:48,820;"- The realignment with everything."
24:48,820;24:50,660;"- Not the pictures that you're missing from it."
24:50,660;24:51,500;"- Yeah, yeah."
24:51,500;24:54,520;"- Yeah, they did that whole realignment"
24:54,520;24:56,380;"to where you see it, how it is today."
24:56,380;24:59,600;"But that was, it was within a few years,"
24:59,600;25:01,740;"like you said, maybe in 2002,"
25:01,740;25:04,500;"that the Cardinals were no longer in the same division"
25:04,500;25:05,340;"as the Cowboys."
25:05,340;25:10,340;"And I have PTSD of going to Sun Devil Stadium"
25:10,340;25:12,500;"and having to deal with Cowboys fans."
25:12,500;25:15,700;"They're the worst in all of sports in my opinion."
25:15,700;25:16,540;"And so--"
25:16,540;25:17,980;"- I'm not gonna do Boston fans."
25:17,980;25:18,820;"- I know, yeah, yeah."
25:18,820;25:20,420;"- One wearing a shirt that is just literally"
25:20,420;25:23,060;"a collage of Tom Brady's face all over it."
25:23,060;25:24,380;"- Yeah, yeah."
25:24,380;25:26,420;"I don't have anything against Boston teams."
25:26,420;25:29,580;"So maybe if I was around Boston,"
25:29,580;25:31,020;"teams more that might be different."
25:31,020;25:32,820;"I was around Cowboys fans growing up"
25:32,820;25:34,260;"and they're just the worst."
25:34,260;25:36,700;"So all of a sudden, Emmett Smith pulls up."
25:36,700;25:39,620;"And in most cases, you'd think getting an all-time great"
25:39,620;25:41,700;"come into your team would be an exciting thing."
25:41,700;25:45,060;"But a lot of people here were pretty lukewarm about it"
25:45,060;25:46,780;"because no one liked Emmett Smith."
25:46,780;25:49,220;"And then he came here an average three yards a carry"
25:49,220;25:52,580;"in this final year of his career."
25:52,580;25:55,460;"And sure, he had that nice touchdown in this game,"
25:55,460;25:57,460;"the first to get the Cardinals on board."
25:57,460;25:58,900;"And I'm sure it got everyone excited."
25:58,900;26:03,620;"But it was definitely a little era to forget."
26:03,620;26:08,180;"And I think even Emmett Smith forgot it when he gave his Hall of Fame exception speech to"
26:08,180;26:12,180;"I don't remember a shout out to the Cardinals in that speech."
26:12,180;26:14,540;"Almost 1000 yards."
26:14,540;26:14,940;"Nine."
26:14,940;26:17,180;"Yeah, I was going to surprise."
26:17,180;26:18,420;"Yeah."
26:18,420;26:20,980;"It's just the volume this year of volume."
26:20,980;26:23,460;"They had no one else to get the rock to."
26:23,460;26:24,540;"I mean, that's true."
26:24,540;26:24,740;"Yeah."
26:24,740;26:25,180;"More."
26:25,180;26:25,780;"That's a little impressive."
26:25,780;26:27,380;"He was pretty old at this point."
26:27,380;26:30,860;"And you played all you played 15 games, 267 carries."
26:30,860;26:31,180;"That's all."
26:31,180;26:33,140;"It's 15 season as we're running back."
26:33,140;26:35,700;"That's that's Frank Gore ask."
26:35,700;26:36,620;"Yeah."
26:36,620;26:39,180;"It was also at this point averaging probably three yards of carry."
26:39,180;26:40,820;"So it was three."
26:40,820;26:43,940;"It was around three yards per carry for Emmett that season."
26:43,940;26:47,980;"And, and you know, you could have blamed the offensive line, but there was a lot"
26:47,980;26:51,460;"of games where it looked like he was still trying to channel that running"
26:51,460;26:55,980;"through the tackles, you know, between the guards types of runs that were maybe"
26:55,980;26:59,380;"two steps low as opposed to one step slow at that point in his career."
26:59,380;27:01,780;"And he saw this game where he's just like running into the back of his"
27:01,780;27:05,380;"when I'm in and stuff and you just look like the same."
27:05,380;27:08,680;"Didn't have that burst, so that definitely disappeared."
27:08,680;27:09,520;"Not at all."
27:09,520;27:11,880;"You could be fences of least this year."
27:11,880;27:12,680;"Yeah."
27:12,680;27:16,760;"So when do we get to talk about my boy Teddy Bruceky?"
27:16,760;27:17,260;"Oh."
27:17,260;27:22,680;"One of the first of many Arizona Wildcats"
27:22,680;27:26,160;"that have come to have great careers."
27:26,160;27:27,680;"I went to college with Gronk."
27:27,680;27:29,960;"Feel free to ask questions about that too."
27:29,960;27:33,760;"I was, I'm a couple years older than him, but we were there at the same time."
27:33,760;27:36,520;"So we can, we can go down that path."
27:36,520;27:40,880;"But if you want to start with Teddy Bruski, I, I was hoping we would talk about him a little bit."
27:40,880;27:42,000;"Absolutely."
27:42,000;27:46,720;"I mean, Teddy Bruski is, well, him and Ronnie Ersner, the heart of this"
27:46,720;27:51,360;"defense and war for this entire first half of the dynasty, I would say."
27:51,360;27:51,800;"Oh, yeah."
27:51,800;27:56,040;"I mean, just a guy who comes back from having a hole in his heart and having a"
27:56,040;27:57,920;"miss a season and then decides, you know what?"
27:57,920;27:58,240;"Yeah."
27:58,240;27:59,720;"Now let's go back to playing football."
27:59,720;28:01,480;"especially in the style that he does,"
28:01,480;28:06,240;"which a lot of people have specific images of him"
28:06,240;28:08,720;"in their mind when you think of Teddy Bruce G."
28:08,720;28:13,440;"Mine is him coming in on a blitz"
28:13,440;28:16,840;"and trying to dive head first over"
28:16,840;28:19,520;"both running back, trying to pick him up."
28:19,520;28:21,920;"And basically just being upside down"
28:21,920;28:24,600;"in the quarterback's face, like legs first,"
28:24,600;28:26,080;"trying to tackle him with his knees,"
28:26,080;28:27,440;"like back of his knees."
28:27,440;28:29,680;"And that's like, that's who Teddy Bruce is."
28:29,680;28:30,680;"Like he's just."
28:30,680;28:32,080;"- Yep."
28:32,080;28:34,160;"So the U of A football team,"
28:34,160;28:35,400;"like the Arizona Cardinals,"
28:35,400;28:39,040;"isn't known for a pristine history of,"
28:39,040;28:41,320;"or tradition of excellence."
28:41,320;28:43,600;"But the years that he was there,"
28:43,600;28:46,960;"they had a defense that was called the Desert Swarm."
28:46,960;28:49,360;"And they were one of the classic."
28:49,360;28:51,280;"You can go Google right now,"
28:51,280;28:55,880;"the Sports Illustrated cover issue with Teddy Bruceky,"
28:55,880;28:58,840;"That also included Chris McAllister."
28:58,840;29:00,200;"There's a couple other guys."
29:00,200;29:03,000;"It started a run of Arizona defenses"
29:03,000;29:04,760;"that even though the teams never made it"
29:04,760;29:07,640;"to like the Rose Bowl or won a conference championship,"
29:07,640;29:11,440;"were regularly ranked and were among the best in the country."
29:11,440;29:12,920;"It was kind of like a model."
29:12,920;29:14,320;"They had a style of play in a model."
29:14,320;29:16,280;"They were kind of becoming known"
29:16,280;29:19,800;"like the Nebraska black shirts were in college football."
29:19,800;29:23,120;"And Teddy Bruceky was one of the pioneers of that era."
29:23,120;29:27,920;"And so he to this day is one of the most beloved alumni"
29:27,920;29:29,840;"of the football program."
29:29,840;29:34,000;"In fact, a couple of years ago, they did a history,"
29:34,000;29:36,880;"was it a 25 year history anniversary"
29:36,880;29:39,520;"of the Desert Swarm team, maybe it was longer than that."
29:39,520;29:42,760;"And the team on Homecoming wore the uniforms"
29:42,760;29:43,840;"that they wore that year."
29:43,840;29:46,760;"And Teddy Bruski's jersey was the one they were selling"
29:46,760;29:50,000;"online to commemorate that anniversary."
29:50,000;29:50,840;"- So,"
29:50,840;29:52,600;"- Mean, mugging in this picture."
29:52,600;29:56,680;"Yeah, I mean that to that hair. Oh, he looks great."
29:56,680;30:01,160;"Maybe maybe when we're done or maybe for your audience, you can tell them to YouTube desert swarm"
30:01,160;30:10,200;"highlights because that defense the way you described the way he played in the NFL was the way that whole defense played in college and him included and"
30:10,200;30:14,280;"Some of the best highlights that the football program has ever had"
30:19,160;30:22,600;"So really though what what thanks for Nikhil Harry the fuck"
30:22,600;30:26,840;"So no, he's a Sun Devil, okay"
30:26,840;30:34,160;"Do you like many on the East Coast don't pay attention to us out here and don't realize you know Bristol, Connecticut"
30:34,160;30:37,400;"Gets this wrong on the regular and we always make fun of it"
30:37,400;30:42,720;"They'll put the U of A logo with Arizona State next to it or vice versa"
30:42,720;30:48,200;"Nikhil Harry played for Arizona State, but I know Nikhil since he was in eighth grade"
30:48,680;30:59,820;"He's a local Phoenix product and it's sad for me because to see him being noticed, someone"
30:59,820;31:06,860;"who is soft is just so not on brand for what I watched him in high school and what I watched"
31:06,860;31:10,400;"out of him at the college level."
31:10,400;31:15,680;"It's kind of bizarre for me because he's a special talent coming up out of high school"
31:15,680;31:20,080;"one of the top ranked wide receivers on the West Coast was getting recruited by everybody,"
31:20,080;31:26,880;"had a great career at ASU even though I'm not an ASU fan. But to see what he has turned into"
31:26,880;31:32,480;"at the pro level, to be honest, is very surprising. And I'm pretty, pretty taken back by it. Not a"
31:32,480;31:37,120;"guy that I expected to have a tough career. And honestly, it might be coaching where you just"
31:37,120;31:40,960;"doesn't take the whole check style because we've seen it. It's not everybody's cup of tea."
31:41,520;31:47,760;"And just learning that offense is yeah, I am Brady at the end of his career is super demanding too."
31:47,760;31:53,120;"Yeah, I can see it. I can see it. You're not even gone though. You never know."
31:53,120;31:58,720;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know, maybe it just takes one season. He's got the physical gifts and the"
31:58,720;32:05,040;"talent, the speed for his size. So, you know, you never know. You never know what can happen,"
32:05,040;32:11,360;"but it is pretty disappointing to see what it's turned into. But there was at one point where"
32:11,360;32:16,640;"He and Byron Murphy, who's technically the number two corner on the Cardinals right now,"
32:16,640;32:17,840;"we're on the same high school team."
32:17,840;32:22,000;"So, um, so it's, it was pretty wild."
32:22,000;32:26,640;"It's pretty wild to see, you know, two NFL guys were at one time on the same high school team here in Phoenix."
32:26,640;32:28,880;"Um, to have that."
32:28,880;32:30,080;"I was really hearing your Hampshire."
32:30,080;32:30,840;"You don't see."
32:30,840;32:38,840;"No, anybody here in high school will go on to play in the NFL football and high school football in Phoenix has become no joke."
32:38,840;32:40,040;"They play year round."
32:40,560;32:44,800;"I mean, if you look at the BCS bowl games last year at the college level,"
32:44,800;32:48,800;"you know, almost every quarterback was from Phoenix. Spencer Ratler on Oklahoma."
32:48,800;32:52,000;"You got Brock Purdy, who was on Iowa State."
32:52,000;32:57,920;"Slovis on USC. You know, you've got the Oregon starting quarterback was from here."
32:57,920;33:00,880;"You know, there were and all of them conveniently not playing for Arizona"
33:00,880;33:04,800;"universities. They can't keep their, they can't, they can't keep the best talent"
33:04,800;33:08,080;"here in state except for Nikhil Harry. Yeah, right."
33:08,080;33:11,640;"The Kiel Harry was like the only guy that Arizona State was able to keep in town."
33:11,640;33:13,600;"So I'm going to take it out of him, I guess, the heat."
33:13,600;33:15,600;"Absolutely."
33:15,600;33:16,960;"Maybe there's your point right there."
33:16,960;33:21,000;"His four years at Arizona State, three years at Arizona State sucked all the life out of him."
33:21,000;33:27,040;"So did you go ahead and see the Pat Tillman tribute?"
33:27,040;33:27,280;"Yeah."
33:27,280;33:28,880;"In this game, in this broadcast."
33:28,880;33:31,680;"Yeah, because this was the year that he died."
33:31,680;33:33,200;"It was."
33:33,200;33:34,880;"And this was the first home game."
33:34,880;33:37,040;"This was the first home game since he had passed."
33:37,040;33:37,440;"Right."
33:37,440;33:38,280;"- Right, right."
33:38,280;33:39,120;"So yeah, thanks."
33:39,120;33:41,440;"- And everyone, the whole league was wearing the 40 stickers."
33:41,440;33:42,280;"- Yep."
33:42,280;33:45,640;"- Yeah, Pat Tillman played for ASU"
33:45,640;33:47,240;"before he played for the Cardinals."
33:47,240;33:49,400;"And so he's a legend here."
33:49,400;33:52,560;"And even though I like we've, you know, well established,"
33:52,560;33:54,040;"I'm not an Arizona State fan,"
33:54,040;33:57,080;"but anyone who was a fan of football here"
33:57,080;33:59,560;"in the state of Arizona as a Pat Tillman fan,"
33:59,560;34:01,200;"he was a extremely,"
34:01,200;34:04,600;"all the stuff you hear and read about him was true,"
34:04,600;34:06,080;"extremely well liked."
34:06,080;34:13,920;"an unbelievably hard-working overachiever who went from being a seventh round pick to"
34:13,920;34:22,500;"a guy that was one of the more exciting safeties in the league that was gearing up to earn a nice second contract and just decided to"
34:22,500;34:29,220;"Hang it all up to go fight in the war after 9/11. So it's an unbelievable story and it's sad to hear"
34:29,220;34:32,200;"The conspiracy theories that have come from that"
34:32,200;34:34,600;"since"
34:34,600;34:41,400;"But but there's an awesome statue out in front of the state farm stadium and in Glendale with a Cardinals play of him"
34:41,400;34:48,980;"Right outside one of the entrances and his jersey still to this day is one of the best-selling Cardinals jerseys year in and year out"
34:48,980;34:57,560;"Yeah, it's a good something like 225 tackles in a season. Yeah, he was a monster. That's incredible"
34:57,560;35:00,120;"Yeah, he was"
35:00,120;35:01,960;"that didn't seem"
35:01,960;35:06,880;"Like pro football reference doesn't have it that high, but it's the only have his offensive stats. It's just weird"
35:06,880;35:10,000;"Pat Tillman"
35:10,000;35:13,000;"Offensive stats. I don't know. Maybe I can't"
35:13,000;35:15,880;"Yeah, well, what's crazy?"
35:15,880;35:25,080;"Greg goddamn stat. I mean still in 2000 he had 155 combined tackles 118 solo for a safety. That's"
35:25,080;35:29,160;"That's a for a safety who was a linebacker in college"
35:31,360;35:40,080;"Yeah, like this guy was, you know, literally the person that you think of, at least locally,"
35:40,080;35:47,080;"when you think of maximizing every ounce of your being to be as good as you can."
35:47,080;35:49,000;"He was incredible."
35:49,000;35:51,000;"And they still honor him regularly out here."
35:51,000;35:56,960;"I mean, every year ASU football team does a salute to service game, and they always,"
35:56,960;35:59,920;"you know, have a Pat Tillman reference just a few years ago."
35:59,920;36:04,440;"everyone on the back of the ASU football team instead of having their own name had Tillman"
36:04,440;36:09,720;"on the back of their jerseys. They do what's called the Tillman Run, which is a, I think"
36:09,720;36:17,740;"it's a 5K that goes from outside of Sun Devil Stadium around Tempe and it ends inside the"
36:17,740;36:23,160;"stadium running on the field. And it's always attended by thousands of thousands of people"
36:23,160;36:29,720;"raising money for the foundation that they've created, the Tillman Foundation. So he is still"
36:29,720;36:35,400;"someone to this day that is honored and talked about regularly. That's the type of impact that"
36:35,400;36:41,480;"he had on the community out here. It's pretty crazy that of all games that we're talking about"
36:41,480;36:46,600;"and looking back on, it's the first home game since he had been killed in action. It's just of"
36:46,600;36:52,120;"all things that seems pretty wild. And that's kind of like why we started doing this podcast is because"
36:52,120;36:58,360;"when we're experiencing it in real time, you're like, oh, that's a cool moment. But then you go back"
36:58,360;37:03,240;"and re-watching. Like, I don't remember this at all. Like, I don't remember this being the first"
37:03,240;37:07,960;"Arizona Cardinals home game since Pat Tillman died, you know? Like, that's these are the things"
37:07,960;37:15,240;"that almost get lost to a history. Yeah, absolutely. What did Corey Dillon end up doing that season?"
37:15,240;37:20,440;"Getting a Super Bowl. Oh, you know, outside of that. I mean, was he like..."
37:20,440;37:24,200;"That's all I got is Jared, come on, man. You're on a piece like that."
37:24,200;37:27,200;"He only ran for 1600 yards and 12 touchdowns."
37:27,200;37:33,720;"He basically had the Randy Moss breakout with the new team season before Randy Moss."
37:33,720;37:35,200;"Yes, he was the original."
37:35,200;37:38,600;"Yeah, he went off."
37:38,600;37:42,760;"And I think it's spoiler alert in the playoffs against a cold."
37:42,760;37:46,840;"He kind of single handedly won that game in the in the slop."
37:46,840;37:51,680;"The Patriots controlled the ball for like 70% of the game or something ridiculous."
37:51,680;37:55,000;"Now everyone knows how the season's ending and he knows going to listen to the rest of the episodes"
37:55,000;38:03,620;"Super Bowl Steve so like gosh, I guess I could just fast forward to"
38:03,620;38:06,280;"2005"
38:06,280;38:08,480;"Like 2016 you're fine Steve"
38:08,480;38:14,400;"So I want I want to touch on Gronk, but just to kind of tie it into this game"
38:16,520;38:24,020;"Brady had a kind of an up-and-down game he threw two picks that weren't bad interceptions. Oh, what was the Hail Mary bullshit?"
38:24,020;38:27,260;"That's right. Yeah, but the other one was bad. Yeah, that was bad"
38:27,260;38:30,440;"But he also threw two touchdowns both to"
38:30,440;38:34,200;"Who I think was supposed to be the original Gronk Daniel Graham"
38:34,200;38:37,000;"who"
38:37,000;38:41,860;"Is one of those guys who I think had all the physical tools that Gronkowski had coming in the league"
38:41,860;38:45,340;"But could not catch a football to save his god damn life"
38:45,340;38:47,340;"That is such an end."
38:47,340;38:48,680;"Yeah."
38:48,680;38:50,980;"So, but you managed to snag two in this one."
38:50,980;38:55,480;"Basically both off play action because Corey Dille was running it down."
38:55,480;38:56,740;"Everybody's throat."
38:56,740;38:57,740;"Yeah."
38:57,740;39:00,900;"One of us, one of us, one of us, that first touchdown in the game, right?"
39:00,900;39:01,420;"Yes."
39:01,420;39:01,660;"Yeah."
39:01,660;39:02,980;"That play action."
39:02,980;39:03,780;"Yeah."
39:03,780;39:12,420;"Which I think is kind of the almost stereotypical touchdown of early Tom Brady career is that"
39:12,420;39:16,260;"really hard play action with two tight ends and throw it to whoever's like from the goal line."
39:16,260;39:22,180;"Yeah, yeah underneath the underneath the the goal post there and then the second one as pointed out"
39:22,180;39:28,100;"by the commentators which I had missed so great kudos to them. The Patriots and this Patrick Pass"
39:28,100;39:33,140;"on like a you know 10 yard touchdown he just Tom Brady overthrew him they just flipped the play"
39:33,140;39:38,740;"and ran to the other side to Graham and he's sort of wide open. That's that's great just front"
39:38,740;39:39,940;"front in the same play twice."
39:39,940;39:40,860;"Yeah."
39:40,860;39:41,340;"For again,"
39:41,340;39:46,420;"Hey, I just see Bill Bella check being like, hey, you know what?"
39:46,420;39:48,700;"Let's just run that same play again against these schmucks."
39:48,700;39:49,660;"It may have been bad."
39:49,660;39:50,140;"You know what?"
39:50,140;39:50,540;"No, fuck."
39:50,540;39:52,740;"I'm going to get it this time, but I want to do it to the right."
39:52,740;39:54,140;"Did he have that?"
39:54,140;39:59,020;"Those chops back then after he had won Super Bowls, this when he got kind of those chops,"
39:59,020;40:03,580;"or he's like, it was really that first 2001 since then it's been coasting for him."
40:03,580;40:06,820;"Nah, I think he's just starting to get that fuck you attitude now."
40:06,820;40:08,660;"Like, Oh, three, he was still struck."
40:08,660;40:15,140;"Well, O3, he played heart through the whole thing because we, like, I completely forgot"
40:15,140;40:19,300;"meant in the last game of O2, he was playing on a separated shoulder and then like,"
40:19,300;40:24,020;"re-separated it. So the whole O3 season was playing basically on a separated shoulder that hadn't"
40:24,020;40:29,380;"fixed itself. So this is like the first year he's like officially healthy and knows the system"
40:29,380;40:34,740;"and everything. So I think this is the start of the fuck you, Tom Brady. But he still doesn't"
40:34,740;40:38,980;"quite look like today's Tom Brady where he just knows what's going to happen all the time."
40:38,980;40:40,020;"-No, he's crazy."
40:40,020;40:42,500;"-Bellowcheck, though, he's getting close to fucking mode."
40:42,500;40:47,220;"-Yeah. He's still wearing polos at this point, so he's not there yet in this game."
40:47,220;40:47,860;"-That's true."
40:47,860;40:50,580;"-He doesn't have the hoodie going. He's in a nice golf hole."
40:50,580;40:51,540;"-A little offerable hoodie, I think."
40:51,540;40:55,620;"-Yeah, yeah, right. It's only 109 on the field, everybody. It's nice out."
40:55,620;40:58,420;"[laughter]"
40:58,420;40:59,140;"-Yeah."
41:01,620;41:11,220;"Yeah, I think just to kind of sum this game up, it was just Patriots keeping it close and it"
41:11,220;41:16,900;"should be because they kept doing stupid turnovers. And the Cardinals not taking any of those"
41:16,900;41:21,620;"turnovers and doing anything with them because except for putting Neil Rackers on the field and"
41:21,620;41:27,540;"kicking field goals. Yeah, he was their offense. He was awesome. Okay, I know you guys think"
41:27,540;41:30,180;"it's like ridiculous that we're talking about kickers here."
41:30,180;41:31,180;"- Oh, we get it."
41:31,180;41:33,060;"- But you should get it."
41:33,060;41:34,500;"You should get it with the career."
41:34,500;41:36,020;"Adam Vinotary had it."
41:36,020;41:37,900;"He was the kicker for you guys this season."
41:37,900;41:41,500;"Neil Rackers was a drive saver for this team"
41:41,500;41:44,780;"for a number of years and kept them in a lot of games."
41:44,780;41:47,540;"And it was just, you know,"
41:47,540;41:50,540;"as much as this team didn't amount to much during this era,"
41:50,540;41:52,660;"I mean, you forget,"
41:52,660;41:55,940;"they did make the Super Bowl in 2007."
41:56,780;41:58,780;"So this just a few years away from that"
41:58,780;42:01,820;"where Rackers was the kicker and they made that playoff run."
42:01,820;42:05,900;"But like when you're a young trying to figure it out team,"
42:05,900;42:08,660;"having a kicker that could, you know,"
42:08,660;42:12,700;"was automatic from 55 plus was a big deal."
42:12,700;42:15,620;"Not to mention he was according to many"
42:15,620;42:17,500;"more handsome than Tom Brady, you know?"
42:17,500;42:18,340;"So,"
42:18,340;42:19,740;"(laughing)"
42:19,740;42:22,540;"so the Cardinals had to have something going for it."
42:22,540;42:24,420;"They might as well have a supercharged, you know,"
42:24,420;42:27,060;"create a player style kicker that had amazing looks."
42:27,060;42:30,900;"It's like me playing Madden. Yeah."
42:30,900;42:31,220;"Pickers."
42:31,220;42:32,100;"Those guys around."
42:32,100;42:33,660;"You had Jared one guy we work with."
42:33,660;42:34,620;"He's a Bill's fan."
42:34,620;42:37,220;"His favorite player is Brian Mormon, the punter."
42:37,220;42:38,340;"Of course. So."
42:38,340;42:40,900;"So built like we said, Bill's fans have it worse."
42:40,900;42:42,340;"They don't even have kickers they can root for."
42:42,340;42:43,140;"It's just punters."
42:43,140;42:47,340;"Which I am surprised you guys slightly worse."
42:47,340;42:50,740;"Speaking of punters, Scott player, the Cardinals punter,"
42:50,740;42:53,700;"the last guy left in the NFL to wear the single bar helmet."
42:54,380;42:55,380;"He's in this game."
42:55,380;42:57,740;"That's like such a goober."
42:57,740;43:00,300;"Those are the dumbest helmets."
43:00,300;43:03,780;"They didn't do anything because like it's like it's like a chin strap."
43:03,780;43:05,780;"Yeah, it was basically a chin strap."
43:05,780;43:09,740;"Yeah, at that point, can you just not wear one or is it like part of the NFL rules?"
43:09,740;43:12,860;"You have to have a you have to have a face mask."
43:12,860;43:13,860;"We like, you know what?"
43:13,860;43:14,860;"Fuck it."
43:14,860;43:15,860;"This will do."
43:15,860;43:18,500;"I just don't understand like I get like it's just in an all aspects of life."
43:18,500;43:21,260;"There are certain things where it's like, you know, you want to wear stuff that maybe"
43:21,260;43:24,420;"is a little off or different because it speaks to who you are."
43:24,420;43:30,140;"And then there are some things that are just so awful looking that it's like just even"
43:30,140;43:32,620;"if you're trying to go for something here, just don't do it."
43:32,620;43:37,500;"And the Scott player single bar, like the Cardinals would have the last guy ever to"
43:37,500;43:39,860;"wear the single bar helmet."
43:39,860;43:43,700;"Like those are the types of things that the Cardinals have in NFL history."
43:43,700;43:46,780;"See, there's a shirt fit on that continuum then."
43:46,780;43:47,780;"Yeah, that's a ball."
43:47,780;43:51,860;"shirt is it's up there. But if"
43:51,860;43:54,940;"as a man who you are and just like a part of"
43:54,940;43:57,860;"yeah, it's a lot about you, Steve."
43:57,860;43:58,500;"Let's say. Yeah."
43:58,500;44:04,180;"Well, I think I think I think that face mask is"
44:04,180;44:08,820;"second worst. Only to I believe it was a San Diego"
44:08,820;44:12,220;"punter at the time. He had it was like the thin"
44:12,220;44:15,100;"double bar, but like the top of it like where it would"
44:15,420;44:23,740;"like go over his eyes. Kind of like raised up is almost like his face mask had raised eyebrows."
44:23,740;44:28,220;"So it gave the whole helmet a quizzical look. And every time I look at it, I couldn't help. I had"
44:28,220;44:32,540;"to laugh at it. It's the most ridiculous look at helmet. Like, why do you need that to go up?"
44:32,540;44:37,580;"So is it so is it blocking your view? I don't understand. Like it's a relation, Andy. Come on."
44:37,580;44:43,260;"But it's the dumbest face mask I've ever seen. Hunters are so weird. If we're talking about"
44:43,260;44:47,980;"Helmets too. Can we talk about how Larry Fitzgerald has the same hunter helmet in this game?"
44:47,980;44:52,620;"Then he still does into the most recent that retro like Revo helmet"
44:52,620;44:57,660;"You know that was super cool and trendy at the time and now literally no one else has except for Larry"
44:57,660;45:03,980;"It's just that he's been grandfathered and nobody else is allowed to wear those anymore probably not even probably not amazing"
45:03,980;45:10,100;"Yeah, I think Larry Fitzgerald in this game. They were already talking about how he was like"
45:10,500;45:14,920;"The focal point of the game two games the focal point of the office two games in the page"
45:14,920;45:19,320;"We'll have a teaming him every play. They're tie law on him. Yeah, that's pretty cool"
45:19,320;45:26,280;"What it kind of looking back on it. What a cool matchup, right? Yeah a good example of looks for the commentators"
45:26,280;45:33,000;"One of the guys of the least of my experience being covered by one of the guys with the most talking about the tie law Larry Fitzgerald match up"
45:33,000;45:35,800;"What great commentary?"
45:35,800;45:41,420;"Well, I'm just looking back at his because like yeah, I was this job is forever old. I mean"
45:41,420;45:44,420;"Tyla was exactly on the back nine of his career. I"
45:44,420;45:52,280;"Don't you say most? Yeah, but he was well accomplished at that point. So it's just you know, when you think about you know"
45:52,280;45:56,340;"Some cool matchups that you know transpired over the years, you know people love to talk about you know"
45:56,340;45:58,220;"What if Jordan could have played against LeBron?"
45:58,220;46:03,840;"You know like like you know it would have been really cool to see Tyla on his prime against Larry and his prime"
46:03,840;46:08,200;"They actually got to face off against each other though in this game and it's and it's pretty cool"
46:08,200;46:13,520;"There's would have been good to have Larry have a quarterback that could throw to it"
46:13,520;46:16,480;"It's just probably played against Tyler all the way up to Stefan Gilmore"
46:16,480;46:19,360;"Yeah, he has"
46:19,360;46:22,040;"That's impressive that that is pretty impressive"
46:22,040;46:25,200;"Oh, man"
46:25,200;46:28,520;"What else we got yeah, you gonna do best and worse?"
46:28,520;46:32,120;"I just want to see if there's anything else in here"
46:33,240;46:36,500;"Throw out, you know the name Bertrand Barry was a pro bowler"
46:36,500;46:40,380;"You know this pro bowler for the Denver Broncos pro bowler for the Cardinals"
46:40,380;46:46,580;"The only pro bowler for the Cardinals in this season. I think he got to Larry or got to Brady in this game"
46:46,580;46:48,520;"so"
46:48,520;46:53,600;"Shout out to Bert the B train getting the getting in on the action against the Pat"
46:53,600;46:56,120;"Yeah, you had a hell of a season"
46:56,120;47:00,980;"14 and a half sacks for four four spumbles on the season this year"
47:01,480;47:03,780;"There is a guy who also had a sack name Ross"
47:03,780;47:10,240;"Colo de J K O L O D Z I E J nailed it"
47:10,240;47:17,820;"Man that guy sitting there being like I sacked Tom Brady and everyone's like no you didn't"
47:17,820;47:22,680;"Steve he probably has a podcast"
47:22,680;47:30,740;"And he talks about on repeat that time that he sacked on my socks. I saw I saw Tom Brady calm"
47:30,740;47:37,780;"Yeah. But there was some great, there was a couple of great names in this that I, that"
47:37,780;47:42,620;"I came across the full back. Obafemi, I am Bodejo. Bodejo."
47:42,620;47:47,460;"Yep. I'm a day Joe. Yep. That's a great fucking name. Yep. And also,"
47:47,460;47:49,140;"Pepe Zellner was happy."
47:49,140;47:51,900;"Pepe Zellner. What a great name."
47:51,900;47:57,660;"Pepe had a few quarterback hurries in this, the first half of this game. Yeah. Yeah."
47:57,660;48:01,500;"It was a solid defensive end, but every time they said, ""Pepi's Elner,"" he couldn't help"
48:01,500;48:02,660;"but spark a little."
48:02,660;48:04,460;"Chuckle a little bit, right?"
48:04,460;48:05,460;"Yeah."
48:05,460;48:06,460;"That's great."
48:06,460;48:08,660;"Bring some levity to the situation that is..."
48:08,660;48:12,580;"Take it easy."
48:12,580;48:19,100;"One last note before we do ""Best and Worst,"" with this win, New England moves to 17 wins"
48:19,100;48:22,140;"in a row on their way to their record setting."
48:22,140;48:32,940;"would tie the 76 77 Oakland Raiders. 18 is the record held by a few team. One, two, three,"
48:32,940;48:39,580;"four, five teams, most recently Denver, the 97 98 Denver team that cheated their way past the"
48:39,580;48:48,140;"salary cap. Good for them. The 89 90 San Francisco 49ers, which I think that was like the Steve"
48:48,140;48:54,540;"young switch over. Yeah. Yeah. It was a transition to Steve Young. Obviously the 72 dolphins,"
48:54,540;48:58,380;"they went 16 and 0 and then won the next two games in 73, I think."
48:58,380;49:03,420;"Or maybe something like that. Yeah, let's restrict this because this is regular season wins."
49:03,420;49:10,700;"Isn't it? No. Now it's the end of all this. Yeah. I thought the NFL does all the records"
49:10,700;49:16,220;"in regular season wins because you have to. Sometimes, yeah. But the last two on this are the"
49:16,940;49:23,420;"3330 here's an actress for you the 3334 and 4142 Chicago Bears."
49:23,420;49:25,180;"Well, wow."
49:25,180;49:32,700;"Free NFL Chicago Bears when there was still an AFL to compete with them."
49:32,700;49:34,140;"Each game was like two to one."
49:34,140;49:40,300;"Yeah. Speaking of things that transpired, you know, you guys talked about all these records."
49:40,300;49:45,100;"Two things that happened to the Cardinals this season were two losses to the 49ers who"
49:45,740;49:48,040;"didn't beat any other teams that season."
49:48,040;49:49,740;"- It went two on 14."
49:49,740;49:50,900;"- They went two on 14."
49:50,900;49:53,100;"So if say, you know, the Cardinals, you know,"
49:53,100;49:54,180;"pull something out of their ass"
49:54,180;49:57,100;"and beat the worst team in football,"
49:57,100;49:59,060;"they would have finished eight and eight"
49:59,060;50:02,040;"and the Rams finished eight and eight that season"
50:02,040;50:03,500;"and made the playoffs."
50:03,500;50:05,900;"And the Cardinals split with the Rams that season."
50:05,900;50:07,860;"I'm not gonna do a deep enough dive"
50:07,860;50:10,860;"to know if they had the tiebreaker with the Rams."
50:10,860;50:12,260;"- But it would have been close."
50:12,260;50:13,860;"- If the Cardinals could have found a way"
50:13,860;50:17,260;"to figure out to beat the worst team in the NFL,"
50:17,260;50:20,880;"which I think led to them drafting Alex Smith one overall."
50:20,880;50:22,860;"I'm pretty sure that's the draft."
50:22,860;50:23,860;"- Oh, nice."
50:23,860;50:26,220;"- I could be wrong."
50:26,220;50:28,220;"I'm just going off the top of the brain here."
50:28,220;50:30,940;"But if they could have figured out a way to do that,"
50:30,940;50:32,340;"they might have made the playoffs that year."
50:32,340;50:34,860;"And we're talking about a playoff team"
50:34,860;50:37,660;"that the Patriots beat in week two on the road,"
50:37,660;50:42,500;"as opposed to, ""Ha, ha, this was a whatever Cardinals win,"""
50:42,500;50:44,380;"or I went over the Cardinals, you know?"
50:44,380;50:47,180;"So just another fun little tidbit for you"
50:47,180;50:49,300;"to talk about how glorious the season was."
50:49,300;50:52,100;"- You were correct."
50:52,100;50:55,460;"Pick number one overall,"
50:55,460;50:57,820;"Sam Smith's Good 49ers, Alex Smith."
50:57,820;51:00,500;"And before that, I watched Alex Smith"
51:00,500;51:03,420;"coached by Urban Meyer play in the festival."
51:03,420;51:05,620;"I was at that game in person."
51:05,620;51:06,460;"- Oh damn."
51:06,460;51:07,620;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
51:07,620;51:09,020;"Just round and round we go."
51:11,020;51:12,900;"Arizona Cardinals picked, uh,"
51:12,900;51:14,020;"intro role."
51:14,020;51:17,460;"Great pick who was big time, big time player again."
51:17,460;51:22,540;"Like that, that stretch of those two drafts were like the groundwork for a"
51:22,540;51:26,020;"defense that got the Cardinals all the way to the Super Bowl just a few years"
51:26,020;51:26,460;"later."
51:26,460;51:29,020;"And this is a great draft too though."
51:29,020;51:33,620;"Alex Smith, Ronnie Brown, Breyland Edwards, Adam Jones, Pac-Man Jones,"
51:33,620;51:39,180;"intro role, Carlos Rogers, Demarcus Ware, Sean Merriman, Jamal Brown from the"
51:39,180;51:39,700;"Saints."
51:40,620;51:47,900;"We're in week two of season two thousand eighties already talking about the oh five draft Jesus Patriots number 32 Logan mankins"
51:47,900;51:50,820;"stall war"
51:50,820;51:58,260;"Yeah, we'll get to that though, right Steve. Yes, Andy. All right, so"
51:58,260;52:01,500;"Just to explain to Jared"
52:01,500;52:06,640;"Growing up around the around the dinner table our parents used to make us do"
52:07,260;52:11,340;"Best and worst for your days. You have to pick the best and the worst it happens"
52:11,340;52:17,440;"So we carried that into the podcast where you just well glad to join the brown family dinner here"
52:17,440;52:23,540;"So you just so we'll start with Steve Steve give me your your best and worst from this game"
52:23,540;52:29,180;"My best was I could just hear this highlight on prime time"
52:29,180;52:36,100;"They they try to pitch to Corey Dylan and he like fumble that he didn't even catch it really don't the Cardinals pick it up"
52:36,100;52:39,660;"But like there's two of them running down the sidelines like big boys"
52:39,660;52:44,940;"Both trying to pick it up and run at the same time and they're like bumping into each other and I can just hear Chris Birmingham"
52:44,940;52:52,780;"The best it was also a worst because I was a yeah"
52:52,780;52:57,060;"Yeah, that was one of those terrible turnovers that pretty bad like the yeah"
52:57,060;53:02,820;"The Cardinals hadn't done anything and they had like 13 total yards of offense and yet they're still in field goal range because"
53:03,500;53:09,580;"Cory Dylan your superstar running back can't catch a pitch like 30 yards and six points. Yeah"
53:09,580;53:19,500;"Yeah, and then I saw a gift of Romeo Cornell doing the voodoo thing"
53:19,500;53:24,300;"You know that's like a famous knowledge that gift. Yeah, I was like oh shit came from this game"
53:24,300;53:29,740;"Yeah, no, I snagged that'll be on the website nice and hey connection for you"
53:30,220;53:35,460;"Romeo chronelles defensive coordinator when he became the head coach of was it the chiefs"
53:35,460;53:40,440;"Clann clan clan was at the Browns. Oh, no, I think you're a major was a chief"
53:40,440;53:47,780;"Was uh, yeah, it was a week when he came the head coach of the chiefs was a Clancy pender gas who was the Cardinals defensive coordinator in this game"
53:47,780;53:52,620;"Another great name clancy pender gas"
53:52,620;53:58,660;"Yeah, that's right. I didn't have too much more worse outside of the"
53:59,060;54:04,480;"Patience inability to really put the Cardinals away. Yeah, there's a worse for the Cardinals where"
54:04,480;54:12,100;"They had like a they're in their own ends up look that so many people have when they talk about"
54:12,100;54:18,500;"Just if you just take a screen grab this isn't good podcasting right now because they're not looking at you"
54:18,500;54:20,740;"But you just have this look where it's just like oh"
54:20,740;54:24,580;"Come on"
54:24,580;54:28,580;"You're like, oh, you're like, you're like, you put your big obnoxious."
54:28,580;54:30,580;"Yeah, I could have done without that."
54:30,580;54:36,220;"You know, gosh, so continue, Steve, but I just, I wanted you to capture that face because"
54:36,220;54:39,300;"that is the face of a Cardinals fan."
54:39,300;54:40,660;"So it's like third and 15."
54:40,660;54:43,180;"They get sacked, but there's an outside."
54:43,180;54:45,500;"Oh, we get to run another play."
54:45,500;54:46,500;"Throw an interception."
54:46,500;54:49,660;"It's just like, Oh, God damn, you should just take them, just decline the outside."
54:49,660;54:51,100;"It's taking the sack and punted."
54:51,100;54:52,100;"Yeah."
54:52,100;54:53,100;"Yeah, that was rough."
54:53,100;54:54,100;"Yeah."
54:54,100;55:03,620;"didn't he? They threw an interception. And then it got called back for defensive holding."
55:03,620;55:10,020;"And I think Tyler. And then so the very next play, and that was like third and long. So the very"
55:10,020;55:16,260;"next play is not like third and less long. And my cow or my cow and whoever you want to pronounce"
55:16,260;55:22,820;"it decides to just chuck at six feet over a double covered Larry's Fitzgerald into Eugene arms"
55:22,860;55:27,660;"waiting arms for his second reception in two place."
55:27,660;55:28,220;"Yeah."
55:28,220;55:29,420;"And this one didn't get called back."
55:29,420;55:29,660;"Yeah."
55:29,660;55:31,860;"I think the pages take that and score a touchdown."
55:31,860;55:35,020;"It's starting to look and then out of hand and then they kept"
55:35,020;55:38,300;"fumbling the ball, coughing it up and letting the Cardinals a little bit back into it."
55:38,300;55:38,900;"Yeah."
55:38,900;55:39,380;"Yeah."
55:39,380;55:42,060;"It's a good, good luck."
55:42,060;55:44,260;"Yeah."
55:44,260;55:44,780;"All right."
55:44,780;55:47,140;"Jared, do you want to give us your best and worst?"
55:47,140;55:47,940;"Sure."
55:47,940;55:49,860;"I'll do it from a Cardinals perspective."
55:50,940;55:55,340;"The best, you know, easy one we talked about, the honoring of Pat Tillman, pretty cool,"
55:55,340;56:01,580;"watching that back and seeing the decals. And the worst was to play, and I think it was the"
56:01,580;56:07,660;"second drive of the game, where it's just a flawlessly executed screen, played a Patrick Pass,"
56:07,660;56:14,620;"who runs for about 25, 30 yards and fumbles the ball forward for another 20, and there's three"
56:14,620;56:19,580;"Cardinals right there to recover it and yet somehow was it was a deal branch"
56:19,580;56:26,580;"comes out of receiver we have comes out of nowhere and ends up with the ball inside the 10 yard line so it ended up being like a"
56:26,580;56:34,380;"55-yard play I can't remember, you know, Tasker probably made something up on that play of the amount of yards that it ended up covering"
56:34,380;56:41,580;"But yeah, but that that was a I guess a microcosm for the rest of the game where even when the Patriots were making mistakes"
56:41,580;56:44,060;"and we're trying to lose the game."
56:44,060;56:45,300;"You know, the Cardinals would just,"
56:45,300;56:46,380;"the Cardinals would just be like,"
56:46,380;56:47,820;"""Nah, you take the win."
56:47,820;56:48,820;"""You can have it."
56:48,820;56:49,660;"""You can have it."""
56:49,660;56:52,540;"So the Patrick Pass fumble forward"
56:52,540;56:55,980;"for another 15 plus yards to get inside the 10 first in goal,"
56:55,980;56:58,500;"which led to that first play action touchdown"
56:58,500;57:02,980;"that we referenced was probably my worst from the game."
57:02,980;57:03,820;"- That's a really good one, yeah."
57:03,820;57:06,900;"I went from the 46 yard line to the seven."
57:06,900;57:07,740;"- Yeah."
57:07,740;57:08,740;"- Yeah, and half of that."
57:08,740;57:09,660;"- And you know what?"
57:09,660;57:13,180;"And guess what? That screenplay was so well executed that it probably could have"
57:13,180;57:14,660;"happened like that without the fumble."
57:14,660;57:15,660;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
57:15,660;57:19,900;"He decided to basically just throw the ball forward another 10, 15 yards and"
57:19,900;57:21,860;"his boy Dion Branch was there to get it."
57:21,860;57:23,340;"It worked."
57:23,340;57:24,940;"That's what you got to do."
57:24,940;57:26,460;"Flawless execution there."
57:26,460;57:29,140;"Just like they wrote it up."
57:29,140;57:31,620;"All right."
57:31,620;57:33,460;"Let's see."
57:33,460;57:34,580;"My best."
57:36,940;57:39,940;"was probably the fact that this was"
57:39,940;57:45,780;"after having suffered through the run game of last season,"
57:45,780;57:48,500;"where the Patriots are, I think, 29th in the league"
57:48,500;57:52,100;"with an old broken down Anton Smith."
57:52,100;57:56,020;"This is the first time the Patriots had a 100 yard receiver"
57:56,020;58:00,100;"and 100 yard rusher in the same game since 1997."
58:00,100;58:01,260;"Ooh, Dougie."
58:01,260;58:04,060;"Steve, can you name either of those players?"
58:04,900;58:11,000;"Boy one of them should be pretty easy. Yeah, Russia. They're a seaver a Russia 97"
58:11,000;58:18,460;"Oh, Robert Edwards. No, God damn. It's your boy. Yeah Curtis Martin and my favorite Martin"
58:18,460;58:25,220;"Yeah, exactly and Sean Jefferson. She's the wide receiver. Oh, it's like over a hundred yards"
58:25,220;58:29,820;"Yeah, charge her Hall of Hamer Sean Jefferson"
58:34,140;58:36,140;"Let's see"
58:36,140;58:39,220;"I have like a mixed best and worst"
58:39,220;58:42,020;"Okay, later on it was Dennis Green"
58:42,020;58:46,500;"The best was that they shared this fact that"
58:46,500;58:48,460;"when"
58:48,460;58:50,620;"Dennis Green was coaching the Vikings"
58:50,620;58:56,300;"The ballboy on that team. Oh, yeah Larry Fitzgerald. Yeah, that's right"
58:56,300;59:00,580;"also true story so that that's kind of the best the worst"
59:01,380;59:10,880;"When Danny Green was coaching in college at Northeastern North Western on that on that Northwestern team Steve Tasker"
59:10,880;59:14,400;"That's your worst and they showed it"
59:14,400;59:18,680;"but well they see it so they put up this they put up the picture and"
59:18,680;59:22,660;"Don Kricky goes what's this?"
59:22,660;59:27,780;"As he's like oh well let me tell you"
59:27,780;59:31,660;"- Which is always like, it would be to clean them up."
59:31,660;59:34,260;"And also, it was funny because for some reason,"
59:34,260;59:36,800;"like the video that we have to watch this,"
59:36,800;59:41,700;"in the second half, all of a sudden,"
59:41,700;59:44,820;"like they were having trouble with the audio or something,"
59:44,820;59:47,700;"but you could actually hear the guy who was probably"
59:47,700;59:50,100;"in their ear, the commentators."
59:50,100;59:52,180;"So you can start to hear like the counter,"
59:52,180;59:55,900;"it's like, oh, going to commercial in six, five, four,"
59:55,900;59:56,900;"and then you hear them like,"
59:56,900;01:00:03,140;"thing to go into commercial like. Oh, that is so bad. But then they did it for the Steve"
01:00:03,140;01:00:08,500;"Tascot. They like Tascot in three, two, and they went to it and Kerry's like, what's this?"
01:00:08,500;01:00:18,580;"Jared is cringing hard right now. Oh gosh. That's just that shouldn't happen. That should not happen."
01:00:18,580;01:00:23,140;"Not at this level of the game. 2004, you know, it's different time."
01:00:23,140;01:00:31,060;"professionals. Welcome. All right. So we have one last thing to announce. Last week we had"
01:00:31,060;01:00:39,060;"Jeff Howan from the Athletic and he in honor of him, we said we're going to give away"
01:00:39,060;01:00:48,740;"a year long athletic subscription for a randomly selected person who wrote us a review of the"
01:00:48,740;01:00:54,260;"the podcast, good or bad, and then text of the hotline to let us know that it was you"
01:00:54,260;01:01:02,900;"that left the review. So picking randomly was pretty easy because we got one review over"
01:01:02,900;01:01:10,460;"the past three weeks. And of course, that would be our mother who figured out technology"
01:01:10,460;01:01:18,260;"enough to be able to review. So thanks, mom. Yes. So thank you for that. She told us, she"
01:01:18,260;01:01:20,960;"She told me the other day not to buy it for her."
01:01:20,960;01:01:21,760;"We didn't need to waste some money,"
01:01:21,760;01:01:24,080;"but she's getting it because we are,"
01:01:24,080;01:01:25,280;"well, I am a man of my word."
01:01:25,280;01:01:27,160;"I'm not gonna vouch for either of my brother."
01:01:27,160;01:01:28,640;"- Yeah, don't love me with that Andy."
01:01:28,640;01:01:33,640;"- So no, yes, so we'll be giving mom a buy my mother."
01:01:33,640;01:01:35,320;"- Yeah, buy my mother a subscription"
01:01:35,320;01:01:37,000;"to the athletic career."
01:01:37,000;01:01:38,720;"So, congrate to her. - Congrats on her."
01:01:38,720;01:01:39,720;"- It's a home of Brown, yeah."
01:01:39,720;01:01:41,920;"- Wait, wait, wait, did she text the Dynasty Hotline"
01:01:41,920;01:01:42,760;"to let you know?"
01:01:42,760;01:01:43,880;"- She did, yeah."
01:01:43,880;01:01:44,720;"- Okay."
01:01:44,720;01:01:45,560;"- Well, she did it twice."
01:01:45,560;01:01:48,240;"She texted me first to say she did it."
01:01:48,240;01:01:49,560;"and she hadn't."
01:01:49,560;01:01:51,760;"So I had to let her know that no,"
01:01:51,760;01:01:53,720;"you haven't left a review."
01:01:53,720;01:01:54,560;"- Oh, so she--"
01:01:54,560;01:01:57,120;"- On damn, I forgot to hit the submit button."
01:01:57,120;01:01:57,960;"- Oh, God."
01:01:57,960;01:01:58,800;"God."
01:01:58,800;01:01:59,640;"(laughing)"
01:01:59,640;01:02:02,440;"So she texted first and then left the review."
01:02:02,440;01:02:03,280;"- Yeah."
01:02:03,280;01:02:05,960;"And then texted again afterwards,"
01:02:05,960;01:02:07,880;"be like, I think I got it this time."
01:02:07,880;01:02:08,720;"Good work, mom."
01:02:08,720;01:02:09,560;"- Yep."
01:02:09,560;01:02:12,440;"- So, very nice."
01:02:12,440;01:02:14,520;"So yeah, so Marlboro, winner of that."
01:02:16,200;01:02:17,820;"And thanks to everybody for listening"
01:02:17,820;01:02:20,160;"and not telling us what you think of us, maybe."
01:02:20,160;01:02:23,700;"Yeah, I mean, no news is good news, I guess."
01:02:23,700;01:02:25,060;"So we'll keep doing this."
01:02:25,060;01:02:27,300;"We're not doing it for their reviews."
01:02:27,300;01:02:28,900;"We're doing it for mom, clearly."
01:02:28,900;01:02:29,900;"- At this point, yes."
01:02:29,900;01:02:35,660;"All right, well, this has been yet another thrilling episode"
01:02:35,660;01:02:37,220;"of the Page of Staunancy podcast."
01:02:37,220;01:02:38,940;"I think this one actually was."
01:02:38,940;01:02:40,020;"- Yeah."
01:02:40,020;01:02:41,780;"- Thank you, Jared, for joining us."
01:02:41,780;01:02:42,700;"- Thanks for having me."
01:02:42,700;01:02:50,700;"when we have kind of other perspectives of these games that we kind of remember, but don't remember."
01:02:50,700;01:02:53,700;"So that was really cool."
01:02:53,700;01:02:54,700;"Absolutely."
01:02:54,700;01:02:56,700;"Next week?"
01:02:56,700;01:02:58,700;"I don't even know."
01:02:58,700;01:03:02,700;"One of these days you're going to shock the shit out of me."
01:03:02,700;01:03:03,700;"Oh, no, I'm not."
01:03:03,700;01:03:05,700;"And be like, oh, yeah, no, they're playing this."
01:03:05,700;01:03:06,700;"I remember this game."
01:03:06,700;01:03:07,700;"I was there."
01:03:07,700;01:03:09,700;"We are traveling to Ralph Olson Stadium."
01:03:09,700;01:03:12,860;"stadium going back across country."
01:03:12,860;01:03:17,060;"Yeah, from the desert to the frozen tundra."
01:03:17,060;01:03:23,780;"Pretty much. Yeah, I mean, it was 58 degrees in this next game in Buffalo"
01:03:23,780;01:03:27,580;"down from 109. So"
01:03:27,580;01:03:29,180;"89 to 58. It's not even that big."
01:03:29,180;01:03:32,740;"Unseasonably cool. And then unseasonably warm. Boom. Yeah."
01:03:32,740;01:03:35,300;"It kind of it could be worse."
01:03:35,820;01:03:42,060;"They will visit the windless buffalo bills in their hometown and we'll see how they do there."
01:03:42,060;01:03:47,900;"But all right, thank you gentlemen and we will see you next week on the Patriots"
01:03:47,900;01:03:48,740;"Saucy Parkest."
01:03:48,740;01:03:50,080;"See you later."
01:03:50,080;01:03:50,960;"See you later."

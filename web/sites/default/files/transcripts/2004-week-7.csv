00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,400;"I am not your mother."
00:18,400;00:26,680;"All right, welcome back to the Patriots Dynasty Podcast."
00:26,680;00:29,120;"I'm your host Andy Brown."
00:29,120;00:35,860;"with me today is middle brother Steve Brown. He of who gets no respect. Have you gotten"
00:35,860;00:41,900;"any respect lately, Steve? I get more respect than the goddamn jets do, but they don't deserve"
00:41,900;00:49,780;"it. This is true. They don't deserve it. We are for those who are new listeners, if they're"
00:49,780;00:55,640;"aren't any. We are the Brown brothers. Oh, which game should I start with? About"
00:55,640;00:58,760;"Hey, you know, maybe they just discovered us."
00:58,760;01:02,440;"Maybe, maybe someone, I don't know, found us tweet."
01:02,440;01:06,560;"They're listening to that first fucking Bengals game, which is just a disaster."
01:06,560;01:08,080;"Yeah, that was a rough one."
01:08,080;01:09,560;"I mean, I shouldn't read that."
01:09,560;01:15,400;"But if you're smart enough and you started at this one, I don't know how smart that is either."
01:15,400;01:18,040;"I would go back and listen to the playoff ones because it was a game."
01:18,040;01:20,640;"It was."
01:20,640;01:24,480;"It's a typical AFCE's battle."
01:24,480;01:30,640;"below we do is we rewatch. We're rewatching every game of the Dynasty era. We started in 2001."
01:30,640;01:35,760;"And we're halfway through 2004 at this point. This is 2004 week seven."
01:35,760;01:40,000;"Patriots playing at home versus the Jets. This is their third home game in a row, I believe."
01:40,000;01:47,600;"Weirdly. Yeah, it's one of those like strange streaks where they had three home games in a row."
01:47,600;01:53,440;"Speaking of streaks. Speaking of streaks, absolutely."
01:54,320;01:56,420;"What is the wind streak up to at this point, Steve?"
01:56,420;01:57,620;"I don't know."
01:57,620;02:00,680;"Twenty one coming into this game is 20."
02:00,680;02:05,120;"So they will leave spoiler alert with 21 wins most ever."
02:05,120;02:11,520;"And it also breaks the regular season wind streak at."
02:11,520;02:14,220;"Eighteen, I believe."
02:14,220;02:15,320;"So that works."
02:15,320;02:19,420;"Breaking the record of do you remember the."
02:19,420;02:22,820;"The team is something with the bears."
02:23,120;02:23,620;"Yes."
02:23,620;02:24,120;"Is it?"
02:24,120;02:30,620;"It's a bears from 1933 and 34, which doesn't really count because they're playing against"
02:30,620;02:32,120;"like mechanics and shit."
02:32,120;02:33,120;"So."
02:33,120;02:36,240;"Yeah, that's not real football."
02:36,240;02:42,680;"But the NFL only recognizes the regular season one and not the one with the playoffs."
02:42,680;02:46,160;"I mean, let's think it's in between World War one and World War two."
02:46,160;02:47,160;"This is true."
02:47,160;02:48,160;"Yeah."
02:48,160;02:52,120;"Like I don't even know if planes were a thing then."
02:52,120;02:53,760;"they were close."
02:53,760;02:56,880;"They were like blimps were the way to go."
02:56,880;02:57,360;"Yeah."
02:57,360;02:58,080;"Yeah."
02:58,080;03:00,240;"Blimps were the new hotness ships."
03:00,240;03:01,360;"Ships is how you got around."
03:01,360;03:02,320;"I'd say you got to the new world."
03:02,320;03:03,760;"Yeah."
03:03,760;03:04,840;"How do you play it?"
03:04,840;03:06,520;"Like different cities."
03:06,520;03:08,040;"You took the train."
03:08,040;03:09,360;"We're strong carriage."
03:09,360;03:11,200;"Oh, sure."
03:11,200;03:12,640;"We're going to need two weeks."
03:12,640;03:13,880;"We got to go to the West Coast."
03:13,880;03:15,200;"They might have had buses."
03:15,200;03:17,960;"Well, they probably didn't also have that many teams back in the thirties."
03:17,960;03:20,320;"That was before the AFL and NFL merged."
03:21,280;03:23,280;"So it's probably only like six teams back then."
03:23,280;03:27,920;"So winning a bunch of games against the same team."
03:27,920;03:31,980;"It's like, it's like playing like wreck soccer, like the men's"
03:31,980;03:34,320;"over 30 league and going on a win streak there."
03:34,320;03:36,320;"You're playing the same like six teams anyway."
03:36,320;03:37,560;"That's true."
03:37,560;03:42,760;"So it's not not as impressive as doing it in the age of salary cap"
03:42,760;03:44,600;"and all of this."
03:44,600;03:47,880;"Do you think that's record will ever be broken because they lose next"
03:47,880;03:51,140;"week and this is the last game they win, which I'm grateful"
03:51,140;03:53,140;"for because it's against the Jets."
03:53,140;03:54,140;"Correct."
03:54,140;04:04,300;"Yeah, I feel like we've talked about this before and I think it was a split decision between"
04:04,300;04:07,500;"you, me and Greg, who's not here this week."
04:07,500;04:11,460;"How could that be a split decision if there's three people?"
04:11,460;04:13,940;"Well, we weren't unanimous is what I'm saying."
04:13,940;04:14,940;"Oh, yeah."
04:14,940;04:16,140;"I know we ever unanimous."
04:16,140;04:21,780;"Well, I think it was I was hard against saying this will ever get broken."
04:21,780;04:23,420;"I was saying it'll never be broken."
04:23,420;04:26,980;"Greg was this will definitely get broken and you were somewhere in the middle."
04:26,980;04:27,660;"So let's put this in."
04:27,660;04:31,140;"I was always switch firmly to Greg's side."
04:31,140;04:32,380;"You're outnumbered, out-noted."
04:32,380;04:33,380;"You think so?"
04:33,380;04:34,740;"It'll get broken."
04:34,740;04:42,460;"I just think because it's any given Sunday that being able to win broken"
04:42,460;04:46,580;"then like Tom Brady's Super Bowl championships and those records that he's setting."
04:46,580;04:48,620;"There are definitely records that will not be broken."
04:48,620;04:48,820;"Yeah."
04:48,820;04:53,220;"Um, I think, you know, passing, well, even passing records, if you look up"
04:53,220;04:57,020;"records or whatever, but like the winning of titles for one player,"
04:57,020;05:00,900;"yeah, I'm pretty is kind of got that locked up, especially since he recently,"
05:00,900;05:05,500;"I think it may have even been today talking about how he thinks he can play till 50."
05:05,500;05:07,860;"No, I believe it."
05:07,860;05:08,940;"Yeah, I would too."
05:10,300;05:14,500;"I mean, until he until he shows sides with slowing down, I'm just going to trust whatever he says."
05:14,500;05:16,000;"Yeah, I have my fantasy team now."
05:16,000;05:19,200;"I bet on sports betting is legal in Virginia now."
05:19,200;05:19,800;"Oh, yeah."
05:19,800;05:22,500;"So I can put money on Tom Brady."
05:22,500;05:23,400;"I never did that."
05:23,400;05:28,000;"I was a field on the Patriots because I'm already like emotionally invested."
05:28,000;05:28,500;"I'm going to see."
05:28,500;05:28,700;"Fine."
05:28,700;05:34,300;"See, when I was doing like pickums and stuff, I would always pick against the Patriots every week."
05:35,700;05:40,700;"That way I either got the pick right or the page is one."
05:40,700;05:43,620;"- Yeah, I feel like I remember that being a strategy."
05:43,620;05:46,980;"- Yep, just for cell preservation more than,"
05:46,980;05:48,260;"I didn't win many leagues."
05:48,260;05:54,020;"- I'm actually gonna have 150 NFL shop gift card."
05:54,020;05:54,860;"- Damn."
05:54,860;05:55,860;"- From one of the betting apps,"
05:55,860;05:58,620;"so you just sign up and they give it to you pretty much."
05:58,620;05:59,780;"- Okay."
05:59,780;06:00,620;"- What are you gonna get with it?"
06:00,620;06:01,580;"- Oh, what I can get, I don't know."
06:01,580;06:02,660;"We gotta help you figure that out."
06:02,660;06:04,820;"- So this was a question that I actually had too,"
06:04,820;06:06,540;"before we get in this game,"
06:06,540;06:10,340;"only because I was back at our parents' house this weekend,"
06:10,340;06:14,100;"or this week helping dad hang drywall on the ceiling,"
06:14,100;06:15,800;"which good times."
06:15,800;06:17,780;"But I was in the basement"
06:17,780;06:22,940;"and I stumbled across Greg's box of Patriots memorabilia."
06:22,940;06:24,780;"So I found, remember we talked ages ago"
06:24,780;06:26,260;"about the Drew Bledzo poster?"
06:26,260;06:27,100;"- Yeah, I see something."
06:27,100;06:28,980;"- The 10 ways Drew Bledzo will kick your butt."
06:28,980;06:30,700;"- So you have the original poster."
06:30,700;06:31,580;"- So I now have it, yeah."
06:31,580;06:32,420;"It's a family house. - It's a family house."
06:32,420;06:33,260;"- It's an image on the internet."
06:33,260;06:35,180;"I didn't know that was the OG poster."
06:35,180;06:37,940;"- Oh yes, that is the poster."
06:37,940;06:39,220;"- From the shrine room."
06:39,220;06:40,700;"- Yep, so I found that."
06:40,700;06:42,580;"So it got me thinking all day today,"
06:42,580;06:48,460;"do you have a favorite piece of,"
06:48,460;06:50,660;"I'll probably have to ask Greg this next week when he's here."
06:50,660;06:52,160;"- That's right, I'm definitely having a favorite piece."
06:52,160;06:54,320;"- A favorite piece of pages memorabilia."
06:54,320;07:02,080;"- No, I have one of hockey memorabilia though."
07:02,080;07:03,640;"Oh, okay. I think I know which one that says."
07:03,640;07:05,000;"- Ryan, Bobby, or picture I have?"
07:05,000;07:06,120;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
07:06,120;07:08,160;"- I wanna essay writing, ""Contest in fourth grade."""
07:08,160;07:10,600;"And the prize was, ""Meet Bobby Orr."""
07:10,600;07:12,680;"- I mean, that's good motivation, right?"
07:12,680;07:14,120;"And that's so, isn't it?"
07:14,120;07:16,120;"- I don't even remember what I wrote."
07:16,120;07:17,120;"- Doesn't matter."
07:17,120;07:18,440;"- Doesn't matter."
07:18,440;07:20,760;"- Good enough to meet Bobby Orr."
07:20,760;07:21,600;"- I don't know if I have one."
07:21,600;07:24,040;"I think I had,"
07:24,040;07:29,040;"oh, I had a signed Patriots hat"
07:29,040;07:30,560;"that was signed by a bunch of players,"
07:30,560;07:32,800;"'cause they came and like some of the,"
07:32,800;07:35,040;"like, you know, all the backups came"
07:35,040;07:37,440;"and played basketball at the high school"
07:37,440;07:39,640;"against like all the athletes of the high school"
07:39,640;07:41,080;"and they just mop the floor with them."
07:41,080;07:41,920;"- Right, of course."
07:41,920;07:46,340;"- But I won the raffle where I got to shoot from half court"
07:46,340;07:48,080;"for like a thousand bucks,"
07:48,080;07:51,760;"which I obviously missed 'cause I was like 10."
07:51,760;07:53,360;"(laughs)"
07:53,360;07:55,160;"- Maybe you're not even good at basketball now"
07:55,160;07:56,000;"and you probably weren't ever."
07:56,000;07:57,480;"- Right, yeah, I still couldn't hit that,"
07:57,480;07:59,960;"but I mean, at least I would have made a competitive now."
07:59,960;08:02,680;"But yeah, but that I got a hat signed by all of them."
08:02,680;08:06,520;"And I think the most famous guy was Scott's CQLs"
08:06,520;08:08,960;"at the time, the back of corner back, did you bled so?"
08:08,960;08:09,860;"- That's great."
08:09,860;08:13,400;"- So, but I lost that, that hat."
08:13,400;08:16,240;"And then I got a paid for shark tooth hat,"
08:16,240;08:17,080;"remember those?"
08:17,080;08:18,160;"- Well, things are, they're back."
08:18,160;08:19,640;"I got Greg's one of the Christmas players."
08:19,640;08:20,680;"- Yeah, yeah."
08:20,680;08:22,520;"And then that got stolen like the third day"
08:22,520;08:24,560;"at Ward's school, was heartbroken."
08:24,560;08:26,240;"- I still have Greg's starter jacket."
08:26,240;08:27,680;"I wear it all the time in the winter."
08:27,680;08:29,920;"- Mm, yep, starter jacket's a little kid."
08:29,920;08:32,640;"This thing is ridiculous."
08:32,640;08:33,960;"Still fits you?"
08:33,960;08:40,320;"Yeah, it's a maybe a touch short on the sleeves on me, but is that that like poofy one?"
08:40,320;08:42,160;"Did I have right here?"
08:42,160;08:43,160;"Show me."
08:43,160;08:47,640;"I didn't see this because I used to have on like way back in the day, back in the Parcels"
08:47,640;08:51,360;"era, like the pullover starter jacket."
08:51,360;08:55,720;"And I now have acquired something similar, but it has Jude blood so on the back of it,"
08:55,720;08:56,720;"which is pretty legit."
08:56,720;09:00,920;"I'll send you a picture. I worked with a Red Sox game."
09:00,920;09:03,680;"Yeah, send me the picture and we'll post it on Twitter."
09:03,680;09:05,280;"See if anybody else has any questions."
09:05,280;09:08,960;"And then ask for suggestions on what we should spend this gift card on."
09:08,960;09:10,280;"All right. Yeah, we'll do that."
09:10,280;09:10,920;"All right."
09:10,920;09:13,440;"I look for Troy Brown jersey. There was not one."
09:13,440;09:15,160;"No. Yeah. That's a shame."
09:15,160;09:17,160;"But they do have the red treasure, is he said, huh?"
09:17,160;09:19,640;"Has to be NFL shop, like NFL."
09:19,640;09:21,000;"Yeah, yeah."
09:21,000;09:23,560;"But don't they? I thought the NFL shop had..."
09:23,560;09:24,760;"I know the page is pro shop."
09:24,760;09:29,240;"has like the the old like white blue with the stripes and though I"
09:29,240;09:34,560;"Thought they had like it was like a brew ski and someone else made me Guinness"
09:34,560;09:39,360;"There was a brew ski when I think I saw the military something like that. Yeah, I'm after Troy Brown"
09:39,360;09:47,920;"I know yeah, we get a custom one for 360 bucks. Oh, that's a lot of money"
09:51,720;09:58,580;"All right, well, we'll find we'll ask our listeners if you have any any ideas you can text the dicey hotline"
09:58,580;10:06,580;"603-505-8043 and tell see which is spent his money on or if you have any bets that you think you should pick"
10:06,580;10:09,440;"You know a Mac Jones prop bet perhaps"
10:09,440;10:13,240;"Text us betting on the Patriots. I just told you that"
10:13,240;10:17,900;"All right bet on Zach Wilson then that's not the Patriots"
10:17,900;10:20,680;"How many interceptions will Zach"
10:20,760;10:23,840;"Wilson throw yeah over under Sam darnold I"
10:23,840;10:27,680;"Am about the fuck the Jets life"
10:27,680;10:32,720;"They'll ruin him just like they did Sam. I love it. So"
10:32,720;10:35,960;"So kind of like a mirror image of"
10:35,960;10:42,720;"This current week's matchup where both the Patriots and the Jets are winless at 0 and 1"
10:42,720;10:46,280;"Back in 2004 week 7"
10:46,840;10:48,280;"This was actually the opposite."
10:48,280;10:53,840;"This was a battle of the unbeaten, both Pat and Jets at 5 and 0 coming into this."
10:53,840;10:57,400;"Two of the last three undefeated teams in the league."
10:57,400;10:58,840;"Did you catch who the third one was?"
10:58,840;10:59,840;"No, I did not."
10:59,840;11:03,840;"The Philadelphia Eagles had won today in this game."
11:03,840;11:04,840;"Oh, yeah."
11:04,840;11:06,520;"The actual opponent in the Super Bowl."
11:06,520;11:07,520;"Correct."
11:07,520;11:15,600;"So, some high-flying teams and also the other team that we will see in the next episode"
11:15,600;11:20,240;"on their bi-week this week, the Pittsburgh Steelers with rookie Ben Rothelsberger are"
11:20,240;11:23,660;"sitting at four in one. So not bad either."
11:23,660;11:25,740;"Yeah, big balance. Good."
11:25,740;11:27,100;"Not the gate. Yeah."
11:27,100;11:34,620;"They a bit more about this streak. They're talking about it had been 391 days since the"
11:34,620;11:39,340;"Patriots had lost to the Redskins back in 2002."
11:39,340;11:43,660;"No, 2000, beginning in 2003."
11:43,660;11:44,860;"Yes."
11:45,460;11:49,180;"The last time they lost at home was the end of 2002."
11:49,180;11:51,300;"That's why I got that confused to"
11:51,300;11:54,420;"Chad Bennington and the Jets."
11:54,420;11:54,780;"Yeah."
11:54,780;11:58,420;"Some more things that have changed."
11:58,420;12:03,020;"Like this was kind of peak Boston sports weekend"
12:03,020;12:07,580;"because last episode we talked about how the Red Sox were down three"
12:07,580;12:08,900;"games and nothing to the Yankees."
12:08,900;12:13,060;"Things have changed since then in a week."
12:13,700;12:19,180;"And the Red Sox are now currently one game up in the World Series"
12:19,180;12:22,500;"after having completed their comeback for games of three."
12:22,500;12:23,660;"What a wild week."
12:23,660;12:24,180;"Yeah."
12:24,180;12:25,780;"And they actually posted a"
12:25,780;12:28,020;"the Patriots set the record for most wins in a row."
12:28,020;12:29,660;"Yeah, it's nice."
12:29,660;12:30,780;"Yeah."
12:30,780;12:33,220;"Yeah. So they they showed a"
12:33,220;12:39,820;"stat thing before the game title good times in Beantown this weekend in New England sports."
12:39,820;12:43,620;"The New England Patriots 20 game winning streak defending Super Bowl champions."
12:43,620;12:48,620;"Boston Red Sox World Series versus the St. Louis Cardinals lead the series won nothing,"
12:48,620;12:54,140;"game two tonight. And Boston College had just defeated Notre Dame the day before 24/23"
12:54,140;13:00,780;"in a big upset. I think Notre Dame was ranked or something. So good day to be a sports fan"
13:00,780;13:07,500;"in New England. Just a little ridiculous. It's good week. Well, yeah, we're just like,"
13:07,500;13:12,500;"We're spoiled for professional sports in New England."
13:12,500;13:20,220;"- We haven't done this in a while."
13:20,220;13:22,700;"You wanna give this game a watchability score?"
13:22,700;13:25,300;"- Yeah, it wasn't a very watchable game."
13:25,300;13:26,500;"- No, it was not."
13:26,500;13:28,700;"- Two maybe two and a half Lombardis."
13:28,700;13:33,500;"Maybe, yeah, that's two and a half, solid."
13:33,500;13:34,860;"- Out of six, yeah."
13:34,860;13:39,300;"I think two was probably as high as I would go."
13:39,300;13:40,020;"Two lumbar."
13:40,020;13:41,740;"He's got a six David Givens balls out."
13:41,740;13:42,860;"He does."
13:42,860;13:43,140;"Yeah."
13:43,140;13:44,660;"He does ball out."
13:44,660;13:46,900;"He finished with over a hundred receiving as I believe."
13:46,900;13:48,060;"Yeah."
13:48,060;13:51,260;"One oh seven, five catches all for first downs."
13:51,260;13:52,980;"It's not too shabby."
13:52,980;13:56,020;"And they were talking about how every single catch he's had this year has been for."
13:56,020;13:56,580;"Yeah."
13:56,580;14:00,620;"And it was, I think by the end of the game, it was because he did it in this game."
14:00,620;14:01,860;"Two every catch was the first down."
14:01,860;14:05,580;"So he ended, I think he's at like 22 or 23 on the season."
14:05,580;14:07,140;"- He's like 25."
14:07,140;14:08,380;"- Something like that."
14:08,380;14:09,820;"- And they said that at the beginning,"
14:09,820;14:11,500;"he said 20 this year."
14:11,500;14:12,340;"- Yeah."
14:12,340;14:14,020;"- And then he got five more in this game."
14:14,020;14:14,920;"- Oh, I swear, yeah."
14:14,920;14:18,300;"So, and I actually tried to look it up,"
14:18,300;14:22,140;"but it's un-Googleable, I guess, I don't know."
14:22,140;14:27,620;"But I'm wondering how many the longest streak is"
14:27,620;14:31,340;"of catches that go for first down."
14:31,340;14:33,380;"That could be a record that you're not going to break either, right?"
14:33,380;14:35,780;"We did Tucker something that he'll figure out."
14:35,780;14:37,340;"Oh, that's a good idea."
14:37,340;14:37,700;"Yeah."
14:37,700;14:39,220;"Oh, I like that."
14:39,220;14:41,100;"Full of good ideas today, Steve."
14:41,100;14:41,740;"Got them all."
14:41,740;14:43,620;"Got that barbecue, dude."
14:43,620;14:45,940;"Just, you know, the meaty goodness."
14:45,940;14:49,780;"There's nothing better than just like a slab of meat that you can eat."
14:49,780;14:51,140;"As much as you want."
14:51,140;14:51,420;"Yep."
14:51,420;14:53,900;"Yeah, just house and house and."
14:53,900;14:55,380;"Yeah."
14:55,380;14:57,100;"Dead animal."
14:57,100;15:00,340;"Givens is what I hope to kill will be."
15:00,340;15:09,020;"Yeah. He's just when he catches the ball, he, his fight for the extra yard reminds me"
15:09,020;15:14,900;"of like a big Edelman. If that's same, like I'm going to get this extra yard every time"
15:14,900;15:21,460;"and I'm going to carry two guys to do it. But he's also physical specimen too and David"
15:21,460;15:23,460;"Gibbons. It's a big dude."
15:23,460;15:27,220;"Man, this is the re-watchcon schemes reminds what I loved him."
15:27,220;15:30,220;"Oh yeah. Yeah. He was your favorite guy for a while, isn't he?"
15:30,220;15:31,220;"Oh yeah, by far."
15:31,220;15:34,220;"Yeah. That's the time of year when I was watching this and this little kid."
15:34,220;15:35,220;"Oh God, yeah."
15:35,220;15:39,220;"Yeah. Cause how old would you have been in 2004?"
15:39,220;15:41,220;"Don't make me do math."
15:41,220;15:43,220;"I think I was 21."
15:43,220;15:46,220;"They were like six years apart. They'd go."
15:46,220;15:51,220;"So, yeah. Mid-teen danger. Perfect time."
15:51,220;15:53,220;"Of course."
15:55,220;15:58,020;"But that was really the only my watchable part of this game."
15:58,020;16:02,020;"Yeah, I mean, you could watch the first half because it takes about"
16:02,020;16:06,980;"30 minutes. Yeah, because the clock didn't stop there was"
16:06,980;16:12,420;"they actually showed a stat right before the Patriots got the ball and we're like running no"
16:12,420;16:14,660;"inside two minutes left and a half."
16:14,660;16:19,380;"Where is it?"
16:19,380;16:22,020;"Both teams"
16:23,780;16:28,740;"had had two drives each in the first half and they were averaging seven minutes per drive."
16:28,740;16:35,220;"And the score before that was seven, six jets."
16:35,220;16:46,900;"It was rough. But then at the end of the half, Patreton, Noah Huddle just goes straight down"
16:46,900;16:51,540;"the field and score a touchdown, Barry de Patton, five seconds left and a half."
16:52,580;16:54,180;"And that was all this."
16:54,180;16:55,380;"But there was."
16:55,380;16:56,820;"There wasn't anymore."
16:56,820;17:00,580;"With the second half, just it was a slog."
17:00,580;17:02,460;"Yeah, lots of three and outs."
17:02,460;17:05,980;"Well, people are not running the ball anywhere."
17:05,980;17:07,860;"Either running back is having a great game."
17:07,860;17:12,060;"Yeah, the only drive that had any promise was the one long one"
17:12,060;17:14,340;"at the end of the third quarter where the Pat"
17:14,340;17:17,940;"started their own nine and then Dylan had that huge run"
17:17,940;17:20,180;"to end the quarter."
17:20,180;17:25,980;"And then Brady hit Pat into the 20, but then Pat and got up and just like tossed the ball to the guy who's covering him."
17:25,980;17:29,060;"And they call it taunting on him, so brought the play all the way back."
17:29,060;17:31,900;"And I think it was like the next play."
17:31,900;17:35,500;"They tried to run a screen and here's something we should talk about."
17:35,500;17:38,300;"They tried to run a screenplay to the full back."
17:38,300;17:42,180;"Only the full back wasn't Patrick Pass like it normally is because he was hurt."
17:42,180;17:44,100;"So the backup full back."
17:44,100;17:45,420;"Who was this?"
17:45,420;17:46,500;"You brown and clacko."
17:46,500;17:47,780;"He's Stan clacko."
17:47,780;17:49,980;"Your nose tackle number 90."
17:49,980;17:55,060;"He actually that the first play from scrimmage was a throw to"
17:55,060;17:55,980;"Klekko out of the backfield."
17:55,980;17:56,540;"Yeah."
17:56,540;17:58,060;"Like they just love throwing to him."
17:58,060;17:59,380;"And then this was a second."
17:59,380;18:03,660;"Well, a second reception of the game, they ran a screen, a"
18:03,660;18:09,580;"screen of full back screen to Dan Klekko who got hit hard."
18:09,580;18:12,780;"The fumble, the ball and left the games and come back."
18:12,780;18:13,540;"Yeah."
18:13,540;18:18,540;"He was big in this like featured, I guess, there."
18:18,540;18:18,860;"Yeah."
18:19,060;18:21,800;"- Yeah, it felt a lot like..."
18:21,800;18:23,700;"- And he can move for a big man, but he just kind of"
18:23,700;18:26,480;"mad like he's not used to carrying a ball, I think."
18:26,480;18:28,180;"- No, well, there was also one play."
18:28,180;18:29,880;"- I don't think that he picked up that he missed too, I saw."
18:29,880;18:31,120;"- Yeah, yeah, there was one play,"
18:31,120;18:34,840;"the deep shot to Gibbons."
18:34,840;18:36,320;"I don't remember what it was."
18:36,320;18:39,680;"That on the sideline, like he was lined up"
18:39,680;18:41,040;"in the backfield as a full back,"
18:41,040;18:44,120;"and then he motioned out to be a tight end."
18:44,120;18:45,960;"But then he obviously didn't know what to do on the place,"
18:45,960;18:46,880;"he just kind of like stood around,"
18:46,880;18:48,820;"like looking for somebody to block."
18:48,820;18:51,700;"Like first you turn around, look at Bray, he's like, oh shit, it's a passing play."
18:51,700;18:54,380;"And there's kind of like ran around trying to find somebody blocking it."
18:54,380;18:55,900;"Wasn't anybody is hysterical."
18:55,900;18:57,820;"All right."
18:57,820;18:58,240;"I miss that."
18:58,240;18:59,020;"You have to put them on the site."
18:59,020;18:59,540;"Yeah."
18:59,540;19:01,900;"I think it's the big, the deep pass by."
19:01,900;19:05,620;"So if you find the deep pass player to, to give in, you'll, you'll keep an eye on"
19:05,620;19:06,860;"the fullback, that play."
19:06,860;19:09,240;"Cause it was Dan Kleckow's before you got it."
19:09,240;19:16,260;"Um, but yeah, it was, uh, it was rough, but you're now down to a third"
19:16,260;19:30,180;"fallback. And at the end of the game, the Patriots are milking a 13 7 lead still with two minutes left in the game. The defense just held us held the jets to a stop on fourth down."
19:30,180;19:40,620;"You're on territory. And they need a first down to be able to just kneel because the jets are out of timeouts. And so it's third and one I think it was."
19:41,260;19:43,260;"And so they're in run heavy."
19:43,260;19:46,820;"And so now the third string full back is who was it Steve?"
19:46,820;19:49,060;"- I know."
19:49,060;19:50,140;"- Richard Seymour."
19:50,140;19:51,700;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
19:51,700;19:53,980;"- So they run like a--"
19:53,980;19:55,380;"- You gotta set a Seymour in there."
19:55,380;19:58,540;"- They run an off tackle with Seymour as the lead blocker"
19:58,540;20:02,100;"and they pick up the first down by a couple of yards"
20:02,100;20:05,140;"with Seymour laying the critical block"
20:05,140;20:07,340;"to spring Corey Dillon to get the first down in there."
20:07,340;20:08,420;"- I think Corey Dillon would have been denied"
20:08,420;20:10,100;"even if he had missed his block."
20:10,100;20:11,060;"- That's probably true."
20:11,060;20:15,060;"Dylan struggle I think better. He got better. They're game went on. That was one of those games"
20:15,060;20:18,300;"Well, he did yeah, he ran for over a hundred yards in this game"
20:18,300;20:20,820;"but they showed the stats of the half and"
20:20,820;20:25,260;"He had 11 carries 23 yards"
20:25,260;20:32,320;"Rough first half those big backs though, you know as the game goes on. Oh, yeah, they pages definitely warm"
20:32,320;20:35,940;"There's one of those type of games though, and those can be a slog to watch. Yeah"
20:37,580;20:42,160;"It was close though score wise right that's had a chance they have ball"
20:42,160;20:46,120;"Inside the 20-ish right around there fourth and ten"
20:46,120;20:49,580;"Chadwick"
20:49,580;20:55,400;"Just forced it to win for better double coverage. I can idiot. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that was the thing that the Patriots"
20:55,400;20:57,560;"I mean the commentators who were they"
20:57,560;21:00,140;"Jim Nance and Phil Sims"
21:00,140;21:02,480;"And they were mediocre. I didn't really listen to him"
21:04,060;21:11,840;"No complaints specifically, but they actually they actually called out the fact that the Patriots on these critical third and fourth downs"
21:11,840;21:14,680;"were"
21:14,680;21:20,740;"Double covering wanker bet on all those like important plays because they knew that's where pennington was gonna go"
21:20,740;21:26,380;"And it worked yeah, I think I think you had one catch in this game. Yeah, they don't the shut"
21:26,380;21:31,180;"Yeah, and they like to the point where they were leaving other guys open and pennington just like"
21:31,460;21:37,140;"It couldn't get off Cravat. We didn't see any of Rodney Harrison this game because he's doubling Cravat and they're not going to"
21:37,140;21:38,460;"Cabrett so"
21:38,460;21:44,880;"Right because of that. Yeah, just another one of those Bill Bella check"
21:44,880;21:52,180;"Underestimated genius things that you just take for granted after 20 years, you know, I agree"
21:52,180;21:55,100;"Like of course he does that but it's like yeah, but yeah"
21:55,100;21:58,100;"He's he's going to sell out to take away the one thing that makes you comfortable"
21:58,100;22:01,300;"And if you beat him with something else, congrats."
22:01,300;22:02,140;"- Yep."
22:02,140;22:03,300;"- But most of the time you don't."
22:03,300;22:06,340;"- They always say it's like one hand tie"
22:06,340;22:08,100;"behind your back, so they move figures out,"
22:08,100;22:10,500;"whatever you do, the best and try to take that away."
22:10,500;22:11,380;"- Yep."
22:11,380;22:13,540;"So that and the next man up philosophy too,"
22:13,540;22:15,540;"you saw on this with the full backs, you know?"
22:15,540;22:18,420;"You've got two defensive guys playing full back"
22:18,420;22:19,380;"and contributing."
22:19,380;22:21,380;"Like they're not just in there as filler."
22:21,380;22:23,300;"They're actually like a part of the game."
22:23,300;22:24,340;"- Yeah."
22:24,340;22:25,460;"I love a good full back."
22:25,460;22:26,260;"- Yeah."
22:26,260;22:27,540;"- I don't do more of that in football."
22:27,540;22:33,220;"Yeah. And I'm pretty sure this is the game, the season where you'll have Troy Brown playing defensive back to."
22:33,220;22:34,580;"Yeah, you're right."
22:34,580;22:36,580;"So they just like, like this is."
22:36,580;22:38,220;"Sweet. I forget about that."
22:38,220;22:42,460;"Being able to save those Ross response by having guys play both sides of the ball."
22:42,460;22:47,300;"Love it. That's awesome. I'm excited to watch that actually. Troy Brown is DB."
22:47,300;22:48,140;"He can't wait."
22:48,140;22:49,700;"He's two. Yeah. Yeah."
22:49,700;22:53,100;"I think I think he ends the season second on the team in the interceptions."
22:53,100;22:55,260;"It's like two or three."
22:55,260;22:59,080;"So it's like not even just yeah, yeah, it's like one lucky one that Chargers game is this here too"
22:59,080;23:06,420;"Which should it the one where he ships tomorrow on the creek? No, no, that's not for I think"
23:06,420;23:09,060;"2006 I want to say"
23:09,060;23:11,860;"That's right be that's right before"
23:11,860;23:18,860;"2000 2007 when they go into here because that's still with the Riche Caldwell and everybody"
23:18,860;23:19,860;"Okay."
23:19,860;23:20,860;"All right."
23:20,860;23:27,860;"You want to do best and worse?"
23:27,860;23:28,860;"All right."
23:28,860;23:29,860;"Yeah."
23:29,860;23:32,860;"Well, did you want to talk about Curtis Martin first?"
23:32,860;23:35,860;"Because he's your boy again, right?"
23:35,860;23:38,860;"No, I don't really need to go all the way."
23:38,860;23:40,860;"We see so many Jets games."
23:40,860;23:43,860;"Yeah, but this is the game where you broke a bunch of records."
23:43,860;23:45,860;"He leads the league in rushing."
23:45,860;23:52,620;"He's gone over 100 yards and four of the first five games of the season."
23:52,620;23:53,940;"Doesn't do it this game."
23:53,940;23:59,060;"Yeah, but he moves to fourth all time in rush attempts in this game."
23:59,060;24:01,900;"Yeah, which is where he actually goes."
24:01,900;24:05,940;"Those records are nearly as impressive to me because they're going to be broken and they have been, right?"
24:05,940;24:10,260;"Well, where the 21 and no win streak is much more impressive."
24:10,260;24:12,820;"I think you're less likely to see those."
24:12,820;24:13,940;"It would be broken."
24:13,940;24:17,300;"I don't think you'll see those running record rushing records broke anytime soon."
24:17,300;24:20,420;"Because the NFL so pass first now."
24:20,420;24:21,980;"You're not going to see a back run."
24:21,980;24:23,540;"It's mine's way down the list now."
24:23,540;24:28,060;"Uh, he's actually still I looked it up because I knew you'd say that."
24:28,060;24:33,900;"He is well, I figured Greg would say that he's fourth in attempts all time still."
24:33,900;24:37,660;"Um, I think he moved up to third, but then somebody passed them."
24:37,660;24:38,420;"Like I remember it was."
24:38,420;24:40,220;"I might have been Frank Gore recently."
24:41,020;24:44,300;"He is sixth in rushing yards total rushing yards and"
24:44,300;24:47,780;"13th in rushing touchdowns"
24:47,780;24:50,660;"It's pretty legit"
24:50,660;24:56,900;"Never never didn't have a thousand yard season always had at least a thousand yards rushing"
24:56,900;25:02,420;"For the however many years he played was fun ridiculous like him play. Yep. Yep"
25:02,420;25:08,820;"And they they were talking about it in his in his game where he sucked the entire time he is there - they did"
25:08,820;25:13,220;"Yeah, he's like I don't even think he went to the playoffs. Maybe you did a couple of times, but"
25:13,220;25:21,920;"And then when pang ten was lit and then they put him out there in the fourth preseason game and fucked up his hand. Yeah"
25:21,920;25:25,020;"This is him back from that surgery now"
25:25,020;25:29,780;"Oops. Actually, I wonder if the oh the Jets went to the playoffs this season"
25:29,780;25:33,140;"Because they would finish"
25:33,300;25:40,640;"10 and six. So they were the other team from the AFC East that would go to the playoffs and they beat the charger. They upset the chargers"
25:40,640;25:43,200;"in the wild card"
25:43,200;25:44,880;"2017 and overtime"
25:44,880;25:47,900;"Then lost to the Chiefs not the Chiefs the Steelers"
25:47,900;25:50,280;"and overtime"
25:50,280;25:52,280;"17 to 20"
25:52,280;25:59,720;"Which was one of two of the four overtime games that they would play this season and what happens to the Steelers?"
26:01,080;26:03,240;"I think we'll probably find out."
26:03,240;26:04,520;"I don't remember off top of my head,"
26:04,520;26:05,640;"but I bet we'll find out."
26:05,640;26:06,720;"- We'll find out."
26:06,720;26:08,040;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
26:08,040;26:10,120;"(laughs)"
26:10,120;26:14,440;"All right, yeah, so give me your best and worst then."
26:14,440;26:16,520;"- All right."
26:16,520;26:22,920;"I have a couple of bests."
26:22,920;26:24,040;"- Okay."
26:24,040;26:28,080;"- One being Tom Brady screaming for a time out"
26:28,080;26:29,320;"right in the rough space."
26:29,320;26:31,920;"Yeah, because the ref wasn't giving it to a quick enough."
26:31,920;26:34,360;"Yeah, he was screaming at him."
26:34,360;26:37,040;"I have to give a shit though, did he?"
26:37,040;26:38,680;"You're like, yeah, whatever I get to it."
26:38,680;26:40,000;"I love mine."
26:40,000;26:42,760;"Our referee seemed for you, Andy."
26:42,760;26:43,480;"Love it."
26:43,480;26:45,400;"OK."
26:45,400;26:46,400;"OK."
26:46,400;26:50,480;"My worst before my best best."
26:50,480;26:51,520;"All right."
26:51,520;26:56,920;"Is there's just a blatant hold on the touchdown for the Jets."
26:56,920;26:58,000;"Like an end around run."
26:58,000;26:58,520;"Oh, yeah."
26:58,520;27:02,080;"- Yeah. - And is like just blatant."
27:02,080;27:03,680;"And he's like, ""Oh, what a good block."""
27:03,680;27:05,160;"And then because they're showing it over and over"
27:05,160;27:06,520;"as a touchdown."
27:06,520;27:08,720;"And like, it's just so clear."
27:08,720;27:10,040;"And like they have chances to be like,"
27:10,040;27:11,880;"""Ooh, actually, I don't know."""
27:11,880;27:14,240;"And they're just a lot of great."
27:14,240;27:16,800;"- That was a Chad Pang team running again."
27:16,800;27:18,280;"- Yes, yes."
27:18,280;27:23,280;"- Who they said that was his fifth career rushing touchdown"
27:23,280;27:26,160;"of which three had come against the Patriots."
27:26,160;27:28,480;"Which is strange. - James Chad and Tim."
27:28,480;27:32,480;"the third. Correct. Not a real Chad."
27:32,480;27:44,680;"Right, Andy. And then the best call the referees made all night was the 12 men on the field penalty for the deaths when the Patriots are"
27:44,680;27:46,280;"punting. Oh my God."
27:46,280;27:49,980;"First down. That was so bad. Yeah."
27:49,980;27:55,580;"It's fourth and four. They're putting all guys on the field and yeah."
27:55,680;27:57,200;"on a punt. Yeah."
27:57,200;27:59,000;"It was early too. It was like the first quarter."
27:59,000;28:02,400;"It was the like the second play of the second quarter."
28:02,400;28:04,680;"And we definitely scored on that track too."
28:04,680;28:07,840;"Yeah, because the next play, I think, was the deep shot to Gibbons"
28:07,840;28:08,800;"that we talked about."
28:08,800;28:10,200;"This is the one where."
28:10,200;28:13,920;"Yeah. And then Brady got sacked on third and goal and they kicked a field goal."
28:13,920;28:17,000;"Yeah, that's the one where a clockout didn't know what he was doing."
28:17,000;28:22,960;"But yeah, that was so jet-seeing."
28:22,960;28:24,880;"Yeah. Yeah. Just."
28:24,880;28:28,360;"- Her med works was not pleased."
28:28,360;28:30,860;"- Those moments that I watch these games,"
28:30,860;28:33,200;"I understand you fucking idiots."
28:33,200;28:34,920;"(laughing)"
28:34,920;28:36,360;"- Gristy do that you stupid jads."
28:36,360;28:37,560;"- You'd never see that,"
28:37,560;28:39,520;"like of all the penalties on a punt,"
28:39,520;28:40,880;"that's the one you never see,"
28:40,880;28:42,440;"the 12 men on the field."
28:42,440;28:44,360;"- Even if you see it,"
28:44,360;28:46,200;"you know, do it when you have 10 yards to go,"
28:46,200;28:47,880;"so that doesn't actually matter."
28:47,880;28:48,920;"- And even better?"
28:48,920;28:49,760;"- Yeah, if we don't do it,"
28:49,760;28:51,240;"if there's less than five yards."
28:51,240;28:53,480;"- Correct, but even better was the pun return,"
28:53,480;28:54,320;"wasn't that good,"
28:54,320;28:56,080;"with the extra blocker now."
28:56,080;28:58,520;"It was only like four or five yards."
28:58,520;28:59,360;"Fantastic."
28:59,360;29:02,680;"All right."
29:02,680;29:04,640;"So those are your best and worst, huh?"
29:04,640;29:05,480;"- Yep."
29:05,480;29:06,320;"- All right."
29:06,320;29:09,040;"Here's the best."
29:09,040;29:14,040;"The, who's your daddy chant at the end of the game"
29:14,040;29:15,320;"by the fans?"
29:15,320;29:16,640;"- Oh, I didn't hear that."
29:16,640;29:18,000;"- That was pretty good, yeah."
29:18,000;29:19,640;"You can hear it in the background"
29:19,640;29:20,560;"like right in the fourth quarter"
29:20,560;29:22,080;"'cause it's like there's nothing going on."
29:22,080;29:23,120;"- You said it's an excellent time"
29:23,120;29:24,200;"to be a sports fan there."
29:24,200;29:28,360;"- Yeah, and there was a bunch of fans holding signs"
29:28,360;29:30,120;"that were Red Sox related."
29:30,120;29:31,180;"We still believe."
29:31,180;29:34,120;"I remember that, that was my favorite."
29:34,120;29:41,760;"- Another good one is they were talking about"
29:41,760;29:44,160;"how do the patients feel about the wind streak,"
29:44,160;29:46,920;"which I think we all know the answer to that."
29:46,920;29:48,360;"- They asked Teddy Bruceky,"
29:48,360;29:49,720;"I don't care, I just wanna beat the Jets,"
29:49,720;29:50,800;"the visual games."
29:52,160;29:55,200;"but they were talking about how they see it as 21 game win streaks."
29:55,200;29:56,180;"Yes."
29:56,180;29:57,200;"It's so patron."
29:57,200;29:58,160;"So Bella check it."
29:58,160;29:59,680;"Silly."
29:59,680;30:02,060;"Um, is that your best or your worst thing?"
30:02,060;30:03,880;"How do you, which category are you putting that in?"
30:03,880;30:05,120;"Um,"
30:05,120;30:10,920;"I'm going to put in the best more so to an oil and Greg, if you"
30:10,920;30:12,440;"feel like I debated that one, though."
30:12,440;30:12,760;"Yeah."
30:12,760;30:12,760;"Yeah."
30:12,760;30:13,280;"Uh, yeah."
30:13,280;30:15,640;"Uh, it's, it's a silly thing, but it works."
30:15,640;30:18,400;"So you got to get, it's like, it's like Rodney Harrison at this point."
30:18,400;30:20,760;"Be like, Oh, no, it believes in us, even though they've won two other"
30:20,760;30:21,580;"last three Super Bowls."
30:21,580;30:21,800;"Yeah."
30:21,800;30:27,320;"I don't know if you believe that, but if it gets you the next year of all, I'm all for it."
30:27,320;30:28,320;"Right."
30:28,320;30:36,440;"But my worst is going to be Chad Pennington having all of his Russian touch hands against"
30:36,440;30:37,440;"the pads."
30:37,440;30:38,440;"We're into cover that."
30:38,440;30:42,200;"So I'm going to give you another best just for you, Steve."
30:42,200;30:44,840;"Oh, well, actually, no, here's a good worst."
30:44,840;30:45,840;"The Jets."
30:45,840;30:47,480;"It's a Jets-related worst."
30:47,480;30:55,060;"This was the one chance that the Jets had to start 6-0 in franchise history because"
30:55,060;30:57,200;"it had never happened before."
30:57,200;30:59,680;"They have never started the season winning 6 games in a row."
30:59,680;31:00,680;"They still haven't."
31:00,680;31:01,680;"Correct."
31:01,680;31:02,680;"Correct."
31:02,680;31:03,680;"Nice."
31:03,680;31:04,680;"So that was fun."
31:04,680;31:07,480;"And they're not going to do it this year either."
31:07,480;31:08,480;"I don't know."
31:08,480;31:09,780;"They are not."
31:09,780;31:10,780;"So yeah."
31:10,780;31:13,020;"So I'll give you one more, one more best."
31:13,020;31:18,020;"And it was just watching Tai Law come in"
31:18,020;31:21,140;"and make a tackle on a tight end"
31:21,140;31:24,980;"who's like catching the ball in the flat is just."
31:24,980;31:27,900;"- He breaks down real well."
31:27,900;31:30,700;"- It's just, yeah, because the guys are always bigger than him"
31:30,700;31:33,140;"and he comes in like a friggin' missile"
31:33,140;31:35,980;"and just absolutely obliterates the guy."
31:35,980;31:37,140;"Doesn't matter how big that doesn't matter."
31:37,140;31:40,260;"I mean, I think he did it last time we saw them play the Jets."
31:40,260;31:42,020;"where he did the Curtis Martin to call the ball to fly."
31:42,020;31:44,740;"And he just like crushes the guy every time."
31:44,740;31:48,740;"And you always think of Tylah as this like ball hocking"
31:48,740;31:51,740;"interception guy, you know, but that."
31:51,740;31:55,020;"- He could run for sand, he could have awesome ball skills."
31:55,020;31:57,180;"- Yeah, he could lay the lumber when he needed to."
31:57,180;32:00,140;"- No one can do a pretty good job of that too."
32:00,140;32:03,220;"- Yeah, but it's not the same level of Tylah, I don't think."
32:03,220;32:05,580;"- No, that was a beast."
32:05,580;32:09,460;"- Yeah, so, yeah, I think that was"
32:09,460;32:12,460;"- That pretty much covers this game."
32:12,460;32:14,380;"- I have a history note for you."
32:14,380;32:15,220;"- Oh, okay."
32:15,220;32:17,500;"- Actually, all right, trivia question."
32:17,500;32:19,380;"Who was the coach of that bear scene"
32:19,380;32:22,940;"that previously held the regular season"
32:22,940;32:23,780;"of ""Wind Street"" from--"
32:23,780;32:25,660;"- Dick Buck-kiss, I don't know."
32:25,660;32:26,940;"- No."
32:26,940;32:28,300;"- George Hallis."
32:28,300;32:30,180;"- Oh, okay, yeah, I should've got that."
32:30,180;32:33,420;"- Then they told that story about Belichick meeting him"
32:33,420;32:35,620;"in the locker room with a little kid."
32:35,620;32:36,460;"- Yeah."
32:36,460;32:38,060;"- And congratulating him on his win"
32:38,060;32:41,100;"and he gave him a signed dollar bill"
32:41,100;32:42,580;"to a little bill bill check it."
32:42,580;32:45,940;"- Because that's what he would do to the first person"
32:45,940;32:47,740;"who congratulated him on a win,"
32:47,740;32:50,140;"he would give that person a signed dollar bill,"
32:50,140;32:51,980;"which is fucking baller."
32:51,980;32:53,340;"- I didn't see."
32:53,340;32:54,180;"- I'm gonna start doing that."
32:54,180;32:56,500;"I'm gonna start carrying dollar bills around."
32:56,500;32:59,220;"And the first time somebody congratulates me on something."
32:59,220;33:00,660;"The first time somebody's like,"
33:00,660;33:01,660;"""Oh, this is your podcast."""
33:01,660;33:04,220;"- I have to be careful of something for that Andy, so."
33:04,220;33:07,180;"- The first person I ever see who's like,"
33:07,180;33:09,300;"Oh, congrats on your podcast."
33:09,300;33:09,860;"I listened to it."
33:09,860;33:11,900;"I love that thing and I give them the signed all the bill."
33:11,900;33:12,900;"Okay."
33:12,900;33:16,660;"So I don't expect to be spending much money on that."
33:16,660;33:18,300;"Okay."

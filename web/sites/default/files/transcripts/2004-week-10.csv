00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,800;"I am not your mother."
00:18,800;00:23,880;"Welcome back."
00:23,880;00:34,880;"uh, a long welcome back to the Patriots Dynasty podcast. We are the brown brothers and we're going back and rewatching every game of the dynasty era."
00:34,880;00:43,880;"Uh, with me today, not both brothers. Greg is actually preparing to go to the current Buffalo game."
00:43,880;00:48,920;"him and his friends are stuffing themselves in an RV and driving up the buffalo, which"
00:48,920;00:56,920;"sounds great, but in reality, uh, doesn't smell very good. But with me, we have Steve Brown,"
00:56,920;01:03,400;"the good brother, the better brother, the best brother, the better brother. No, no, the best"
01:03,400;01:07,000;"brother. I'm the best brother. Well, if I'm the better brother, I'm automatically the best"
01:07,000;01:11,400;"brother unless you have a brother I don't know about it. That's fair. I mean, we might. We've"
01:11,400;01:15,560;"been told we look like the mailman. So there might be other brothers out there that we don't know about."
01:15,560;01:24,600;"But in kind of this actually works out really well. We've been gone for a few weeks because"
01:24,600;01:31,640;"shit's just been crazy. Thanks, I mean, Patriots game in Carolina. Yeah. And I am redoing a kitchen."
01:31,640;01:38,760;"So things are just a hot mess right now. So, but everything's kind of worked out for the best"
01:38,760;01:44,360;"because this in the current time, we are what's the day today, December 2nd, 2021."
01:44,360;01:54,360;"We are preparing ourselves for, I'd say the first real Patriots bills game"
01:54,360;02:02,440;"that's meant anything in a while. Wouldn't you say? Sure. I mean, this is like the biggest deal"
02:02,440;02:06,040;"of pass fields. I feel like Bill Stins always build it up more than it actually is."
02:06,040;02:10,920;"Well, yeah, I'm talking I'm talking from a patch fans perspective here like this is this is the bill Super Bowl every year"
02:10,920;02:13,320;"Especially because it's in Buffalo. Right"
02:13,320;02:16,840;"And they always get their ass kicked"
02:16,840;02:22,120;"Yes, I was actually going back and and re like watching everything and I think"
02:22,120;02:24,520;"uh"
02:24,520;02:26,520;"the Patriots"
02:26,520;02:28,440;"in"
02:28,440;02:31,320;"Like all the all the games against the bills in Buffalo"
02:31,320;02:34,360;"Do you want to guess what their record is? I think it's 20 games"
02:34,360;02:40,540;"Yeah, 20 games. Do you want to guess what their record is in Buffalo 18 and two 18"
02:40,540;02:46,640;"and 17? You fucking nailed it 18 and two. Technically 18 and three if you count the"
02:46,640;02:52,360;"came Newton game last year. So you can call it 18 and three, but yeah. In the Belichick"
02:52,360;02:57,800;"Brady era 18 and two. That's that includes in the red zone, right? That was at Buffalo."
02:57,800;03:04,040;"Yes. Yep. That was the one where they were driving for the game. So 18, two and a half"
03:04,040;03:20,120;"Because fuck the Bells fan. Yeah, it's a cam Newton. He sucks now. You see him. It's terrible. Yeah. Yeah. So the fact that pages got as much as they did out of them is a small miracle. I'm still a big fan of Cam Newton."
03:20,120;03:33,560;"Yes, I love Cam, but he's just not good anymore. Yeah. Yeah. He's just not that well, I mean, you can't really judge him this year because like you can't just throw a starting quarterback in two weeks after you pick him up and expect him to like do anything."
03:33,560;03:38,180;"But yeah, he's definitely not the MVP caliber that he used to be."
03:38,180;03:40,300;"Good thing Greg is in here."
03:40,300;03:45,120;"He would be taking us on a whole different trajectory of this podcast by arguing"
03:45,120;03:47,720;"about how terrible Kim is or something like that."
03:47,720;03:48,720;"Oh, undoubtedly."
03:48,720;03:48,920;"Yeah."
03:48,920;03:50,200;"Um,"
03:50,200;03:53,080;"God, we're aligned."
03:53,080;03:54,440;"Andy bell checks the best."
03:54,440;03:56,760;"He's awesome coach who really let the most out of camp."
03:56,760;03:57,340;"Right."
03:57,340;03:57,920;"Exactly."
03:57,920;04:03,360;"And almost be a really good Buffalo bills team for the first time in two"
04:03,360;04:08,160;"countries. Yeah. With the bills perspective, you're right. This is probably the biggest"
04:08,160;04:12,440;"Patriots at Bill's game in a lot of their lifetimes. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Let's Lisa, they"
04:12,440;04:15,440;"can remember because they probably had bigger games like the AC Championship game last year"
04:15,440;04:22,320;"was a bigger game than this. But yeah, it means a lot to them. I've been keeping an eye on"
04:22,320;04:30,880;"Bill's social media. And half of them are very confident that the diocese over and the bills"
04:30,880;04:35,920;"are going to stop the life out of the Patriots this week and the Patriots are pretenders."
04:35,920;04:39,440;"And the other half are very nervous."
04:39,440;04:49,160;"I saw a meme today of, you know, the one where Mo is chucking in the Simpsons, Mo, the bartender"
04:49,160;04:53,840;"is chucking, who's the fat drunk out of the bar?"
04:53,840;04:55,600;"Yeah, Barney's chucking out of the bar."
04:55,600;04:59,480;"And then like, all was the next frame you see Barney in the background."
04:59,480;05:00,480;"Yeah."
05:00,480;05:04,560;"It was that, but Mo was the Buffalo Bills last year"
05:04,560;05:06,120;"and the Buffalo Bills this year,"
05:06,120;05:08,440;"but he's like creeping back into it."
05:08,440;05:10,080;"It's like, yeah, that's how they feel."
05:10,080;05:12,880;"They're like, oh, this feels familiar."
05:12,880;05:15,680;"If this game goes wrong, you're shit's gonna fall apart."
05:15,680;05:18,280;"- I mean, like you said, it's me too."
05:18,280;05:19,800;"They've been let down a lot."
05:19,800;05:21,400;"They've been to the games."
05:21,400;05:23,680;"- So here's a Pockwiz for you."
05:23,680;05:26,960;"Can you, do you remember those two games, those two losses?"
05:28,160;05:30,840;"One was the West Welker game raised a ton of yards."
05:30,840;05:31,680;"They still lose it."
05:31,680;05:34,080;"I don't remember at all, but I think we're going to watch soon."
05:34,080;05:38,360;"Yeah, 2011, where Brady threw four touchdowns"
05:38,360;05:40,000;"and also four interceptions."
05:40,000;05:42,760;"And the other one was at the week 17 game"
05:42,760;05:44,400;"where Brady sat the second half."
05:44,400;05:45,640;"That one was at home."
05:45,640;05:46,480;"Nope."
05:46,480;05:48,760;"No, this was a very memorable one."
05:48,760;05:53,680;"This is one that I think Bill's fans still talk about"
05:53,680;05:54,520;"to this day."
05:54,520;05:57,000;"We've done it on this podcast."
05:57,000;06:00,480;"The only other memorable bills moment I can remember is when they do the"
06:00,480;06:02,640;"build on the field, but I'm pretty sure they still lost that game."
06:02,640;06:03,800;"Yeah, though they did."
06:03,800;06:08,120;"No, this is the opening of 2003."
06:08,120;06:09,880;"Oh, yes."
06:09,880;06:10,960;"The Lord Maloy game."
06:10,960;06:11,280;"Yeah."
06:11,280;06:15,520;"And the Sam Adams pick six."
06:15,520;06:19,680;"So I will go on record because this will come out after the game, right?"
06:19,680;06:25,560;"Uh, yeah, this will come out on Tuesday that the Patriots won't lose 31."
06:25,560;06:25,920;"Nothing."
06:26,720;06:28,440;"Okay. You think the pages will win?"
06:28,440;06:30,440;"Not 31, nothing."
06:30,440;06:33,280;"I'm going to go on record."
06:33,280;06:34,400;"I think the pages will win this game."
06:34,400;06:37,320;"I think it'll be real fucking close."
06:37,320;06:40,280;"I think it's going to be a dogfight, but I think they pull it out."
06:40,280;06:43,400;"I just don't think the builders are mentally over it."
06:43,400;06:46,360;"You know, no, one against Kim Newton."
06:46,360;06:47,320;"Money fumbles in the red zone."
06:47,320;06:48,480;"Doesn't mean you're over that hump."
06:48,480;06:48,840;"Yeah."
06:48,840;06:52,920;"All of the, and then they beat the pants off the second"
06:53,320;06:56,680;"stringers at the end of 2020 as well."
06:56,680;06:58,840;"I didn't even watch."
06:58,840;07:00,120;"I knew it was going to be that."
07:00,120;07:02,080;"So."
07:02,080;07:03,400;"But where are we?"
07:03,400;07:06,120;"We are 2004 move on."
07:06,120;07:08,840;"Oh, that feeling we just said they were like, wow, that doesn't really count."
07:08,840;07:11,680;"That's how bills feel about every all those 18s."
07:11,680;07:16,720;"Because there's a lot of them like this game where they just beat the pants off"
07:16,720;07:18,240;"the bills and it wasn't even competitive."
07:18,240;07:19,560;"That. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
07:19,600;07:23,080;"No, the the average margin victory was 2815."
07:23,080;07:24,520;"So almost two touchdowns."
07:24,520;07:26,920;"And this one was 29 six."
07:26,920;07:27,400;"Yes."
07:27,400;07:27,640;"Yes."
07:27,640;07:30,000;"So we're talking this is this is a home game, but this is 20"
07:30,000;07:33,760;"and the 6.4 is the better is because they only scored them"
07:33,760;07:36,320;"on a punt return touchdown and then missed the extra point."
07:36,320;07:36,880;"Yes."
07:36,880;07:37,480;"Yes."
07:37,480;07:39,320;"Well, we'll get to that."
07:39,320;07:40,800;"We will get to that."
07:40,800;07:42,320;"That was my favorite."
07:42,320;07:47,160;"But yes, in the Brady Belichick era, the page 35 and five"
07:47,160;07:51,000;"And the average score of the games was 27.15."
07:51,000;07:54,980;"So they, they generally beat the bills by two touchdowns."
07:54,980;07:57,380;"On these rats are on paths."
07:57,380;07:58,700;"Dynasty.com."
07:58,700;07:59,300;"Correct."
07:59,300;07:59,780;"Yes."
07:59,780;08:00,300;"Nice."
08:00,300;08:01,540;"Nice job, Steve Brown."
08:01,540;08:02,140;"Look at the plug."
08:02,140;08:03,220;"You're own work Andy."
08:03,220;08:04,100;"Always the sales."
08:04,100;08:05,220;"A guy all the time."
08:05,220;08:05,980;"I need that."
08:05,980;08:07,320;"I'm not a hype guy."
08:07,320;08:08,420;"I'm a developer, man."
08:08,420;08:10,220;"I just need a lot of help."
08:10,220;08:12,620;"Oh, yes."
08:12,620;08:13,780;"In a lot of things."
08:13,780;08:14,460;"Yeah."
08:14,460;08:16,320;"I'm just doing my little part."
08:17,020;08:24,020;"Appreciate it one thing I don't need help in is re-watching these games because this is this was just the perfect game for it because"
08:24,020;08:26,660;"We're back in 2004 week 10"
08:26,660;08:28,660;"Patriots"
08:28,660;08:30,660;"I've already beat the bills in week 4"
08:30,660;08:34,580;"31 17 in Buffalo. This is this game is at home"
08:34,580;08:36,900;"last week"
08:36,900;08:45,020;"since it's been a while was the Rams game where we first saw Troy Brown on defense because the page is so"
08:45,020;08:50,540;"banged up in the defensive backfield that they're starting people who are named Earthwin"
08:50,540;08:52,340;"Morland and Randall Gay."
08:52,340;08:53,340;"Oh, yeah."
08:53,340;08:57,060;"Apparently was the starting nickelback at LSU last year."
08:57,060;08:59,260;"I didn't know he was a rookie in this year, but yeah."
08:59,260;09:01,140;"Yeah, he was a rookie."
09:01,140;09:04,940;"But he wasn't even like a starting corner for LSU."
09:04,940;09:06,580;"He was the nickelback at LSU."
09:06,580;09:10,540;"So he wasn't even like, he's a deaf guy at LSU and he's starting on the Patriots."
09:10,540;09:15,540;"The bills could only muster six special things points against this defensive backfield is"
09:15,540;09:17,820;"Oh, and it gets worse too."
09:17,820;09:20,380;"Like this, it gets worse."
09:20,380;09:23,300;"Oh, yeah."
09:23,300;09:31,740;"And the last time the pages lost, I think there were 23 of 24 wins in this stretch was"
09:31,740;09:36,620;"Yeah, a couple of weeks ago, the other doors went off in Pittsburgh on Halloween."
09:36,620;09:43,260;"But this was Monday night, which gives you the A team."
09:43,260;09:44,940;"I actually really like these guys."
09:44,940;09:46,940;"Mike Patrick, Joe Thais and Paul Maguire."
09:46,940;09:48,260;"You like these three?"
09:48,260;09:49,260;"I do."
09:49,260;09:51,980;"And especially in this game, I don't know what it was."
09:51,980;09:53,140;"I have a note here."
09:53,140;09:53,740;"Really?"
09:53,740;09:57,140;"Two of these douches are recently in the Hall of Fame yuck."
09:57,140;09:59,220;"They're not in the Hall of Fame for their commentating."
09:59,220;10:01,900;"That's for goddamn sure."
10:01,900;10:03,860;"I'm going to have to get you a Joe Thaisman jersey."
10:03,860;10:05,660;"Like you guys got me a--"
10:05,660;10:06,620;"What's his name, Jerzy?"
10:06,620;10:11,460;"They're just they'll talk over each other."
10:11,460;10:16,260;"See, that's what they're just pushing storylines instead of actually like"
10:16,260;10:17,300;"commentating on the game."
10:17,300;10:20,940;"They're just being like, they're not actually say what's going on in front of you to make any commentary on that."
10:20,940;10:24,860;"That's why Tony Romo is good because he's like live streams in his head about what's happening."
10:24,860;10:29,260;"These guys don't even pay attention to what goes in the field and they're just talking about Tom Brady's determination."
10:29,260;10:30,260;"It's true."
10:30,260;10:33,420;"But it's like that point to when they make a big stop and they're like, and he's so determined."
10:33,420;10:36,020;"And he goes, the last person to show up and the first person to leave."
10:36,020;10:39,820;"Oops, I mean the other way around and just like, God, you have worse."
10:39,820;10:40,220;"Yes."
10:40,220;10:42,420;"But what was the score at that point where they started bringing on that?"
10:42,420;10:44,340;"Cause this game was a blowout like early."
10:44,340;10:45,860;"It was the whole game."
10:45,860;10:50,260;"It was, it was 20, nothing at halftime and like it, it should have been felt like"
10:50,260;10:51,780;"the Brady Bledsoe."
10:51,780;10:54,660;"And then they shut cut the season cold bear and she's laughing at his mistake."
10:54,660;10:55,060;"Yeah."
10:55,060;10:55,500;"Oh, yeah."
10:55,500;11:02,180;"And Susie Colver too, like I, I feel so bad for her because part of the like the"
11:02,700;11:07,700;"extracurriculars that were going on was that the Red Sox had recently won the World Series."
11:07,700;11:11,860;"And so they had a couple of Red Sox at the game of like celebrating it."
11:11,860;11:14,300;"Like they brought the trophy and everything."
11:14,300;11:18,860;"And they had Kurt Schilling on crutches showing off the World Series."
11:18,860;11:20,700;"- Just got out of the hospital after the place."
11:20,700;11:22,700;"- Yeah, after the surgery and everything."
11:22,700;11:26,100;"Yeah, which he's how far he's fallen, that sucks."
11:26,100;11:28,300;"- Oh, that was, I haven't known, that was peak."
11:28,300;11:29,620;"That was his peak."
11:29,620;11:32,940;"everything else from that moment down here for her."
11:32,940;11:35,220;"- Yeah, and he's-- - That is weak."
11:35,220;11:36,060;"- Yeah, and he's still doing it."
11:36,060;11:36,900;"- And he's still doing it."
11:36,900;11:38,740;"- He's my TV appearance and then it's all just twirl."
11:38,740;11:39,860;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
11:39,860;11:41,380;"He just fell the fuck off."
11:41,380;11:44,300;"And the other guy that was there was Johnny Damon too."
11:44,300;11:46,260;"And so did you catch the interview?"
11:46,260;11:48,900;"It was like towards-- - Oh, dude, it was so bad."
11:48,900;11:53,900;"- Oh, like, I couldn't tell if he was just like dumb"
11:53,900;11:58,780;"or if he was drunk,"
11:58,780;12:00,060;"But I have it here."
12:00,060;12:00,900;"- He's done."
12:00,900;12:01,740;"- He was just drunk."
12:01,740;12:03,580;"He was just dumb and I don't know."
12:03,580;12:05,700;"But listen, 'cause he's like, he's almost slurring,"
12:05,700;12:07,460;"but not quite."
12:07,460;12:10,420;"So let me imagine being his coworker"
12:10,420;12:12,660;"and he's just droning on and on on the clubhouse"
12:12,660;12:13,500;"who play in baseball."
12:13,500;12:14,660;"He's just talking and talking without it."
12:14,660;12:28,220;"Like he went off like three plays and sl"
12:28,220;12:30,900;"We're honored before the game."
12:30,900;12:33,740;"The Patriots won a Super Bowl before your season."
12:33,740;12:35,740;"What kind of motivation was that?"
12:35,740;12:38,100;"Oh, it's a huge motivation because they showed--"
12:38,100;12:38,940;"We're going to play a straight play."
12:38,940;12:41,540;"--or showed to opening day a couple of years ago,"
12:41,540;12:44,460;"throwing out the first pitch, and they showed up again this year."
12:44,460;12:46,700;"And those guys inspire us."
12:46,700;12:49,060;"I mean, they know how to play as a team."
12:49,060;12:52,060;"And that's exactly what we had to do to win a championship."
12:52,060;12:55,820;"So coming out here and supporting them,"
12:55,820;12:57,420;"what we're doing today, Dave, we think"
12:57,420;13:01,220;"the greatest team around and they say nothing."
13:01,220;13:02,060;"- He's saying nothing."
13:02,060;13:02,900;"- We support them."
13:02,900;13:05,140;"New England's a very happy place right now."
13:05,140;13:07,100;"- You know, with so much criticism these days"
13:07,100;13:09,600;"of athletes and selfishness and you mention"
13:09,600;13:11,740;"even the Patriots are so much of that."
13:11,740;13:13,420;"How do you forge that?"
13:13,420;13:15,980;"- Well, you have to look towards the team"
13:15,980;13:18,580;"because that's exactly what wins your championships."
13:18,580;13:21,980;"I mean, look at Kurt Schilling going on at Broken Ankle."
13:21,980;13:24,580;"You don't want to see the pickups that he has."
13:24,580;13:27,580;"You have guys like Orlando Cabrera, Dave Roberts,"
13:27,580;13:29,140;"making that big solo bass."
13:29,140;13:31,580;"And of course we have the big guys, Ortiz, and Manny,"
13:31,580;13:32,060;"and--"
13:32,060;13:33,540;"Almost sounds strong, right?"
13:33,540;13:36,300;"I mean, you have to look at this as a team."
13:36,300;13:38,340;"I mean, there's something very special."
13:38,340;13:39,940;"Keith Fall, Pedro."
13:39,940;13:41,500;"I mean, on and on and on."
13:41,500;13:42,300;"I mean, there's--"
13:42,300;13:42,980;"On and on and on."
13:42,980;13:43,480;"And two."
13:43,480;13:45,140;"15, 16 guys who--"
13:45,140;13:45,660;"Plan number two."
13:45,660;13:46,740;"--could be MVP."
13:46,740;13:48,740;"And that's what makes a great team."
13:48,740;13:52,340;"So I'm very happy of what we accomplished these fans"
13:52,340;13:52,900;"of New England."
13:52,900;13:53,540;"Still going."
13:53,540;13:56,120;"They're the absolutely, they're the best."
13:56,120;13:59,540;"And I mean, this is the best place in the world to play."
13:59,540;14:01,220;"And I mean, they've made me happy."
14:01,220;14:02,940;"I know they've made our teammates very happy."
14:02,940;14:05,900;"And we are very happy that we got to bring a championship"
14:05,900;14:06,860;"to them."
14:06,860;14:08,020;"- Congratulations."
14:08,020;14:08,940;"Enjoy the off-scene."
14:08,940;14:09,940;"- All right, thank you."
14:09,940;14:11,740;"- Thank you very much."
14:11,740;14:13,580;"- Do you see how space at the very end there?"
14:13,580;14:16,540;"Go back like 10 seconds, right when you finish,"
14:16,540;14:18,700;"see, let's off camera?"
14:18,700;14:19,860;"Like, what the fuck was that?"
14:19,860;14:20,700;"Like each of them."
14:20,700;14:22,020;"- Oh yeah."
14:22,020;14:22,860;"- Look at that."
14:22,860;14:24,700;"(laughing)"
14:24,700;14:26,060;"- Rough."
14:26,060;14:26,900;"Rough."
14:26,900;14:28,260;"- He's like, there's 15, 16 guys."
14:28,260;14:30,580;"He named nine of them, including himself."
14:30,580;14:31,420;"- Yeah."
14:31,420;14:33,260;"(laughing)"
14:33,260;14:35,100;"- Oh man, we'll save that so we can go."
14:35,100;14:37,900;"- He's been happy like three, five times in a row."
14:37,900;14:39,380;"- Yeah."
14:39,380;14:42,300;"And he's like, oh, this is the best place to play."
14:42,300;14:43,660;"And then he immediately accepts it."
14:43,660;14:45,660;"- I'm happy and I hope the fans are happy"
14:45,660;14:47,620;"and the team is happy and you like how happy"
14:47,620;14:49,260;"they make us feel happy."
14:49,260;14:50,820;"So it's the happy place."
14:52,460;14:54,580;"and I'm going to the Yankees."
14:54,580;14:57,420;"- That's why Monday night also the worst, terrible production."
14:57,420;15:01,180;"You couldn't see the down in distance on the score clock."
15:01,180;15:03,580;"You know, I was always on the down because I was watching"
15:03,580;15:04,820;"and doing something else."
15:04,820;15:05,660;"- Oh, yeah, yeah."
15:05,660;15:08,420;"- Oh, I thought it was all right."
15:08,420;15:09,260;"I like it."
15:09,260;15:11,660;"I like the, well, they have the Skycam,"
15:11,660;15:12,500;"which is still new."
15:12,500;15:14,540;"- That's like you just have poor choice and commentators"
15:14,540;15:16,060;"because those guys are awful."
15:16,060;15:18,740;"- I think I'm just a connoisseur."
15:18,740;15:22,420;"So I can understand the finer points."
15:22,420;15:24,700;"- And the commentators favor,"
15:24,700;15:26,660;"I'll give them this one bone."
15:26,660;15:30,780;"They call that they're better than the bills defensive coordinator"
15:30,780;15:34,540;"because they called the touchdown to Fourier."
15:34,540;15:36,060;"He's like, ""Oh look at number 88."""
15:36,060;15:37,340;"It's a place where they like to go to him."
15:37,340;15:38,460;"Corey Dillon's off the field,"
15:38,460;15:41,460;"and sure enough, Tom Brady throws a play action"
15:41,460;15:43,420;"to Christian Fourier for the touchdown."
15:43,420;15:45,500;"And they're like, ""Oh wow, great call, Joe."""
15:45,500;15:46,540;"It's like, ""Yeah, he knows it."
15:46,540;15:47,620;"What the hell are you doing?"""
15:47,620;15:49,540;"DC on the bills letting that guy go free."
15:49,540;15:51,500;"- Yeah, fucking brutal."
15:51,500;15:53,700;"- Yeah, who was the coach on this team?"
15:53,700;15:54,900;"- That wasn't like Malarkey."
15:54,900;15:55,740;"- That's the back of the day."
15:55,740;15:57,740;"- That's a bone head bills move."
15:57,740;15:58,620;"- Oh yeah, yeah."
15:58,620;16:02,580;"But yeah, though, I thought the best part"
16:02,580;16:05,420;"about the commentators in this was,"
16:05,420;16:08,180;"I think Paul Maguire just having a bad day or something,"
16:08,180;16:10,420;"but he was getting super snippy with the other two."
16:10,420;16:12,820;"Like they say something, he was like, no, that's wrong."
16:12,820;16:14,860;"And then just like let it hang."
16:14,860;16:16,540;"It was fucking beautiful."
16:16,540;16:17,380;"- It's awkward."
16:17,380;16:18,940;"Yeah, that's the best part."
16:18,940;16:20,140;"I love the awkwardness of it."
16:20,140;16:20,980;"No, I want it."
16:20,980;16:22,300;"So good commentating."
16:22,300;16:23,140;"There was."
16:23,140;16:24,860;"I mean, things about the game that I don't already know."
16:24,860;16:26,500;"These guys don't even know the game."
16:26,500;16:28,020;"No, Joe Thaisman does."
16:28,020;16:30,700;"Joe Thaisman was the original Tony Romo, dude."
16:30,700;16:32,940;"No, Joe Thaisman, so bad."
16:32,940;16:34,420;"And he came in here because the other two guys"
16:34,420;16:35,660;"are bitching about who's right,"
16:35,660;16:37,260;"about if that was the right color or not, three places."
16:37,260;16:38,580;"That's true."
16:38,580;16:42,700;"To be fair, they did, they were legitimately pissed off"
16:42,700;16:47,420;"about the rough in the past on Rodney for him."
16:47,420;16:50,220;"- Which nowadays, 100% rushing the road."
16:50,220;16:51,900;"- Oh yeah, it definitely was."
16:51,900;16:52,740;"- It was."
16:52,740;16:53,820;"- The ladder these days."
16:53,820;16:55,060;"- Yeah, it was the buff the news."
16:55,060;16:55,900;"It was awkward."
16:55,900;16:57,260;"- Oh yeah."
16:57,260;16:59,020;"- But it just put it stuck in the ground"
16:59,020;17:00,060;"that was a blown knee."
17:00,060;17:02,300;"- Yeah, so let's just talk about the scoring"
17:02,300;17:03,220;"this real quick."
17:03,220;17:08,260;"Patriot, first quarter, nothing really happened."
17:08,260;17:11,020;"Past kicked the field goal, no big deal."
17:11,020;17:13,860;"And then there's a bunch of boneheaded bills moves"
17:13,860;17:14,860;"in the first quarter."
17:14,860;17:15,980;"What are you talking about?"
17:15,980;17:17,580;"- All right, give them to me."
17:17,580;17:19,580;"I have, this is my new thing."
17:19,580;17:21,540;"Every time you play the bills,"
17:21,540;17:23,140;"they do a bunch of boneheaded things"
17:23,140;17:25,540;"that you just like, that's just, what are you doing?"
17:25,540;17:26,380;"- Your bills."
17:26,380;17:27,660;"- Your bills first kick of the game,"
17:27,660;17:29,700;"the return to catch is it and runs in the end zone."
17:29,700;17:30,820;"And the rest are like, we'll start that"
17:30,820;17:32,260;"at the one yard line."
17:32,260;17:33,740;"Then they review it for 10 minutes."
17:33,740;17:34,740;"- And they had to challenge it."
17:34,740;17:35,580;"- Yeah."
17:35,580;17:38,540;"- The bills had to challenge it to be a touch back."
17:38,540;17:39,380;"- And it's a challenge."
17:39,380;17:40,980;"like way to kill the woman."
17:40,980;17:42,140;"I'm like, Oh, it's Monday night."
17:42,140;17:42,640;"Let's go."
17:42,640;17:44,480;"And then I first kick off."
17:44,480;17:46,180;"We're going to have a 10 minute review."
17:46,180;17:46,820;"Yeah."
17:46,820;17:49,020;"Oh, oh, terrible."
17:49,020;17:51,080;"But why even put that on the board bills?"
17:51,080;17:52,020;"Like, right?"
17:52,020;17:53,060;"It's going ahead and move."
17:53,060;17:53,820;"It's 10."
17:53,820;17:55,580;"And oh, yeah, go ahead."
17:55,580;17:58,020;"They get their first possession."
17:58,020;18:01,220;"And they do a 24 year punk to the 10 yard line."
18:01,220;18:01,620;"That's true."
18:01,620;18:04,620;"Oh, well, even before that, though,"
18:04,620;18:06,300;"they tried to do a flea flicker."
18:06,300;18:11,560;"But the Patriots rushed so well that they were standing next to Drew"
18:11,560;18:14,560;"Bledsoe when whoever it was, the running back went to turn around"
18:14,560;18:16,920;"the Patriots. So it was like, fuck it, and kept it and still in"
18:16,920;18:18,880;"the blank running for 10, 12 yards."
18:18,880;18:20,840;"That was actually a good play by Will."
18:20,840;18:24,360;"This was Will's McGatie's fourth start, I think it was."
18:24,360;18:28,360;"And his other three starts this season, he had all rushed for 100 yards."
18:28,360;18:31,640;"And he was the guy towards ACL in college, right?"
18:31,640;18:32,520;"Yeah. Yep."
18:32,520;18:34,340;"So this was, I think this is a"
18:34,340;18:36,440;"You're going to have after you've tracked it."
18:36,440;18:38,700;"You must have sat up the first year."
18:38,700;18:40,240;"I feel like something like that."
18:40,240;18:40,640;"Yeah."
18:40,640;18:45,100;"So this is his first time seeing the field after the first round pick."
18:45,100;18:46,260;"Yep."
18:46,260;18:47,860;"Yeah."
18:47,860;18:50,360;"Um, but yeah."
18:50,360;18:51,280;"So, and then you're right."
18:51,280;18:53,520;"They drove to the New England 35 and punted."
18:53,520;18:55,920;"It's a good start with it."
18:55,920;18:59,420;"Like as a fourth and four, too, like, yeah, you're, you're, you're, you're,"
18:59,420;19:02,680;"you're always, you know, Patre's a better team."
19:02,680;19:03,740;"Like the Titans, we played it down."
19:03,740;19:06,180;"they were going for on fourth in the red zone a lot. Yeah."
19:06,180;19:09,020;"But next to a brush draw on the defense to see if they can convert."
19:09,020;19:10,060;"So you have to. Yeah."
19:10,060;19:13,660;"Scare play calling and then they punt it 24 yards to the 10 and like"
19:13,660;19:17,180;"immediately Corey Dilling gets the ball and ripses over the hole."
19:17,180;19:19,500;"No one touches 70 like rolls on the ground for the first down."
19:19,500;19:27,060;"So yeah, I think this game, it felt like the page is driving up and down the field."
19:27,060;19:29,420;"They had like a two to one"
19:31,780;19:37,940;"advantage in like a time of possession like they just ran the ball of will because this"
19:37,940;19:42,420;"supposed to be a good bills defense too. They had the bills defense was sort of like the"
19:42,420;19:47,540;"Patriots defense of the I don't care what you get between the 20s but in the red zone they're"
19:47,540;19:52,180;"pretty good in the red zone. Well no this year there were they were they're almost like this"
19:52,180;20:00,580;"year's Patriots where they they were giving up 268 total yards per game which is phenomenal."
20:01,540;20:07,300;"And then they gave up 273 in the first half of this one and over 400, which is the first time"
20:07,300;20:09,860;"this bill's defense had given up 400 yards"
20:09,860;20:19,140;"since two years ago against the pets. Yeah, the inventory kicked the 20, 24, and 27 yard field"
20:19,140;20:23,540;"they did good in the red zone. That's sure they did. The defense kept a minute as best they could."
20:23,540;20:28,660;"They gave a bunch of yards. They had nowhere on the field for twice as long. And their offense was"
20:30,180;20:31,560;"- Rosis."
20:31,560;20:35,620;"- I don't think that's a strong enough word, Steve."
20:35,620;20:40,200;"It was, let me give you this stat line."
20:40,200;20:42,860;"Drew blood cells passing."
20:42,860;20:48,940;"19 attempts, eight completions, 76 yards,"
20:48,940;20:51,940;"three interceptions, two sacks."
20:51,940;20:53,780;"- How many completions?"
20:53,780;20:54,620;"- Eight."
20:54,620;20:55,460;"- Eight of 19."
20:55,460;20:56,700;"- And yet three interceptions."
20:56,700;20:57,540;"- Yeah."
20:58,940;21:02,340;"hot. Yeah. And this is coming into this game against Earth,"
21:02,340;21:04,140;"Wind, Moreland and Randall Gay."
21:04,140;21:08,340;"And Troy Brown playing a lot of corners."
21:08,340;21:11,940;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's safeties where in there Harrison"
21:11,940;21:13,540;"and he played especially well."
21:13,540;21:18,040;"And Eugene was an interception on a terrible ball by Drew."
21:18,040;21:19,640;"Yeah. On a deep ball."
21:19,640;21:22,440;"Yes. The bars didn't even drop the clean pick six."
21:22,440;21:25,740;"That was that. Like this game could have been way out of hand."
21:25,740;21:27,440;"This was what I'm saying. It should have been."
21:27,440;21:29,440;"and he catches that take six."
21:29,440;21:31,120;"Yeah."
21:31,120;21:37,240;"Yeah, if you convert any one of the one, two, three, four, five"
21:37,240;21:40,880;"military field goals for a touchdown, it's over."
21:40,880;21:42,320;"But they only see."
21:42,320;21:43,400;"It was a harmony over."
21:43,400;21:44,360;"Yeah, exactly."
21:44,360;21:45,600;"But yeah, it's even more over."
21:45,600;21:49,560;"They didn't even get any offensive points."
21:49,560;21:53,120;"No, not even from the two yard line."
21:53,120;21:54,400;"Right."
21:55,160;21:59,360;"So yeah, both the Patriots touchdowns came in the second quarter."
21:59,360;22:01,280;"A couple of Brady touchdown passes."
22:01,280;22:04,720;"The one to patent was nice because it took them a while to find"
22:04,720;22:05,720;"anybody was wide open."
22:05,720;22:06,520;"Yeah."
22:06,520;22:06,880;"Yeah."
22:06,880;22:09,200;"And then before he actually won was a nice, nice play."
22:09,200;22:12,320;"You like big block on the spell down and got up and got up and got touched."
22:12,320;22:12,520;"Yeah."
22:12,520;22:13,200;"Yeah."
22:13,200;22:14,080;"So that was nice."
22:14,080;22:20,280;"Um, and that was those were sandwiched between a, a brew ski interception of"
22:20,480;22:21,180;"True blood. So."
22:21,180;22:26,020;"Which is the second one and a half on top of the Eugene Wilson one you mentioned."
22:26,020;22:30,360;"And actually it was like, you know, the the page had strove down, scored touchdown"
22:30,360;22:32,920;"with not a lot of time left like right around two minutes and then."
22:32,920;22:36,360;"Blood so immediately gets picked off like two plays later."
22:36,360;22:39,080;"And so the page is not like another two minute drive when they go down and score"
22:39,080;22:40,280;"another touchdown."
22:40,280;22:43,560;"And so now it was six nothing and now it's 20 and nothing and half time"
22:43,560;22:45,040;"this game's over. Fucking done."
22:45,040;22:49,080;"It always died. I mean, yeah, I was the fourth starter."
22:49,080;22:53,960;"I mean, because then the third quarter of the Patriots started the field goal and then"
22:53,960;23:00,840;"nothing happens a bunch of three and outs until Buffalo returned the punt for a seven-year touchdown."
23:00,840;23:06,680;"Went for a two-point conversion and that's the one that Rodney Harrison had the roughing the"
23:06,680;23:12,200;"passer because he dove and hit true blood. So right above the knees, like right on those"
23:12,760;23:17,460;"like five pads and it looked awkward. So like that probably hurt because"
23:17,460;23:21,220;"bloods out like had to jump in his knees went back. It was awkward as fuck."
23:21,220;23:25,500;"So I got the call and they went for a two point conversion again."
23:25,500;23:27,780;"And the one still failed. Yeah."
23:27,780;23:30,960;"Tried to run up the middle with Will's McGay and I think he lost two yards."
23:30,960;23:32,140;"Like it was even close."
23:32,140;23:36,060;"It wasn't close. Well, they they crushed Will's again."
23:36,060;23:39,900;"He he must have been super hot coming in. He had 2.6 yards per carry."
23:39,900;23:42,460;"Yeah. He was. That's why I withdrew. It was so bad because"
23:42,460;23:46,200;"They shut down the run so effectively early that it was all in passing"
23:46,200;23:47,360;"I felt that kind of bad again"
23:47,360;23:51,060;"I still bad for doing these games because he had no help from the run game"
23:51,060;23:55,760;"No, I'm and and his guys were dropping like even if he did put the ball in their hands"
23:55,760;24:00,220;"They were dropping like big plays like third and fourth down conversions were getting dropped"
24:00,220;24:03,300;"And it's just like a typical like poor drew blood so game"
24:03,300;24:06,120;"You're right. It wasn't a lot of it wasn't his fault, but"
24:06,120;24:09,240;"Then you turn around"
24:09,240;24:11,240;"All of the interceptions were bad as well."
24:11,240;24:12,080;"- You drew that bad as well."
24:12,080;24:14,800;"- That Eugene Wilson was a bad bro for sure."
24:14,800;24:16,240;"- Yeah, that may have been like a miscommunication"
24:16,240;24:17,080;"on the route too."
24:17,080;24:19,560;"- All right, he didn't even see Teddy Brisky."
24:19,560;24:20,560;"- Yeah, didn't see Teddy Brisky."
24:20,560;24:22,400;"And then the last one,"
24:22,400;24:24,720;"this is what Greg was teasing in the last episode"
24:24,720;24:26,400;"that I had forgotten about."
24:26,400;24:30,960;"But this is the druest of Drew Bledso,"
24:30,960;24:35,960;"the Bledsoist play where he is picked off by none other"
24:36,720;24:41,120;"then his former favorite receiver, Troy Brown, to start the fourth quarter."
24:41,120;24:41,800;"He's couldn't help."
24:41,800;24:43,200;"He's couldn't help voted to him."
24:43,200;24:44,360;"Couldn't help so natural."
24:44,360;24:44,760;"Yeah."
24:44,760;24:45,840;"He's like, I recognize him."
24:45,840;24:46,840;"He should have."
24:46,840;24:48,400;"Has he thrown a Troy Brown in his career?"
24:48,400;24:50,680;"Oh, good question."
24:50,680;24:53,080;"But ton, you know, yeah, I bet."
24:53,080;24:57,440;"Brown's drafted in like 97, 98."
24:57,440;25:03,000;"Uh, yeah, around then maybe around and blood cell was right around there, too."
25:03,000;25:04,040;"Yeah."
25:04,040;25:09,400;"And Troy, I'd be ecstatic by the time Brady came on his well established as awesome."
25:09,400;25:09,960;"Yeah."
25:09,960;25:12,840;"You probably play with Ben Coats."
25:12,840;25:13,960;"Oh, Troy."
25:13,960;25:15,400;"Yeah, do you think?"
25:15,400;25:16,200;"Oh, yeah, I think so."
25:16,200;25:17,080;"I think I'm glad."
25:17,080;25:19,000;"Bloods, whole love Ben Coats."
25:19,000;25:20,280;"Yeah, let's see."
25:20,280;25:22,200;"Troy Brown."
25:22,200;25:25,480;"I don't know who was the starting tight end on the bills."
25:25,480;25:26,520;"I said his name at the beginning."
25:26,520;25:28,920;"I've been really forgot it because it was not forgettable."
25:28,920;25:30,120;"Yeah, it was nobody worth."
25:30,120;25:31,720;"There's no Ben Coats in Buffalo."
25:31,720;25:40,040;"Tribragg got drafted in '93. Oh, geez. Yeah, it's been around for '93 to 2007. That's a hell of a career."
25:40,040;25:50,600;"So let's see, '93. Drew Bledsoe was the quarterback backed up by Scott Seacules and Scott Zolak."
25:50,600;25:55,640;"The leading Russia was Leonard Russell with a thousand yards."
25:57,320;26:01,640;"Let's see the leading receiver was Ben Coates."
26:01,640;26:08,880;"659 yards a touchdowns because Ben Coates 91 through 2000."
26:08,880;26:10,840;"So yeah, they definitely overlapped."
26:10,840;26:13,080;"You're never going to be able to figure out how many completions."
26:13,080;26:17,480;"But whatever it is, add at least one because Troy got another completion from Drew."
26:17,480;26:21,320;"And do you see his face and his running off the field?"
26:21,320;26:24,720;"That is the most hype I've ever seen Troy Brown ever."
26:25,040;26:27,400;"He was kind of a flat line guy, you know."
26:27,400;26:27,960;"Yeah."
26:27,960;26:31,720;"No, that smile was just light up the whole state."
26:31,720;26:32,720;"Electric."
26:32,720;26:34,360;"Oh, electric."
26:34,360;26:35,320;"Yep."
26:35,320;26:38,040;"Maximum stuff."
26:38,040;26:38,600;"That was awesome."
26:38,600;26:39,960;"Oh, it was so good."
26:39,960;26:41,600;"I love that."
26:41,600;26:44,240;"When you put that highlight, make sure you capture his whole."
26:44,240;26:45,080;"Oh, yeah."
26:45,080;26:46,640;"Oh, no, the highlight goes for the full."
26:46,640;26:46,880;"Yeah."
26:46,880;26:47,520;"Everything."
26:47,520;26:50,040;"It's it's top notch."
26:50,040;26:51,360;"It's like the perfect."
26:51,360;26:52,800;"It's the epitome Troy Brown, too."
26:53,440;26:56,080;"Cause he was just in the right spot, good coverage."
26:56,080;27:01,520;"And then it was a bad throw by, um, Drew Bledsoe and just put it like right"
27:01,520;27:02,640;"on Troy Brown's hands."
27:02,640;27:06,440;"I actually returned it for a good, like 15, 20 yards."
27:06,440;27:06,640;"Yeah."
27:06,640;27:10,400;"Is number 80, number 80, it was covering the number 80 because he was covering"
27:10,400;27:11,160;"Eric and mold state."
27:11,160;27:11,320;"Yeah."
27:11,320;27:11,880;"Exactly."
27:11,880;27:12,520;"Scrubs."
27:12,520;27:13,240;"No."
27:13,240;27:13,440;"Yeah."
27:13,440;27:14,560;"He was covering like a little."
27:14,560;27:18,120;"Eric holds, but I'm like a heat run, like into the formation, then back out, he"
27:18,120;27:21,560;"did like a pretty hard route to cover and tried to mirror it."
27:21,560;27:23,320;"He was in his back pocket the whole way through."
27:23,320;27:24,520;"Yeah, it's fantastic."
27:24,520;27:25,520;"Yeah."
27:25,520;27:27,720;"I know the trout over on this a million pounds."
27:27,720;27:30,220;"All right, let's see."
27:30,220;27:31,420;"Uh, okay, here you go."
27:31,420;27:32,920;"True blood."
27:32,920;27:35,120;"So Troy Brown, 266 receptions."
27:35,120;27:37,120;"So call it 267."
27:37,120;27:37,620;"Seven."
27:37,620;27:37,820;"Yeah."
27:37,820;27:38,620;"Perfect."
27:38,620;27:40,920;"There you go."
27:40,920;27:43,120;"Oh boy."
27:43,120;27:48,520;"Um, unfortunately, that was short lifts that interception because"
27:48,520;27:53,120;"Brady was, I think it was maybe two plays later was picked off"
27:53,120;28:00,000;"point eight clemons. And this is where the rest of bloods was"
28:00,000;28:03,760;"often kind of failed them because they were they're all like"
28:03,760;28:05,640;"the page is 30 or something like that. They were like deep"
28:05,640;28:08,280;"inside and then went for it on because they're down, you"
28:08,280;28:12,580;"know, 29 to six at this point or 26 to six. So they have"
28:12,580;28:15,440;"score touchdowns, went for it on third and seven. And a guy"
28:15,440;28:19,160;"dropped it went for it on fourth and seven. And who was it?"
28:19,160;28:22,640;"Lee Evans maybe made the catch, but like jumped up to make"
28:22,640;28:24,520;"the catch and came down out of bounds,"
28:24,520;28:27,120;"even though he didn't have to jump and just like,"
28:27,120;28:28,680;"so turn over and dance."
28:28,680;28:29,680;"And then that was it."
28:29,680;28:30,680;"- I skipped that part."
28:30,680;28:32,800;"I was like, ""Bosing ending, nothing."""
28:32,800;28:35,080;"This, they're off and sucks."
28:35,080;28:37,880;"- Yeah, I look at the pages drive and it was all Corey,"
28:37,880;28:39,920;"Dylan, Corey, Dylan, Corey, Dylan, Kevin,"
28:39,920;28:41,440;"Kevin, Corey, Kevin, Corey."
28:41,440;28:43,980;"- Exactly, right, now this works."
28:43,980;28:46,280;"- Right. - Venetary,"
28:46,280;28:48,480;"they'll go from the Buffalo 20."
28:48,480;28:49,320;"- Exactly, yeah."
28:49,320;28:51,800;"And then now we're officially in garbage time."
28:51,800;28:54,440;"The pay bill's bring in there"
28:54,440;28:59,060;"Their savior for the future JP lost man who they had just drafted out of"
28:59,060;29:02,080;"First round out of Tulane. That's what it was. Yep"
29:02,080;29:10,560;"And he was like mediocre at Tulane he threw like 30 something touchdowns like 17 interceptions or something like that. Okay"
29:10,560;29:15,240;"But yeah, so yeah blood so just"
29:15,240;29:18,200;"Did not have a good day"
29:18,320;29:21,280;"The end of 1976 yards and three interceptions"
29:21,280;29:24,820;"What was their totally yards?"
29:24,820;29:29,180;"Their total yards in this game"
29:29,180;29:35,280;"You want to you want to give me a ballpark give me guess 150 less"
29:35,280;29:42,760;"Tough cuz Corey Dylan ran for 151 yards. That's well. That was my baron. I was like the Corey bill about came the whole team"
29:42,760;29:44,320;"He did"
29:44,320;29:48,520;"By 26 yards they had a total 125 yards total"
29:48,520;29:54,720;"Well, I guess Corey Dillon had 156 because he has five yards of seating as well. They rushed for"
29:54,720;29:58,320;"50 yards and had"
29:58,320;30:01,440;"75 night passing yards a few"
30:01,440;30:04,080;"Factor in sacks and stuff"
30:04,080;30:05,840;"Oh"
30:05,840;30:07,840;"Corey down was a beast in this game"
30:07,840;30:10,600;"Yeah, and he was like good"
30:10,600;30:14,960;"He kept getting, he would get the edge and then like, wow, look at that big dude move."
30:14,960;30:19,320;"And he would just turn up field and you could just, you could sense the fear and the defensive"
30:19,320;30:20,320;"backs."
30:20,320;30:21,320;"Yeah."
30:21,320;30:22,760;"And then that safety coming over and trying to hit him."
30:22,760;30:23,760;"Yeah."
30:23,760;30:25,520;"I'm not having a good day because we're doing this."
30:25,520;30:26,520;"Right."
30:26,520;30:30,840;"Well, they actually had a quote by lawyer, Malloy talking about coming into this game."
30:30,840;30:32,720;"He's like talking about Corey Dillon."
30:32,720;30:35,800;"He's like, uh, us defensive backs."
30:35,800;30:40,000;"Like when you go tackle Corey Dillon, you have to want to hit him."
30:40,000;30:41,680;"Otherwise you have no chance."
30:41,680;30:43,560;"Like you have to want to do it."
30:43,560;30:45,680;"Otherwise he's just gonna run you over like you're not there."
30:45,680;30:46,960;"- That's exactly what happened."
30:46,960;30:49,600;"- He looks bigger than six one 225."
30:49,600;30:52,000;"But at this point that's an NFL linebacker."
30:52,000;30:56,080;"- Right, six one 225, that's still a, I mean 225 is a big boy."
30:56,080;30:57,000;"But yeah."
30:57,000;30:59,120;"- It really caruses him around there."
30:59,120;30:59,960;"- Probably."
30:59,960;31:02,360;"- They also look way bigger"
31:02,360;31:03,720;"'cause they're wearing the big old shoulder pads"
31:03,720;31:04,560;"back in the day."
31:04,560;31:06,240;"- Yeah, that's exactly what they're doing."
31:06,240;31:07,720;"- Everybody looks way more massive."
31:07,720;31:08,920;"- They do, yeah."
31:08,920;31:10,420;"Yeah, everybody's more like"
31:10,420;31:10,920;"nowadays."
31:10,920;31:11,780;"It's like NFL blitz."
31:11,780;31:12,660;"Couldn't you put in a color"
31:12,660;31:14,260;"where you make the dude super massive?"
31:14,260;31:14,700;"Yeah."
31:14,700;31:15,200;"Yeah."
31:15,200;31:18,380;"Well, I mean, they were already"
31:18,380;31:19,340;"still pretty massive."
31:19,340;31:20,500;"You went out to go, but yeah,"
31:20,500;31:21,980;"that was a fun breaking."
31:21,980;31:24,440;"Just power bombing people after the play."
31:24,440;31:24,980;"So good."
31:24,980;31:25,540;"Yeah."
31:25,540;31:26,980;"JP loss wins that line."
31:26,980;31:28,860;"One for two five yards with an"
31:28,860;31:30,340;"interception and a sack, which"
31:30,340;31:31,900;"she dropped the ball in that sack to"
31:31,900;31:32,420;"right."
31:32,420;31:32,740;"Yeah."
31:32,740;31:33,100;"Yeah."
31:33,100;31:34,420;"Fumbled that which to cover by the"
31:34,420;31:34,940;"Patriots."
31:34,940;31:37,900;"Not a good day."
31:38,140;31:41,340;"Well, he had been asking here is that he had one rush for five yards, did."
31:41,340;31:42,340;"Yes."
31:42,340;31:44,980;"So he had 10 total yards in his first ever."
31:44,980;31:50,260;"And the page is finished with 428 total yards against the bills."
31:50,260;31:54,300;"Defense who was averaging when I say 230 yards."
31:54,300;31:55,980;"Yeah, they ate them up to 68 per game."
31:55,980;31:58,100;"Corey Dillows are running and then they had no chance."
31:58,100;32:01,660;"And Brady was playing similar with Mac Jones is doing now or he's just hitting the"
32:01,660;32:02,260;"play action."
32:02,260;32:02,940;"Yep."
32:02,940;32:05,460;"We'll go back to the quick guys and run with it."
32:05,780;32:08,900;"Yep. And the bills had not given up a hundred yard rush of this season."
32:08,900;32:10,820;"That ended as well."
32:10,820;32:17,620;"Time mainly because I'll gain their offense by a significant margin."
32:17,620;32:20,900;"Corey Dillon gained 42 yards on the first drive."
32:20,900;32:23,540;"Spucking set in the tone."
32:23,540;32:24,820;"Using best."
32:24,820;32:30,020;"Yeah. Yeah. It was great. Another stat that I actually know will save that."
32:31,780;32:36,700;"But yeah, this is a fucking crazy ass defensive backfield."
32:36,700;32:39,420;"There's just the names in here."
32:39,420;32:41,860;"No time because you're you're top two starting."
32:41,860;32:43,540;"Cornerbacks are out."
32:43,540;32:45,900;"Tyla and Tyrone pool, both out."
32:45,900;32:48,260;"It's not that Samuel was kind of I don't even think he was."
32:48,260;32:50,340;"They said he was starting, but I didn't see him."
32:50,340;32:54,820;"So you're starting Randall Gay and Earthwood, Moreland and Troy Brown"
32:54,820;32:57,780;"as your three defensive backs."
32:57,780;33:01,660;"And the front seven was just so good that it didn't matter."
33:01,660;33:10,740;"But I think we talked a bit about JP Lostman, his interception that he threw to Telebanta"
33:10,740;33:16,180;"Kane. We had a Telebanta Kane sighting. He had a sack in this game and interception. So"
33:16,180;33:17,180;"sign of things to come."
33:17,180;33:21,420;"Like, let's a little bit, yeah. Look him up real quick. I want to know how tall he is"
33:21,420;33:24,180;"because he looked a whole lot shorter than anybody else in that field."
33:24,180;33:25,580;"He's always looking short. I remember."
33:25,580;33:29,540;"He was not a big dude. And all, yeah, he's always wearing 48, too. So you know, he's not"
33:29,540;33:30,540;"like a weird number."
33:30,540;33:34,700;"He's not a star. He's definitely a special teams first guy because he's in the 40"
33:34,700;33:36,820;"I mean have we even had a number 48 since"
33:36,820;33:42,920;"I don't know about 48 he's 6 2 2 50"
33:42,920;33:48,060;"Jesus I found heavier than Corey Dylan and an inch taller. Yeah, so he's bigger than Corey Dillon"
33:48,060;33:54,200;"And yet he's dwarfed by the rest of the even tiny little linebacker that point that those times again right now"
33:54,200;33:59,820;"Yeah, no big NFL linebacker. Yeah, but back then he was dwarfed by literally everybody else on that field"
34:00,060;34:02,060;"It was ridiculous"
34:02,060;34:06,460;"But yeah, so the interception was fantastic is JP Lawson rolls out"
34:06,460;34:14,120;"They supposed to be this like athletic ish quarterback who you know gunslinger Brett far sort of thing"
34:14,120;34:16,500;"and he"
34:16,500;34:19,520;"throws it probably three yards directly into"
34:19,520;34:22,140;"telebantic games chest"
34:22,140;34:25,320;"Who was also rolling out with them like just let me just throw it to him"
34:25,320;34:29,340;"Three yards. I didn't see this interception actually I was"
34:29,340;34:33,660;"game because it was so bad. It was unbelievably bad."
34:33,660;34:39,660;"And now I'm interested. I'm going to go on to padsdynac.com and watch that highlight."
34:39,660;34:43,820;"Yeah, I'll make sure it's up there. You should put on there before we do these things because"
34:43,820;34:47,580;"sometimes Greg doesn't watch any of these games. Oh, I actually watched the highlights."
34:47,580;34:52,060;"We're talking about it. We're talking about them. Well, if there's not many, I will, but there"
34:52,060;34:57,340;"was like 20 different highlights in this game. So they're still uploading as we're doing this."
34:57,980;35:01,340;"It takes a while. Oh my goodness. Yeah, I'm gonna stay up to my"
35:01,340;35:05,580;"Yeah, yeah, there was a lot of highlights for so many highlights"
35:05,580;35:11,820;"So many like even though just the big Corey Dillon runs you have like a whole like four or five"
35:11,820;35:16,700;"Separate 10 plus yard runs. We're running over people and all sorts of stuff"
35:16,700;35:22,860;"Ridiculous. All right. What else we got in here? I do best and worse"
35:22,860;35:25,980;"And similar as bottom here. Yeah, I think of uh"
35:27,340;35:32,060;"You got to touch on all my things here. So, you know, your typical bills game,"
35:32,060;35:37,660;"Patriots, run up the score even without a defensive backfield."
35:37,660;35:42,300;"Yeah. All right. Give me your best and worst, Steve."
35:42,300;35:47,820;"You go first. I always go first. You want me to go first? Okay. I'm going to take all your best,"
35:47,820;35:52,220;"though. No, you're not. I had a million bests. All right."
35:53,020;35:54,820;"There's a lot in this game that you can pick."
35:54,820;35:58,660;"I liked the."
35:58,660;36:02,620;"They were kind of like interviewing Tom Brady,"
36:02,620;36:04,380;"but they'd obviously done before the game,"
36:04,380;36:05,780;"but like kept into spursing it."
36:05,780;36:08,380;"And one of the things was that."
36:08,380;36:13,140;"So they just draw they sprinkled in a couple of like interesting fact toys."
36:13,140;36:15,220;"One of them was that his teammates call him Mr. Wonderful."
36:15,220;36:17,580;"Which I."
36:17,580;36:19,940;"Yeah, that sounded corny as fuck."
36:19,940;36:22,780;"Yeah, but I feel like I've seen that somewhere."
36:22,780;36:30,460;"where like in his, I don't know if it's like his pro football reference."
36:30,460;36:35,460;"Now it's not in there. It's somewhere. Oh, Jesus."
36:35,460;36:39,300;"Because pro football reference will have like the name and then like in parentheses"
36:39,300;36:41,140;"will have all the nicknames for the people."
36:41,140;36:46,020;"So, but I've seen the Mr. Wonderful somewhere."
36:46,020;36:48,980;"It's like Susie Colbert saying, so I didn't trust it."
36:48,980;36:50,940;"I want to hear it out in Brady's mouth before I believe that."
36:51,260;36:54,380;"That's fair, but I mean, it's something somebody called."
36:54,380;36:56,980;"So Tom Bernal sorts of things."
36:56,980;36:58,220;"He just doesn't know it."
36:58,220;37:02,100;"But here's the list of Tom Brady's current."
37:02,100;37:06,340;"Nicknames on pro football reference."
37:06,340;37:10,900;"TV 12, obviously, Tom terrific."
37:10,900;37:14,060;"Touchdown Tom, don't really know."
37:14,060;37:15,020;"I go to."
37:15,020;37:17,700;"Yeah, which that's not really a nickname."
37:17,700;37:19,180;"It's just the greatest of all time."
37:19,180;37:21,180;"I guess it's the note, but all right."
37:21,180;37:22,860;"- Here's where it gets weird."
37:22,860;37:24,460;"The pharaoh."
37:24,460;37:25,460;"- I don't remember that one."
37:25,460;37:27,060;"- I've never heard that one."
37:27,060;37:28,060;"Come back, kid."
37:28,060;37:30,020;"- Yeah."
37:30,020;37:31,340;"- Yeah, like that was kind of like an early one."
37:31,340;37:32,540;"- We first started coming back about,"
37:32,540;37:33,780;"actually call them that."
37:33,780;37:34,880;"- Or?"
37:34,880;37:35,820;"- Or?"
37:35,820;37:36,660;"- Sir."
37:36,660;37:38,780;"- I guess I are."
37:38,780;37:39,620;"- Yep."
37:39,620;37:41,020;"- I'm not gonna know that one."
37:41,020;37:43,720;"- That's not a nickname, that's just like,"
37:43,720;37:45,340;"- Yeah, it's an annotation."
37:45,340;37:46,180;"- Yeah, exactly."
37:46,180;37:48,700;"That's just what you call, yeah, I don't know."
37:48,700;37:50,700;"It's a side of respect, maybe."
37:50,700;37:51,700;"Hello, sir."
37:51,700;37:54,700;"You're a victim, but I don't remember anyone calling them Sir Brady."
37:54,700;37:55,700;"No."
37:55,700;37:58,700;"I mean, I don't hate it."
37:58,700;37:59,700;"It's not bad."
37:59,700;38:00,700;"Sir Brady."
38:00,700;38:01,700;"Yeah."
38:01,700;38:02,700;"Yeah."
38:02,700;38:03,700;"The brave, sir Brady."
38:03,700;38:04,700;"Yeah."
38:04,700;38:06,700;"If you call him Tom Brady, McNanon, it's actually Sir Brady."
38:06,700;38:08,700;"They're correcting people Andy."
38:08,700;38:09,700;"I'm sorry."
38:09,700;38:10,700;"I'm sorry."
38:10,700;38:12,700;"It's the pharaoh to go into pro football reference.com."
38:12,700;38:13,700;"He prefers to call sir."
38:13,700;38:18,700;"- I'm sorry, he's always a Mr. Wonderful to me."
38:18,700;38:25,700;"But this, the other fun tidbits in this was that"
38:25,700;38:30,700;"at this point in his career in 2004,"
38:30,700;38:35,700;"he has more Super Bowl MVPs than he does Pro Bowls in his career,"
38:35,700;38:36,700;"which is interesting."
38:36,700;38:38,700;"- Kind of crazy about that."
38:38,700;38:39,700;"- I think he's a great guy."
38:39,700;38:40,700;"- I think he's a great guy."
38:40,700;38:54,100;"which is interesting. Kind of crazy to think about. Like he just, you know, assuming he goes this year, so you, yeah, he would have to think that he doesn't win Superbell MVP. So it evens up."
38:54,100;39:00,700;"Maybe. Yeah, we'll see. We know who wins Superbell MVP Andy. Yeah, we don't know if he wins a promo though."
39:00,700;39:03,500;"I'm assuming it goes to Pro Bowl this year."
39:03,500;39:05,500;"I"
39:05,500;39:13,140;"Should have gone the first two years. Oh, but first you didn't come on to laugh way. I did go in 2001"
39:13,140;39:16,780;"I don't think you did I don't know"
39:16,780;39:21,880;"Yeah, I know you did when he went in what 2003 yeah, cuz remember 2001 like the only"
39:21,880;39:26,620;"There was a bunch of snubs because I was him and there was Troy Brown did making it either"
39:26,620;39:31,060;"Even though he went in now three which makes sense. Yeah, yeah"
39:31,700;39:33,020;"And then it goes again in 2004."
39:33,020;39:34,660;"And then it goes again, I don't know how many fucking times"
39:34,660;39:36,900;"a dude's been in the problem now."
39:36,900;39:39,460;"Yeah, they're like, this is only his fifth year"
39:39,460;39:41,020;"and he's won two Super Bowl MVPs."
39:41,020;39:43,260;"He's like, right, he's got a long ride."
39:43,260;39:46,860;"15 years in the shell of more of those."
39:46,860;39:49,060;"Yeah, only two MVPs."
39:49,060;39:51,340;"He starts winning them and giving away the cars."
39:51,340;39:52,900;"Yeah, because he's angry."
39:52,900;39:54,060;"Yeah, give me you."
39:54,060;39:56,300;"Exactly, he's got no roof for him anymore."
39:56,300;40:01,500;"My worst is, let's say, oh, there's a lot we could do."
40:01,500;40:04,500;"Give a lot of worse enough of the Patriots"
40:04,500;40:09,860;"Actually, I'll give you one more best they showed"
40:09,860;40:12,820;"like an infographic thing of"
40:12,820;40:16,620;"Bill Belichick's player profile about what he looks for in players"
40:16,620;40:20,100;"And they were asking about that and they pointed out that"
40:20,100;40:22,460;"like athleticism"
40:22,460;40:29,260;"Didn't show up on that list like he just didn't talk about that or skill. They were like it was blowing themselves about it. Yeah, but it was"
40:30,300;40:37,940;"Commitment to football work ethic intelligence and team attitude, which is like so bill and check it like that is his system, right?"
40:37,940;40:40,980;"I guess you still gotta be good."
40:40,980;40:47,180;"Yeah, but I think you also have to be good at what they tell you to do more than be."
40:47,180;40:50,180;"Yeah, he's left actually be good, particularly skilled."
40:50,180;40:55,180;"And then they showed like all the undrafted late round draft picks."
40:56,420;41:02,260;"like to tie into that of the offensive starters and it was like this list was crazy. Troy Brown"
41:02,260;41:07,060;"in the eighth round, David Givens in the seventh, which to those rounds even exists anymore,"
41:07,060;41:12,500;"your eighth round doesn't seven does. All right, Joanne Juzy, undrafted, Dan Copen,"
41:12,500;41:18,580;"fifth round, Steven Neal, undrafted, Brandon Goren, seventh round. That's there. That's one,"
41:18,580;41:24,980;"two, three, four out of their five offensive line spots. We're the undrafted or five plus"
41:24,980;41:25,980;"around."
41:25,980;41:31,940;"Do you see I think recently about talking about Jakob Johnson being the second most"
41:31,940;41:34,260;"improved player, Belichick's ever coached?"
41:34,260;41:35,260;"Really?"
41:35,260;41:36,260;"I didn't see that."
41:36,260;41:37,260;"After Steven Neal."
41:37,260;41:38,260;"Oh yeah."
41:38,260;41:40,620;"Well, Steven Neal was a wrestler."
41:40,620;41:42,260;"Yeah, he was a wrestler."
41:42,260;41:43,260;"Right, right, right."
41:43,260;41:44,980;"Didn't know Dick about football."
41:44,980;41:45,980;"Yeah."
41:45,980;41:46,980;"It's fucking bananas."
41:46,980;41:48,540;"So it was cool that Belichick's like, yeah, he came a long time."
41:48,540;41:52,420;"And I guess Jakob Johnson's coming from Germany through that international thing."
41:52,420;41:53,420;"Yeah."
41:53,420;41:54,820;"Also didn't. I dig about football."
41:54,820;41:57,120;"And now he's actually been turning it up recently."
41:57,120;41:58,120;"Yeah."
41:58,120;41:59,420;"He's been playing really well."
41:59,420;42:02,620;"He's I think a big reason why the rungens working so well at the moment,"
42:02,620;42:06,520;"which segues in me into one of my, I guess, the best and the worst."
42:06,520;42:07,020;"All right."
42:07,020;42:07,520;"Give him to me."
42:07,520;42:09,520;"I forgot how good Patrick passes."
42:09,520;42:12,320;"I feel like I've said this before, but yeah, for a full back."
42:12,320;42:13,120;"He's awesome."
42:13,120;42:13,820;"Yeah."
42:13,820;42:17,620;"It was like he's Corey Dylan run play where he gets the corner and then"
42:17,620;42:21,520;"to allow Corey doing at the edge and the linebackers, like chasing them and he"
42:21,520;42:23,460;"almost cuts him and then Patrick passed,"
42:23,460;42:24,780;"cleans him up, pushes him out of bounds,"
42:24,780;42:27,020;"let Corey Dunk go from like another 15 yards."
42:27,020;42:28,020;"- Yeah."
42:28,020;42:29,860;"- And then on the punter turn,"
42:29,860;42:31,200;"he was a personal protector,"
42:31,200;42:34,460;"and so he almost ran down the punter turner."
42:34,460;42:36,220;"And he like dies and swipes at his ankles"
42:36,220;42:37,540;"and just happens to miss, you know?"
42:37,540;42:38,580;"- Yeah. - Right there."
42:38,580;42:39,420;"- But he was the closest one."
42:39,420;42:40,900;"- He's so close. - He's so close, yeah."
42:40,900;42:41,740;"- He's a fullback there."
42:41,740;42:43,300;"He's running down a punter turner."
42:43,300;42:44,660;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
42:44,660;42:45,500;"- Right near the goal line."
42:45,500;42:47,220;"He was flying."
42:47,220;42:48,060;"- Yep."
42:48,060;42:49,340;"- He's pretty quick for a fullback."
42:49,340;42:50,780;"- He was, wasn't he?"
42:50,780;42:53,180;"And I think he has no love, you know?"
42:53,180;42:55,020;"- No, he doesn't."
42:55,020;42:55,860;"I mean, full-backs in general."
42:55,860;42:56,860;"- And we'll tend not to."
42:56,860;42:57,860;"- That's true."
42:57,860;43:00,620;"But I feel like Patriots full-backs have been"
43:00,620;43:02,100;"sort of cult heroes, you know?"
43:02,100;43:02,940;"- In England, yeah."
43:02,940;43:04,380;"- This is because after this."
43:04,380;43:08,420;"- Good question."
43:08,420;43:12,220;"- Devlin was well loved."
43:12,220;43:13,060;"- Yeah."
43:13,060;43:15,580;"Who was before him though?"
43:15,580;43:19,780;"- Patrick Devlin's fruit."
43:19,780;43:22,220;"- Patrick Bass was the fullback for Mark Edwards, right?"
43:22,220;43:23,760;"'Cause we saw, we played against Mark Edwards"
43:23,760;43:25,140;"in the Saints' game or somewhere."
43:25,140;43:26,220;"- Yes, yeah, yeah."
43:26,220;43:28,820;"I feel like there's been more though."
43:28,820;43:31,380;"I don't know, I know we're missing somebody"
43:31,380;43:32,220;"in the middle of the game."
43:32,220;43:34,140;"- Clearly, they get no respect."
43:34,140;43:35,460;"- Right. - I'm not changing."
43:35,460;43:36,500;"- My buddy Patrick."
43:36,500;43:39,780;"- Let me get you a Patrick Pass."
43:39,780;43:43,900;"- That's a deep cut jersey, a Patrick Pass jersey."
43:43,900;43:45,300;"- This is what I'm saying."
43:45,300;43:46,580;"- It's a real deep cut."
43:46,580;43:47,420;"- Yep."
43:47,420;43:49,620;"Let's see."
43:49,620;43:53,180;"Here's the list of all running backs."
43:53,180;43:56,500;"Mariam Butts, he was more running back."
43:56,500;43:57,620;"They split him up by full back."
43:57,620;43:58,220;"They really don't."
43:58,220;44:00,420;"So that one needs that check, Greg."
44:00,420;44:02,260;"I know, right?"
44:02,260;44:02,940;"Yeah."
44:02,940;44:06,100;"Patrick Pass is-- this is running back in this."
44:06,100;44:08,740;"But there's somewhere missing."
44:08,740;44:11,740;"They have Dan Klekko as I'm running back in here."
44:11,740;44:13,420;"The other thing, it wasn't just Patrick Pass"
44:13,420;44:14,460;"playing full back in this."
44:14,460;44:17,140;"It used to be Dan Klekko, and then they had Richard Seymour"
44:17,140;44:22,140;"Yeah, like goal line stuff. Yeah. Patrick was a lighter for back, I guess. Yeah."
44:22,140;44:27,860;"You also missed a little segment about when they were just talking about Tom Brady endlessly"
44:27,860;44:32,660;"and pushing their storylines instead of watching the game. Did you hear that? I couldn't, I"
44:32,660;44:36,980;"rewinded and I couldn't understand what Susie said, but it was either Brady was a backup"
44:36,980;44:42,740;"on an 0 and 7 or an 0 and 17 team. Oh, and seven. I think it was. There's no way they"
44:42,740;44:44,860;"played 17 games in high school."
44:44,860;44:45,540;"No, no, no."
44:45,540;44:46,040;"Yeah."
44:46,040;44:47,460;"It sounded like she said 17."
44:47,460;44:48,940;"I was like, oh, shit, either way."
44:48,940;44:51,380;"Yeah, that's bad."
44:51,380;44:52,100;"That's."
44:52,100;44:55,180;"And yeah, he couldn't even start."
44:55,180;44:56,500;"That must have been high school."
44:56,500;44:57,100;"I'm assuming."
44:57,100;44:58,100;"Yes, it was high school."
44:58,100;44:58,380;"Yeah."
44:58,380;45:00,500;"And then he was a backup in"
45:00,500;45:03,460;"in Michigan as well with all that."
45:03,460;45:05,700;"What arise though, from backup on your"
45:05,700;45:07,700;"shit high school team to right?"
45:07,700;45:10,940;"Going for your back-to-back Super Bowl wins"
45:10,940;45:12,660;"for like a I don't know how many times"
45:12,660;45:14,860;"eighth time, ninth time."
45:14,860;45:15,860;"Yeah."
45:15,860;45:19,660;"Yeah, I mean, at this point, lost track."
45:19,660;45:29,900;"All right, before I do my couple of bests and worse, did you see the mid game highlights"
45:29,900;45:32,460;"in this or from around the league?"
45:32,460;45:33,460;"Yes."
45:33,460;45:34,460;"Yeah, yeah."
45:34,460;45:35,460;"Yeah, some good games."
45:35,460;45:39,860;"You see that Joey Porter throwing punches pregame and getting kicked out from the game."
45:39,860;45:40,860;"Yeah."
45:40,860;45:44,340;"fucking Browns games, Brown's skills games back in the day were legit."
45:44,340;45:49,140;"And then I actually watched the end of it, like, as a post game"
45:49,140;45:51,020;"Patriots coverage and they're highlight of it."
45:51,020;45:54,260;"The dude was like, I thought the NHL was on strike."
45:54,260;45:58,220;"He's got a pretty good laugh."
45:58,220;46:00,460;"And I was like, finally, it's a good fucking commentating."
46:00,460;46:01,340;"That's not good."
46:01,340;46:02,380;"That's not bad actually."
46:02,380;46:02,660;"Yeah."
46:02,660;46:03,820;"I'll give them the men."
46:03,820;46:09,180;"I sent Trevor a snapchat of the Lions game where the Lions are down."
46:09,700;46:12,460;"was at 17, three in the fourth quarter."
46:12,460;46:13,260;"Yeah."
46:13,260;46:15,540;"And drumming was beast back then,"
46:15,540;46:18,140;"returns two punts in the fourth quarter for touchdowns."
46:18,140;46:18,980;"Yeah."
46:18,980;46:21,540;"I think the first time anyone's returned two punts in a game"
46:21,540;46:23,660;"for touchdowns, and he does them both in the fourth quarter"
46:23,660;46:26,780;"to tie the game and then David Gerard beats him in overtime."
46:26,780;46:27,780;"Yeah."
46:27,780;46:29,540;"That ties are the stillers."
46:29,540;46:32,020;"After all that, fuck a brutal."
46:32,020;46:34,260;"He's got to be so mad."
46:34,260;46:36,460;"That's been in a drumming."
46:36,460;46:37,700;"That was a crazy bourbon call."
46:37,700;46:47,180;"Oh Jesus. Yeah, that was that was so typically lions ask, wasn't it?"
46:47,180;46:48,320;"You're off."
46:48,320;46:54,900;"Worse was Sam Adams. He was a beast a little bit in this game and I just one hit where"
46:54,900;46:59,300;"he like legit lifted Brady off his feet and then I was like all that weight."
46:59,300;47:00,300;"Yeah."
47:00,300;47:01,300;"Again, another foul nowadays."
47:01,300;47:04,740;"That's true. Yeah, you got a blind side. One play."
47:04,740;47:10,140;"Yeah, I kind of once very I mean, it's hard to miss that guy coming. Oh, you could you could feel him coming"
47:10,140;47:13,740;"That's what that's the commentators said could feel the ground rubble when he thought his way"
47:13,740;47:15,780;"Yeah"
47:15,780;47:18,020;"And on the other worst slash bust"
47:18,020;47:23,480;"Was Teddy Briska like near towards ACL. Yeah, that looked real bad"
47:23,480;47:27,220;"Somehow miraculously doesn't and he's walking off the field like"
47:27,220;47:34,200;"And he comes just pop and he sees Vable and the camera still has like a close-up on his face in his face is like"
47:34,200;47:35,960;"like, holy shit."
47:35,960;47:36,800;"Yeah."
47:36,800;47:37,400;"Exactly."
47:37,400;47:40,640;"Oh, oh, oh, good."
47:40,640;47:43,440;"It's gracious."
47:43,440;47:46,040;"Yeah, it definitely escaped."
47:46,040;47:47,040;"He's gave something real bad."
47:47,040;47:48,320;"There's a lot of people in there."
47:48,320;47:50,560;"And I think that could have changed the trajectory"
47:50,560;47:53,520;"of their whole season if Teddy Bruce, because he's a--"
47:53,520;47:54,920;"the corners suck for sure."
47:54,920;47:59,000;"But their D-line is these Teddy Bruce Keys and awesome."
47:59,000;48:02,000;"My other best is his intersection return,"
48:02,000;48:03,320;"which I don't know if you have this highly,"
48:03,320;48:04,800;"because they didn't even show a replay of it"
48:04,800;48:06,520;"'cause they're such bad production values"
48:06,520;48:08,040;"that they didn't even show another replay"
48:08,040;48:08,880;"of their turnos."
48:08,880;48:10,280;"So, snokey smooth."
48:10,280;48:13,280;"Yeah, it catches it, almost runs in the receiver,"
48:13,280;48:15,560;"ducks in, slips out of a couple of tackles,"
48:15,560;48:17,080;"gets like 30, 40 yards out of him."
48:17,080;48:19,040;"- Yeah, and then like, looks like he's gonna get run out of bounds,"
48:19,040;48:22,320;"but then like, he dukes out one of the offensive line"
48:22,320;48:23,960;"when he gets another like 10, 15 yards."
48:23,960;48:25,040;"- Yeah, he's the old Olay."
48:25,040;48:26,440;"- Yeah, he did."
48:26,440;48:28,800;"Yeah, now that'll be on the website too."
48:28,800;48:30,400;"That's the Uplod in currently."
48:30,400;48:31,240;"- Good."
48:31,240;48:34,080;"A lot of plays, a lot of plays."
48:34,080;48:39,080;"I try to grab all the defensive turnovers and sacks,"
48:39,080;48:41,960;"and then offensive plays,"
48:41,960;48:43,600;"like running plays over 10 yards"
48:43,600;48:46,320;"and then like deep passes and touchdowns."
48:46,320;48:47,840;"- You shouldn't get that crack back block"
48:47,840;48:50,160;"that Eric molds through on Teddy Brisky"
48:50,160;48:51,880;"in the early in the game."
48:51,880;48:54,160;"- I don't do highlights of other teams."
48:54,160;48:55,040;"It's only Patriots."
48:55,040;48:58,960;"- It's crazy seeing plays that are blatantly illegal now."
48:58,960;49:00,720;"- Oh yeah. - You know, it's beautiful."
49:00,720;49:02,200;"It's a little jarring, isn't it?"
49:02,200;49:04,800;"- And the commentators are like about it."
49:04,800;49:07,400;"- Yeah, oh, they're like, what a great fucking hit."
49:07,400;49:08,240;"- It's legit."
49:08,240;49:09,800;"- It's like that was Heinz Ward."
49:09,800;49:11,720;"- Yeah, yeah, it looked like Heinz Ward out there."
49:11,720;49:13,120;"- Yeah, exactly."
49:13,120;49:15,080;"I was like, yeah, that's a dirty fucker."
49:15,080;49:17,000;"(laughs)"
49:17,000;49:19,120;"- I mean, it wasn't dirty, but it was in the rules, you know?"
49:19,120;49:20,680;"- It's true, yeah, it wasn't dirty then."
49:20,680;49:21,600;"It is now."
49:21,600;49:22,840;"Can't think of that. - It's not."
49:22,840;49:26,120;"- Now you got people praising Jacoby Myers"
49:26,120;49:29,640;"for not throwing that block and just throwing a pick instead"
49:29,640;49:31,400;"- It's like Kendrick Bourge for a touchdown."
49:31,400;49:33,000;"It's a different game this day."
49:33,000;49:34,480;"- If Kobe definitely could have cleaned that guy up"
49:34,480;49:35,320;"in his feet for sure."
49:35,320;49:37,160;"Actually probably got a blog in the back."
49:37,160;49:38,240;"That's something about crackbacks"
49:38,240;49:40,360;"that are almost there, you know?"
49:40,360;49:41,360;"- Yeah, so,"
49:41,360;49:45,400;"yeah, so you can actually watch this game on YouTube."
49:45,400;49:46,400;"This one's on YouTube."
49:46,400;49:49,680;"The link's on the website."
49:49,680;49:50,520;"But,"
49:50,520;49:54,280;"yeah, I mean, this was a good game"
49:54,280;49:58,240;"to kind of get you ready for Monday night this week, I think."
49:59,440;50:01,500;"Not that or, you know,"
50:01,500;50:03,080;"- Depends on how it goes."
50:03,080;50:05,520;"- Yeah, I'm just thinking that when I said it, yeah."
50:05,520;50:08,520;"- Bill's fans don't watch this game after Monday night."
50:08,520;50:09,600;"- Regardless."
50:09,600;50:10,440;"- Regardless."
50:10,440;50:11,600;"(laughing)"
50:11,600;50:12,840;"- You can hold the fans, you know,"
50:12,840;50:14,240;"depending on how it goes,"
50:14,240;50:17,280;"maybe you want to relive some more glory,"
50:17,280;50:19,920;"or maybe you have some, you know,"
50:19,920;50:23,000;"maybe just want to relive the glory for better or for worse."
50:23,000;50:24,240;"- Or just watch that second quarter."
50:24,240;50:26,560;"That's for the fun stuff is."
50:26,560;50:27,400;"- Yeah."
50:27,400;50:30,320;"- Watch second quarter and then the fourth quarter."
50:30,320;50:32,920;"Fourth quarter is great 'cause it's a bunch of bills turnovers."
50:32,920;50:34,440;"It's a great time."
50:34,440;50:36,360;"- Yeah, it's just them imploding."
50:36,360;50:37,560;"- Yeah."
50:37,560;50:39,040;"- Andy, I gave you Rossman's sighting."
50:39,040;50:40,960;"He throws a fumble in as an interception."
50:40,960;50:41,800;"- Yep."
50:41,800;50:42,800;"- Which is the harm of things to come."
50:42,800;50:46,040;"- And he was getting hyped up even by the commentators"
50:46,040;50:49,640;"talking about how he's the first round quarterback"
50:49,640;50:51,360;"selected by the bill since Jim Kelly."
50:51,360;50:53,080;"So he's like the second coming."
50:53,080;50:55,120;"- Yeah, first of fucking many buddy."
50:55,120;50:55,960;"- Oops."
50:55,960;50:57,240;"- Yeah, exactly."
50:57,240;50:58,240;"won't be the last."
50:58,240;51:03,080;"So yeah, so that was"
51:03,080;51:05,840;"2004, week 10."
51:05,840;51:07,840;"A great game."
51:07,840;51:11,240;"If you're a Pats fan, what's next week?"
51:11,240;51:15,720;"Next week, the Patriots travel to Arrowhead Stadium."
51:15,720;51:19,640;"Take on the Dick Vermeil Kansas City Chiefs."
51:19,640;51:21,400;"I know nothing about this game."
51:21,400;51:23,840;"I know absolutely nothing about this."
51:23,840;51:25,520;"I've remembered most of these so far."
51:25,520;51:26,200;"But this one."
51:27,120;51:29,240;"Couldn't tell you apparently Trent Green is a quarterback."
51:29,240;51:31,960;"Still not ringing any bells."
51:31,960;51:35,800;"I feel like there's a bunch of big names in the cheese back then."
51:35,800;51:36,920;"So we'll see. Yeah."
51:36,920;51:37,440;"Yeah."
51:37,440;51:39,560;"And you're Tennyson, Tony Gonzalez, Dante Hall."
51:39,560;51:40,160;"Yeah."
51:40,160;51:42,360;"The other game we did that went to overtime was electric."

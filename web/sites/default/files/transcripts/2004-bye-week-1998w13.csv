00:00,000;00:06,720;This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,
00:06,720;00:10,920;you have the choice not to. My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying
00:10,920;00:15,720;to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid. You still want to listen? Go right
00:15,720;00:18,520;ahead. I am not your mother.
00:18,520;00:28,600;Welcome back to the Page of Fantasy podcast. The only podcast I would have to assume where
00:28,600;00:36,200;We are going back and rewatching every game of the Patriots dynasty starting in 2001.
00:36,200;00:39,160;We have finished the 2004 regular season.
00:39,160;00:43,780;So if you want to listen to those, you can go back and listen to that.
00:43,780;00:47,800;But since the Patriots have a bye week, we thought we would kind of take like we do traditionally
00:47,800;00:51,320;our bye week and do something a little bit different.
00:51,320;00:57,360;So this time, Greg has convinced us to watch a random game that is important to him and
00:57,360;01:01,560;really only him. That's not true. That's not true at all.
01:01,560;01:05,600;In this family, a legendary game. This now it's important to
01:05,600;01:09,920;dad. He was there too. That might be and it's our grapes.
01:09,920;01:14,000;That's exactly what's important to me because I was first on
01:14,000;01:18,480;the list to go to this game. But I was overruled by McBrown. And
01:18,480;01:20,600;he brought Greg instead and it turned out to be an instant
01:20,600;01:23,200;classic. So Greg, what game are we talking about?
01:24,280;01:32,440;1998 week 13 Patriots versus Bills also known as the Terry Glenn Hail Mary interference game
01:32,440;01:37,400;Ben Coase touchdown Vintaria two-point conversion game. Spoiler.
01:37,400;01:44,520;Yeah, that's the game. Yeah, all right. Well, I don't know. Everyone calls it that though. I
01:44,520;01:49,720;feel like the name is generally a little shorter. What would you call it Steve? I don't know. I
01:49,720;01:54,120;don't remember this game that much. I remember being sort of excited, but this is pretty young.
01:54,120;01:59,800;Yeah, I remember being super fucking salty. I think it's a good at scale. Yeah, I'll bet Andy
01:59,800;02:01,720;There's definitely a reason why though
02:01,720;02:06,080;I believe the reason why is because I had been to data taking me to a Red Sox game and
02:06,080;02:09,640;That was the last game that anybody had gone to so
02:09,640;02:13,020;Well, you're probably the first one to go to our Red Sox game, too
02:13,020;02:19,020;Well, yes, I went to Red Sox game before you guys were born. So yes, that is correct. There you go
02:19,020;02:21,920;Craig was the first to go to a Patriots game
02:23,560;02:25,560;This is your first game, right?
02:25,560;02:29,560;Well, technically I went to a Patriots game as an infant.
02:29,560;02:31,560;Oh, yeah.
02:31,560;02:43,560;In the early 80s, when our grandmother came over, mom's mom, and from what I understand, this was the time when the Patriots were an absolute shit show.
02:43,560;02:49,800;show and they, uh, like, you know, early eighties. So it was all a bunch of controversy going
02:49,800;02:54,440;around. I think there was something to do with one of the, uh, like female reporters getting
02:54,440;03:00,840;harassed in the locker room. Yes. And so the fans were passing around, um, like blow up dolls,
03:00,840;03:07,560;like inflatable sex dolls around the crowd, like you do with beach balls. Um, and so my,
03:07,560;03:13,320;our parents decided that was a good idea to bring grandma to, um, very religious woman.
03:13,320;03:21,160;from English. Very British. Yeah. And so I think me and Grandma ended up in the car in the parking
03:21,160;03:26,920;lot and Grandma got to see a handful of people just peeing in between cars while the game was
03:26,920;03:31,080;happening. Well, they brought not just Grandma to that game, they also brought an infant. Right.
03:31,080;03:36,760;Yeah, I was there as well, apparently. So a nice family outing, which I think kind of says a lot
03:36,760;03:42,440;about the fact that we're doing this podcast now, maybe. It can't be worse than an English soccer
03:42,440;03:46,280;game, which I'm sure grandma wouldn't do. That's actually a good point, Greg. Yeah.
03:46,280;03:50,920;As far as I heard way rooter and see way more gross stuff at the soccer game growing up.
03:50,920;03:55,720;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's definitely less violent. And like, you know, World War II.
03:55,720;04:02,440;Yeah. And also I think the one thing that American sports is missing are the the chance.
04:02,440;04:08,600;Oh yeah. Americans are not good at chanting. That whole section was in that Patriots dynasty
04:08,600;04:12,200;book. You send me Andy from the guy who did the tiger was one.
04:12,200;04:13,000;I forget his name.
04:13,000;04:15,800;Something super generic. Jeff.
04:15,800;04:17,880;Yes, it was.
04:17,880;04:22,120;Jeff Howes on it now. I'm so bad at Jeff Benedict.
04:22,120;04:24,480;That book was sweet.
04:24,480;04:26,560;Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. If you don't, if you haven't read it yet,
04:26,560;04:29,560;I recommend it. Although I had a hard time getting through
04:29,560;04:31,480;the 2007 season part of it.
04:31,480;04:34,960;Oh, yeah. But read it just like the opening is in there.
04:34,960;04:38,120;The opening is about Drew Bloodsow and his injury.
04:38,120;04:40,280;And it's a fascinating rate.
04:40,280;04:42,280;- Which is good context for this game
04:42,280;04:43,960;because he has an injury in this game too.
04:43,960;04:45,320;- Correct. Yeah.
04:45,320;04:49,380;So Greg, tell us about what we got going on here in 1998.
04:49,380;04:51,960;- What's the scene for us?
04:51,960;04:52,800;- Paint us a picture.
04:52,800;04:57,800;- Six and five Patriots versus seven and four Bills.
04:57,800;05:00,440;- Yes.
05:00,440;05:05,440;- Coming down the playoff scenario stretch here.
05:05,440;05:06,360;- Correct.
05:06,360;05:07,300;- Pat's trying to make the playoffs.
05:07,300;05:11,780;I guess they had a super dramatic win on Monday night rolling into this game.
05:11,780;05:13,860;Yeah. Yeah. Does that game have a name?
05:13,860;05:20,500;Yeah. Remember that the drew blood. So finger game. Um, yeah, this was, uh,
05:20,500;05:26,340;the game where drew blood. So engineered a last minute come from behind,
05:26,340;05:31,420;uh, touchdown drive while in the middle of the drive,
05:31,420;05:36,420;breaking his index finger in two places, um, on the helmet of his,
05:36,620;05:42,180;somebody. I'm not quite sure who. And still managed to throw a game winning like 20 something
05:42,180;05:47,820;girl touchdown right at the end of the game. Sean Jefferson. Yeah, great.
05:47,820;05:52,660;Yeah, a clip of it. Yeah, well, we'll post the the highlights of that. This whole game
05:52,660;05:58,500;was on YouTube, right? This whole game, this whole game was on YouTube. Did you watch it?
05:58,500;06:03,620;I did. I watched it in two, two different YouTubes. One was a little more stretched
06:03,620;06:08,740;out. Yes, but it had the whole game and the one that was normal size didn't have the fourth
06:08,740;06:14,900;quarter, which is what was that? That was what was that? Should we talk about some names?
06:14,900;06:19,100;Because there's a whole shitload of throwback names. Can we just rattle some off here?
06:19,100;06:24,180;Hang on, hang on. Before you do that, I just want to touch on a bit more of the context.
06:24,180;06:28,740;This was when the AFC East still had the Colts in it. And so there are one, two, three, four,
06:28,740;06:36,020;teams in the AFC East, four of them would make the playoffs this year. Patriots were the four seed
06:36,020;06:41,940;in or I believe six seed in the AFC at nine and seven. Bills were the fifth seed at 10 and six.
06:41,940;06:47,700;Miami Dolphins, four seed, also 10 and six. And the New York Jets, the second seed in the AFC
06:47,700;06:51,380;at 12 and four. So this is like the last time the Jets were actually good.
06:51,380;06:56,020;This is probably the last time the Jets. Yeah. Because they have Curtis Martin,
06:56,020;06:57,460;- He's just running over everybody
06:57,460;06:59,560;and just being an absolute beast for them.
06:59,560;07:00,600;- Correct.
07:00,600;07:01,440;That is absolutely-
07:01,440;07:02,820;- They showed the highlights of the Jets game
07:02,820;07:04,580;earlier the day during the broadcast
07:04,580;07:07,220;and he has like 140 yards.
07:07,220;07:08,060;- Yeah.
07:08,060;07:11,040;- Had some sick runs where he just runs away from everybody.
07:11,040;07:14,100;- Yeah, that was Pete Curtis Martin in 1998.
07:14,100;07:16,940;So I believe that was the year that he left, correct?
07:16,940;07:18,700;- Yes.
07:18,700;07:19,520;- It's gotta be right around there, yeah.
07:19,520;07:20,500;- It was, no, this was the year.
07:20,500;07:21,740;This is the year after.
07:21,740;07:24,020;And then they drafted Robert Edwards,
07:24,020;07:26,060;who also was having himself a year.
07:26,060;07:29,640;- This might be Pete Carroll second to last year, right?
07:29,640;07:31,540;'Cause it's Pete Carroll, the coach.
07:31,540;07:33,100;- Pete Carroll is the coach.
07:33,100;07:34,980;I don't remember exactly when he left,
07:34,980;07:36,340;but yes, we can go for it.
07:36,340;07:39,300;- Fact check it, bro.
07:39,300;07:41,620;- All right, Greg, give me some names.
07:41,620;07:44,100;- All right, Drew Bloodsill, Robert Edwards,
07:44,100;07:48,220;Sean Jefferson, Terry Glenn, Ben Coats, Bruce Armstrong,
07:48,220;07:50,260;Dave Wallabaugh.
07:50,260;07:51,240;- Oh yeah.
07:51,240;07:53,380;- Chris Slade, a bunch of guys
07:53,380;07:55,900;You've already heard of before Willie Clay,
07:55,900;07:56,740;- Chat Eaton.
07:56,740;07:59,740;- Bucky Jones, Chat Eaton.
07:59,740;08:03,680;And then the Bills, Doug Flutie, Antoine Smith, Sam Gash,
08:03,680;08:08,680;Andre Reed, Eric Moulds, Ted Washington, Bruce Smith,
08:08,680;08:13,420;Sam Cowart, Thurman Thomas is on this team.
08:13,420;08:14,260;- Yeah.
08:14,260;08:16,780;- So this is like the,
08:16,780;08:20,340;some of the remnants of those four Super Bowl Bills teams.
08:20,340;08:21,180;- Yep.
08:21,180;08:22,820;- I thought it was crazy.
08:22,820;08:27,640;How many players in this game and also in a lot of the games like we're watching this year
08:27,640;08:30,580;Really?
08:30,580;08:36,580;Let me set that crazy even like even last year 2003 Tylah Antoine. Yeah, Bruce. Yeah
08:36,580;08:38,580;It's amazing how much overlap there is with
08:38,580;08:42,620;You know, Doug Flutie play for the Pats same gash also play for the Pats
08:42,620;08:47,740;Ted Washington and Antoine Smith would go on to play for the Pats Doug Flutie
08:48,620;08:52,620;Yeah, he'd come for the Pats. He actually was already on the Pats once, right?
08:52,620;08:57,380;Yes, he had played for the Pats already. They showed that clips him with the sick flow. He had a fucking
08:57,380;09:00,520;Yeah, they actually they actually showed a stat
09:00,520;09:07,200;Where Doug Flutie was undefeated at Foxboro Stadium coming into this game. Yes
09:07,200;09:12,320;So here's 3 and 0 at Boston College in 1983 2 and 0 Boston College in 84
09:12,320;09:15,960;4 and 0 with New England in 88 and 1 and 0 in New England 89
09:17,420;09:24,100;And this is undefeated 10 and 0 10 years. Oh, yeah, so 10 and 0 this would be his first loss in Foxborough Stadium
09:24,100;09:27,040;Yeah, I mean Doug food is a shit. Everyone loves him
09:27,040;09:34,420;Doesn't get a damn respect this game does very watchable because you were like rooting for Doug Flutie a ton
09:34,420;09:38,580;Even though he's a bills quarterback. Yeah, it's one of those things I can't be mad at him
09:38,580;09:43,040;Even though he plays out of his mind on this game - he does. Yeah, he throws like
09:43,580;09:49,500;40 yards here to fit always. This is yeah, this is a week 13 and they said he's been sacked five times on the season
09:49,500;09:56,860;He's also 36. Yeah, he's not a spring chicken in this game. He's 36 years. There's 36
09:56,860;10:00,540;Oh, that's right. Cuz he spent all that time in the Canadian CFL. Yeah. Yeah
10:00,540;10:08,660;He must have been lit in the CFL right just running around people. I believe he was like there Michael Vick
10:08,660;10:13,080;Yeah, for sure. You won the comeback player of the year this year. Yeah
10:13,080;10:14,080;No way.
10:14,080;10:21,520;And then was this the year that, or was this later on where, no, it must have been later
10:21,520;10:24,960;on where they had the Brad Johnson stuff and like they kept trying to start Brad Johnson.
10:24,960;10:31,480;Yeah, I think that's the next year with the loss of Tennessee, the music city miracle.
10:31,480;10:32,480;Music City.
10:32,480;10:33,480;Oh, right.
10:33,480;10:35,080;So this is the last time that bills are good too.
10:35,080;10:36,080;Yes.
10:36,080;10:37,080;Besides the current times.
10:37,080;10:39,080;Until very recently, yes, yes.
10:39,080;10:40,080;Yes.
10:40,080;10:41,080;That's tough.
10:41,080;10:46,680;All right, so the other couple names for you, the commentators, Vern Lundquist and Randy
10:46,680;10:47,680;Cross.
10:47,680;10:50,200;Did you hate them, Andy?
10:50,200;10:52,840;Of course I did.
10:52,840;10:59,640;But speaking of commentators, I would just like to share something for you boys that
10:59,640;11:02,160;I think you might like.
11:02,160;11:05,400;We have a birthday today.
11:05,400;11:15,780;1971, the St. Louis Cardinals drafted a fierce 290-pound competitor named Dan Dierdorf.
11:15,780;11:22,200;Dierdorf headed an offensive line that yielded the fewest sacks in the NFL for five straight
11:22,200;11:27,560;years during the 70s.
11:27,560;11:32,360;This relentless right tackle punished would be defenders, whether the Cardinals chose
11:32,360;11:35,240;to run or pass.
11:35,240;11:40,840;I always thought that I went through my years in the NFL like I had blinders on, like I was a racehorse.
11:40,840;11:45,340;I saw nothing but the upcoming game and my upcoming opponent.
11:45,340;11:50,240;I really had the ability to rule everything else out and make it inconsequential.
11:50,240;11:57,440;Dierdorf would be denied only one Pro Bowl appearance from 1974 through 1980,
11:57,440;12:01,240;securing his place in Pro Football history.
12:01,240;12:04,740;So there you go.
12:04,740;12:08,520;Happy birthday to the legend who is Dan Deardor.
12:08,520;12:12,680;See in the Pro Bowl or the Hall of Fame?
12:12,680;12:17,120;No, I think we talked about season Hall of Fame for broadcasting.
12:17,120;12:17,880;Right. Oh, yeah.
12:17,880;12:19,120;I think Hall of Fame. Yes.
12:19,120;12:21,220;Which is worse.
12:21,220;12:24,720;For Indians on your way worse.
12:24,720;12:28,700;I guess he kept those blinders on all these games that he's commentating.
12:28,700;12:30,000;I love it.
12:30,000;12:33,700;So, yeah, that was just for you boys.
12:33,700;12:34,740;I knew you'd like that.
12:34,740;12:38,100;That's such bullshit to keep the blinders on like me.
12:38,100;12:39,700;A great dude.
12:39,700;12:42,100;He was clearing some holes in that highlight clip, though.
12:42,100;12:44,180;They were OK. I mean, he was blowing.
12:44,180;12:45,540;He's football.
12:45,540;12:46,580;Oh, it's 70s football.
12:46,580;12:48,580;Yeah, he was going to let black people play back then.
12:48,580;12:51,380;Steve, Jesus Christ.
12:51,380;12:57,820;All right.
12:57,820;12:59,580;Let's talk about this game, then, Greg.
12:59,580;13:01,580;Actually, I need to ask you this.
13:02,260;13:04,700;Can't you watch the game?
13:04,700;13:08,660;Parts of it, I watched the beginning and then the life.
13:08,660;13:10,540;Obviously, watch the game live.
13:10,540;13:12,500;So no big deal.
13:12,500;13:15,140;That's probably a touch on TV.
13:15,140;13:17,060;That little fucking TV.
13:17,060;13:19,300;50 yard line. No big deal.
13:19,300;13:23,420;So he didn't watch it.
13:23,420;13:24,660;Is that right? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
13:24,660;13:26,620;He watched the highlights and the notes.
13:26,620;13:27,860;I don't need to watch it again.
13:27,860;13:28,860;Once you've seen it live.
13:28,860;13:29,780;No, fine.
13:29,780;13:32,540;What do you remember? What do you remember actually from this game?
13:32,540;13:33,220;Yeah.
13:33,220;13:36,020;Oh my God, Andy, you should have this crowd.
13:36,020;13:40,380;This TV doesn't do it justice, what it was like being there.
13:40,380;13:42,620;They were loud. It was incredible.
13:42,620;13:45,180;Foxborough, Foxborough. They got ready.
13:45,180;13:46,060;The yard line.
13:46,060;13:48,620;I don't know where we got tickets from, but how far up are you?
13:48,620;13:50,060;Yeah. I don't know.
13:50,060;13:53,140;Those were lower ball.
13:53,140;13:54,300;Oh, no, shit.
13:54,300;13:55,140;So they're like really good.
13:55,140;13:58,900;Foxborough even have lower bowls, but it was just really good seats.
13:58,940;14:02,620;Yeah, I mean, I feel like I sat in the same seats for the Cardinals game.
14:02,620;14:03,820;My first Patriots game.
14:03,820;14:05,180;Yeah.
14:05,180;14:06,620;In 2000 and like,
14:06,620;14:09,260;2008.
14:09,260;14:09,980;Yeah. 2008.
14:09,980;14:11,420;Yeah. It was the game of the Mack Castle season.
14:11,420;14:14,700;Dad went a decade before taking me to a Patriots game.
14:14,700;14:16,860;I mean, that feels about right too.
14:16,860;14:17,740;Yeah. Oh yeah.
14:17,740;14:19,260;Middle middle son.
14:19,260;14:19,820;Who cares?
14:19,820;14:21,580;I took him to a Bruins game.
14:21,580;14:22,060;That's fine.
14:22,060;14:25,660;Well, you weren't as emotionally invested as I was those.
14:25,660;14:26,380;For sure.
14:26,380;14:27,900;Yeah. You were your way into it.
14:27,900;14:29,900;I was through at that point.
14:29,900;14:32,500;Because I went to the game in '97.
14:32,500;14:34,500;That's my first Bruins game.
14:34,500;14:36,000;At the Fleet Center.
14:36,000;14:38,000;Yeah, makes sense.
14:38,000;14:39,500;And Andy was a Red Sox son.
14:39,500;14:40,700;Andy is a Red Sox son.
14:40,700;14:41,700;I was a Bruins son.
14:41,700;14:42,800;You were the Patriots son.
14:42,800;14:43,300;This is true.
14:43,300;14:43,800;Yeah.
14:43,800;14:44,300;Yeah.
14:44,300;14:46,300;I got pulled out of, dad told me, fifth grade.
14:46,300;14:48,300;He took me to a Red Sox game.
14:48,300;14:49,300;That's sweet.
14:49,300;14:50,300;Taking you out of school.
14:50,300;14:50,800;Yeah.
14:50,800;14:57,000;Like three rows up from like just behind home plate, like where the netting is, just outside
14:57,000;15:00,520;the netting. I think you got him from a guy work. I'm gonna do
15:00,520;15:00,920;that one.
15:00,920;15:05,720;He said, dad, this is the best day of my life. He still
15:05,720;15:06,680;remembers that and brings it.
15:06,680;15:09,720;I used to say that too. I said this was the best day of my
15:09,720;15:10,040;life.
15:10,040;15:13,480;No, I was like, yeah, that's fine. I did write a book about
15:13,480;15:17,000;it though. I have a book I wrote about the trip to my habit
15:17,000;15:18,360;still to I slob a ticket.
15:18,360;15:23,960;Hell yeah. The things you remember. So take your children
15:23,960;15:29,160;sporting events, even if they're the 83 Patriots and they're passing around.
15:29,160;15:38,040;Yes. Blow up dolls. Yep. Then your conservative British grandmother has to sleep at the infant
15:38,040;15:42,200;and go sit in the car while your parents finish the game and has to watch people just take pisses
15:42,200;15:47,320;around around her. Tough life. Speaking of football.
15:47,320;15:52,200;The game is sweet though. I don't blame mom and dad for not leaving because this game was awesome.
15:52,200;15:55,000;Yeah, well, yeah, this isn't the one that I'll never mind.
15:55,000;16:04,360;Yes, this game. It was kind of the peak droop. Let's go. I would say this is where he kind of
16:04,360;16:12,040;made his name as the Patriot Savior at the time. Because he was that larger than life playing with,
16:12,040;16:17,960;I think pins in his finger at this point, had a bandage up in the commentators were talking about
16:17,960;16:24,620;how he didn't even like keep his hand warm because it was getting colder in the game.
16:24,620;16:25,680;Greg, how cold was it?
16:25,680;16:26,680;43 degrees.
16:26,680;16:27,680;How cold did it feel?
16:27,680;16:28,680;Do you remember being cold?
16:28,680;16:29,680;No.
16:29,680;16:30,680;I was shit-faced drunk though.
16:30,680;16:31,680;You were like seven.
16:31,680;16:32,680;Yeah.
16:32,680;16:44,600;You're thinking about the Denver game.
16:44,600;16:46,760;I was drunk on love of the game, man.
16:46,760;16:47,760;Of course.
16:47,760;16:49,560;Nothing could have made me cold.
16:49,560;16:56,360;But yeah, so, and like I said last week, he had on Monday night against the damn
16:56,360;17:04,400;merino dolphins, he had engineered a comeback with a broken finger and Pete
17:04,400;17:07,440;Carroll tried to call a timeout and Drew Bloodsor didn't even notice and he kept
17:07,440;17:08,800;on going and threw the winning touchdown.
17:08,800;17:09,680;Or ignored him.
17:09,680;17:13,040;That's the big broadcast, which I really appreciate it.
17:13,040;17:14,120;I hope he ignored him.
17:14,120;17:14,960;So do I.
17:15,480;17:19,560;If we ever have Drew Bloodsawan, we'll ask him if he ignored Pete Carroll on that play.
17:19,560;17:24,840;Um, uh, yeah, and through a touchdown to Sean Jefferson, some great names.
17:24,840;17:31,520;Uh, and then, uh, did not practice this entire week.
17:31,520;17:38,720;They said, uh, through some warmup passes just to see if he could in the pregame
17:38,720;17:40,980;warmups and what did they say?
17:40,980;17:42,360;Steve, you remember what they said about it?
17:42,360;17:44,480;Um, about how they were watching it.
17:44,480;17:48,920;No, I said they I heard they didn't take a snap all week, but not what they say.
17:48,920;17:52,160;Yeah. But then they're like, oh, everybody was watching his pregame warmups.
17:52,160;17:54,040;Like I don't even know what it was.
17:54,040;17:54,760;Yeah. Yeah.
17:54,760;17:59,400;They were some like awful analogy, but it's good radio there, Andy.
17:59,400;18:01,440;They broadcast on Instagram.
18:01,440;18:03,040;Everyone was very I'm trying.
18:03,040;18:05,320;I'm trying to set Steve up for like some interesting knowledge.
18:05,320;18:06,840;But apparently he didn't fucking watch the game either.
18:06,840;18:07,880;So I did watch the game.
18:07,880;18:08,680;I watched most of it.
18:08,680;18:12,640;I watched until that YouTube video ran out and then I watched the last two drives.
18:12,840;18:14,840;That's where those scored and the pitches scored.
18:14,840;18:15,720;Yeah, it's my third.
18:15,720;18:18,600;If my first game I had to watch Scott Zolak play,
18:18,600;18:21,400;I probably wouldn't be here on this podcast right now.
18:21,400;18:25,560;80 drag solid.
18:25,560;18:27,080;I went back and looked at the
18:27,080;18:34,440;Boston Globe for the day before and the day after the game,
18:34,440;18:35,800;or the day of the day after the game.
18:35,800;18:36,680;Sweet.
18:36,680;18:44,040;And there was an article about like, is this Scott Zolak's time to shine because he's,
18:44,040;18:48,440;this was his contract year. His contract is going to run out at the end of this year.
18:48,440;18:54,440;And he'd be a free agent. And, you know, he's had like zero starts basically up until this.
18:54,440;19:00,040;He's just played like mop up duty. And so, you know, is this his time to show that he can be a
19:00,040;19:03,720;starting quarterback and go make some starting quarterback money in free agency?
19:04,840;19:06,640;Spoiler alert, the answer was no.
19:06,640;19:09,960;It was not because the shine.
19:09,960;19:10,760;Correct.
19:10,760;19:16,200;If he does become 30 years later when he's someone caught him snorting lines on
19:16,200;19:18,600;live radio.
19:18,600;19:19,400;What?
19:19,400;19:21,720;I did not hear about this.
19:21,720;19:24,600;Oh, well, how long ago is this?
19:24,600;19:25,600;They don't remember it.
19:25,600;19:27,560;Don't let it leave this bug.
19:27,560;19:28,720;We'll be bad out.
19:28,720;19:30,880;We'll be bad out.
19:30,880;19:31,480;True.
19:31,480;19:34,760;And the only place one more year after this, so maybe there's something to that.
19:34,760;19:41,840;Yeah, I think Greg just cracked the case. But in true Drew Blatsoe fashion, his first
19:41,840;19:46,360;pass of this game, Deep Bomb floated to the free safety picked off.
19:46,360;19:49,080;Oh yeah. It was like two on one. He threw it to the one guy.
19:49,080;19:50,080;Yeah.
19:50,080;19:51,080;Yeah.
19:51,080;19:52,080;Can't of corn with that.
19:52,080;19:54,120;I mean, he's got a broken finger. You really can't.
19:54,120;19:57,320;Yeah, it floated on him. And the second one probably should have been picked off, but
19:57,320;19:58,880;that floated on him too. So it ended up out of it.
19:58,880;20:01,680;It took him a little while to find the touch, but he found the touch perfectly.
20:01,680;20:02,680;But when he did, yeah.
20:02,680;20:04,080;On the game winner. Come on.
20:04,080;20:10,480;So, uh, yeah, this was a, uh, a quality game that's kind of started off a little slow.
20:10,480;20:11,800;It was all bills early.
20:11,800;20:17,520;And apparently these two teams have played two weeks before and the bills basically
20:17,520;20:18,640;just stomp the Patriots.
20:18,640;20:22,760;They rush for 213 yards or something ridiculous.
20:22,760;20:25,280;So everybody's like, Oh, they're going to do it again.
20:25,280;20:26,920;There's Thurman Thomas.
20:26,920;20:31,480;And I don't know if he's a rookie, but a young Antoine Smith, like prime Antoine.
20:31,480;20:32,840;He was awesome.
20:32,840;20:39,100;Yeah, he was he was your typical Antoine that you would expect that you probably remember
20:39,100;20:44,440;from 2001 exactly. He's the same guy except faster. Yeah, yeah. But you know, he's the
20:44,440;20:48,200;one who was the kind of their short yardage back and at this point, they're using Thurman
20:48,200;20:50,640;Thomas is like the third downback kind of guy.
20:50,640;20:54,920;term Thomas is like it's gonna be one of his last seasons. He's yeah, I think he goes one
20:54,920;20:59,600;more season with the Dolphins after this is last season with the bills and then he's done.
20:59,600;21:02,080;I did not know Thurman Thomas played for the Dolphins.
21:02,080;21:03,680;- One year, he did, yes.
21:03,680;21:06,400;- Where else did Ben Coates play? Trivia.
21:06,400;21:07,480;- Oh, I don't know.
21:07,480;21:10,800;- Hint, he won a Super Bowl with his team.
21:10,800;21:11,640;- What?
21:11,640;21:13,180;- The Broncos?
21:13,180;21:14,020;- No.
21:14,020;21:16,880;- Oh, the Ravens.
21:16,880;21:18,720;- The Ravens.
21:18,720;21:22,020;Also, Sam Gash won a Super Bowl in that same team.
21:22,020;21:22,860;- Oh shit.
21:22,860;21:23,920;- No shit.
21:23,920;21:25,260;- Good trivia.
21:25,260;21:26,520;- That is great trivia.
21:26,520;21:28,640;- I like that, nicely done.
21:28,640;21:30,000;Speaking of Ben Coates in this game though.
21:30,000;21:32,080;Wait, so how many rings does Ben Coates have?
21:32,080;21:33,560;He has just the one.
21:33,560;21:33,960;The one.
21:33,960;21:35,320;Just the one with the Ravens.
21:35,320;21:35,600;Wow.
21:35,600;21:39,680;The deal Ray Bork spent his shit ton of time in New England and
21:39,680;21:41,120;leave and immediately won a championship.
21:41,120;21:41,280;Yeah.
21:41,280;21:45,400;Hey, I'm sure everybody's happy for him at the time.
21:45,400;21:46,240;Well deserved.
21:46,240;21:47,440;Yeah, gotta do it.
21:47,440;21:48,240;For sure.
21:48,240;21:52,280;Uh, speaking of Ben Coates though, in this, he had, uh, himself a game in this.
21:52,280;21:53,200;Oh yeah.
21:53,200;21:56,400;Was, you know, pre-Gronk and he looked like it.
21:57,360;22:02,160;But the commentators were all about how much he pushed off.
22:02,160;22:03,000;Yeah.
22:03,000;22:06,080;Talking about how the defensive backs don't know if they need to like train
22:06,080;22:10,180;in tight, Quando or lift weights or whatever to be able to cover bank codes.
22:10,180;22:13,880;Cause all he does is run at defenders, hit them, bounce off, and then turn
22:13,880;22:14,960;around cause he's open.
22:14,960;22:15,720;Yeah.
22:15,720;22:19,960;Uh, it was a take on tight end names.
22:19,960;22:20,560;Okay.
22:20,560;22:21,960;Best, best names in football.
22:21,960;22:26,080;Now, I got a couple of written down here before you answer.
22:26,080;22:27,320;I shouldn't have.
22:27,320;22:31,560;Single syllable, sick last name, okay?
22:31,560;22:32,700;Ben Coates.
22:32,700;22:33,540;Yeah.
22:33,540;22:34,780;Jay Remersma.
22:34,780;22:35,880;That's the one I was going with.
22:35,880;22:37,400;Rob Gronkowski.
22:37,400;22:38,240;Mm-hmm.
22:38,240;22:39,560;Pat Fryermouth.
22:39,560;22:40,360;Mm.
22:40,360;22:43,460;Gary the Barnyard Dog Barnage.
22:43,460;22:45,080;(laughs)
22:45,080;22:46,360;Who the fuck is that?
22:46,360;22:47,200;Okay.
22:47,200;22:48,080;I played for Cleveland for like,
22:48,080;22:50,840;he had one good fantasy year and everybody,
22:50,840;22:53,680;I just love the name the Barnyard Dog.
22:53,680;22:54,520;That's really good.
22:54,520;22:55,360;Barnage.
22:55,360;23:01,920;Rutledge. Yeah, dude. I was only there's a germane Wiggins. I still yeah, I still think
23:01,920;23:09,200;fullbacks have better names. Oh, yeah, strong Sam gash. Natron means.
23:09,200;23:16,000;Natron means went to the same college as Ben Coates. What college?
23:16,000;23:20,800;Livingstone College. All right. Livingstone. Where's that?
23:21,600;23:26,240;North Carolina, it's HBCU. All right. Where in North Carolina is it?
23:26,240;23:31,520;I don't know. Don't you live in North Carolina, Greg?
23:31,520;23:34,880;Yeah, I never heard of it. I read it, but it did not.
23:34,880;23:39,360;I didn't even know Livingstone was a college here. I don't even know if it was a college here,
23:39,360;23:43,760;for being honest. Sounds like it would be a stat check then.
23:43,760;23:48,480;He's from Hendersonville though, which is a pretty popular place.
23:50,960;23:55,080;- All our New England Patriots fans will know all about
23:55,080;23:57,840;Henderson, North Carolina.
23:57,840;23:58,760;- Was that a-
23:58,760;24:00,520;- Patriots fans got fans everywhere.
24:00,520;24:03,640;- And you know how many Patriots fans
24:03,640;24:05,000;are in North Carolina, Andy?
24:05,000;24:06,580;- Yeah, like seven.
24:06,580;24:07,420;- No.
24:07,420;24:10,000;- Dude, we have a bar.
24:10,000;24:10,960;- Oh my God.
24:10,960;24:14,240;- Who's the Patriots player that lives there all the time,
24:14,240;24:15,080;Greg?
24:15,080;24:16,160;- Yeah.
24:16,160;24:17,280;- Antoine Harris.
24:17,280;24:18,120;- Yeah.
24:18,120;24:18,960;- Yes.
24:19,920;24:21,040;- I'm a NFL legend.
24:21,040;24:22,400;- Oh yeah, if he wants to come on the pod,
24:22,400;24:24,760;we will definitely have Antoine Harris on the pod.
24:24,760;24:28,240;- No, you just fucking slammed North Carolina like that.
24:28,240;24:29,440;- Yeah, you're from there.
24:29,440;24:32,080;I'm slamming you, not North Carolina.
24:32,080;24:32,920;- Fuck you, Andy.
24:32,920;24:33,760;- Okay, that's great.
24:33,760;24:36,880;- Natron means business.
24:36,880;24:39,080;- Natron refried means.
24:39,080;24:40,120;- That's a good one.
24:40,120;24:40,960;- That is a good one.
24:40,960;24:41,800;- Ben Wintercoat.
24:41,800;24:43,400;- I prefer that over Natron means business.
24:43,400;24:45,920;- And all time, Burmanism.
24:45,920;24:47,880;- Yeah, Natron refried.
24:47,880;24:50,960;Also, I tried to look up the album for Sam Gash.
24:50,960;24:51,800;- Oh no.
24:51,800;24:54,040;(laughing)
24:54,040;24:54,880;- And? - And?
24:54,880;24:55,880;- Nothing out there.
24:55,880;24:57,680;(laughing)
24:57,680;24:58,520;- So, are you going to do it?
24:58,520;25:00,120;- So, what'd you come up with then, Greg?
25:00,120;25:01,280;- Nothing.
25:01,280;25:02,120;- I need a list.
25:02,120;25:02,960;- I know you have a list.
25:02,960;25:04,800;- I didn't come up with a single thing, Mom.
25:04,800;25:07,040;(laughing)
25:07,040;25:10,440;- All right, speaking of running backs,
25:10,440;25:12,800;let's talk a bit about Robert Edwards.
25:12,800;25:14,840;'Cause he was supposed to be,
25:14,840;25:17,840;and I think this specific year, 1998,
25:17,840;25:22,840;he was the second coming of, uh, Curtis Martin.
25:22,840;25:26,160;- Yeah.
25:26,160;25:28,480;- 15 yards, 13 touchdowns.
25:28,480;25:33,480;- I thought that Robert Edwards was my original David Givens.
25:33,480;25:37,560;- Hmm, yeah, I can see that until you cast him aside.
25:37,560;25:38,720;- I was trying to find the guy that said,
25:38,720;25:40,920;everybody loved that were like up and coming.
25:40,920;25:43,640;And that was really in on both those guys.
25:43,640;25:45,280;- Yeah, that would have done it.
25:45,280;25:46,200;- Cause he was good this year.
25:46,200;25:51,320;He was okay in this game, but like if Robert Edwards had played in today's game, he'd be
25:51,320;25:52,320;really good.
25:52,320;25:54,460;You know, he'd catch the ball.
25:54,460;25:55,460;He can catch a ball.
25:55,460;25:57,320;He's pretty shaky in the hole.
25:57,320;26:00,800;He didn't have that like Antoine Smith type power.
26:00,800;26:02,000;That's true.
26:02,000;26:04,280;Which Curtis Martin sort of did.
26:04,280;26:05,280;Yeah.
26:05,280;26:06,440;The first round draft pick out of Georgia.
26:06,440;26:07,440;Yeah.
26:07,440;26:11,120;He also started his career with a touchdown in six straight games.
26:11,120;26:13,960;As far as six games, he just go to rushing touchdown.
26:13,960;26:15,560;13 touchdowns for rookies.
26:15,560;26:16,400;- No joke.
26:16,400;26:17,220;- No joke.
26:17,220;26:18,060;- He's a pro bowl.
26:18,060;26:21,760;- He's clearly pro bowl because he went to the pro bowl.
26:21,760;26:22,760;- Right, that just didn't.
26:22,760;26:24,520;- He didn't go to the pro bowl.
26:24,520;26:25,940;- Wait, how did he shred his knee?
26:25,940;26:30,120;- Yeah, it was like some fucking event.
26:30,120;26:31,960;Like he wasn't actually on the pro bowl roster.
26:31,960;26:35,060;He just went to this fucking beach party pro bowl thing
26:35,060;26:35,960;that they were doing.
26:35,960;26:36,960;- No shit.
26:36,960;26:37,800;- Yeah.
26:37,800;26:39,320;- I thought he was on the pro bowl
26:39,320;26:40,560;and that's how he shredded his knee.
26:40,560;26:41,400;- Makes it even worse.
26:41,400;26:42,240;He didn't even make the pro bowl.
26:42,240;26:43,280;- That makes it way worse.
26:43,280;26:44,280;- Oh, that's tough.
26:44,280;26:45,320;That is tough.
26:45,320;26:47,600;Do you want to hear what his injury was?
26:47,600;26:48,440;- I doubt it, but okay.
26:48,440;26:49,680;- I don't know.
26:49,680;26:50,520;- It was a-
26:50,520;26:51,800;- How gross is it?
26:51,800;26:54,600;- So there's also some interesting names.
26:54,600;26:56,840;So the guy that threw him the ball
26:56,840;27:00,120;was noted dickhead Charlie Batch.
27:00,120;27:00,960;- Oh shit.
27:00,960;27:02,400;- Just threw a fucking-
27:02,400;27:03,840;- So it's his fucking fault.
27:03,840;27:04,680;- Yeah, Joel Flacken.
27:04,680;27:06,720;- If he threw him a better ball, he probably doesn't.
27:06,720;27:07,560;- Yeah.
27:07,560;27:10,800;And Charles Woodson went up for it.
27:10,800;27:13,180;It was like, he got tangled up with Charles Woodson
27:13,180;27:14,020;on a beach, obviously.
27:14,020;27:15,460;You all know the story.
27:15,460;27:17,780;Came down, hyperextended his knee.
27:17,780;27:21,300;He tore his ACL, his MCL and his PCL
27:21,300;27:23,620;and partially tore his LCL.
27:23,620;27:24,480;- What the fuck?
27:24,480;27:26,300;- I didn't know that that had ligaments in there.
27:26,300;27:27,860;Yeah, what are those?
27:27,860;27:31,460;- That's basically every ligaments in your knee.
27:31,460;27:33,740;He had major nerve damage
27:33,740;27:37,700;and the worst part was that he sliced an artery in his knee.
27:37,700;27:41,860;So they were talking about amputation.
27:41,860;27:43,220;- Yeah.
27:43,220;27:46,840;So they said if the sutures hadn't held on the way to the hospital,
27:46,840;27:50,400;they, cause they sutured it up that they would have amputated and he never would
27:50,400;27:55,000;have walked again. Holy fuck. Oh, we see him again in. Yeah.
27:55,000;27:59,000;He comes back. Yeah. No, with the dolphins. I think it was like, Oh,
27:59,000;28:02,200;two maybe dude. He came back. Oh, three.
28:02,200;28:05,440;Played a couple of seasons in the NFL. Didn't really catch on them.
28:05,440;28:10,280;Went to Canada and 2000 yards seasons for real, real Argonauts.
28:10,320;28:11,680;Fuck yeah. Good for him.
28:11,680;28:12,000;Yeah.
28:12,000;28:12,400;Why?
28:12,400;28:13,600;That's exciting.
28:13,600;28:17,280;He came back on the patch and then they immediately caught on.
28:17,280;28:20,080;You got to give him another look.
28:20,080;28:25,440;If going through that rehab, that's got to be an absolutely insane rehab.
28:25,440;28:29,040;That's going to be so painful.
28:29,040;28:34,800;Well, in the book that Steve was talking about, they're talking about the Drew Bledsoe injury.
28:34,800;28:39,680;He basically had blood in his lungs.
28:39,680;28:40,680;Yeah.
28:40,680;28:47,240;And so they may have like, usually when things like this happen, you have to like cut open
28:47,240;28:52,440;the pec muscle to go in and like kind of clean things up.
28:52,440;28:55,160;Or what maybe wasn't in the lungs, it was like around the lungs, it was like collapsing
28:55,160;28:56,160;the lung.
28:56,160;29:00,560;And so what they tried to do is basically just like, they put a tube in and pumped the
29:00,560;29:05,280;blood out of his lungs and back into like where it was supposed to be.
29:05,280;29:08,980;And basically if that didn't work, they would have had to like cut in and like, go get it.
29:08,980;29:12,500;But then that would basically be the muscles that you use to throw football.
29:12,500;29:14,220;And he never would have played again.
29:14,220;29:15,220;Yep.
29:15,220;29:18,620;So he was like inches away from never playing football again.
29:18,620;29:20,820;That's not that book in open.
29:20,820;29:24,420;Kyrie Irvin's taken like six to seven maintenance days a season.
29:24,420;29:25,420;It's like, Jesus Christ.
29:25,420;29:27,740;You're just going to not get vaccinated.
29:27,740;29:29,660;So it's a play after games.
29:29,660;29:32,740;He doesn't get to play games in Brooklyn anyway.
29:32,740;29:35,100;That's why he's doing it.
29:35,100;29:36,100;Jesus Christ.
29:36,100;29:38,860;Yeah, but True Bloods got this game out though.
29:38,860;29:39,860;Yeah.
29:39,860;29:44,740;That's like, no one ever said True Bloods was not tough.
29:44,740;29:47,540;That guy was a tough motherfucker.
29:47,540;29:50,380;He just took too many shots like Ben Roethlisberger.
29:50,380;29:54,380;Yeah, he was just one of those guys who...
29:54,380;29:59,780;Yeah, he just, I feel like his pocket awareness always let him down.
29:59,780;30:04,340;That's a good point.
30:04,340;30:05,340;And then he would try to do too.
30:05,340;30:07,740;I mean, how many, you took a couple of sacks,
30:07,740;30:09,220;took four sacks in this game.
30:09,220;30:13,140;And I'd say at least two, maybe three of them
30:13,140;30:14,380;were preventable.
30:14,380;30:15,500;We could have just thrown the ball away,
30:15,500;30:16,900;but he's like waiting for something to happen,
30:16,900;30:18,580;waiting for something to happen takes a sack.
30:18,580;30:19,740;Oh, come on, man.
30:19,740;30:21,060;- Their offensive line wasn't great
30:21,060;30:23,140;besides Dave Wallabaugh.
30:23,140;30:23,980;- Wallabaugh.
30:23,980;30:24,820;(laughing)
30:24,820;30:27,420;- All time, all time New England name right there.
30:27,420;30:28,260;Dave Wallabaugh.
30:28,260;30:29,300;- I have the offensive line.
30:29,300;30:30,220;Let's take a look.
30:30,220;30:31,940;- Sounds like a boy. - Bruce Armstrong.
30:31,940;30:34,100;- Yeah, Bruce is, he's also on the private side.
30:34,100;30:35,300;- Hall of Famer, yeah.
30:35,300;30:36,980;Yeah, it was him versus Bruce Smith.
30:36,980;30:38,660;He's in the back line of his...
30:38,660;30:40,900;They've been going at it for fucking decades.
30:40,900;30:41,780;Oh yeah, exactly.
30:41,780;30:47,300;Damian Denson, who I believe was starting his first ever game at left guard, Dave Wallabaugh,
30:47,300;30:50,340;Todd Ruchi and Max Lane. You remember Max Lane?
30:50,340;30:50,820;Yeah.
30:50,820;30:53,860;Also a great name for an offensive lineman, Max Lane.
30:53,860;30:54,900;No.
30:54,900;30:57,380;You don't want to run behind a guy's Max Lane?
30:57,380;31:01,140;No. You want to pass rushing against a guy who's Max Lane.
31:01,140;31:01,620;Exactly.
31:01,620;31:02,500;Right to the quarterback.
31:02,500;31:04,740;You want to run behind that.
31:04,740;31:11,060;maximum lane. But Drew Bledsoe in this game 28 to 43, 246, three touchdowns, one pick for six.
31:11,060;31:16,180;Not too shabby. Outplayed by Doug Flugy though.
31:16,180;31:21,860;How many rushing yards did Robert Davids have? Because it was pretty much on true, I feel like.
31:21,860;31:29,620;13 carries 40 yards. Yeah, that's all true. They had Sam Adams, who's an absolutely massive.
31:29,620;31:36,740;Ted Washington. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I mean, he's not strong though versus Bruce Smith.
31:36,740;31:44,740;Yeah. This is the peak of their battles. Is it? Yeah. Bruce Armstrong made the pro ball in
31:44,740;31:51,700;1991, 94, 95, 96, and 97. Okay. And we're currently in 98. Bruce Smith.
31:53,460;31:56,180;His fucking career is insanity.
31:56,180;32:01,180;He made the pro bowl in 87, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95,
32:01,180;32:04,300;96, 97, 98.
32:04,300;32:10,800;And first team all pro in 87, 88, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97.
32:10,800;32:16,160;- Bruce Smith was outwards.
32:16,160;32:17,260;- This is on the backside,
32:17,260;32:19,760;the back nine of their careers though.
32:19,760;32:22,400;- Like not really like coming in,
32:22,400;32:24,000;They're about to go into their back nine,
32:24,000;32:25,840;but they both have made the parole ball
32:25,840;32:28,800;the last four years for both of them.
32:28,800;32:33,800;- Bruce Smith from '86 to '98,
32:33,800;32:40,420;there was one year where he didn't top double digit sacks.
32:40,420;32:43,800;- All time, leading sack leader, 200 sacks.
32:43,800;32:46,360;- He wasn't that big in this game though, right?
32:46,360;32:47,360;- No, he didn't do a lot.
32:47,360;32:48,200;- Bruce Armstrong.
32:48,200;32:50,760;- He got one half a sack.
32:50,760;32:52,900;- Our Bruce got him on this one.
32:52,900;32:53,760;- Yeah.
32:53,760;32:57,840;- 1990 had 19 sacks, 19.
32:57,840;32:59,680;He had an even 200 for his career.
32:59,680;33:02,120;You want to put it in reference of like a play,
33:02,120;33:04,880;a modern day player that you'd recognize.
33:04,880;33:07,400;The white free knee at 126 and a half.
33:07,400;33:08,240;(laughing)
33:08,240;33:09,240;- Oh!
33:09,240;33:10,080;- Yeah.
33:10,080;33:11,120;So 200-- - So 300 sacks.
33:11,120;33:11,960;- Experts.
33:11,960;33:14,600;- A fucking ridiculous number.
33:14,600;33:15,440;- Yeah.
33:15,440;33:17,440;Unbelievable.
33:17,440;33:19,180;Yeah.
33:19,180;33:21,180;I always had good players.
33:21,180;33:23,180;I mean, their receivers in this game were so good.
33:23,180;33:25,180;You know, they had so many awesome names in their receiver.
33:25,180;33:28,180;It was like Andre Reed's 200 catch.
33:28,180;33:29,180;Some shit like that.
33:29,180;33:30,180;Some like that.
33:30,180;33:33,180;No, 220 games for Andre Reed.
33:33,180;33:34,180;Oh, yeah.
33:34,180;33:37,180;And it was Mould's on your other side,
33:37,180;33:40,180;who was being covered by Tai Law.
33:40,180;33:41,180;And on the first play of the game,
33:41,180;33:43,180;Tai Law went over and dapped him up.
33:43,180;33:46,180;And we saw him kind of like shake hands before the first play.
33:46,180;33:47,180;Just kind of, you know.
33:47,180;33:51,860;He had that absolutely sick catch.
33:51,860;33:52,580;Yeah.
33:52,580;33:56,500;So that was, that was an amazing grab.
33:56,500;33:57,940;Yeah.
33:57,940;34:02,860;The 85 yard touchdown where he kind of one hand snagged it between
34:02,860;34:07,660;Tyler and the safety and our ran the other safety for an 85 yard touchdown.
34:07,660;34:11,220;But he caught it like it wasn't like the tip of the ball hit his palm.
34:11,220;34:13,380;It was like the flat part of the ball hit his palm.
34:13,380;34:16,620;He just kind of like grabs it, like a bunch of bananas and then just runs.
34:16,860;34:18,060;Just snagged it one day.
34:18,060;34:20,260;Yes. And then he's just gone.
34:20,260;34:21,380;Just outruns everybody.
34:21,380;34:23,740;Tylaws busts an ass, can't catch him.
34:23,740;34:26,620;Yeah. Which I mean, Tylaw, this is, I think, Greg,
34:26,620;34:28,860;peak Tylaw as well. Oh, yeah. Tylaws.
34:28,860;34:31,420;Absolutely. Seven picks coming into this game already.
34:31,420;34:33,140;It's week 13. Yeah.
34:33,140;34:35,740;So you got to pick every other game.
34:35,740;34:37,180;Did not have.
34:37,180;34:39,620;Their deal on is kind of nobody's alime backers.
34:39,620;34:41,460;They had some names.
34:41,460;34:44,340;Secondary had two Hall of Famers. Yeah.
34:45,860;34:48,620;And then some of the names, Steve Israel.
34:48,620;34:53,780;He's all over this broadcast.
34:53,780;34:54,620;You remember him, dude.
34:54,620;34:56,500;He's the guy that was from Jerusalem.
34:56,500;35:00,740;Yes, Greg.
35:00,740;35:02,260;Oh, oh yeah.
35:02,260;35:04,180;Now that you said that.
35:04,180;35:09,460;There's also, um, Mike Lombardi in the halftime show.
35:09,460;35:11,340;Oh, yeah.
35:11,340;35:15,740;Is that he is, I think he's come full circle and it's
35:15,740;35:18,220;back in the media, but he was on the Patriots front office.
35:18,220;35:21,940;He was a Patriots general manager, something along those lines.
35:21,940;35:22,180;Yeah.
35:22,180;35:25,540;He was definitely high up in the Patriots front office.
35:25,540;35:26,220;Yeah, he was.
35:26,220;35:30,460;It's kind of crazy to see him on the halftime of a 1998 show.
35:30,460;35:31,180;Right.
35:31,180;35:31,540;I know.
35:31,540;35:31,780;Yeah.
35:31,780;35:35,140;And the halftime show was way better because they actually showed
35:35,140;35:39,020;highlights, you know, they went game by game and showed some highlights
35:39,020;35:40,060;from the important ones.
35:40,060;35:43,180;Oh, we didn't have Keisha and Johnson just running his
35:43,180;35:44,900;mouth for fucking 35 minutes.
35:45,020;35:47,100;It's not even 35 minutes. It's like 35 seconds.
35:47,100;35:48,260;They go right back to commercial.
35:48,260;35:50,580;Yeah. Just making up what he's going to say on the spot.
35:50,580;35:52,220;Yeah. Oh, yeah.
35:52,220;35:55,300;That's on the by right.
35:55,300;35:57,740;One of the other big notes in this, I don't know if you guys notice, was
35:57,740;36:00,660;there was a huge push to bring back replay.
36:00,660;36:03,860;Yes. So I looked that up real quick.
36:03,860;36:08,220;And apparently, like instant replay had been around for a long time.
36:08,220;36:12,140;But it was disbanded in 1991
36:12,140;36:14,660;because the technology basically couldn't keep up with it.
36:14,660;36:20,940;It wasn't great. Um, so there seemed to be a lot of push and Steve,
36:20,940;36:24,820;going back to your point of like, they actually showed replays at halftime,
36:24,820;36:29,700;the highlights rather, uh, the highlights, a lot of them revolved around,
36:29,700;36:32,800;here's a play that would have been overturned if there was replay,
36:32,800;36:37,340;but it wasn't and it affected the game in this way. Um, so,
36:37,340;36:39,100;uh,
36:39,100;36:42,860;it worked out in the Patriots favor I would say in this game because the Patriots
36:42,860;36:47,960;on their game winning drive had a borderline completion to Sean
36:47,960;36:51,380;Jefferson. Greg was he in the order line? He wasn't even
36:51,380;36:51,940;close.
36:51,940;36:52,380;Question.
36:52,380;36:52,860;But it was close.
36:52,860;36:55,620;The problem is, you can't tell it's such crappy video quality.
36:55,620;36:56,900;That's what I'm saying. Yeah, tell him.
36:56,900;36:59,260;Yeah, with the with the feed that I had, I'm like, I'm going
36:59,260;37:01,540;to look at this, I'm gonna, I'm gonna bring it to Greg and be
37:01,540;37:04,780;like, Hey, look, you can tell that this pixel his foot is in
37:04,780;37:09,700;bounds. But you couldn't tell because both feet were one
37:09,700;37:14,380;pixel. So I'm not actually sure. But there was such an uproar
37:14,380;37:17,380;that I assume it looked pretty clear to me that it didn't have
37:17,380;37:19,900;a speed in. Of course, it's so hard because you're a pessimist.
37:19,900;37:22,980;Yeah. And you hate the Patriots for some I said I couldn't tell.
37:22,980;37:26,260;You guys should get your eyesight checked because it
37:26,260;37:29,580;seemed pretty obvious to me. Not that well, you were sitting at
37:29,580;37:32,620;the 50 yard line. We're watching it and fucking YouTube. That's
37:32,620;37:33,540;true. Later.
37:33,540;37:39,140;The whole stands were a chatter about it. I bet though. I could
37:39,140;37:41,380;Let's see it from my seat, dude.
37:41,380;37:45,740;So yeah, instant replay will be brought back in 1999,
37:45,740;37:48,340;the season after this, probably because of,
37:48,340;37:50,580;I think all the focus on all the plays
37:50,580;37:52,940;that would have been overturned if there was replay.
37:52,940;37:54,260;- Jokes on them, just go watch
37:54,260;37:56,420;that Saints NFC championship game.
37:56,420;37:57,980;- Yeah, doesn't fucking matter.
37:57,980;37:59,140;- Right?
37:59,140;38:00,880;Oh, if this play had gone differently,
38:00,880;38:03,420;maybe the game would have gone differently.
38:03,420;38:04,780;- We've come full circle again.
38:04,780;38:07,460;- That shit was so, there was instant replay though,
38:07,460;38:09,100;and they still didn't even look at it.
38:09,100;38:12,360;Yeah. That was fucking crazy. That was tough.
38:12,360;38:16,740;So let's talk about this fourth quarter. Cause this is like,
38:16,740;38:20,060;if you're going to watch a game or you're not going to watch highlights,
38:20,060;38:24,140;just watch the end of the, like the fourth quarter. Yeah.
38:24,140;38:25,020;10 minutes left.
38:25,020;38:29,780;Yeah. Bills marched down basically from the start of the fourth quarter onwards,
38:29,780;38:33,420;um, marched down on a, let's see,
38:33,420;38:38,060;14 plays 67 yard touchdown drive helped out by
38:38,660;38:41,860;two, three defensive penalties, a couple of passing
38:41,860;38:43,620;appearances that were a little ticky tack.
38:43,620;38:46,580;And a sweet Doug Flute scramble.
38:46,580;38:47,260;Oh yeah.
38:47,260;38:47,660;Yeah.
38:47,660;38:52,220;On third down to like reach and stretch and just barely make the line on
38:52,220;38:57,860;like a third and nine after they had like nine and a quarter.
38:57,860;38:58,940;He's the man.
38:58,940;39:03,980;He can't not love stretching all five foot six of him out to get that first down.
39:03,980;39:04,220;Yeah.
39:04,220;39:04,700;Perfect.
39:05,780;39:12,700;Um, so, and the touchdown pass to who is it to, uh, uh, Andre Reed diving catch
39:12,700;39:14,900;at the back of the end, though, it was super nice.
39:14,900;39:15,260;Yeah.
39:15,260;39:15,940;It was a nice play.
39:15,940;39:20,420;Um, page, get the ball back and miss a field goal out of an interior, miss field
39:20,420;39:20,660;goal.
39:20,660;39:22,700;So if Connor you're listening, that's your boy.
39:22,700;39:27,580;Um, to be fair, why are they going for a field goal down four points?
39:27,580;39:28,980;That's, you know, Pete Carroll.
39:29,820;39:36,160;Um, but the Patriots managed to hold the bills to punting at the two minute
39:36,160;39:40,000;warning. Um, so the page gets the ball back with, uh, I think a minute,
39:40,000;39:47,360;52 left after the punt and drive 10 plays, 82 yards, uh, with the play that
39:47,360;39:52,100;we just mentioned, the questionable fourth down conversion where, uh,
39:52,100;39:55,220;Sean Jefferson, I'm going to say gets both feet down.
39:55,220;39:58,380;Cause I'm a Patriots fan and, uh, leaning out of bounds catches the
39:58,380;40:02,740;ball for the first down. That was on the fourth down. That
40:02,740;40:05,780;was fourth down. Yeah, I didn't realize with a running clock with
40:05,780;40:09,540;a running clock, Ben Coates had caught the third down. No, he
40:09,540;40:12,580;missed. They caught the third down got tackled in bounds. Yeah.
40:12,580;40:15,660;And they had no time out. So they had to run set and then run
40:15,660;40:16,620;the play real quick.
40:16,620;40:21,780;Yep. And just barely converted it. And then I don't know if it
40:21,780;40:22,900;was next play a couple plays later.
40:22,900;40:25,860;No, there's four seconds left after that.
40:25,860;40:27,860;That's right. Yeah. So it was exactly the next place. They have
40:27,860;40:30,060;one shot at the end zone through the end zone.
40:30,060;40:33,740;And there was a passing appearance call in the end zone on Terry Glenn,
40:33,740;40:35,100;whoever the defender was.
40:35,100;40:35,620;It doesn't matter.
40:35,620;40:37,620;He, he, he, he,
40:37,620;40:41,780;Terry Glenn had a good look at it and the dude got pushed right in the back,
40:41,780;40:42,620;right?
40:42,620;40:45,380;Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was, you think it was a good call,
40:45,380;40:47,140;even on the crap fucking video.
40:47,140;40:49,220;Yeah. I think it was, I think it was a blatant pass interference,
40:49,220;40:51,460;but you never call that. It doesn't matter.
40:51,460;40:52,780;Come on.
40:52,780;40:55,420;If you don't think that was a passing appearance.
40:55,700;40:57,860;No, anything goes on a Hail Mary, dude.
40:57,860;41:00,260;Dude, he got a Hail Mary from the 20 yard line.
41:00,260;41:01,420;It's a 20 yard pass.
41:01,420;41:01,700;Yeah.
41:01,700;41:02,020;Dude.
41:02,020;41:03,300;Look at the, look at the.
41:03,300;41:03,780;Yeah.
41:03,780;41:05,500;I get the shitload of people there.
41:05,500;41:08,260;It's a lot of, there's a lot of traffic there, but it's not like a fucking
41:08,260;41:11,540;absolute bomb from midfield where it's in the air forever.
41:11,540;41:12,460;It's a jump ball.
41:12,460;41:13,540;He was, no blood.
41:13,540;41:14,860;So fucking Zing that thing.
41:14,860;41:18,300;And it was right to Terry Glenn and he got put in the lower back and
41:18,300;41:19,780;just fucking, and he bent out.
41:19,780;41:22,900;I love that Steve's coming to my side.
41:22,900;41:25,300;He used to be like, taking sides.
41:25,380;41:26,100;You don't want to do that.
41:26,100;41:27,200;Fucking play the ball.
41:27,200;41:28,080;He didn't play the ball.
41:28,080;41:31,880;He pushed the receiver right in the back and the judge was right there at the
41:31,880;41:34,640;end zone line because that's where the play was because that's where he's got to
41:34,640;41:37,240;see and he sees the guy just get pushed right in the back.
41:37,240;41:38,520;Of course, it's right there.
41:38,520;41:40,020;You want to hear a quote from.
41:40,020;41:41,720;Ty law himself.
41:41,720;41:43,280;Okay.
41:43,280;41:45,600;If I was them, I'd be ticked off too.
41:45,600;41:49,360;You never see that, that call on a hail Mary, which it was.
41:49,360;41:51,380;I know where they're coming from.
41:51,380;41:53,560;These officials are making way too many calls.
41:53,560;41:54,920;It's getting worse and worse every week.
41:54,920;41:58,320;- Tai Long, he's on the Patriots and he's completely agree.
41:58,320;42:01,000;- Imagine that in this day and age?
42:01,000;42:05,520;Imagine the social media firestorm with that kind of comment?
42:05,520;42:06,440;- Twitter would melt out.
42:06,440;42:08,920;- Well, Bellcheck A would never allow that.
42:08,920;42:10,880;That's a Pete Carroll kind of comment.
42:10,880;42:11,720;- Oh yeah.
42:11,720;42:12,880;(laughs)
42:12,880;42:13,720;- Good point.
42:13,720;42:16,320;- B, the rules are probably different back then as well.
42:16,320;42:18,120;Where they, I mean, you saw in this game,
42:18,120;42:20,080;just rewatching it,
42:20,080;42:22,120;how much they're glorifying hits and stuff.
42:22,120;42:24,760;It's just like a little out of date.
42:24,760;42:29,760;Yeah, there was a lot more hitting in the defensive backfield just generally.
42:29,760;42:33,760;Yeah, but there was still like I think even on the the bill such on drive,
42:33,760;42:37,560;there's still some like you really going to call that like it just later the game.
42:37,560;42:38,760;You're going to throw the flag there.
42:38,760;42:41,560;It's like, okay, they had been calling it tight on the bills drive.
42:41,560;42:44,760;So yeah, I don't think I've ever seen a pass interference on it.
42:44,760;42:46,360;Hail Mary though outside of this.
42:46,360;42:51,160;I feel like I guess I'm saying Hail Mary and I've seen some like pretty
42:51,160;42:54,200;agree just like tackling a player's and Hail Mary's.
42:54,200;42:55,400;Well, how far was the ball there?
42:55,400;42:56,920;They tackled Gronks.
42:56,920;42:58,280;Yeah, exactly.
42:58,280;42:59,160;That was one.
42:59,160;42:59,960;That one's pretty.
42:59,960;43:01,160;That one's like egregious.
43:01,160;43:03,800;The one where they tackled Gronk in the Super Bowl.
43:03,800;43:04,300;Yeah.
43:04,300;43:07,400;And I like I wasn't even that mad about that.
43:07,400;43:08,920;So I was like, it's fucking Hail Mary.
43:08,920;43:10,360;That's what you got, you know?
43:10,360;43:11,000;How far was it?
43:11,000;43:12,520;I feel like it wasn't a Hail Mary though.
43:12,520;43:13,640;It was like 30 yards.
43:13,640;43:15,640;30 yards not that long.
43:15,640;43:17,560;Yeah, but Steve, it's a jump ball, right?
43:17,560;43:20,360;It's a throw it up and everybody jumps to try and catch it.
43:20,360;43:25,860;Well, every ball blood. So throws is a jump ball. It's true. We just cannot call a passing
43:25,860;43:26,860;appearance.
43:26,860;43:32,560;Bro got a broken finger. Of course. He actually slung this one in there. He was slinging it.
43:32,560;43:38,500;Either way blood. So yeah, came back and in the next day, you can talk all you want. And
43:38,500;43:42,060;you know, this is the same goes to like listening to chief fans talk about, oh yeah, well, you
43:42,060;43:45,900;know, if you, he didn't lie, if what's his face didn't line up off size and that game's
43:45,900;43:50,540;always like, yeah, well, the game, like the page didn't win it on that play. Like you
43:50,540;43:56,580;can still make the stops. You can still like make the stops in the in overtime. So the
43:56,580;44:00,740;deals have one play, they all they had to do was start a page for one play with this
44:00,740;44:06,300;vaunted defense with, you know, Bruce Smith and all those all the players on it.
44:06,300;44:09,980;Well, they did stop. There's no other players. And then there's a flag thrown. So they had
44:09,980;44:10,980;stopped for another point.
44:10,980;44:15,260;There's one, but like Belichick says, Greg, you got to play every single play just like
44:15,260;44:19,740;Like, you know, the same thing came to bite us in the ass and we put Gronk out there on
44:19,740;44:23,140;the skip get coverage in Miami or turned it for a touchdown.
44:23,140;44:26,020;So you gotta play every single play in the game.
44:26,020;44:28,180;See, it was absolutely correct.
44:28,180;44:30,900;I don't know how these officials are allowed to make those calls.
44:30,900;44:31,900;What do you mean?
44:31,900;44:32,900;They get paid.
44:32,900;44:33,900;Wait, Philip.
44:33,900;44:34,900;Imagine that.
44:34,900;44:35,900;Wait, Philip, son.
44:35,900;44:43,260;Coach Wade Phillips doesn't understand.
44:43,260;44:46,380;Let's let's talk about that because the Patriots throw
44:46,380;44:49,980;it's a Ben Coates touchdown to Ben Coates back in the end zone.
44:49,980;44:52,340;Great throw by sick play.
44:52,340;44:53,380;Yeah, absolutely.
44:53,380;44:54,180;Perfect action.
44:54,180;44:55,940;I mean, let's sort of coats.
44:55,940;44:57,060;It's a classic.
44:57,060;44:57,980;They let's play action.
44:57,980;44:59,780;But, oh, yeah.
44:59,780;45:03,260;With a rush at his feet, tosses it over the over the
45:03,260;45:05,380;into the corner of the end zone, touchdown Ben Coates.
45:05,380;45:07,020;With a fucking brother, too.
45:07,020;45:09,460;But what a touch pass.
45:09,460;45:14,460;So it's Bill's 21, Patriots 23, game's over, no time left.
45:14,460;45:17,420;The Bills just walk off the field.
45:17,420;45:20,060;There's still an extra point left to do.
45:20,060;45:21,940;And the Bills like, "No, we're not coming back out,
45:21,940;45:23,000;so fuck it."
45:23,000;45:26,600;So the Patriots line up to kick the field goal,
45:26,600;45:29,260;but the crowd starts chanting two,
45:29,260;45:30,820;like go for two, go for two.
45:30,820;45:32,500;And so they snap it directly out of infinity
45:32,500;45:34,860;who walks into the end zone for the two point conversion.
45:34,860;45:36,020;- Oh, you started that, Greg?
45:36,020;45:37,060;- I started that chant.
45:37,060;45:37,900;- Of course you did.
45:37,900;45:38,740;- Good job.
45:38,740;45:43,460;Patriots 25, Buffalo 21 game.
45:43,460;45:44,460;- Question.
45:44,460;45:48,520;- Now the Patriots and Bills are tied at seven and five,
45:48,520;45:52,340;couple games back of Miami and the Jets.
45:52,340;45:54,100;- What about nowadays?
45:54,100;45:55,940;Do they make you still kick the extra point?
45:55,940;45:57,740;I feel like it's game over when it's quite a touchdown,
45:57,740;45:58,580;right? - They do.
45:58,580;46:01,140;Because remember the playoff game
46:01,140;46:02,740;between the Saints and the Vikings.
46:02,740;46:04,020;- No, they don't make you kick it.
46:04,020;46:04,900;- They did.
46:04,900;46:05,940;They made them come back out.
46:05,940;46:08,260;And so they just like the Saints just sent out
46:08,260;46:12,060;whoever the fuck like still was partially dressed and just like stood there and they
46:12,060;46:13,060;kicked their shirt.
46:13,060;46:15,500;They don't, they don't make you do it anymore.
46:15,500;46:19,420;I feel like over time, but no, it literally happened.
46:19,420;46:23,820;No, there's like a rule of like, there's something to do with like, if there's, if it doesn't
46:23,820;46:26,540;change the outcome of the game, you don't have to do it.
46:26,540;46:30,660;But like, there's games, there's like one second left or something that they, I find
46:30,660;46:37,460;that hard to believe only because of the money in betting.
46:37,460;46:38,860;I think that's why they changed it.
46:38,860;46:40,220;- Craig's right.
46:40,220;46:41,900;Having to kick a useless extra point
46:41,900;46:44,140;is way harder for Vegas.
46:44,140;46:45,060;- Yeah.
46:45,060;46:47,240;- They'd rather him just win outright, you know?
46:47,240;46:48,080;- Yeah, maybe.
46:48,080;46:51,660;Apparently this game was a three and a half point spread
46:51,660;46:52,860;for the Patriots too.
46:52,860;46:54,780;- Which is strange.
46:54,780;46:55,620;- Really?
46:55,620;46:57,740;- No, no, they passed their favor by one and a half.
46:57,740;46:58,580;- No, I see.
46:58,580;47:00,860;I've found conflicting reports on this.
47:00,860;47:02,180;- Did you?
47:02,180;47:04,460;- I found two different sources that said
47:04,460;47:07,060;it was Patriots were favored by three and a half.
47:07,060;47:11,580;And that this was part of the reason that they brought back review was because
47:11,580;47:17,420;all these bettors were all pissed off because they lost money on this game.
47:17,420;47:20,180;Interesting. Well, I don't think it would have mattered either way, right?
47:20,180;47:21,940;If it's one and a half or three and a half.
47:21,940;47:25,580;Yeah. No, what? Because the two point conversion is what changed it.
47:25,580;47:27,780;If they kicked the field, they would have won by three.
47:27,780;47:30,380;Well, I think the touchdown, regardless, if it's one and a half,
47:30,380;47:32,660;the Pats now covered because they won.
47:32,660;47:34,700;Right. If it's one and a half, it doesn't matter.
47:34,700;47:36,660;If the Pats were favored by three and a half.
47:36,660;47:44,720;You also got to think that 1998 Vegas lines are probably not as well set as, you know,
47:44,720;47:46,300;2022 Vegas lines.
47:46,300;47:49,940;Maybe a lot more data out there for them to analyze.
47:49,940;47:50,940;That's true.
47:50,940;47:51,940;You make a good point.
47:51,940;47:52,940;All right.
47:52,940;47:54,740;You got anything else you want to do best and worst?
47:54,740;47:55,740;Sure.
47:55,740;47:57,540;All right, Greg, you go first.
47:57,540;47:59,000;Give me your best and worst.
47:59,000;48:02,160;My best was just enjoying the crowd, being there in person.
48:02,160;48:04,960;You know, you can't really put a price on that.
48:04,960;48:09,840;It's a memory that I'll hold forever in my life that you guys won't hold in your lives.
48:09,840;48:14,720;Well, I already went to the Bruins game, so I had no case.
48:14,720;48:16,400;Yeah, I got the red socks.
48:16,400;48:24,920;Yeah, I know my worst is Sam gash. He's a little baby. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I bet you wouldn't
48:24,920;48:26,400;say it to his face.
48:26,400;48:29,760;Sam gash. Come on down here.
48:29,760;48:31,440;He's still kick your ass.
48:31,440;48:32,640;Am I ticked off?
48:32,640;48:34,320;You bleeping bet I'm ticked off.
48:34,320;48:40,240;For that official to behave like that, that's just expletive.
48:40,240;48:41,280;They cost us the game.
48:41,280;48:44,880;What it comes down to is we had something stolen from us and we're ticked off.
48:44,880;48:48,480;Apparently, he was a big baby about getting cut by the Pats, too.
48:48,480;48:49,680;Really?
48:49,680;48:55,360;He dedicated the rest of his careers making the Patriots regret cutting him or some shit.
48:55,360;48:57,840;How long was he on the Patriots?
48:57,840;48:59,040;That sounds like something that--
48:59,040;48:59,520;Five years.
48:59,520;49:02,800;That sounds like something that Ella may do, you know?
49:02,800;49:04,800;He's a big one.
49:04,800;49:06,000;Or even like a...
49:06,000;49:07,120;He's the NFL dude.
49:07,120;49:11,280;Even like Rodney Harrison. That's something he would do.
49:11,280;49:14,000;You know, anything to get up for a game.
49:14,000;49:16,960;I think that's very, that's very Rodney.
49:16,960;49:20,160;Yeah, that does feel very Rodney, right?
49:20,160;49:22,480;So. All right, Steve, best and worst.
49:22,480;49:26,160;You to go, Andy. I'm still figuring out mine.
49:26,160;49:29,040;All right. My best was that they announced that the special team
49:29,040;49:34,400;coach in this game, who the special teams actually I thought did quite a good job, Dante Scarnecchia.
49:34,400;49:36,400;That's so fun.
49:36,400;49:42,400;And my worst outside of Greg getting to go to this game instead of me, which is some bullshit,
49:42,400;49:51,280;was your typical Pete Carroll lack of, not focus, well, that's what I'm looking for, lack of
49:51,280;49:57,920;discipline, I guess. On the last drive, the fourth quarter, the Bills had on defense,
49:57,920;50:03,360;They had to call a timeout one, they had to burn a timeout because they had 12 men on the field plus
50:03,360;50:09,440;two running off when the snap was about to happen. And then three plays later, there was a flag for
50:09,440;50:16,560;12 men on the field to get. And on top of a couple of passing of fair and some couples just
50:16,560;50:22,000;bullshit penalties right down the end, it was just like, I can see why the page didn't keep them.
50:22,000;50:26,720;This is the type of coach that would fucking throw it from the two yard line with Marsh
50:26,720;50:28,720;He's going to be a Hall of Fame coach.
50:28,720;50:29,720;Do you think?
50:29,720;50:30,720;With college?
50:30,720;50:31,720;Yeah.
50:31,720;50:32,720;Yeah.
50:32,720;50:33,720;Yeah.
50:33,720;50:34,720;Yeah.
50:34,720;50:35,720;Yeah.
50:35,720;50:36,720;Put them right next to Dan Diodor would be fine.
50:36,720;50:37,720;Failures.
50:37,720;50:38,720;Wing of Hall of Fame.
50:38,720;50:39,720;Steve.
50:39,720;50:41,720;He was going to go into broad peak.
50:41,720;50:42,720;He was going to go into broadcasting.
50:42,720;50:44,720;He's going to be a great broadcaster.
50:44,720;50:45,720;You already hear now.
50:45,720;50:46,720;He's going to be awful.
50:46,720;50:48,720;He's going to hear his going through the entire fucking time.
50:48,720;50:49,720;He is.
50:49,720;50:52,720;My, my worst is actually Patriots special teams, Andy.
50:52,720;50:55,540;My worst is actually Patriots special teams, Andy.
50:55,540;50:58,080;Well, go fuck yourself then.
50:58,080;51:02,480;There was that absolute dime punt hit by Tom Tupa.
51:02,480;51:07,200;They had bounced like three times in between the goal line and the one yard
51:07,200;51:08,520;line, and then they downed it.
51:08,520;51:10,920;And then the guy who's downing it had his foot in the end zone.
51:10,920;51:13,040;So actually they showed the replay.
51:13,040;51:16,200;The reason they call a touchback because the ball literally bounced on the
51:16,200;51:17,520;goal line and then came out.
51:17,520;51:18,880;That's why it was bullshit.
51:18,880;51:20,760;So it was actually almost the perfect pun.
51:21,200;51:27,000;missed it by six inches. Tom Tupa BT dubs punting.
51:27,000;51:31,560;Yes, he had. That was a great pun. What else he had?
51:31,560;51:37,840;There was a, so it's like a two play sequence here. All right.
51:37,840;51:42,960;It was Robert Edwards trying to go over the pile. Not really his
51:42,960;51:45,840;strength and getting immediately the ball popped out. And then
51:45,840;51:50,840;the ball falls into a 1998 goal line pile, you know?
51:50,840;51:54,160;Oh yeah. And like, that was just an absolute,
51:54,160;51:56,600;it took like four and a half minutes to untangle.
51:56,600;51:57,440;We had the ball.
51:57,440;52:00,920;Yeah. It was like, I don't even remember who it was.
52:00,920;52:05,040;Like, well, whoever had the ball first definitely doesn't have it anymore.
52:05,040;52:08,120;Yeah. And the, well, look at the referee trying to pull it out.
52:08,120;52:15,520;They didn't even know too, had it. So, or they did it. I missed it.
52:15,520;52:19,920;Eventually, yeah, but it took a while whoever that was props
52:19,920;52:22,640;because that was an old school fumble pile.
52:22,640;52:23,160;Yeah.
52:23,160;52:28,280;And then the next play was that Robert Edwards touchdown pass
52:28,280;52:31,400;because they're like, well, we ain't going to run it in with Robert Edwards.
52:31,400;52:33,320;I try and it was actually really nice.
52:33,320;52:34,000;It's like a night.
52:34,000;52:36,280;It's like a recent play design, you know, it was world.
52:36,280;52:39,080;Have Ben code, set a little screen for the linebacker trying to cover him
52:39,080;52:41,840;and then run him right across the goal line and then zip it right to him.
52:41,840;52:43,360;That's pretty cool.
52:43,360;52:44,240;That's awesome.
52:44,240;52:52,120;Cool. All right. Well, that'll do it for 1998. Thanks for taking the trip back in time with
52:52,120;52:53,780;us except for Greg.
52:53,780;52:56,360;Even further back in time.
52:56,360;53:02,320;So next week, next episode, whenever that is, might not be next week. Will B, will be back
53:02,320;53:08,080;to 2004 in the AFC divisional game. Who are they playing, Greg?
53:08,080;53:12,480;I thought we were doing our special edition Roe v. Wade episode next week.
53:12,480;53:14,480;- No, we're talking playoffs.
53:14,480;53:15,720;(laughing)
53:15,720;53:17,600;- More important things to talk about.
53:17,600;53:22,780;2004, the vision of playoff.
53:22,780;53:25,980;- No, we're talking playoffs.
53:25,980;53:29,620;- Indianapolis Colts coming to Gillette Stadium.
53:29,620;53:31,040;- Oh, the Colts, really?
53:31,040;53:35,720;- The red hot record setting, Indianapolis Colts.
53:35,720;53:38,760;So I believe this was their season where they had
53:38,760;53:43,160;three wide receivers, all with over a thousand receiving arts.
53:43,160;53:44,280;Yeah, yeah.
53:44,280;53:44,760;Yeah.
53:44,760;53:47,560;Satan Manning's record breaking back year, right?
53:47,560;53:48,040;Right.
53:48,040;53:49,800;We've been hearing about this all year about it.
53:49,800;53:51,640;Spare me.
53:51,640;53:51,960;Okay.
53:51,960;53:55,960;I've heard all that before.
53:55,960;54:00,680;Well, you'll hear it all again next time on the Patriots.
54:00,680;54:01,520;- Deja vu.
54:01,520;54:02,360;- Deja vu.
54:02,360;54:03,680;- See you later.
54:03,680;54:04,680;- See you later.
54:04,680;54:05,680;- See you later.
54:05,680;54:19,680;FLOORi

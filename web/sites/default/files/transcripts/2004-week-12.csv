00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:19,440;"I am not your mother."
00:19,440;00:29,080;"Welcome back to the Phages Sanicy Podcast, where we are going back and rewatching every"
00:29,080;00:33,160;"of the Patriots dynasty era starting 2001."
00:33,160;00:37,840;"This week we are up to season 2004, week 12."
00:37,840;00:41,640;"The Patriots at home against the Baltimore Ravens"
00:41,640;00:44,440;"in neck deep in mud."
00:44,440;00:47,240;"Nice and rainy and muddy and gross."
00:47,240;00:50,480;"So speaking of muddy and gross with me today,"
00:50,480;00:52,680;"I'm your host, Andy Brown with me today."
00:52,680;00:54,680;"Are both my brothers, Steve Brown,"
00:54,680;00:57,360;"who is feeling muddy in the butt area, I think."
00:59,000;01:00,000;"That's fine."
01:00,000;01:01,000;"Yes, yes."
01:01,000;01:03,280;"Not a little bit less, but I'm here."
01:03,280;01:04,280;"All right."
01:04,280;01:05,280;"Fighting through it."
01:05,280;01:06,280;"I love it."
01:06,280;01:11,120;"And Greg Brown as well, who is muddy in the upper lip area at the moment."
01:11,120;01:12,120;"That's right."
01:12,120;01:13,120;"That is also true."
01:13,120;01:14,120;"Yeah."
01:14,120;01:15,120;"Quite a mustache."
01:15,120;01:16,120;"But Greg's like a blonde mud."
01:16,120;01:18,080;"I don't know if that's a thing."
01:18,080;01:19,080;"Yeah."
01:19,080;01:20,080;"Let's be clear."
01:20,080;01:24,280;"This mud on my mustache is not the same as the mud since Steve's butt."
01:24,280;01:27,480;"I want that on the record."
01:27,480;01:29,480;"I'm not sure."
01:29,480;01:30,480;"Noted."
01:30,480;01:31,480;"Yeah."
01:31,480;01:32,480;"All right."
01:32,480;01:40,760;"But before we get into the game, I think we should address the elephant in the room."
01:40,760;01:52,960;"We actually got a review of the podcast from somebody we do not know from Breon P, user."
01:52,960;01:59,200;"enjoyable but needs to focus on Pat's more or Patre's more. And so I quote, ""This"
01:59,200;02:03,600;"podcast is enjoyable but has a lot of random rambling,"" which I think has proven true already."
02:03,600;02:07,760;"It would be so much better if the host could focus on the game in Patre's. For example,"
02:07,760;02:11,520;"I'm not very interested in what they are having for dinner or references from their past."
02:11,520;02:19,760;"If they can focus on the past, it would be so much better. So, I, being the eldest brother"
02:19,760;02:26,800;"and the one who likes to please people, we'll be focusing more on the game. Greg, the youngest brother"
02:26,800;02:32,160;"will be doing the exact opposite. So you can expect to hear more of the game from me"
02:32,160;02:36,080;"and more of what Greg had for dinner, I think, going forward."
02:36,080;02:41,680;"See, I, as the middle brother, agree with both sides. This guy's points somebody disagree with."
02:41,680;02:44,480;"I too don't want to hear what Greg has for dinner."
02:44,480;02:45,120;"Fair."
02:45,120;02:46,960;"Why you eating on the podcast, Greg?"
02:46,960;02:48,400;"Yeah, that's a dick move, Greg."
02:48,400;02:49,880;"- 'Cause it's during dinner time."
02:49,880;02:54,960;"I had a nice big plate full of China food."
02:54,960;02:57,040;"Shout out Eddie Lacey."
02:57,040;02:57,880;"What about that?"
02:57,880;03:01,840;"- You know, mixing a little retro football reference."
03:01,840;03:03,840;"- But yes, that's the other part I disagree with."
03:03,840;03:04,960;"Not talking about our past,"
03:04,960;03:06,280;"the whole point of doing this podcast"
03:06,280;03:07,880;"is to bullshit with you guys."
03:07,880;03:08,720;"- I agree."
03:08,720;03:11,840;"I think we have to talk about our past"
03:11,840;03:15,000;"because our past is tied into these football games."
03:15,000;03:17,680;"So you'll probably have more of that as well."
03:17,680;03:18,520;"- Oh, we will talk about that."
03:18,520;03:22,200;"- Also, sometimes like football's boring, you know?"
03:22,200;03:23,040;"I get bored."
03:23,040;03:25,120;"Like I want to talk about other things sometimes."
03:25,120;03:27,400;"What's on your mind, Greg?"
03:27,400;03:28,280;"- Is it technically a lock, Greg?"
03:28,280;03:29,120;"- I don't know."
03:29,120;03:29,960;"It's just like--"
03:29,960;03:32,120;"- You ever try any new medication or--"
03:32,120;03:33,360;"- Football's awesome, right?"
03:33,360;03:34,200;"Everybody loves football."
03:34,200;03:36,840;"But sometimes football can be boring."
03:36,840;03:37,680;"- I agree."
03:37,680;03:41,480;"- Speaking of which, the second half of this game,"
03:41,480;03:44,080;"if you're going to find it, watch it, don't watch,"
03:44,080;03:46,280;"well, watch the third quarter."
03:46,280;03:48,200;"- Actually, I would just watch the third quarter of this game."
03:48,200;03:49,720;"- The mud ball."
03:49,720;03:50,880;"- Yeah."
03:50,880;03:55,880;"This was a game that they actually had a shot,"
03:55,880;03:59,040;"which I've sent you to in the chat,"
03:59,040;04:04,040;"of a literal wooden ruler stuck in the mud."
04:04,040;04:10,280;"And I believe it is at up to two inches."
04:10,280;04:11,120;"- Yes."
04:11,120;04:12,480;"- Closing it on two and a half."
04:12,480;04:14,320;"- It's a stick in the mud."
04:14,320;04:15,800;"- Yeah, literally."
04:15,800;04:21,640;"literally a stick in the mod. Yeah, it's the it's the photo representation of your role in this podcast."
04:21,640;04:30,920;"So what you're telling me is Steve tried to bang the field. He's just about to be touching."
04:30,920;04:37,880;"Fun fact, you can see that ruler on the prime time highlights. Oh, really? They showed up."
04:37,880;04:41,160;"Yeah, that's right. So we will link the we'll link the prime time highlights."
04:41,160;04:46,200;"and I'm glad I only watched the Primetime highlights. Most of those have been sick, but also this"
04:46,200;04:51,000;"looked like a super boring game. Yeah, I did watch this whole thing. I finished it today. Yep."
04:51,000;04:57,000;"I had to get back in the style. It's been a while because of the new additions to my family, but"
04:57,000;05:02,440;"it was nice to watch old school football again, and there's nothing more old school than"
05:02,440;05:10,040;"the seven and three Ravens visiting the 91 Patriots on Sunday night in the rain in the mud,"
05:10,040;05:14,440;"Went back when they still had like actual grass fields, which was nice."
05:14,440;05:20,360;"But if you take a look at some of the shots of this, this game, literally that between the hashes,"
05:20,360;05:25,960;"the entire field is just brown, like browner than, you know, our reans."
05:25,960;05:29,320;"Again, really glad I didn't watch it considering up in sick all week."
05:29,320;05:36,760;"Yeah. And the, I don't know this game in the first half, the second half, but one of the stats"
05:36,760;05:41,480;"they put up, I believe it was the second half when the Patriots started running away with it,"
05:41,480;05:45,480;"because at halftime it was 3-3. So again, didn't miss any of the first half."
05:45,480;05:50,040;"Unless you like defensive battles, regular defensive battles kind of guy?"
05:50,040;05:52,600;"Yeah, it depends. Sometimes I like them."
05:52,600;05:55,000;"Because I mean, this is the Ray Lewis."
05:55,000;05:58,760;"Yeah, they're two good defenses though, so that's kind of enticing."
05:58,760;06:04,120;"Yeah, Ed Reed on this, like early Ed Reed. Literally there's one play where he takes on"
06:04,120;06:06,900;"on Corey Dillon head to head in Open Field"
06:06,900;06:09,740;"and wins that battle, which I don't think happens very often."
06:09,740;06:10,740;"- Not this year."
06:10,740;06:15,340;"- No, so I remember I'd read at Miami."
06:15,340;06:17,860;"I was my first memory, he said,"
06:17,860;06:19,860;"he had a big play against Boston College"
06:19,860;06:24,700;"where he like scooped and scored when Boston College is good."
06:24,700;06:25,600;"- No, yeah, yeah."
06:25,600;06:29,140;"- The last time you were good?"
06:29,140;06:33,980;"- Yeah, wasn't that that William Green year?"
06:33,980;06:37,980;"Remember that guy was in the Heisman running vaguely. Yeah."
06:37,980;06:41,540;"He was a beast. Wasn't Miami good that year though."
06:41,540;06:44,780;"Yeah, 2001 weren't they good that year? Yeah, they were right."
06:44,780;06:48,580;"Yeah. It seemed good when they had Matt Ryan too, but they haven't been good since."
06:48,580;06:49,780;"Right. No."
06:49,780;06:54,900;"Yeah. The hurricanes were the 2001 National Championship."
06:54,900;06:56,420;"Yeah."
06:56,420;06:59,700;"And I think there was like a bunch of good players on that team as well."
06:59,700;07:01,540;"Yeah."
07:01,900;07:07,100;"Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Reggie Wayne and read were roommates during the time at you Miami"
07:07,100;07:11,100;"Didn't then say they're gonna make or they made a 34 30 about that team"
07:11,100;07:15,260;"Was it that team? I know there was yeah, someone's Vince Wolf work and"
07:15,260;07:17,260;"You"
07:17,260;07:23,740;"Right. I don't think Vince Wolf work overlap. I think I looked that up and they missed by like a year or so"
07:23,740;07:26,380;"but"
07:26,380;07:28,380;"Yeah, I think that team was a pretty stacked"
07:29,020;07:35,020;"There is one Miami team that had like across three different years or something. They had like"
07:35,020;07:42,220;"27 first round picks or something. Sure. Yeah. On like one roster. That's insane."
07:42,220;07:49,820;"I'd read several records during a time in the universe of Miami holds the record for career"
07:49,820;07:55,580;"receptions with 21 as a safety career interception return yards with 389 and interceptions return"
07:55,580;07:57,340;"and for touchdowns with five."
07:57,340;07:59,980;"You also block four pints during his four year career."
07:59,980;08:03,340;"He was also a member of the track and field team."
08:03,340;08:04,820;"(laughs)"
08:04,820;08:06,540;"And was the big, he's champion in the javelin."
08:06,540;08:09,260;"Jesus, can you imagine Ed Reed trucking a javelin at you?"
08:09,260;08:10,100;"That's some scary shit."
08:10,100;08:11,040;"Oh, here we go."
08:11,040;08:12,500;"Ed Reed, what?"
08:12,500;08:14,340;"They are, they're--"
08:14,340;08:15,180;"Did you?"
08:15,180;08:19,380;"Why, yeah, 2001 University of Miami is the best team ever."
08:19,380;08:24,100;"Okay, is that the 30 for 30 or?"
08:24,100;08:25,720;"I'm actually made that or"
08:25,720;08:26,820;"reading article should."
08:26,820;08:30,460;"No, I feel like there was one for some team of that era."
08:30,460;08:36,620;"Maybe it was the most of the Florida team with Tim Tebow and Aaron Hernandez on it."
08:36,620;08:39,440;"No, I thought they made a 30 for 30 about that team."
08:39,440;08:40,260;"I don't know."
08:40,260;08:41,380;"Okay, here we go."
08:41,380;08:43,460;"You want to hear these draft picks?"
08:43,460;08:44,180;"Yeah."
08:44,180;08:45,460;"Let's go stat check boy."
08:45,460;08:46,140;"Okay."
08:46,140;08:47,660;"This is all in one roster."
08:47,660;08:48,060;"We have"
08:49,900;08:52,340;"Andre Johnson, third overall."
08:52,340;08:54,700;"Sean Taylor, fifth overall."
08:54,700;08:56,620;"Kellen Winslow, sixth overall."
08:56,620;08:58,420;"Bryant McKinney, seventh overall."
08:58,420;09:00,140;"Intro, roll, eighth."
09:00,140;09:01,740;"Jonathan Vilma, 12th."
09:01,740;09:03,820;"Jeremy Shockey, 14th."
09:03,820;09:05,300;"Jerome McDougall, 15th."
09:05,300;09:06,780;"Philip Buchanan, 17th."
09:06,780;09:08,660;"DJ Williams, 18th."
09:08,660;09:10,140;"Vernon Carey, 19th."
09:10,140;09:11,700;"Vince Wilfberg, 21st."
09:11,700;09:13,780;"Willis McGay, he, 23rd."
09:13,780;09:15,700;"Ed Reed, 24th."
09:15,700;09:17,140;"William Joseph, 25th."
09:17,140;09:18,860;"Mike Rump, 27th."
09:18,860;09:21,440;"I think Kelly Jennings, 31st."
09:21,440;09:22,940;"That's crazy."
09:22,940;09:28,380;"Over how many players went to the NFL, 17, picked in the first round of the draft."
09:28,380;09:31,020;"Oh, over how many years?"
09:31,020;09:32,020;"Well, it does."
09:32,020;09:33,620;"All on this one roster, right?"
09:33,620;09:36,380;"So they got, wow, it might not have been for years."
09:36,380;09:39,220;"Not in the same year, but yeah."
09:39,220;09:40,220;"Good Lord."
09:40,220;09:42,220;"It's hard to have me as a core of the draft."
09:42,220;09:45,060;"And also Clinton Portis and Frank Gore on those teams."
09:45,060;09:46,940;"They just weren't high draft."
09:46,940;09:48,780;"What the hell?"
09:48,780;09:50,380;"- Unbelievable."
09:50,380;09:53,500;"- Who picked Jonathan Delman, the Jets?"
09:53,500;09:54,340;"- Yeah."
09:54,340;09:55,160;"- Thanks."
09:55,160;09:57,020;"- He was like the worst of that list when he started it to,"
09:57,020;09:57,860;"you know?"
09:57,860;09:58,700;"- Yeah, yeah."
09:58,700;10:00,340;"And I don't think he was great on the Jets,"
10:00,340;10:03,220;"but I think it more because of the Jets than anything."
10:03,220;10:04,060;"- Yeah."
10:04,060;10:06,380;"Big players go to get their careers ruined."
10:06,380;10:07,260;"- That's right, yeah."
10:07,260;10:08,380;"Yeah, we know."
10:08,380;10:12,980;"So as good as this Baltimore Ravens defense was,"
10:12,980;10:16,120;"I just want to read you the offensive leaders"
10:16,120;10:17,580;"of this team."
10:17,580;10:20,860;"They ranked six in the league on defense"
10:20,860;10:22,180;"and 20th on offense."
10:22,180;10:23,740;"And the fact that they were 20th,"
10:23,740;10:25,980;"I think is gonna be a shock to you."
10:25,980;10:27,420;"Quarterback, Kyle Bowler,"
10:27,420;10:31,180;"who I believe was a rookie this year,"
10:31,180;10:32,020;"or maybe it was the second year,"
10:32,020;10:32,940;"this is first year starting,"
10:32,940;10:36,860;"through 13 touchdowns, 11 interceptions all season."
10:36,860;10:39,420;"Jamal Lewis was running back"
10:39,420;10:41,820;"who I believe was injured in this game."
10:41,820;10:44,300;"So didn't play much if at all,"
10:44,300;10:47,100;"had just over 1,000 yards and seven touchdowns."
10:47,100;10:48,780;"And they're top two wide receivers,"
10:48,780;10:52,940;"top two Travis Taylor, ever heard of them?"
10:52,940;10:53,780;"- Nope."
10:53,780;10:55,260;"- Nope, that's because he led the team"
10:55,260;10:58,060;"with 421 yards and zero touchdowns."
10:58,060;10:59,220;"- Oh."
10:59,220;11:00,860;"- And the other wide receiver Clarence Moore,"
11:00,860;11:02,020;"never heard of him?"
11:02,020;11:02,860;"- Nope."
11:02,860;11:03,700;"- Nope, you know why?"
11:03,700;11:05,220;"'Cause he was second on the team,"
11:05,220;11:07,740;"293 receiving yards and four touchdowns."
11:07,740;11:08,580;"So."
11:08,580;11:09,900;"- Did you throw the ball?"
11:09,900;11:11,860;"- They just, they didn't move the ball."
11:11,860;11:14,740;"They were just that bad on them."
11:14,740;11:17,020;"- How long yards did Buller throw for?"
11:17,020;11:19,600;"2,559 Wow."
11:19,600;11:21,780;"That's like 700 of it."
11:21,780;11:24,060;"Six. Yeah."
11:24,060;11:28,140;"Almost had like everyone's like got 150 yards on the team."
11:28,140;11:30,460;"It was not it's not a good list. Yeah."
11:30,460;11:35,340;"That's the 31st in the NFL in yards."
11:35,340;11:38,220;"Probably. Yeah."
11:38,220;11:39,380;"You're saying? Yeah. Yeah."
11:39,380;11:40,580;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
11:40,580;11:42,340;"The points for their 20th points."
11:42,340;11:42,980;"They were OK."
11:42,980;11:44,860;"It was right because their defense is going on points."
11:44,860;11:45,340;"Right. Yeah."
11:45,340;11:46,620;"And they're giving them short fields and stuff and they"
11:46,620;11:50,580;"kicking field goals. But yeah, they did they let's see."
11:50,580;11:54,980;"It was it was not a good team. Let's see, they scored one,"
11:54,980;11:59,860;"two, three times under. Wow. Yeah, double digits. They're bad."
11:59,860;12:04,820;"Yeah, not not a good thing. Like they're they're passing"
12:04,820;12:08,860;"offenses horrific horrendous. They were ninth in the NFL and"
12:08,860;12:13,660;"rushing. Yep. And they still with 31st in the NFL in yards."
12:15,780;12:18,340;"This is probably like a historically bad passing off it."
12:18,340;12:22,860;"They were 31st in passing yards and 30th in passing touchdowns."
12:22,860;12:24,140;"Hell yeah, dude."
12:24,140;12:26,260;"Who's got worse passing yards?"
12:26,260;12:27,180;"Who else is like?"
12:27,180;12:28,020;"That's a great question."
12:28,020;12:28,660;"I don't know."
12:28,660;12:33,060;"Like, because that Kyle Bull or usually when you hear numbers like that,"
12:33,060;12:34,700;"you're like, oh, you know, he split time."
12:34,700;12:35,420;"He missed some games."
12:35,420;12:36,260;"Yeah, he got him good."
12:36,260;12:39,740;"He started on all 16 and went nine and seven."
12:39,740;12:41,980;"Like, I think they just missed the playoffs."
12:41,980;12:42,900;"Who was the coach?"
12:42,900;12:44,780;"This is Brian Billick."
12:45,700;12:48,260;"which because it was a bloat at the ends,"
12:48,260;12:49,180;"who were the commentators?"
12:49,180;12:54,180;"This was, where are my notes?"
12:54,180;12:56,880;"Oh, Jim Nance and Phil Simms."
12:56,880;12:58,500;"- Oh yeah, TV."
12:58,500;12:59,580;"- Yeah, so at the end of it,"
12:59,580;13:03,580;"they were talking about how Brian Billick's name"
13:03,580;13:05,100;"is very close to Bill Belichick,"
13:05,100;13:07,540;"and people always get the two confused."
13:07,540;13:09,500;"And Brian Billick ordered some really nice suits,"
13:09,500;13:10,860;"and then they showed up,"
13:10,860;13:13,220;"and he tried them on, and the sleeves were really short."
13:13,220;13:14,380;"And then he looked inside the name,"
13:14,380;13:18,300;"I was it was Bill Belichick. So they sent him Bill Belichick suits instead of Brian Billick."
13:18,300;13:22,300;"It's kind of funny. Yeah, so that's that's the uh,"
13:22,300;13:25,100;"they don't get that's what that's what we ended up with."
13:25,100;13:33,260;"That should not happen anymore. No, no, I don't think it does. But yeah, this was uh,"
13:33,260;13:37,020;"this was a very"
13:37,020;13:43,980;"Stereotypal game for the Baltimore Ravens. Where I guess they just like are good at keeping it close because of their defense and hope to like"
13:43,980;13:50,820;"score a random push on here and there and win by a couple of points but and then"
13:50,820;13:55,740;"Kyle bowler gets sacked on one play and the next play gets sacked fumble"
13:55,740;14:06,820;"yeah I mean you want to hear their two-minute offense it was oh yeah so"
14:06,820;14:11,820;"the pages punted and down at the Baltimore too so that first of all there's"
14:11,820;14:15,820;"like seven minutes left, they're down 24 to three, which is what the game would end up being."
14:15,820;14:21,980;"And so they ran it twice to get to third down."
14:21,980;14:32,380;"Managed to get a first down, but then on second down, the ball got snapped over"
14:32,380;14:35,980;"bowlers head into the end zone. So we picked it up and threw an inflation."
14:35,980;14:40,460;"And then on third down, another bad snap, which looked like the center just threw it"
14:40,460;14:47,020;"basically straight up behind them. So Kyle Baller had to catch the the the"
14:47,020;14:52,460;"fair ball and was immediately sacked and that was that was third down. So that"
14:52,460;14:57,420;"was there that was there seven minute offense. The old car hunt snap. Yeah. Yeah."
14:57,420;15:00,940;"It was he literally snapped it like straight up instead of at Kyle Baller."
15:00,940;15:05,180;"It's going to go corral the fly ball. It was immediately sacked by whoever was"
15:05,180;15:09,260;"coming off. He had taken the frivial. Did Deon Sanders is on this team?"
15:10,220;15:15,180;"The on-sayers on this team. He's on his team. There was no mention of him. What's the level?"
15:15,180;15:18,540;"I think yeah, I don't know if he played. He's anyway putting nine games."
15:18,540;15:22,700;"I don't think this is one of them. Is he really on the same?"
15:22,700;15:25,580;"Neon, Dion. I don't remember him being a little raven."
15:25,580;15:27,340;"Yeah, right at the end."
15:27,340;15:33,020;"Dion's saying is look at that. One more, actually one more year after this."
15:34,380;15:37,500;"He had five hundred returns for 41 yards."
15:37,500;15:42,220;"Um, and three interceptions on this team."
15:42,220;15:44,340;"He was he was second."
15:44,340;15:46,820;"He was tied for second on this team with three interceptions."
15:46,820;15:50,060;"Did not hear his name once in this game."
15:50,060;15:52,300;"Oh, he played fascinating."
15:52,300;15:54,660;"Yeah, he must have been hers on them, but."
15:54,660;15:57,500;"But this was a so."
15:57,500;15:57,740;"Yeah."
15:57,740;16:00,220;"So that was the oven and on the defense on the scene, though."
16:00,220;16:01,740;"Uh, Ed Reed."
16:02,420;16:04,100;"Let the team with nine interceptions."
16:04,100;16:06,220;"17 pass defended and a touchdown."
16:06,220;16:06,980;"Big six."
16:06,980;16:10,380;"Terrell Suggs of the team with 10 and a half sacks."
16:10,380;16:12,980;"Ray Lewis, 101 solo tackles."
16:12,980;16:15,460;"And then a Dallas Thomas."
16:15,460;16:16,860;"Those are your three linebackers."
16:16,860;16:19,140;"Four force fumbles and eight sacks."
16:19,140;16:21,660;"So it's pretty good."
16:21,660;16:23,940;"The daleous Thomas is, you know, what could"
16:23,940;16:27,300;"Ed Reed is defensive player of the year this year, right?"
16:27,300;16:29,700;"I believe that was this year. Yeah."
16:29,700;16:31,060;"And Ray Lewis won it."
16:31,900;16:33,540;"Just before this was 2000."
16:33,540;16:38,180;"Wasn't that him when they went to Super Bowl when he killed the man."
16:38,180;16:42,700;"He did not kill him and I looked this up in preparation for the podcast."
16:42,700;16:46,540;"OK, talk to me, Greg."
16:46,540;16:49,420;"He was there when somebody got killed."
16:49,420;16:50,900;"Right. And then."
16:50,900;16:54,580;"And then he ratted him out."
16:54,580;16:57,100;"I thought he didn't. I thought he."
16:57,100;17:00,900;"They all jumped in his limo and took off and dumped everything in the dumps"
17:00,900;17:05,140;"somewhere. Yeah, that happens. And then they were like, they charge"
17:05,140;17:07,940;"him with murder because they were like, well, we don't know if"
17:07,940;17:10,220;"fucking did this. And you're in the limo and they was like, Oh,"
17:10,220;17:14,580;"there's wasn't his blood in the limo to the guy's blood. Yeah. So"
17:14,580;17:17,740;"then as part of the plea deal to get it plugged down to just"
17:17,740;17:24,380;"like, whatever obstruction of justice. Yeah, he pled, or he"
17:24,380;17:26,580;"ratted out his two buddies, but then they didn't even get"
17:26,580;17:32,460;"convicted. What? Yeah, they got self defense. Oh shit. So no,"
17:32,460;17:34,980;"okay, Ray Lewis is the only one to spend any time in jail for"
17:34,980;17:40,820;"this. How long he spent in jail? Like a week? Couple of nights?"
17:40,820;17:45,480;"Yeah. A little between when it happened and then when he got"
17:45,480;17:48,900;"the plea deal. So Jesus, because it was it was the night"
17:48,900;17:51,060;"before the Super Bowl or something. Right? Yeah, well, I"
17:51,060;17:53,940;"think it was denied off the Super Bowl. Yeah, not the one he"
17:54,140;17:57,380;"Not the one he was in. It was in the Rams Titan Super Bowl."
17:57,380;17:59,060;"When they kill him over."
17:59,060;18:02,140;"There's a lot of law."
18:02,140;18:03,900;"Apparently, you should have club or something. Yeah."
18:03,900;18:07,380;"Yeah. He had some guy like smashed a bottle over one of their heads."
18:07,380;18:09,780;"So his two buddies just fucking stabbed him to death."
18:09,780;18:11,180;"Yeah."
18:11,180;18:13,900;"And then they're like, yo, let's get the fuck out of here."
18:13,900;18:18,580;"And unfortunately, Ray Lewis was wearing a fucking cream white suit."
18:18,580;18:20,220;"And it's that's in hat."
18:20,220;18:23,820;"That's almost like innocuous shit to be trying to go away with"
18:23,820;18:29,020;"murder. So Ray Lewis, we're like not get blood on you. Yeah."
18:29,020;18:32,140;"Right. Yeah, that's a thing. Yeah, that shit will stand out real"
18:32,140;18:34,780;"quickly. You'll know immediately if you have blood on you. I'm"
18:34,780;18:37,900;"telling you, dude, I could get away with murder. You just don't"
18:37,900;18:41,460;"be an idiot. Like Aaron Hernandez, his own fucking security"
18:41,460;18:44,900;"system caught him. That's true. Yeah. Don't get a real"
18:44,900;18:47,780;"problem. Right? Yeah, just if you're going to kill someone,"
18:47,780;18:50,380;"just cover your tracks just that easy."
18:50,380;18:53,860;"[LAUGHTER]"
18:53,860;18:57,340;"Oh, boy."
18:57,340;19:01,780;"Speaking of easy, the reason it was so easy"
19:01,780;19:05,180;"to build such a good defense for these Baltimore Ravens,"
19:05,180;19:06,980;"listened to the coaching staff that"
19:06,980;19:09,260;"was on the defensive side of the ball."
19:09,260;19:10,940;"You had the defensive coordinator."
19:10,940;19:13,740;"Well, obviously, Brian Bellicou was pretty good."
19:13,740;19:16,900;"Just not against the Patriots."
19:16,900;19:18,260;"They won this game."
19:18,260;19:22,160;"Can you name the other game that the Patriots beat the Ravens with Brian Bellic?"
19:22,160;19:23,480;"The head coach."
19:23,480;19:26,000;"That's a boy."
19:26,000;19:27,680;"Is this a trick question?"
19:27,680;19:28,240;"No."
19:28,240;19:31,280;"It's going to be the next time I play, right?"
19:31,280;19:32,320;"Nineteen ninety nine."
19:32,320;19:33,240;"We've seen the Ravens."
19:33,240;19:33,640;"Yeah."
19:33,640;19:34,120;"It's the next one."
19:34,120;19:34,600;"It's like five."
19:34,600;19:35,040;"I play."
19:35,040;19:37,840;"And three years."
19:37,840;19:39,440;"I don't know."
19:39,440;19:46,880;"I mean, 2004 plus three in the, it's that nail bite in 2007 to keep the, uh, undefeated game"
19:46,880;19:48,640;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
19:48,640;19:49,360;"That one."
19:49,360;19:50,440;"So that's that's the only two"
19:50,440;19:52,520;"times besides or the fourth"
19:52,520;19:53,440;"down where you called time"
19:53,440;19:55,640;"on a lot where who called Ryan,"
19:55,640;19:56,520;"right? Exactly."
19:56,520;19:57,840;"So Rex Ryan is the defensive"
19:57,840;19:59,280;"line coach on the scene."
19:59,280;20:00,800;"Oh, Rex Ryan's on his team."
20:00,800;20:02,360;"He is. Yeah."
20:02,360;20:03,120;"Yeah."
20:03,120;20:04,800;"Defensive coordinator Mike Nolan,"
20:04,800;20:06,560;"the police coach,"
20:06,560;20:09,760;"defensive line assistants to Rex"
20:09,760;20:11,200;"Ryan is Mike Petin."
20:11,200;20:13,200;"Petin."
20:13,200;20:14,200;"Mike Petin."
20:14,200;20:15,360;"Petin. How are you pronouncing?"
20:15,360;20:16,000;"Yeah."
20:16,000;20:18,780;"It was the head coach of the Browns for two years."
20:18,780;20:19,800;"Went 10 and 22."
20:19,800;20:20,660;"Yeah."
20:20,660;20:25,240;"Um, and then linebackers coach Mike Singletary, the famous bears"
20:25,240;20:26,640;"linebacker who was also a 49."
20:26,640;20:27,520;"Can't win with them."
20:27,520;20:28,360;"Can't do it."
20:28,360;20:29,120;"Won't do it."
20:29,120;20:33,960;"Who was 18 and 22 as a head coach of 49ers over three."
20:33,960;20:34,920;"You have win with them."
20:34,920;20:36,200;"Won't do it."
20:36,200;20:38,840;"I don't remember that."
20:38,840;20:40,160;"It's like a conference."
20:40,160;20:41,880;"Not such a good coach."
20:41,880;20:43,840;"I think he's gone up Vernon Davis."
20:44,160;20:46,320;"If I remember correctly, that feels right."
20:46,320;20:48,040;"That's a lot of Andy."
20:48,040;20:49,280;"Can we get some audio of that?"
20:49,280;20:50,160;"Yeah."
20:50,160;20:52,640;"Let me see if I can find it."
20:52,640;20:53,960;"It's a little stat check."
20:53,960;20:57,280;"Steve, what's a disgust while he does this?"
20:57,280;20:59,600;"Oh, God, we have to carry it."
20:59,600;21:03,720;"You remember Mike Singletary, though, right?"
21:03,720;21:05,000;"From the Bears."
21:05,000;21:06,640;"The yeah, yeah."
21:06,640;21:08,040;"Yeah."
21:08,040;21:09,520;"And then he coached with the Niners."
21:09,520;21:09,880;"I remember that."
21:09,880;21:10,720;"I have some of it."
21:10,720;21:13,840;"And then I think the coach left mid year something."
21:13,840;21:22,160;"So he was like the interim coach and he was trying to do like the culture change thing where he's like, I'm going to just going to be a fucking huge hard ass."
21:22,160;21:22,520;"Yeah."
21:22,520;21:25,120;"And all the players are like, this sucks."
21:25,120;21:26,840;"We're three and eight."
21:26,840;21:29,160;"Yeah, they were not good."
21:29,160;21:30,200;"Yeah."
21:30,200;21:32,800;"All right, let me see what I can do."
21:32,800;21:35,520;"OK."
21:35,520;21:37,680;"Let's see if it works."
21:37,680;21:39,400;"Oh, God."
21:39,400;21:41,280;"Ready?"
21:42,840;21:46,800;"come out here. I'm excited for you. Why is there no sound?"
21:46,800;21:49,720;"He volumes volumes up."
21:49,720;21:52,920;"He gave you $300 for some weed."
21:52,920;21:57,840;"And just get penalized all the way. Here we go. All right."
21:57,840;22:00,600;"Let's just try this. This is how I believe. Okay, I'm from the old"
22:00,600;22:04,280;"school. I believe this. I would rather play with 10 people"
22:04,280;22:09,880;"and just get penalized all the way until we got to do something"
22:09,880;22:14,640;"else rather than play with 11 when I know that right now that person is not sold"
22:14,640;22:19,400;"out to be a part of this team it is more about them than it is about the team"
22:19,400;22:24,880;"cannot play with him cannot win with him cannot coach with him can't do it I"
22:24,880;22:35,600;"want winners I want people that want to win that's great so awesome just the"
22:35,600;22:38,200;"cadence and everything is just all the time."
22:38,200;22:39,480;"Perfect."
22:39,480;22:40,880;"Electric."
22:40,880;22:43,120;"That's up there with, you know, as he's saying that,"
22:43,120;22:45,520;"he's like, I'm nailing this."
22:45,520;22:47,520;"You can see it on his face."
22:47,520;22:49,440;"He's just like, yeah, he's it."
22:49,440;22:52,960;"He's been practicing this in the shower for like two weeks."
22:52,960;22:54,520;"Yep."
22:54,520;22:55,040;"Can't coach."
22:55,040;22:56,000;"Can't do it."
22:56,000;22:56,800;"Can't do it."
22:56,800;22:57,240;"Can't do it."
22:57,240;22:58,840;"Can't coach with him."
22:58,840;23:00,520;"Well, I play with him."
23:00,520;23:03,040;"And where would him?"
23:03,040;23:04,120;"Vernon Davis too."
23:04,120;23:09,400;"So that that's that's who that's who's running this defense."
23:09,400;23:13,600;"And you have Ray Lewis and you have Ed Reed and you have Adelius Thomas."
23:13,600;23:14,720;"Oh, yeah."
23:14,720;23:15,400;"Absolutely."
23:15,400;23:16,360;"And beyond Sanders."
23:16,360;23:18,400;"Don't forget the on and beyond Sanders."
23:18,400;23:20,600;"Neon Dion that is correct."
23:20,600;23:25,640;"Um, and so the pages put up 24 points on this off on this defense, which is"
23:25,640;23:28,560;"pretty impressive on a soggy surface too."
23:28,560;23:30,680;"Well, this was where the strip sack."
23:30,680;23:31,480;"True."
23:31,960;23:35,560;"But this was all core Dylan 30 carries hundred twenty three yards in the touchdown"
23:35,560;23:40,320;"Oh, it's one of those ones he gets you worn down in the end. I feel like he was probably punished in it was"
23:40,320;23:42,320;"Yeah, it was demoralizing"
23:42,320;23:45,520;"Yeah, oh yeah"
23:45,520;23:49,680;"Yeah, that'll be on the website it was a"
23:49,680;23:56,380;"Solid but I mean this is just one of those like stupid sloppy games that you have like that you used to"
23:56,380;23:59,240;"Pray for whenever the pages play the Colts, you know"
24:00,040;24:02,300;"- For everything we just use a sloppy mess."
24:02,300;24:06,960;"- And then you kind of had to waste it on Baltimore"
24:06,960;24:08,200;"offense instead."
24:08,200;24:10,000;"But I'm - This is just not a"
24:10,000;24:11,720;"enjoyable game to watch though."
24:11,720;24:12,560;"- Not particularly."
24:12,560;24:13,400;"- No."
24:13,400;24:14,500;"- I'm dealing four yards, still in four yards,"
24:14,500;24:16,820;"still in 13 yards, Patrick passed seven yards,"
24:16,820;24:20,320;"no gain, incomplete, one yard, delay of gain,"
24:20,320;24:21,840;"punter punts."
24:21,840;24:24,960;"- Yeah, oh yeah, it's all just a whole lot of punts."
24:24,960;24:26,080;"Let's see."
24:26,080;24:26,920;"On to"
24:26,920;24:30,020;"three, four."
24:30,020;24:33,820;"Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,"
24:33,820;24:35,020;"that's in the first half."
24:35,020;24:36,900;"There was--"
24:36,900;24:39,020;"- We'll give us the watchability score of it."
24:39,020;24:45,140;"- Out of six slum bodies, I give this one and a half."
24:45,140;24:49,620;"- The mud novelty probably wears off pretty fast."
24:49,620;24:53,020;"- Yeah, yeah, literally just watch the highlights of this one."
24:53,020;24:55,020;"They're easy enough to find on YouTube"
24:55,020;24:58,620;"and it's, you know, it's nothing great."
24:58,620;25:06,100;"Although the Patriots do set a record for being the 19th straight game in a row."
25:06,100;25:08,220;"Scoring first."
25:08,220;25:10,340;"Cool."
25:10,340;25:11,300;"Pretty impressive."
25:11,300;25:12,700;"It is a pretty impressive."
25:12,700;25:14,540;"The record still stand."
25:14,540;25:15,540;"It's like a record."
25:15,540;25:16,420;"Believe it does."
25:16,420;25:21,340;"Just because I mean, how can it's almost like a matter of luck, you know?"
25:21,340;25:22,700;"It's a coach's wet dream."
25:22,700;25:23,860;"It's going for us."
25:23,860;25:24,180;"Oh, yeah."
25:24,180;25:25,220;"I scored first."
25:25,220;25:27,780;"You know, we sit the tall and say, yeah, no, no shit, dude."
25:27,780;25:33,540;"What do you think we're trying to do here? I can give up points first. I'm not getting"
25:33,540;25:37,220;"scored first 19 years in a row in the 20th games like Belljacks. We got to score first,"
25:37,220;25:43,300;"you know, I really said that. Of course, yeah. Fucking shit, Bill. And my guess is they score"
25:43,300;25:49,140;"first in a few of their next games because on the rest of the season, they only have one"
25:49,140;25:53,540;"game left first, a team of the winning record. That is the Jets who are at eight and three"
25:53,540;25:59,140;"in second in the ASC East, and the 10-in-one Patriots after this."
25:59,140;26:05,820;"So there were also two other 10-in-one teams this week."
26:05,820;26:10,700;"The Pittsburgh Steelers are one of them, and the Philadelphia Eagles are the other."
26:10,700;26:16,740;"Both the Eagles and the Patriots have so lost to those Pittsburgh Steelers."
26:16,740;26:22,860;"I believe they, because they ended both undefeated streaks back to back weeks."
26:22,860;26:25,180;"This Steelers team is a goddamn wagon right now."
26:25,180;26:27,860;"Yes, they are riding high because this Ben's rookie year too, right?"
26:27,860;26:29,780;"He's on some crazy streak."
26:29,780;26:33,740;"He's never lost because that first game was, I think, Tommy Maddox or something ended up"
26:33,740;26:35,580;"with the loss and he got hurt."
26:35,580;26:37,460;"And so Ross is very coming."
26:37,460;26:38,700;"He has a loss of football game."
26:38,700;26:42,100;"He's playing, you know, like Big Ben of old."
26:42,100;26:45,900;"And that L is going to hurt them pretty hard then."
26:45,900;26:47,500;"Yeah, no."
26:47,500;26:56,060;"But the thing I found interesting was week 11 and the Philadelphia Eagles at 10 and one"
26:56,060;27:03,620;"have already clinched a division, which is fucking early 11 weeks in because of the Giants"
27:03,620;27:06,500;"Cowboys and Redskins, but all finished six and 10 this season."
27:06,500;27:12,940;"And the Eagles, did you see the game of the week this week?"
27:12,940;27:15,260;"What was the game of the week this week?"
27:15,260;27:19,820;"It was the four and six bangles versus the two and eight"
27:19,820;27:22,980;"Browns. It sure was. I remember this day."
27:22,980;27:24,660;"Eighty to forty eight."
27:24,660;27:25,380;"Yeah."
27:25,380;27:29,740;"And the second highest game scoring game to not go into overtime."
27:29,740;27:34,380;"Crazy fucking, but I remember this because that was a who is that"
27:34,380;27:35,860;"bangles quarterback at the time."
27:35,860;27:38,300;"Oh, no, not big of the Browns quarterback."
27:38,300;27:38,820;"The old guy."
27:38,820;27:40,740;"Oh, no, the old rookie."
27:40,740;27:42,900;"Remember him?"
27:42,900;27:44,260;"Oh, I started your lucky."
27:44,620;27:46,100;"Yeah, this is Kelly Hokem now."
27:46,100;27:46,980;"Are you sure?"
27:46,980;27:47,740;"Yeah."
27:47,740;27:48,420;"Motherfucker."
27:48,420;27:48,820;"All right."
27:48,820;27:50,820;"Cause I have a soft spot for Kelly Hokem."
27:50,820;27:52,420;"Do you have a Kelly Hokem?"
27:52,420;27:53,620;"This is Jersey and all."
27:53,620;27:56,260;"Why do you have a Jersey?"
27:56,260;27:57,500;"Was that a bet you lost?"
27:57,500;28:00,180;"I have no idea to be honest."
28:00,180;28:01,180;"No idea."
28:01,180;28:06,300;"Speaking of Jersey, I believe you owe me a Jersey."
28:06,300;28:07,500;"That's true."
28:07,500;28:07,780;"For you."
28:07,780;28:10,220;"Do I do on the 2021 new."
28:10,220;28:11,700;"Let's circle back on that."
28:11,700;28:13,460;"OK."
28:13,460;28:16,940;"Let's put a pin in that one."
28:16,940;28:20,140;"We'll circle back later."
28:20,140;28:23,180;"OK, we'll put something on calendar for that, Joe."
28:23,180;28:24,100;"OK, yeah."
28:24,100;28:26,020;"Let's take this one offline, Andy."
28:26,020;28:27,860;"Lots of time."
28:27,860;28:32,460;"So yeah, the number one highest"
28:32,460;28:36,380;"scoring football game to not go into overtime at this point."
28:36,380;28:37,940;"Was it?"
28:37,940;28:40,660;"66 Redskins Giants game, apparently."
28:40,660;28:41,660;"Oh, well."
28:42,420;28:47,260;"But what was the Chiefs Rams game of a couple of years ago?"
28:47,260;28:48,700;"What did that end up being?"
28:48,700;28:51,140;"Bajillion to Bajillion."
28:51,140;28:51,940;"Yeah, Bajillion."
28:51,940;28:54,060;"I came because it wasn't both games in the fifth."
28:54,060;28:56,580;"Well, in both scores in the 50s, like 58, 54 or something."
28:56,580;28:58,260;"That sounds right."
28:58,260;28:58,780;"Bananas."
28:58,780;29:03,900;"So over 100 points, which is 48 points and losing by 10."
29:03,900;29:04,740;"Right."
29:04,740;29:05,900;"Yeah, but two scores."
29:05,900;29:07,340;"It's crazy."
29:07,340;29:11,140;"But it is TJ Hushmazoo."
29:12,060;29:13,820;"TJ, who's your mama?"
29:13,820;29:15,900;"We ever seen that video."
29:15,900;29:16,860;"What's that from?"
29:16,860;29:20,860;"It's a it's a marsh on Lynch."
29:20,860;29:23,060;"Mike Duff when he was on the bills."
29:23,060;29:27,220;"And they announced TJ who's mazada and he turns to a teammate."
29:27,220;29:29,780;"He goes TJ, who smooshu?"
29:29,780;29:32,340;"You never seen that."
29:32,340;29:33,420;"No, I did."
29:33,420;29:34,620;"You got that."
29:34,620;29:35,580;"His mic."
29:35,580;29:40,900;"Dub moments from when he's on the bills are just like charisma at its finest."
29:40,900;29:42,980;"- See, so funny. - I'm a little bit more good."
29:42,980;29:43,820;"- Yeah."
29:43,820;29:44,820;"- What am I Googling?"
29:44,820;29:46,820;"- Say it again?"
29:46,820;29:47,980;"- What am I Googling?"
29:47,980;29:53,020;"- B-Smoke, Mic'd Up, Bills."
29:53,020;29:56,460;"- Got it."
29:56,460;29:58,200;"- See if we can find this."
29:58,200;30:00,060;"Marshall Lynch mic'd up, here we go."
30:00,060;30:03,940;"- TJ, who's your mama?"
30:03,940;30:05,660;"(laughs)"
30:05,660;30:08,600;"- All right, let me, let me share this."
30:10,300;30:11,300;"What is this?"
30:11,300;30:13,900;"(upbeat music)"
30:13,900;30:15,300;"- Marshawn Lynch."
30:15,300;30:17,900;"(upbeat music)"
30:17,900;30:18,820;"- Marshawn Lynch."
30:18,820;30:20,480;"- Marshawn Lynch, Marshawn."
30:20,480;30:22,120;"(upbeat music)"
30:22,120;30:24,820;"- I'm in baseball, you say they had that fun up there."
30:24,820;30:25,980;"- Yeah, I'm going to the ball."
30:25,980;30:26,820;"- Back."
30:26,820;30:29,100;"(upbeat music)"
30:29,100;30:31,100;"- It is Marshawn Lynch, shaking attack."
30:31,100;30:31,940;"(crowd cheering)"
30:31,940;30:33,300;"- Dude, it's wrong."
30:33,300;30:34,700;"Dude, so good back then."
30:34,700;30:37,700;"- I got a little bit of speed on them though."
30:37,700;30:40,300;"I got a little bit of speed on them though."
30:40,300;30:41,740;"They can't tackle."
30:41,740;30:42,500;"I see that."
30:42,500;30:43,180;"They can't tackle."
30:43,180;30:43,740;"You can't tackle."
30:43,740;30:44,740;"I see that."
30:44,740;30:45,740;"I see that."
30:45,740;30:46,740;"I see that."
30:46,740;30:47,740;"That was pancake."
30:47,740;30:50,740;"Hey, I got to leave some pancakes today."
30:50,740;30:51,740;"You know what?"
30:51,740;30:52,740;"It's a ******* hill."
30:52,740;30:53,740;"He's such a goofy dude."
30:53,740;30:54,740;"He's the best."
30:54,740;30:55,740;"Thang, minding up your butt cheeks."
30:55,740;30:56,740;"He's a good guy."
30:56,740;30:57,740;"He's such a goofy dude."
30:57,740;30:58,740;"He's the best."
30:58,740;30:59,740;"He's the best."
30:59,740;31:01,740;"Thang, minding up your butt cheeks."
31:01,740;31:02,740;"He's a good guy."
31:02,740;31:03,740;"He drops the throw."
31:03,740;31:04,740;"Five-step throw."
31:04,740;31:05,740;"Here it is."
31:05,740;31:07,740;"Caught by Hooshman Tada for the touchdown"
31:07,740;31:11,300;"TJ Hooshma Zoo"
31:11,300;31:14,020;"TJ Hooshma"
31:14,020;31:15,020;"Number 90"
31:15,020;31:20,020;"Hey, he told me guys he say I'm gonna come steal them teeth from you after the gang"
31:20,020;31:26,700;"Joyous person"
31:26,700;31:30,460;"So much fun to play with"
31:30,460;31:33,460;"Yeah, you back over here."
31:33,460;31:35,460;"Hey, I like you."
31:35,460;31:37,460;"I like you a lot."
31:37,460;31:39,460;"Yeah, I'm full of hell here, don't you?"
31:39,460;31:40,460;"Hell yeah."
31:40,460;31:45,460;"Are you throwing passes?"
31:45,460;31:50,460;"March on Lynch's first NFL career touchdown pass."
31:50,460;31:52,460;"You threw a touchdown and rushed off."
31:52,460;31:55,460;"Oh, mamas, I'm trying to get like LT."
31:56,460;31:59,400;"I'm only 21, but I live my life like I'm down"
31:59,400;32:08,880;"He's not even talking anyway just stay"
32:08,880;32:13,940;"2600 pound double side of magnet. Let's go ahead and see what we can find"
32:13,940;32:16,700;"Magnet Andy"
32:16,700;32:19,100;"Magnificious"
32:19,100;32:21,220;"Oh boy"
32:21,220;32:26,180;"He is such a joy as individual. He's just so charismatic. Yes, just"
32:26,180;32:30,940;"Not even on purpose. Yeah, just naturally. Yeah, exactly"
32:30,940;32:35,220;"Just like you Craig, that's right"
32:35,220;32:38,420;"No comment"
32:38,420;32:41,740;"All right, should we do best and worse for this thing?"
32:41,740;32:44,420;"The other thing else you want to you want to bring up about the"
32:44,420;32:47,540;"2004 Baltimore Ravens or Patriots"
32:49,860;33:06,460;"No, okay. Oh boy. All right. Let's see. Any good stats in this two is a good number for inches of mud."
33:06,460;33:18,900;"Also, let's see. Combine stats. Possessions 11, puns nine, first down's 11. Great. The New England Patriots,"
33:18,900;33:25,500;"41 points in the final two minutes of the first half on the season, mostly NFL, of course."
33:25,500;33:28,820;"So this is just like typical Patriots 2004."
33:28,820;33:38,620;"How would you rank the 2004 teams in like Patriots dynasty team rankings if you could"
33:38,620;33:39,620;"rank each season?"
33:39,620;33:45,540;"Because I've heard some people say that 2014 was the best team or the best defense ever."
33:45,540;33:52,540;"They're the best. Someone also said that they're the final form of the offense, you know?"
33:52,540;33:56,940;"That's what I've heard. Because this is kind of where Tom Brady turns into like a full"
33:56,940;34:02,660;"fledged quarterback. And isn't just like a running back to. Yeah. Exactly. You got"
34:02,660;34:12,580;"Corey Dillon as well. You've got rookie Dion Branch and David Givens, Troy Brown."
34:12,580;34:15,380;"a case that they're not neither of those guys. So it was like a lead, right? That we've had better"
34:15,380;34:19,220;"receivers over the dynasty. But true, never had a better running back. This is probably the best"
34:19,220;34:26,100;"iteration of the defensive all time. Tom Brady's Tom Brady. Yeah, Tom Brady's officially Tom Brady"
34:26,100;34:32,900;"at this point. Adam military making clutch kicks. Because I was always a problem with 2007 offense,"
34:32,900;34:38,260;"you know, if you can get the hand once. True. Well, they had no defense too."
34:39,940;34:41,940;"But yeah, they didn't have much of a running game."
34:41,940;34:44,500;"To be fair, they didn't need it for most of it."
34:44,500;34:47,460;"But Greg, thoughts?"
34:47,460;34:49,700;"Yeah, it's tough to say."
34:49,700;34:54,740;"Tyler's not as good this year, so my instinct is to say that no, this is not the best defense"
34:54,740;34:55,740;"that they've had."
34:55,740;35:01,340;"So what would you rank better than 2001 defense?"
35:01,340;35:03,340;"Or last year's 2003?"
35:03,340;35:04,340;"Interesting."
35:04,340;35:05,340;"Yeah."
35:05,340;35:06,340;"Shun down Peyton Manning like that in playoffs."
35:06,340;35:07,340;"That was pretty big."
35:07,340;35:08,340;"Fair."
35:08,340;35:09,340;"Fair."
35:09,340;35:10,340;"That's true."
35:10,340;35:12,740;"Um, yeah, I would, I would say 2003 defense."
35:12,740;35:18,420;"That's because I mean, also the 2003 defense doesn't have Troy Brown playing corner back."
35:18,420;35:19,340;"Uh huh."
35:19,340;35:21,820;"So secondary was definitely better."
35:21,820;35:22,580;"Yeah."
35:22,580;35:24,140;"This is secondary beat up there."
35:24,140;35:26,140;"They're talking about Earth Wind Morland in this game."
35:26,140;35:31,380;"That being said, this is the only Super Bowl where it wasn't super close right at the end."
35:31,380;35:32,140;"True."
35:32,140;35:36,340;"The only kind of gaming sort of hand they've ever played in the Super Bowl."
35:36,340;35:37,460;"But they didn't like win."
35:37,460;35:37,780;"Yeah."
35:37,780;35:38,380;"Like right."
35:38,380;35:46,060;"this minute stuff is the best that team to win it most comfortably. That's true. Although I wasn't the"
35:46,060;35:55,340;"second Ram Super Bowl or biggest martial victory. It was 10 points. Yeah. Two scorers. But yes."
35:55,340;36:00,060;"But that team was nowhere near as good as this team. I think defensively they were"
36:01,100;36:08,860;"on par. Yeah. Just because what they did to the Rams who, I think if you look at that season,"
36:08,860;36:17,900;"the Rams and the Chiefs were both top 10 all-time offenses. And they shut them both down"
36:17,900;36:24,620;"enough. Like they held the Chiefs scoreless through a half and basically through three quarters."
36:25,180;36:28,180;"Yeah, that defense is legit."
36:28,180;36:29,180;"Yeah."
36:29,180;36:33,180;"So I think there's some similarities between those two."
36:33,180;36:38,580;"But often, I think this seems like you said better, much more well around with"
36:38,580;36:39,580;"Corey Dillon."
36:39,580;36:42,180;"So that's the best run back we've ever had."
36:42,180;36:43,380;"Yeah."
36:43,380;36:46,980;"I just respect to Kevin Falk or Sweet Feet."
36:46,980;36:49,420;"Yeah, I know, but like a true running back, you know,"
36:49,420;36:50,980;"Yeah, that's true."
36:50,980;36:52,580;"Harrison, Mondray, and two."
36:52,580;36:53,680;"Yeah."
36:53,680;36:55,080;"Well, maybe they'll turn into that, right?"
36:55,080;36:56,800;"That's the help."
36:56,800;36:59,400;"- Although will the Patriots still keep them on their roster"
36:59,400;37:00,560;"at that point?"
37:00,560;37:02,680;"- No, they'll just keep them split in time."
37:02,680;37:05,160;"- But I'm saying like, will they,"
37:05,160;37:08,720;"will they resign them after they rookie contract?"
37:08,720;37:11,640;"- Probably not."
37:11,640;37:13,600;"- I think they're proven that they just don't do that anymore."
37:13,600;37:14,440;"It's not their thing."
37:14,440;37:17,520;"- Now let's see, what else have we got?"
37:17,520;37:20,000;"Yeah, so as being of that running game,"
37:20,000;37:25,000;"the Patriots running comparisons from 2003 to 2003"
37:25,000;37:28,440;"2004, 2003, they averaged just over 100 yards a game."
37:28,440;37:32,200;"And in this season, they're averaging 120, almost 122."
37:32,200;37:35,360;"Um, they have seven rushing touchdowns this season."
37:35,360;37:37,080;"They had two rushing touchdowns last season."
37:37,080;37:39,360;"That's 2003."
37:39,360;37:39,760;"Two."
37:39,760;37:41,520;"Not great."
37:41,520;37:46,440;"Um, and then in 2003, they're rushing offense was 27th in the league this year."
37:46,440;37:48,320;"They're, they're only 12 surprisingly."
37:48,320;37:52,240;"Um, even though Corey Dillon, the only game he hasn't rushed for 100 yards was"
37:52,240;37:53,320;"the one he didn't play in."
37:53,480;37:55,440;"It was hurt against the Steelers."
37:55,440;37:58,000;"And that's the only game they've lost, funnily enough."
37:58,000;37:58,840;"- There you go."
37:58,840;38:03,080;"- But of all the, like there was some big moves"
38:03,080;38:08,440;"running back-wise in free agency this offseason."
38:08,440;38:12,000;"So Eddie George went to the Cowboys,"
38:12,000;38:14,440;"Thomas Jones went to the Bears,"
38:14,440;38:16,600;"do Staley on the Steelers,"
38:16,600;38:19,360;"Quentin Portis went to the Redskins"
38:19,360;38:20,760;"who are now the commanders."
38:20,760;38:23,440;"Thoughts on the name commanders?"
38:23,440;38:24,440;"Stupid."
38:24,440;38:25,440;"Awful name."
38:25,440;38:28,440;"Should have done Greg's idea."
38:28,440;38:30,440;"This is much of that pain speed to say."
38:30,440;38:31,440;"Well, the hogs."
38:31,440;38:32,440;"The hogs."
38:32,440;38:33,440;"Yeah."
38:33,440;38:34,440;"The red hogs."
38:34,440;38:35,440;"Come here."
38:35,440;38:37,440;"But we knew it was going to be dumb, didn't we?"
38:37,440;38:38,440;"Oh, yeah."
38:38,440;38:39,440;"100%."
38:39,440;38:42,440;"So out of all of those, all those guys change teams."
38:42,440;38:49,200;"And the player with the most rushing yards by a player acquired last off season, Corey"
38:49,200;38:52,440;"Dillon, who was already over a thousand yards in this game."
38:52,440;38:56,200;"Galore at thousand yards in week 11, game 11."
38:56,200;38:58,620;"11 12 week 12."
38:58,620;39:00,600;"So not too bad."
39:00,600;39:02,080;"He's out rushing Clinton board."
39:02,080;39:04,440;"He's got 945 yards on the season."
39:04,440;39:06,160;"He's number two."
39:06,160;39:07,280;"He got traded for a first round pick."
39:07,280;39:09,040;"We got Corey Dolan for a third."
39:09,040;39:09,680;"Yep."
39:09,680;39:14,920;"Fourth of all, Eddie George for the for the for the Cowboys, 416 yards in the season."
39:14,920;39:16,160;"Good trade."
39:16,160;39:21,840;"But do Staley 700 yards on that stealers offense, which is impressive."
39:21,840;39:25,080;"See him later. Sure will."
39:25,080;39:28,240;"Now, Kyle Bowler has not played well."
39:28,240;39:30,320;"He's been sacked at least once every game,"
39:30,320;39:31,960;"which seems about right."
39:31,960;39:37,280;"Then of course, Phil Sims was talking about how great he's playing in this game."
39:37,280;39:39,440;"Kyle Bowler is playing so much better."
39:39,440;39:41,360;"Literally, as he throws an interception,"
39:41,360;39:44,240;"his first interception in 124 pass attempts."
39:44,240;39:46,400;"So close."
39:46,400;39:50,320;"Actually, we also found out because both these quarterback wearing gloves in this game,"
39:50,320;39:52,840;"because of how putrid the mother was."
39:52,840;39:55,600;"Turns out Phil Sims was the one who started that"
39:55,600;39:58,160;"wearing gloves on a throwing hand."
39:58,160;40:01,560;"And he was mocked mercifully apparently back in"
40:01,560;40:03,760;"whenever he played the 70s, 80s, whenever that was."
40:03,760;40:05,760;"- Oh yeah, I'm sure he's called a little bitch boy."
40:05,760;40:06,800;"- Oh, I'm sure he was."
40:06,800;40:08,340;"I mean, it fits."
40:08,340;40:12,760;"But yeah, so he claimed to fame is he was the first"
40:12,760;40:15,360;"quarterback you wearing gloves on a throwing hand."
40:15,360;40:16,200;"- He normalized it."
40:16,200;40:18,520;"He came out of the, I don't know where you keep"
40:18,520;40:19,960;"your gloves, the drawer."
40:19,960;40:21,960;"Yeah, your glove compartment."
40:21,960;40:22,960;"Mm."
40:22,960;40:23,960;"Love compartment."
40:23,960;40:26,640;"He came out of the compartment and really made the NFL"
40:26,640;40:27,640;"accept it."
40:27,640;40:28,640;"And that looked much better."
40:28,640;40:29,640;"We are."
40:29,640;40:30,640;"Yeah."
40:30,640;40:33,240;"Tom, how do you think you can look out for your ridicule?"
40:33,240;40:34,480;"Baller was the first round draft."
40:34,480;40:37,480;"Like, do you know that?"
40:37,480;40:38,480;"Where did you play college?"
40:38,480;40:39,480;"That means, right?"
40:39,480;40:40,480;"Cal."
40:40,480;40:41,480;"That's right."
40:41,480;40:42,480;"Yeah."
40:42,480;40:46,640;"I think it was pretty, like, relatively highly hyped."
40:46,640;40:49,400;"Like all first round quarterback graphics, right?"
40:49,400;40:51,560;"but he was never any good."
40:51,560;40:52,460;"- No, no."
40:52,460;40:55,560;"No, he never panned out into anything."
40:55,560;40:57,640;"- Which is, you know, pretty par for the course"
40:57,640;40:58,480;"for the Ravens."
40:58,480;41:01,720;"I mean, Lamar Jackson is probably the best quarterback"
41:01,720;41:02,960;"they've ever had."
41:02,960;41:05,280;"- It's exciting."
41:05,280;41:06,440;"- Who?"
41:06,440;41:08,520;"- Who's been better than him?"
41:08,520;41:09,600;"- He's gonna say Flacco."
41:09,600;41:10,640;"- Flacco."
41:10,640;41:13,760;"- He had one good postseason."
41:13,760;41:17,680;"And got paid a shit ton and dragged that team back"
41:17,680;41:20,920;"immediately. Is he better than?"
41:20,920;41:23,920;"Well, my god, super bowls."
41:23,920;41:25,680;"He's reached the pinnacle."
41:25,680;41:27,920;"Is Eli Manning better than?"
41:27,920;41:29,720;"Aaron Rodgers."
41:29,720;41:31,120;"Yes."
41:31,120;41:33,200;"You like my record?"
41:33,200;41:35,000;"I would like to be on record saying that."
41:35,000;41:37,760;"You say Eli Manning is better than Aaron Rodgers."
41:37,760;41:40,040;"OK. Yes, please, please put that in the log."
41:40,040;41:42,560;"Do you hear?"
41:42,560;41:43,520;"Can you record that?"
41:43,520;41:50,080;"They're at twenty twenty two seven eight p.m. Greg Brown on the"
41:50,080;41:52,880;"records and Eli Manning is a better quarterback than Aaron Rodgers."
41:52,880;41:54,440;"You care to expand?"
41:54,440;41:59,480;"Yeah, Roger says a beta cocks. So I boy."
41:59,480;42:04,960;"Opposed to the alpha male Eli Manning."
42:04,960;42:06,440;"Chad."
42:06,440;42:11,720;"This is all you've sold me."
42:11,720;42:20,280;"possibilities. Oh, geez. Craig. I don't know. Super Bowl"
42:20,280;42:22,200;"predictions go. We didn't talk about Super Bowl since it"
42:22,200;42:28,760;"happened, right? I don't believe so. Yeah, I think we got it"
42:28,760;42:30,840;"all wrong. Things have been a bit of a blur. It says it"
42:30,840;42:35,240;"bangles. Did we? Yeah, thoughts on the champion Rams. Oh, no, I"
42:35,240;42:40,400;"think my heart was with the Bengals, but I got was with the"
42:40,400;42:43,740;"Rams. Yeah, you might be right. I think I said Rams to Greg and you said"
42:43,740;42:44,980;"bengals. Yeah."
42:44,980;42:52,260;"We were all wrong. Okay. We're all wrong. But listening to Greg and"
42:52,260;42:59,200;"the Brisbane. So I guess you just don't even offensive line to get"
42:59,200;43:03,580;"super well. Is that what we're learning? I still think Aaron Donald sucks."
43:03,580;43:07,260;"Oh, that's right. You did say that. Even though he ended that Super Bowl."
43:07,340;43:08,740;"He almost won MVP Greg."
43:08,740;43:12,420;"If he had won MVP, I would have been so pissed off."
43:12,420;43:13,580;"I think he would have won it."
43:13,580;43:14,220;"That's where I'm elsewhere."
43:14,220;43:14,660;"Yeah."
43:14,660;43:17,140;"Except that the voting happens before."
43:17,140;43:19,380;"Is it like the voting happens in the third quarter or something?"
43:19,380;43:19,900;"Does it?"
43:19,900;43:20,580;"Yeah."
43:20,580;43:28,740;"So, but just like the the fluisio after that game of him is just unbearable."
43:28,740;43:32,940;"I can't tell you how many different people I heard say, maybe not the best."
43:32,940;43:35,660;"He's the best player of all time."
43:37,060;43:38,820;"Like, what are you talking about?"
43:38,820;43:41,140;"He's not even the best defensive player of all time."
43:41,140;43:42,060;"Yeah."
43:42,060;43:43,780;"Lawrence Taylor."
43:43,780;43:45,980;"Yeah. Yeah. These people have in St. Lawrence Taylor play."
43:45,980;43:48,780;"Yeah. I love that you're getting so worked up about it, Greg."
43:48,780;43:49,780;"This is the best."
43:49,780;43:51,020;"I just had a double team."
43:51,020;43:53,820;"The fucking end of the game, I'll be like, oh, man, Greg's not going to like this."
43:53,820;43:55,460;"You don't even need to look at it."
43:55,460;43:56,580;"Look what Dave Andrews did."
43:56,580;43:59,340;"Well, I didn't do anything."
43:59,340;44:03,660;"David Andrews like not that he ended the game, but the associated dick sucking."
44:03,660;44:05,500;"That was going to come with it. Oh, yeah."
44:05,500;44:07,500;"All around them. Oh, yeah."
44:07,500;44:12,180;"Because everyone has like the same take to it's all like"
44:12,180;44:16,720;"regurgitated regurgitated takes of like, which is like, he"
44:16,720;44:19,940;"might be the best player in the NFL period. Like that's such a"
44:19,940;44:22,660;"that's such a take that like I don't know who started it. But"
44:22,660;44:26,020;"now everyone just says it like you watch ESPN. His name comes"
44:26,020;44:30,380;"up and they just say that as like, it's just the thing. Right."
44:30,380;44:33,860;"You know, yeah, I think that's a good fact now. Yeah, that's"
44:33,900;44:35,500;"That's sports media. That's what they do."
44:35,500;44:41,340;"No one actually moves into like, is there any nuance to this or like why anything is anything?"
44:41,340;44:43,980;"They're just like, yeah, just state this as a fact."
44:43,980;44:53,820;"But that's not what sports talk sports TV sports media is anymore. It's just throw out or some sort"
44:53,820;44:58,700;"of opinion and then have two people yell at each other about how the other one's completely wrong"
44:58,700;45:03,660;"and how they're an asshole for believing what they believe, you know, that's literally all that's"
45:03,660;45:05,480;"- It's literally like every one of these shows now,"
45:05,480;45:07,120;"so I don't watch it anymore."
45:07,120;45:08,660;"That's what sports talk radio is, except,"
45:08,660;45:13,660;"""Sportalk Radio,"" is that except it's the radio broadcasters"
45:13,660;45:17,280;"putting out their thing and then people calling in"
45:17,280;45:18,920;"to tell them they're wrong, and then they're shooting"
45:18,920;45:20,080;"on those people instead."
45:20,080;45:23,840;"- Yo, I heard of that Tony Mas,"
45:23,840;45:26,280;"is gonna be calling Red Sox games this year?"
45:26,280;45:27,120;"- Nah."
45:27,120;45:28,600;"(laughs)"
45:28,600;45:30,080;"- Maybe there's no greens."
45:30,080;45:30,920;"- Right, yeah."
45:30,920;45:31,760;"- Yeah."
45:31,760;45:32,760;"- No greens."
45:32,760;45:35,840;"It's one of the few times I'm rooting for the strike to happen."
45:35,840;45:38,560;"Jackie Bradley sucks."
45:38,560;45:39,800;"My socks."
45:39,800;45:43,600;"But I didn't like Jackie Bradley's come with a bet and he's just getting"
45:43,600;45:45,720;"a fucking trash to my Tony Mazz."
45:45,720;45:46,240;"Right."
45:46,240;45:52,880;"But the play by play guys travel on the same team plane."
45:52,880;45:54,320;"Yeah."
45:54,320;45:56,240;"So that could be interesting."
45:56,240;45:57,160;"Mm."
45:57,160;45:59,760;"Would mind seeing Tony Maslow, the black guy."
45:59,760;46:02,240;"Walking off one of those planes."
46:02,240;46:07,160;"Yeah, and I'm just going to venture a guess that he's not the most physically imposing human Tony"
46:07,160;46:14,240;"Mass. No, no, no, you haven't you haven't ever seen him? Yeah. Oh boy. Yeah. He looks like"
46:14,240;46:22,200;"a bald Steve Brown at the age of like 60. Whoa, ugly. I could say shots, Steve."
46:22,200;46:28,560;"I'm not. I am. No, Steve. No, it looks is that there you go. Tony Mass."
46:29,080;46:31,400;"If I was bald, I would be ugly."
46:31,400;46:33,960;"Look at this."
46:33,960;46:34,520;"Yes."
46:34,520;46:36,120;"This is what I'm saying."
46:36,120;46:37,640;"I'll leave that one alone."
46:37,640;46:38,440;"That's a tough look."
46:38,440;46:39,960;"We're going to have a bit."
46:39,960;46:41,160;"It's just a lot."
46:41,160;46:42,600;"A lot of real estate there."
46:42,600;46:44,840;"Dude, you can start a drive-in theater."
46:44,840;46:45,480;"Exactly."
46:45,480;46:48,520;"It's looking just too much."
46:48,520;46:50,920;"Beautiful."
46:50,920;46:53,080;"Oh, God."
46:53,080;46:54,120;"All right."
46:54,120;46:56,440;"Any other comments, Greg?"
46:56,440;46:58,740;"Did anybody else want to shoot on before we call this?"
46:58,740;47:02,540;"Anyone want to compare to Hitler?"
47:02,540;47:04,600;"We haven't done that yet."
47:04,600;47:11,340;"That game still is the second highest scoring game in NFL history."
47:11,340;47:11,840;"Holy shit."
47:11,840;47:12,240;"Really?"
47:12,240;47:15,440;"Rams Chiefs one was one point less."
47:15,440;47:16,040;"Wow."
47:16,040;47:17,940;"54 to 51."
47:17,940;47:19,840;"Oh, wow."
47:19,840;47:21,240;"That's crazy."
47:21,240;47:22,240;"It was 51."
47:22,240;47:22,540;"Okay."
47:22,540;47:25,840;"I was trying to find like what the highest scoring Patriots game is."
47:25,840;47:29,640;"and they don't really, they're like showing up on any list."
47:29,640;47:38,260;"If I had to guess, I would say it's the, uh, the route of the, um,"
47:38,260;47:40,360;"Titans Titans."
47:40,360;47:44,720;"Yeah, cause you need to buy themselves or yeah, that's even score."
47:44,720;47:45,400;"That's true."
47:45,400;47:46,400;"Um, let's see."
47:46,400;47:50,680;"There's a couple like 59 to 31s in there."
47:50,680;47:52,240;"Yeah."
47:52,240;47:53,640;"Gotta be 2007."
47:53,640;47:54,880;"Yeah."
47:54,880;47:56,880;"I mean, the page is like a bunch of money."
47:56,880;47:58,320;"- I mean, the team score is a compliment."
47:58,320;47:59,400;"- So let's see."
47:59,400;48:03,960;"I'll tell you the highest scoring paths game."
48:03,960;48:05,360;"So obviously 59, nothing gets tight."
48:05,360;48:08,400;"And it's 59.24 against the Colts in 2012."
48:08,400;48:13,040;"56.10, 59.24 so far as the biggest one."
48:13,040;48:15,080;"55.31 against the Steelers."
48:15,080;48:19,240;"Let's see."
48:19,240;48:22,360;"Oh, where's the 35.35 against Cowboys?"
48:22,360;48:23,360;"What?"
48:23,360;48:24,360;"- That doesn't seem right."
48:24,360;48:28,420;"- There's a tie."
48:28,420;48:29,520;"- Yeah, there is no there."
48:29,520;48:31,200;"- Can't tie in the NFL."
48:31,200;48:32,200;"- Nope."
48:32,200;48:34,520;"- I'm gonna give you a peaches ever tie it either."
48:34,520;48:38,520;"- Say 5924 against the Colts in 2012."
48:38,520;48:42,440;"Looks like that might be the highest scoring pass game"
48:42,440;48:43,520;"'cause what's that?"
48:43,520;48:44,360;"- You should go to a..."
48:44,360;48:45,760;"- That's 83 points, that's pretty good."
48:45,760;48:48,760;"- That's Dynasty.com and see what's on there."
48:48,760;48:50,080;"- Ooh, look at that, yeah."
48:50,080;48:52,680;"- That didn't go to our resource site out there."
48:52,680;48:56,520;"There's some sort of site that chronicle all of the Patriots."
48:56,520;48:58,840;"Even so the last 20 years."
48:58,840;49:02,560;"And then a bunch of idiots go through and watch each game and record"
49:02,560;49:04,160;"powers of content for each game."
49:04,160;49:07,440;"2013 week nine against the steel 55 31."
49:07,440;49:09,920;"That's a good one."
49:09,920;49:14,120;"That is 86 combined total points."
49:14,120;49:15,840;"That's pretty good."
49:15,840;49:19,200;"I think that's as high as I can get you."
49:21,200;49:22,600;"can't keep up with our defense."
49:22,600;49:27,480;"Well, that's the thing is the page to have a good defense when they blow teams out."
49:27,480;49:30,200;"So about that."
49:30,200;49:30,920;"Damn."
49:30,920;49:35,520;"Would you guys think of the halftime show at the Super Bowl?"
49:35,520;49:37,640;"It was good."
49:37,640;49:38,120;"I liked it."
49:38,120;49:39,000;"I liked it."
49:39,000;49:39,560;"It was good."
49:39,560;49:41,520;"It only got 33 complaints, right?"
49:41,520;49:43,360;"It's pretty good."
49:43,360;49:46,880;"Which is crazy when you think of it of like what?"
49:46,880;49:50,800;"Who those artists are historically?"
49:51,080;49:57,640;"Yes. The fact that they are like the least problematic of artists is just mind boggling."
49:57,640;50:00,680;"It's been a little different from the most to the least."
50:00,680;50:09,080;"Yeah. I like that the only scandal was the fact that somebody caught Snoop Dogg smoking a J beforehand."
50:09,080;50:12,760;"Yeah. I got all around him about that. Well, that's the thing."
50:12,760;50:17,760;"- They kind of avoided who they are though."
50:17,760;50:19,960;"- You think?"
50:19,960;50:22,160;"- Your dog wasn't smoking weed on stage."
50:22,160;50:23,960;"The Eminem and Dre song,"
50:23,960;50:27,360;"where Eminem versus all about killing his wife"
50:27,360;50:29,080;"and where you stash the body."
50:29,080;50:30,840;"- Yeah, sure, they didn't go with that one."
50:30,840;50:32,080;"- Hard, I would buy you."
50:32,080;50:34,320;"- Yeah, and steady plays the fucking one from eight mile,"
50:34,320;50:36,040;"which isn't even a Dre song."
50:36,040;50:40,400;"It was just, I just, you know, I was kind of disappointed."
50:40,400;50:42,720;"- And it wasn't forgot about Dre either, which was still."
50:42,720;50:45,040;"Yeah, I wanted it to be like that."
50:45,040;50:49,440;"The point of those guys has always been like the fuck you to everything everybody."
50:49,440;50:55,640;"And it just doesn't feel right watching them like dance through the hoops to be like,"
50:55,640;50:59,120;"you know, good corporate guys that they're old."
50:59,120;51:00,920;"I mean, I don't know."
51:00,920;51:01,920;"I get softer."
51:01,920;51:06,440;"You know, out of my head though was like, I thought pretty deeply about this of like"
51:06,440;51:09,960;"what they would do if they really wanted to like pull one."
51:09,960;51:10,960;"Yeah."
51:10,960;51:16,480;"And you know, hit him up by Tupac, where it's just like, you know, the lights dim and everybody's quiet."
51:16,480;51:22,400;"And it's like completely silent in the state of me, because that's why I fucked your bitch, you bad motherfucker."
51:22,400;51:25,760;"That's like open with gunfire too."
51:25,760;51:27,840;"That would have got me so hyped."
51:27,840;51:30,720;"Fuck your bitch in the curriculum."
51:30,720;51:36,160;"Dude, so awesome."
51:36,160;51:38,600;"Is that the one that starts with gunfire too?"
51:38,600;51:39,520;"Yeah."
51:40,000;51:41,840;"Yeah, that's gonna be great to just play."
51:41,840;51:44,000;"Yeah, there was a lot of the talk stadium."
51:44,000;51:44,840;"Yeah."
51:44,840;51:46,600;"(laughs)"
51:46,600;51:47,800;"I like getting them screaming."
51:47,800;51:48,640;"Mm-hmm."
51:48,640;51:51,680;"Oh well."
51:51,680;51:52,880;"Next year."
51:52,880;51:53,720;"Next year."
51:53,720;51:55,120;"Yeah, we'll have the holographic."
51:55,120;51:57,480;"But if yeah, but if like how far we've gotten"
51:57,480;52:00,840;"in like progressive terms of, to like, you know,"
52:00,840;52:01,680;"what we're allowed to say,"
52:01,680;52:04,080;"no one cares to think about like,"
52:04,080;52:06,880;"what Dr. Dre and Eminem used to say in their first album."
52:06,880;52:07,880;"Oh yeah."
52:07,880;52:09,520;"You used to talk about hate gay people"
52:09,520;52:11,800;"I'm like, there was a lot of shit."
52:11,800;52:14,760;"- It's rife with the most inappropriate raunchy shit"
52:14,760;52:16,280;"you could ever imagine."
52:16,280;52:17,120;"- Oh yeah."
52:17,120;52:18,200;"- Which is why it's awesome."
52:18,200;52:20,400;"- On purpose too, like yeah, that's why it got popped."
52:20,400;52:21,240;"- Yeah, because now."
52:21,240;52:24,600;"- But this like selective answer is very perplexing."
52:24,600;52:25,720;"- Yeah, well, you know."
52:25,720;52:27,760;"- Yeah, no."
52:27,760;52:30,560;"- You get soft as you get older, Greg."
52:30,560;52:33,200;"- Yeah, once Ice Cube did, are we there yet?"
52:33,200;52:35,200;"I think that was kind of a nail in the coffin."
52:35,200;52:36,200;"(laughing)"
52:36,200;52:37,840;"- I'm one's crop, you can do whatever you want."
52:37,840;52:38,680;"- Yeah."
52:38,680;52:43,880;"Yeah, it's game over. Yeah, once he was voicing the fucking animal and track four."
52:43,880;52:48,760;"He was just co-starred with Adam Sandler. Yeah, exactly."
52:48,760;52:51,640;"There was an R.U.E. there yet too, maybe even three."
52:51,640;52:55,880;"No, there wasn't. There's definitely two. Yeah. Why was there one? There's three."
52:55,880;53:03,640;"All right. He's got to be in this. Oh, he's not. All right. So I got a football question for you."
53:03,640;53:05,760;"It's Terry Cruz is that ice cube."
53:05,760;53:09,760;"Oh, Terry Cruz, the office linebacker."
53:09,760;53:11,200;"That guy's awesome."
53:11,200;53:12,600;"You should probably watch that."
53:12,600;53:17,000;"You see the commercial where Gerard Mayo is the new like."
53:17,000;53:21,480;"Yeah, Terry Cruz and he is a."
53:21,480;53:23,000;"I'm back."
53:23,000;53:23,000;"I'm back."
53:23,000;53:23,480;"People."
53:23,480;53:25,640;"Yeah, tackling people about mayonnaise."
53:25,640;53:27,640;"I was like a woman's male thing."
53:27,640;53:28,720;"I like that."
53:28,720;53:29,120;"I like that."
53:29,120;53:31,920;"Like me when all of a sudden comes in and just like tackles him and like force"
53:31,920;53:33,400;"- It just means the mega names."
53:33,400;53:34,360;"- That's awesome."
53:34,360;53:36,920;"- Oh, I'm a spook."
53:36,920;53:38,640;"- That's good, that's good."
53:38,640;53:39,480;"- That's not bad, right?"
53:39,480;53:41,760;"- Yeah, I think I got his name, it is Mayo."
53:41,760;53:42,600;"- Yeah."
53:42,600;53:43,960;"- 'Cause you know they work backwards from that"
53:43,960;53:46,520;"where they're like, all right, we got Dr. Mayo."
53:46,520;53:48,200;"- Well, no, they're like, we're Hellman's."
53:48,200;53:49,120;"We're Hellman's."
53:49,120;53:51,120;"There's a guy named Mayo, what can we do with him?"
53:51,120;53:52,600;"- Yeah, he was a linebacker."
53:52,600;53:54,080;"Wasn't there a linebacker commercial?"
53:54,080;53:54,920;"- Yes, exactly."
53:54,920;53:55,880;"- Let's bring that back."
53:55,880;53:58,120;"- Yeah, it all tracks there."
53:58,120;53:59,760;"- Yeah, it took him so long."
53:59,760;54:00,600;"- Yeah."
54:01,400;54:04,520;"- The Are We There Yet is not a third movie."
54:04,520;54:05,520;"It's a sitcom."
54:05,520;54:07,400;"- Oh."
54:07,400;54:08,800;"- With three seasons."
54:08,800;54:09,880;"- That's worse."
54:09,880;54:10,720;"- That's worse."
54:10,720;54:11,920;"- Oh, dude."
54:11,920;54:13,320;"- That's worse."
54:13,320;54:16,400;"- What's worse that or a little Sheldon,"
54:16,400;54:17,380;"or whatever the hell,"
54:17,380;54:18,220;"a little Sheldon."
54:18,220;54:19,940;"- Sheldon, I'll watch this over a little Sheldon"
54:19,940;54:20,780;"all day."
54:20,780;54:22,160;"- Oh, sometimes I'll watch like five minutes of that"
54:22,160;54:24,520;"as just like a, what's itself,"
54:24,520;54:25,360;"- Masochism."
54:25,360;54:27,160;"- Masochism, where I just like,"
54:27,160;54:29,200;"'cause I hate myself."
54:29,200;54:31,440;"I'm feeling a little too joyous right now."
54:31,440;54:35,520;"So let's, I've watched too many beast mode compilations."
54:35,520;54:37,080;"So let's, let's bounce this out."
54:37,080;54:38,640;"- It's the opposite of a beast mode."
54:38,640;54:41,240;"- Bounces out was an awful television."
54:41,240;54:42,800;"- 74 episodes."
54:42,800;54:44,520;"- All right."
54:44,520;54:46,320;"So here's a, you want to do a homework assignment here"
54:46,320;54:47,860;"for the next podcast."
54:47,860;54:53,240;"We each need to come up with a NFL player related"
54:53,240;54:56,320;"commercial branding deal co-op deal, okay?"
54:56,320;54:58,080;"- No."
54:58,080;55:00,480;"So we'll come up with like the premise for a commercial."
55:00,480;55:03,240;"- I feel like I already did this for his episode"
55:03,240;55:06,640;"'cause I was gonna do that we were not sponsored by."
55:06,640;55:10,980;"And mine was something to do with Warren Saps,"
55:10,980;55:13,620;"female vibrators."
55:13,620;55:19,160;"- Yes, and then I remember saying I don't get it"
55:19,160;55:22,040;"and then he went in this long explanation"
55:22,040;55:23,240;"which I've since forgotten."
55:23,240;55:27,840;"- That's what he would gift his female coworkers"
55:27,840;55:31,320;"when he was an anchor at Fox Sports."
55:31,320;55:32,880;"- Yes."
55:32,880;55:34,520;"- I believe it may have even been his own brand."
55:34,520;55:38,520;"I don't know, or a brand that he enjoyed."
55:38,520;55:40,000;"- Preused. - Yeah."
55:40,000;55:41,560;"- Perhaps, yeah."
55:41,560;55:42,760;"So that's what he would just give his"
55:42,760;55:45,140;"platonic female coworkers."
55:45,140;55:47,720;"- Just off the top of my head here,"
55:47,720;55:50,200;"like a Cam Newton insurance one,"
55:50,200;55:53,040;"where in the Super Bowl he doesn't dive on the fumble."
55:53,040;55:53,880;"(laughing)"
55:53,880;55:55,040;"He asked him after the game, he's like,"
55:55,040;55:57,440;"""You know, I got a long career, Adami."""
55:57,440;55:59,700;"(laughing)"
55:59,700;56:04,960;"- Yeah, that's safety is the right decision, state farm."
56:04,960;56:06,120;"Want to get away?"
56:06,120;56:06,960;"- Yeah."
56:06,960;56:09,640;"- Oh, with Leon Let,"
56:09,640;56:12,600;"where he's returning the fumble."
56:12,600;56:13,440;"- Don't be good."
56:13,440;56:15,360;"- Yeah, exactly, Don BB runs them down."
56:15,360;56:17,560;"- Yeah, cuts to a Southwest commercial."
56:17,560;56:18,400;"Want to get away?"
56:18,400;56:19,640;"- All right, home market assignment,"
56:19,640;56:20,480;"come up with your best."
56:20,480;56:21,760;"- We just did it, we just did it."
56:21,760;56:23,600;"- I know, but we really think it through,"
56:23,600;56:24,840;"we'll have some funny ones."
56:24,840;56:25,680;"- All right, fine."
56:25,680;56:27,280;"I don't think we will, but I appreciate it."
56:27,280;56:28,880;"- I appreciate your confidence in us."
56:28,880;56:31,200;"That'll be your homework."
56:31,200;56:32,520;"'Cause you're not gonna watch the game next week anyway."
56:32,520;56:33,840;"So, that'll be your homework."
56:33,840;56:36,040;"You come up with your top 10 and we'll watch it anyway."
56:36,040;56:37,360;"- All right, voila!"
56:37,360;56:39,920;"(laughing)"
56:39,920;56:40,760;"- Oh boy."
56:40,760;56:43,800;"All right, let's do best and worst."
56:43,800;56:47,640;"You don't wanna neither be at best and worst."
56:47,640;56:49,440;"- Yeah, I got nothing to do."
56:49,440;56:52,280;"- All right, I'll give you some best and worst."
56:52,280;56:56,400;"The best is the defensive package"
56:56,400;56:59,600;"that the pages are rolling out in the red zone,"
56:59,600;57:02,480;"where you have Richard Seymour playing full back"
57:02,480;57:05,800;"and Mike Vrable playing tight end."
57:05,800;57:09,200;"And that scored two touchdowns in this game."
57:09,200;57:13,080;"- Oh yeah, and it is Corey Dillon truck stick"
57:13,080;57:14,560;"on Ray Lewis there."
57:14,560;57:16,320;"- Yeah, yeah, to get an end touchdown."
57:16,320;57:18,520;"- Exactly, Seymour buckled him too."
57:18,520;57:19,600;"- Yep, yep."
57:19,600;57:20,720;"- So that Seymour in this game--"
57:20,720;57:23,120;"- I could have a best, that's my best."
57:23,120;57:23,960;"That's a great one."
57:23,960;57:25,760;"- More erasing than Lewis."
57:25,760;57:28,400;"Yeah, so in this game though,"
57:28,400;57:30,840;"Richard Seymour was in on all short yardage things"
57:30,840;57:32,960;"as like the starting fullback."
57:32,960;57:34,280;"Could not find anybody to block"
57:34,280;57:36,320;"'cause the halls were so wide open."
57:36,320;57:38,120;"So he's run through open, Corey Dills,"
57:38,120;57:39,120;"run around and run through."
57:39,120;57:40,440;"Dick Seymour."
57:40,440;57:41,280;"Yeah."
57:41,280;57:42,120;"Could not find--"
57:42,120;57:44,240;"I have a hard time handling holes that are too open."
57:44,240;57:46,880;"Just wide open holes that you're running this Seymour."
57:46,880;57:51,880;"Mom told me this weekend that she can't call people dick."
57:51,880;57:53,720;"(laughing)"
57:53,720;57:55,900;"- Like she's like, people are like, ""Rich it,"
57:55,900;57:56,800;"I can't call him dick."""
57:56,800;57:58,260;"And I was like, ""Why not?"""
57:58,260;58:02,200;"She goes, ""Oh, well in England, that's like a slang for penis."""
58:02,200;58:04,940;"And I was like, ""It was just like for penis everywhere."""
58:04,940;58:07,180;"(laughing)"
58:07,180;58:08,100;"- Very naughty."
58:08,100;58:10,560;"- Oh, God."
58:10,560;58:13,000;"- I said, ""We're just not all like five year olds"
58:13,000;58:15,720;"that can't, you know, say a word"
58:15,720;58:17,760;"without fucking giggling to ourselves."""
58:17,760;58:19,120;"- Sometimes a naughty boy."
58:19,120;58:21,280;"(laughing)"
58:21,280;58:23,400;"- Oh my goodness."
58:23,400;58:31,800;"You can't take those people anywhere. Oh, fuck. All right. So that's good. Another quality note for"
58:31,800;58:37,480;"this 2004 Patriots off the Patriots team in general is they have more college graduates"
58:37,480;58:42,920;"than any other team, which apparently makes them smarter. And the entire team loves learning the"
58:42,920;58:47,080;"new game plan every week because it's different every week. And Phil Sims went into a long rant"
58:47,080;58:52,280;"where he would always be excited to get the game plan. And it was all and you know, if it was the"
58:52,280;58:55,000;"same as last week, he get all pissed off. He's like, Oh, I'm running the same"
58:55,000;59:00,360;"players we did last week. That's not gonna work. So this team, full of smart guys."
59:00,360;59:08,840;"We could start. Yeah. Did you know, Ryan Fitzpatrick went to have it? Oh, I didn't have it. Yeah. Cool."
59:08,840;59:17,240;"Also nice fun step for what's his face if he still listens, the"
59:17,880;59:19,600;"Adam and Terry apologist."
59:19,600;59:20,600;"Pushmazoo."
59:20,600;59:23,200;"[LAUGHTER]"
59:23,200;59:24,200;"Corey, what's his face?"
59:24,200;59:25,200;"Oh, look at that."
59:25,200;59:26,200;"He's Connor."
59:26,200;59:26,700;"Connor?"
59:26,700;59:28,800;"Go whatever the hell's name is."
59:28,800;59:31,080;"Yeah, if he's not too busy mangling"
59:31,080;59:33,760;"stakes on his Facebook page."
59:33,760;59:34,760;"Oh, trigger."
59:34,760;59:36,720;"Adam."
59:36,720;59:39,960;"Adam and Terry, four of New England's six playoff games,"
59:39,960;59:41,680;"won by Adam and Terry kicks."
59:41,680;59:42,880;"That's pretty good."
59:42,880;59:43,880;"It's not a good--"
59:43,880;59:44,380;"It's pretty good."
59:44,380;59:45,720;"It's a pretty good average."
59:45,720;59:47,000;"So don't tell him."
59:47,000;59:53,760;"Uh, also, Richard Seymour in a full back position actually past blocking, which is impressive."
59:53,760;59:57,760;"Although I feel like it's kind of defeating the purpose because isn't he like almost seven feet tall?"
59:57,760;59:58,960;"So you're not going to throw the football over."
59:58,960;01:00:02,920;"Um, I got some best here."
01:00:02,920;01:00:04,280;"OK, give me some best."
01:00:04,280;01:00:08,400;"Um, we got a lot of funny names on this team, this Ravens team."
01:00:08,400;01:00:09,480;"Give me some funny names."
01:00:09,480;01:00:11,080;"Darnell Dinkins."
01:00:11,080;01:00:12,800;"Yeah."
01:00:12,800;01:00:14,640;"TJ slaughter."
01:00:14,720;01:00:16,440;"This is my favorite name. He's a linebacker."
01:00:16,440;01:00:18,840;"That's a solid line background."
01:00:18,840;01:00:23,320;"DJ Sam's Club, which is like a combination of BJ's and Sam's Club."
01:00:23,320;01:00:28,640;"And then my personal favorite, Kelly Greg."
01:00:28,640;01:00:33,520;"That's me and my wife."
01:00:33,520;01:00:37,000;"Yeah, that's very similar to Steve Gregory."
01:00:37,000;01:00:42,520;"Two G's, though, which really never trust a Greg with two G's."
01:00:42,520;01:00:45,080;"You gotta see this guy too."
01:00:45,080;01:00:46,560;"[laughter]"
01:00:46,560;01:00:47,560;"Oh boy."
01:00:47,560;01:00:50,920;"Boy, you got a neck on him."
01:00:50,920;01:00:51,920;"[laughter]"
01:00:51,920;01:00:55,760;"He's also like, go to his, just like your wife."
01:00:55,760;01:00:56,760;"Our reference picture."
01:00:56,760;01:00:57,760;"Oh god."
01:00:57,760;01:01:00,360;"Looks like he's biting his left too."
01:01:00,360;01:01:01,360;"What?"
01:01:01,360;01:01:02,360;"My position?"
01:01:02,360;01:01:05,560;"Oh, dude, his neck is his head."
01:01:05,560;01:01:06,560;"Uh-huh."
01:01:06,560;01:01:07,560;"Holy shit."
01:01:07,560;01:01:08,560;"Kelly Graggle, yeah."
01:01:08,560;01:01:09,560;"Oh boy."
01:01:09,560;01:01:10,560;"Is he on the toilet?"
01:01:10,560;01:01:12,440;"- Boy, is he on the toilet?"
01:01:12,440;01:01:14,160;"Well, this bitch has been taken."
01:01:14,160;01:01:17,480;"- He looks like my six week old"
01:01:17,480;01:01:19,560;"who's when he's feeling his diaper."
01:01:19,560;01:01:20,920;"He's got that."
01:01:20,920;01:01:21,760;"Look to him."
01:01:21,760;01:01:24,760;"Yee, bud."
01:01:24,760;01:01:28,080;"You should send it to your wife."
01:01:28,080;01:01:29,720;"Greg, you should send it to your wife."
01:01:29,720;01:01:30,560;"- Yeah."
01:01:30,560;01:01:31,400;"- See what you just said."
01:01:31,400;01:01:32,560;"- He's getting my wife."
01:01:32,560;01:01:33,880;"(laughs)"
01:01:33,880;01:01:34,880;"- My wife."
01:01:34,880;01:01:37,400;"- I'm sure she'll be very appreciative of that."
01:01:37,400;01:01:40,000;"All right, Troy Brown."
01:01:40,000;01:01:43,080;"Another, another best, I would say,"
01:01:43,080;01:01:45,240;"playing slot cornerback, making a tackle"
01:01:45,240;01:01:46,800;"in the fourth quarter on,"
01:01:46,800;01:01:47,640;"wherever the running back was,"
01:01:47,640;01:01:49,640;"Chester Taylor, I think it was."
01:01:49,640;01:01:51,220;"That's hard to do when you tried Brown size,"
01:01:51,220;01:01:54,620;"maybe in the open field, preventing a first down."
01:01:54,620;01:01:58,080;"Also playing cornerback Eugene Wilson"
01:01:58,080;01:01:59,000;"has shifted from safety,"
01:01:59,000;01:02:01,600;"'cause they just don't have enough cornerbacks."
01:02:01,600;01:02:03,600;"So he's now playing cornerback right Brown."
01:02:03,600;01:02:06,040;"That was just for you."
01:02:06,040;01:02:07,040;"Yeah."
01:02:07,040;01:02:08,200;"- I didn't know he went back."
01:02:08,200;01:02:11,040;"And that's kind of all I have."
01:02:11,040;01:02:15,080;"Thoughts on Russia and Ukraine."
01:02:15,080;01:02:17,760;"(laughing)"
01:02:17,760;01:02:21,160;"The false flag, geopolitical podcast now."
01:02:21,160;01:02:22,920;"The false flag."
01:02:22,920;01:02:24,120;"All are conspiracy."
01:02:24,120;01:02:25,760;"They're just trying to get rid of the Nazis."
01:02:25,760;01:02:27,440;"Bye. (laughing)"
01:02:27,440;01:02:29,520;"Yeah, it's a peacekeeping mission."
01:02:29,520;01:02:32,240;"That's a special operation to remove the Nazis."
01:02:32,240;01:02:33,240;"I don't want to be in that game."
01:02:33,240;01:02:34,280;"The Nazi equation."
01:02:34,280;01:02:36,560;"Yeah, by bombing Holocaust museums."
01:02:36,560;01:02:37,400;"Yeah."
01:02:37,400;01:02:39,400;"Yeah. And assassinated."
01:02:39,400;01:02:41,400;"That's a fault. That's a fault."
01:02:41,400;01:02:43,400;"Okay."
01:02:43,400;01:02:47,400;"What is it? Steve, have you heard anything from a vechkin?"
01:02:47,400;01:02:53,400;"I think you've like anti to it, but a lot of sponsors are dropping them. We're talking about just."
01:02:53,400;01:03:03,400;"Interesting. Well, New Hampshire has taken the bold, courageous step of not selling Russian vodka at their liquor store."
01:03:03,400;01:03:05,600;"- So, like a store's crash. - Probably solved."
01:03:05,600;01:03:07,640;"- Yeah. - Virginia too, baby."
01:03:07,640;01:03:09,560;"- There'll be peace in no time."
01:03:09,560;01:03:10,640;"- Yeah."
01:03:10,640;01:03:12,480;"- Really putting the pressure on."
01:03:12,480;01:03:13,880;"- Live for your die."
01:03:13,880;01:03:14,720;"- Yeah."
01:03:14,720;01:03:16,440;"(laughing)"
01:03:16,440;01:03:17,960;"- Economic sanctions, baby."
01:03:17,960;01:03:22,680;"Speaking of taking it easy, Bill Belichick."
01:03:22,680;01:03:28,120;"Basically just did walkthroughs in the week prior to this,"
01:03:28,120;01:03:29,960;"because he knew this would be such a physical game"
01:03:29,960;01:03:32,120;"because it's a Baltimore Ravens."
01:03:32,120;01:03:32,960;"- That's good."
01:03:32,960;01:03:35,040;"- Smart Greg is that a sign of his genius"
01:03:35,040;01:03:36,440;"or him going soft."
01:03:36,440;01:03:38,200;"- I think it's him going soft."
01:03:38,200;01:03:41,200;"- I am shocked."
01:03:41,200;01:03:42,480;"Do you think that?"
01:03:42,480;01:03:44,000;"- I'm on a team bell check here."
01:03:44,000;01:03:44,840;"- Yeah."
01:03:44,840;01:03:46,520;"- Me too."
01:03:46,520;01:03:49,040;"Just another sign of him being ahead of the curve."
01:03:49,040;01:03:50,760;"- Kind of finger on the pulse of the team."
01:03:50,760;01:03:51,680;"- Yep."
01:03:51,680;01:03:52,520;"Absolutely."
01:03:52,520;01:03:54,240;"- I think they should do that every week."
01:03:54,240;01:03:55,080;"- Just walkers."
01:03:55,080;01:03:56,400;"- Walkers."
01:03:56,400;01:03:59,720;"- Yeah, players don't need to practice."
01:03:59,720;01:04:01,960;"(laughing)"
01:04:01,960;01:04:06,600;"that sounds like some Jacksonville Jack"
01:04:06,600;01:04:07,600;"warship."
01:04:07,600;01:04:08,240;"That was the"
01:04:08,240;01:04:09,240;"biggest show."
01:04:09,240;01:04:10,840;"That was the"
01:04:10,840;01:04:11,840;"biggest show."
01:04:11,840;01:04:16,080;"At some point when they're pro they don't need to practice."
01:04:16,080;01:04:18,280;"I don't think I agree with that."
01:04:18,280;01:04:20,480;"I don't think a lot of players are either."
01:04:20,480;01:04:21,880;"A lot of pro players are probably."
01:04:21,880;01:04:24,440;"I think Urban Meyer would probably agree with you."
01:04:24,440;01:04:28,280;"Andrew Whitworth, that guy hasn't practiced in like four years."
01:04:28,280;01:04:31,920;"I'm sure there are some people who don't need to practice."
01:04:31,920;01:04:32,760;"Yeah, correct."
01:04:32,760;01:04:34,360;"I might as need to practice anymore either, but."
01:04:34,360;01:04:35,200;"Yeah."
01:04:35,200;01:04:36,200;"Players."
01:04:36,200;01:04:37,520;"Yeah, it's a fair practice."
01:04:37,520;01:04:38,240;"Yeah."
01:04:38,240;01:04:39,480;"It's more situation-"
01:04:39,480;01:04:40,320;"It's more situation-"
01:04:40,320;01:04:41,160;"You are, maybe you need it."
01:04:41,160;01:04:45,120;"I think the Patriots way of practicing situational football"
01:04:45,120;01:04:49,320;"is probably more useful to professionals than anything."
01:04:49,320;01:04:50,760;"But just like hitting each other all the time,"
01:04:50,760;01:04:54,240;"that's like not really helping you."
01:04:54,240;01:04:55,960;"I don't think so."
01:04:55,960;01:04:57,080;"Maybe at the beginning of the season,"
01:04:57,080;01:04:59,000;"they're knocked the rust off and all that jazz,"
01:04:59,000;01:05:00,920;"and pre-season shit."
01:05:00,920;01:05:04,240;"And you get in the season, you just want to be healthy, man."
01:05:04,240;01:05:06,720;"Football's a brutal sport."
01:05:06,720;01:05:07,680;"- That's right."
01:05:07,680;01:05:09,720;"So we should be coaches."
01:05:09,720;01:05:13,760;"We should, let's all play our coaches."
01:05:13,760;01:05:17,680;"When you all move back up here, we'll coach a P-We team"
01:05:17,680;01:05:19,800;"and we'll just fucking stomp to people."
01:05:19,800;01:05:23,440;"- And we'll just have a no practice policy."
01:05:23,440;01:05:25,480;"We'll just practice touchdown celebrations."
01:05:25,480;01:05:26,760;"It's all we practice."
01:05:28,600;01:05:30,600;"And Hail Mary's Hail Mary's in touch."
01:05:30,600;01:05:31,600;"I was all operations."
01:05:31,600;01:05:33,800;"Everybody go along."
01:05:33,800;01:05:36,080;"- All right, week one."
01:05:36,080;01:05:37,160;"- I've felt blitz."
01:05:37,160;01:05:38,000;"What was it?"
01:05:38,000;01:05:40,400;"The bomb and I fell street."
01:05:40,400;01:05:42,720;"Was the matter."
01:05:42,720;01:05:43,560;"- That was how it was."
01:05:43,560;01:05:44,480;"- It was something like that."
01:05:44,480;01:05:46,560;"- We just, everyone would just go around"
01:05:46,560;01:05:48,120;"and just run every play."
01:05:48,120;01:05:48,960;"- Of course."
01:05:48,960;01:05:52,720;"- That's literally every Madden game."
01:05:52,720;01:05:53,960;"Fucking love that shit."
01:05:53,960;01:05:56,320;"It should be fun."
01:05:56,320;01:05:58,320;"Football should be fun."
01:05:58,320;01:06:01,120;"Everybody should have as much fun as beast mode."
01:06:01,120;01:06:03,080;"That's right."
01:06:03,080;01:06:03,600;"It's Julian."
01:06:03,600;01:06:04,920;"I look at him giggling."
01:06:04,920;01:06:05,600;"It's tackled."
01:06:05,600;01:06:06,760;"See what happens to him."
01:06:06,760;01:06:09,320;"He'd be like, they beat it out of them."
01:06:09,320;01:06:10,120;"Yeah."
01:06:10,120;01:06:11,720;"I'm only here, so I don't get fines."
01:06:11,720;01:06:12,360;"Yeah."
01:06:12,360;01:06:13,760;"They beat it out of them."
01:06:13,760;01:06:15,280;"It's crazy to watch that."
01:06:15,280;01:06:15,680;"Yeah."
01:06:15,680;01:06:18,360;"But then corporate culture steps in and says, Hey, we're"
01:06:18,360;01:06:18,720;"skittles."
01:06:18,720;01:06:20,160;"We'll give you millions of dollars."
01:06:20,160;01:06:22,920;"Yeah."
01:06:22,920;01:06:24,560;"So you guys probably doing it right now."
01:06:24,560;01:06:26,240;"But that's because he's out of the league, right?"
01:06:26,600;01:06:28,840;"He's able to be himself again."
01:06:28,840;01:06:34,000;"Remember when we got kicked out of the game and then he just went up and sat in the stands."
01:06:34,000;01:06:37,400;"And you got to Jack."
01:06:37,400;01:06:38,960;"He's when he was on the Raiders at the end."
01:06:38,960;01:06:39,680;"You got to Jack."
01:06:39,680;01:06:41,800;"All that street clothes."
01:06:41,800;01:06:44,360;"And he just went watch the rest of the game from with the fans."
01:06:44,360;01:06:45,920;"The guy is just."
01:06:45,920;01:06:55,160;"He's the end of like some players that like once they get famous, you get like annoyed with them because you're like, all right, they're like, self aware now and they're like playing into it."
01:06:55,920;01:06:59,040;"He just always struck me as the most authentic,"
01:06:59,040;01:07:02,800;"even though he is popular guy, you know?"
01:07:02,800;01:07:04,520;"- Kind of like Ricky Williams."
01:07:04,520;01:07:06,320;"- Yeah, Ricky was very similar."
01:07:06,320;01:07:07,160;"- Yep."
01:07:07,160;01:07:09,600;"- Like we're just too strange to be put on."
01:07:09,600;01:07:10,800;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:07:10,800;01:07:12,040;"Anybody else in that list?"
01:07:12,040;01:07:16,080;"I can't think of it."
01:07:16,080;01:07:17,400;"- Aaron Donald."
01:07:17,400;01:07:19,240;"(laughing)"
01:07:19,240;01:07:22,680;"- Steve, he's the biggest little player ever."
01:07:22,680;01:07:23,920;"The ball player."
01:07:25,120;01:07:27,120;"I stress the player."
01:07:27,120;01:07:33,120;"Steven Adams, the big center guy from New Zealand, the Kiwi."
01:07:33,120;01:07:35,120;"He's pretty awesome."
01:07:35,120;01:07:37,120;"Oh, I'm in the NBA."
01:07:37,120;01:07:38,120;"Yeah."
01:07:38,120;01:07:42,120;"He's probably just because he has a New Zealand accent though."
01:07:42,120;01:07:44,120;"Probably."
01:07:44,120;01:07:50,120;"Where would you fit Tom Brady on that scale?"
01:07:50,120;01:07:53,120;"He's pretty self-aware now, isn't he?"
01:07:53,120;01:07:53,960;"- That's true."
01:07:53,960;01:07:55,960;"- He saw him transition it, honestly."
01:07:55,960;01:07:56,800;"Back in the '90s."
01:07:56,800;01:07:57,640;"- Yeah."
01:07:57,640;01:07:59,200;"- And now you see the fame changes."
01:07:59,200;01:08:01,120;"- Steve's right, yeah."
01:08:01,120;01:08:06,120;"- But his social media accounts are still pretty like,"
01:08:06,120;01:08:13,480;"I think self aware of like not being too big."
01:08:13,480;01:08:16,120;"Like he's still got a good sense of humor about it, no?"
01:08:16,120;01:08:19,120;"- He's got a very carefully crafted public image."
01:08:19,120;01:08:20,120;"- That's probably true."
01:08:20,120;01:08:22,120;"- Yeah, I don't think the image is like,"
01:08:22,120;01:08:25,160;"I don't think the image is like bad or annoying,"
01:08:25,160;01:08:27,240;"or I think it's just, it's not,"
01:08:27,240;01:08:31,260;"I don't get the vibe that it's him being his true self"
01:08:31,260;01:08:32,100;"and not letting him--"
01:08:32,100;01:08:32,940;"- Not being marshalled lynched out there"
01:08:32,940;01:08:33,820;"and everyone thinking it's funny."
01:08:33,820;01:08:36,760;"He's got a bunch of people helping him be funny."
01:08:36,760;01:08:37,720;"- Maybe, maybe."
01:08:37,720;01:08:42,460;"I feel like less so now that he's on the box,"
01:08:42,460;01:08:43,740;"I feel like he kind of saw a bit more"
01:08:43,740;01:08:45,380;"of who he actually was."
01:08:45,380;01:08:46,220;"- I don't know."
01:08:46,220;01:08:48,180;"I don't think so."
01:08:48,180;01:08:49,940;"- What about the Manning brothers?"
01:08:49,940;01:08:51,540;"- Here's the thing, the bigger the--"
01:08:51,540;01:08:52,380;"Eli Manning."
01:08:52,380;01:08:54,100;"- Where authentic Tom Brady was."
01:08:54,100;01:08:57,460;"Once that butch in went away, it's sort of the authenticity."
01:08:57,460;01:09:00,820;"- What about Eli Manning talking shit to his brother on the--"
01:09:00,820;01:09:02,300;"- That feels authentic."
01:09:02,300;01:09:05,020;"- Again, he feels like an artist that doesn't know"
01:09:05,020;01:09:07,340;"how to do it, you know?"
01:09:07,340;01:09:09,460;"Like how to be like a savvy guy."
01:09:09,460;01:09:10,820;"So when he comes out of his mouth, you're like,"
01:09:10,820;01:09:11,780;"""Well, that's real."""
01:09:11,780;01:09:12,620;"- Yeah, well that's good."
01:09:12,620;01:09:15,780;"Oh, he's flipping the birds on national television."
01:09:15,780;01:09:17,620;"- Where Peyton very much is aware,"
01:09:17,620;01:09:19,220;"he has those social skills,"
01:09:19,220;01:09:24,220;"knows what plays and what doesn't. Very Tom Brady ask. Yeah. Yeah."
01:09:24,220;01:09:29,620;"But charming about it. Right. Yeah. That's fair. All right."
01:09:29,620;01:09:34,980;"All right. I gotta go to bed. Yes. Oh, you pull your thing. Yeah."
01:09:34,980;01:09:39,860;"You like to knock to you, Greg. Montezuma's revenge."
01:09:39,860;01:09:46,620;"The doctor called it Traveler's diarrhea. That's the medical term."
01:09:47,140;01:09:49,860;"You try sticking a finger up there, Steve, see what happens."
01:09:49,860;01:09:50,940;"No, have it."
01:09:50,940;01:09:52,300;"I'll go do that."
01:09:52,300;01:09:54,820;"Well, don't do it because you may never, uh,"
01:09:54,820;01:09:59,500;"even once you pop, you just can't stop as they say in a commercial."
01:09:59,500;01:10:01,940;"Prangles."
01:10:01,940;01:10:03,500;"That's terrible."
01:10:03,500;01:10:03,780;"Good."
01:10:03,780;01:10:04,340;"All right."
01:10:04,340;01:10:08,140;"Boy, speaking of poop next week."
01:10:08,140;01:10:13,940;"We are in the Cleveland to visit the three and eight Cleveland Browns."
01:10:15,740;01:10:18,740;"Who's that starting quarterback right coming off a huge game?"
01:10:18,740;01:10:19,060;"I don't know."
01:10:19,060;01:10:24,060;"A huge person Palmer that they lost for the Browns."
01:10:24,060;01:10:25,420;"Carson Palmer."
01:10:25,420;01:10:27,100;"No, bingles."
01:10:27,100;01:10:27,940;"Right."
01:10:27,940;01:10:31,300;"We play in the Browns of the Bengals, Browns, Cleveland, Brown's"
01:10:31,300;01:10:31,580;"us."
01:10:31,580;01:10:33,060;"That's a welcome talking to poop."
01:10:33,060;01:10:33,300;"Right."
01:10:33,300;01:10:33,500;"Yeah."
01:10:33,500;01:10:34,660;"So your boy, Kelly Holcomb,"
01:10:34,660;01:10:37,460;"in Cleveland."
01:10:37,460;01:10:41,500;"Pat's going for, I don't know, another win."
01:10:41,500;01:10:43,700;"They're 11th on the season."
01:10:43,700;01:10:44,980;"William Green."
01:10:45,020;01:10:46,380;"Just the guy we were talking about."
01:10:46,380;01:10:47,820;"He's only in green."
01:10:47,820;01:10:48,020;"Yeah."
01:10:48,020;01:10:48,780;"There you go."
01:10:48,780;01:10:49,940;"Boston call."
01:10:49,940;01:10:52,140;"So maybe this will be another barn burner."
01:10:52,140;01:10:55,260;"Or maybe only one team will score on the points."
01:10:55,260;01:10:57,020;"We shall find out next week."
01:10:57,020;01:11:02,380;"Who schmazoo, the Patriots, that is the podcast."
01:11:02,380;01:11:03,900;"See you later."
01:11:03,900;01:11:05,420;"See you later."
01:11:05,420;01:11:06,020;"Yeah."
01:11:06,020;01:11:06,660;"Blight up."

00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,640;"I am not your mother."
00:18,640;00:25,080;"Welcome back to the Pages Diescy Podcast."
00:25,080;00:31,720;"Well, the only podcast dedicated to rewatching every game of the pages down in Sierra."
00:31,720;00:33,680;"I'm your host, Andy Brown."
00:33,680;00:37,960;"With me tonight, as always, are my trusty brothers."
00:37,960;00:38,960;"Not trustworthy, but trusty."
00:38,960;00:41,720;"Especially that Greg Brown."
00:41,720;00:43,720;"What's the difference?"
00:43,720;00:47,520;"How did you say as always as if like Greg is here all the time?"
00:47,520;00:49,640;"I mean, has been lately."
00:49,640;00:50,640;"Yeah."
00:50,640;00:52,920;"This season, I don't think either of you have missed a game, right?"
00:52,920;00:54,080;"I'm not going to fact check that."
00:54,080;00:56,180;"I didn't do that anymore either."
00:56,180;00:58,600;"I didn't watch last week for the first time forever."
00:58,600;00:59,800;"I did watch this one though."
00:59,800;01:00,800;"Most of it."
01:00,800;01:02,360;"I did a bit of a quote."
01:02,360;01:05,240;"Yeah, but you've both been here for all of these, at least."
01:05,240;01:11,080;"Yes, I have PTSD from Greg would only show up once every five times."
01:11,080;01:13,360;"That was years ago."
01:13,360;01:16,520;"This whole lenient scheduling has been a godsend."
01:16,520;01:21,440;"Yeah, because we're only showing up now when all of us can actually do it."
01:21,440;01:23,160;"That's a good point."
01:23,160;01:24,240;"God for that baby."
01:24,240;01:27,680;"Kids really say my ass."
01:27,680;01:33,480;"Yeah, he's please put in a crimp on my style, but I don't have"
01:33,480;01:34,320;"much style to begin with."
01:34,320;01:34,980;"So it's all good."
01:34,980;01:36,840;"Speaking of babies, huh, Steve?"
01:36,840;01:38,440;"Way, way."
01:38,440;01:41,640;"And he's being a baby."
01:41,640;01:42,600;"Things can come on me."
01:42,600;01:44,600;"It's nice, great."
01:44,600;01:45,520;"It's stressful."
01:45,520;01:47,800;"God is speaking of babies."
01:47,800;01:52,320;"This week, we are talking about that Cleveland Browns."
01:52,920;01:57,680;"And their front office being big old babies, firing their head coach midway"
01:57,680;01:58,360;"through the season."
01:58,360;02:02,000;"And butch something other with the fuck was his name Cassidy."
02:02,000;02:05,520;"That's what I thought those lines."
02:05,520;02:11,280;"Yeah, but David's got fired mid week this week before the game."
02:11,280;02:17,400;"So Terry Ribisky is in his, um, he's getting his second shot at being an interim"
02:17,400;02:22,760;"head coach, which you don't often hear people getting more than one shot at"
02:22,760;02:23,760;"Yeah."
02:23,760;02:24,760;"And Terry."
02:24,760;02:25,760;"Terry."
02:25,760;02:29,240;"Yeah, it's passed on by the commentators."
02:29,240;02:32,120;"This will be a winning team in fairly short order."
02:32,120;02:35,480;"I don't think the exact same thing."
02:35,480;02:37,720;"Yeah, this will be a winning team in fairly short order."
02:37,720;02:39,400;"They're going to do this right."
02:39,400;02:41,880;"They're going to do this the right way."
02:41,880;02:44,160;"And this is 2004."
02:44,160;02:47,040;"So it'll happen soon, I'm sure."
02:47,040;02:51,520;"Well, what are their records?"
02:51,520;02:53,520;"into this game, they are three and eight."
02:53,520;02:55,520;"Oh, I meant out seasons here."
02:55,520;03:01,520;"The season they will finish four and 12 on this season in 2004."
03:01,520;03:05,520;"Six and 10, four and 12, 10 and six."
03:05,520;03:08,520;"Oh, four and 12, five and 11, five and 11,"
03:08,520;03:11,520;"four and 12, five and 11, four and 12, seven and nine,"
03:11,520;03:14,520;"three and 13, one and 15, oh and six."
03:14,520;03:17,520;"Oh, short order."
03:17,520;03:18,520;"Yeah, in there."
03:18,520;03:20,520;"So seven, 10 and six."
03:20,520;03:23,220;"Well, the Browns just want to play off game, right?"
03:23,220;03:24,420;"This last year."
03:24,420;03:26,320;"It's all a blur."
03:26,320;03:28,520;"I thought they lost a playoff game."
03:28,520;03:29,920;"I thought they won one."
03:29,920;03:31,020;"I should have like to the."
03:31,020;03:32,820;"To Pittsburgh, right?"
03:32,820;03:33,620;"We can't hold them."
03:33,620;03:38,320;"No, I mean, like this past year, they want to play off game."
03:38,320;03:40,220;"No, 2020."
03:40,220;03:41,720;"They lost them to visual rounds."
03:41,720;03:46,020;"So yeah, so there was a one there wild card game, I think, again, somebody."
03:47,320;03:52,720;"And that was their first win since Bill Belichick was their head coach."
03:52,720;03:54,840;"Back in the 90s."
03:54,840;03:56,880;"This is Terry's only shot at it."
03:56,880;03:59,080;"He gets replaced next year by who?"
03:59,080;04:00,440;"All right."
04:00,440;04:01,520;"Doesn't matter."
04:01,520;04:04,720;"He's asking me about Brown's coaches."
04:04,720;04:06,800;"He's a Patriots coach in this game."
04:06,800;04:09,600;"Oh, Romeo Cornell."
04:09,600;04:11,080;"Yeah."
04:11,080;04:12,320;"And he has a lot for a long either."
04:12,320;04:15,880;"The soft seasons when he leads for them and then Charlie Weiss goes another"
04:15,880;04:21,960;"game soon after the same season. I thought yeah. But they actually showed the stat at"
04:21,960;04:29,160;"the beginning of this that Cleveland led the series 12 games to seven. Yeah. But as it"
04:29,160;04:35,120;"stands now, they are currently tied at 13 to 13. No, because yes, the Browns have only"
04:35,120;04:36,400;"won one game."
04:36,400;04:41,200;"Peyton Hill is that is correct. Who is the head coach?"
04:41,200;04:43,300;"- Uh, man, genie."
04:43,300;04:44,140;"- Correct."
04:44,140;04:45,140;"- I think that."
04:45,140;04:46,140;"- Yeah."
04:46,140;04:48,240;"- I could barely remember that game."
04:48,240;04:49,080;"- Mm-hmm."
04:49,080;04:50,960;"And I believe that game,"
04:50,960;04:54,440;"the Patriots kick was injured."
04:54,440;04:57,120;"And so do you know who kicked the extra points?"
04:57,120;04:58,420;"- That was West Volker."
04:58,420;04:59,420;"- Correct."
04:59,420;05:00,580;"Nicely done."
05:00,580;05:01,720;"- 2010, I just looked out."
05:01,720;05:02,560;"- Remember that."
05:02,560;05:03,400;"- Mm-hmm."
05:03,400;05:05,920;"- It's on, it's on, patstinest.com."
05:05,920;05:07,080;"- That is correct."
05:07,080;05:08,280;"You can look at all this stuff."
05:08,280;05:14,760;"There's actually, um, I did a solo episode when you two weren't here about West Welkers."
05:14,760;05:18,120;"Uh, on the dolphins."
05:18,120;05:19,440;"I need their listen to that thing."
05:19,440;05:21,520;"I went way better than having you here."
05:21,520;05:22,160;"I'm not going to lie."
05:22,160;05:25,480;"It was also like, did you do or for everybody listening?"
05:25,480;05:28,680;"Uh, it was actually one of the more popular ones that we put out."
05:28,680;05:31,320;"So both was it on a game?"
05:31,320;05:32,320;"Yeah."
05:32,320;05:32,720;"Yeah."
05:32,720;05:38,240;"It was about, um, when the Patriots, it was 2003 when the Patriots played the dolphins."
05:38,240;05:44,240;"to set the streak of most wins in a row that they broke the Dolphin streak from."
05:44,240;05:51,180;"But the story of the game was Wes Welker was their full-time kicker because their kicker pulled a"
05:51,180;05:56,920;"Hammy in warm-ups. So yeah, when he was on the Dolphins. Yeah, yeah, so he was doing kick-offs."
05:56,920;06:02,320;"He was doing extra points and I don't think he could feel it. But yeah, so his first ever point"
06:02,320;06:05,200;"scored in the NFL was an extra point in that game."
06:05,200;06:10,160;"So how, so how did this you're, you're doing it yourself and yeah,"
06:10,160;06:11,200;"talking into your guess."
06:11,200;06:12,000;"How was that?"
06:12,000;06:13,560;"I never really asked a bunch of questions."
06:13,560;06:14,560;"How long is it?"
06:14,560;06:16,760;"Uh, it's a lot shorter than these ones that we do."
06:16,760;06:18,160;"Cause I don't have to put up a you fucker."
06:18,160;06:22,960;"Well, like I can see you just drone and on for like 45 minutes and saying that's a"
06:22,960;06:23,560;"lot shorter."
06:23,560;06:26,680;"I mean, yeah, it went, it went for a, it was over half an hour."
06:26,680;06:30,600;"It was like 35, 40 minutes after I took out all the silence."
06:30,600;06:34,960;"It's a sociopath shit right there."
06:34,960;06:36,160;"God damn right."
06:36,160;06:43,960;"Andy just like in a fucking in a basement just talking to his self about a 2004 Patriots"
06:43,960;06:44,960;"game."
06:44,960;06:45,960;"Hey, I did it in my bedroom."
06:45,960;06:46,960;"Thank you."
06:46,960;06:47,960;"That's dolphins."
06:47,960;06:48,960;"Let's welcome kick the next point."
06:48,960;06:51,400;"Fucking great crazy dude."
06:51,400;06:52,400;"Crazy."
06:52,400;06:54,880;"You're not case."
06:54,880;06:55,880;"You're welcome."
06:55,880;07:01,680;"All right, so a little bit more about this Cleveland Browns football team."
07:01,680;07:03,880;"I will do the talking about it."
07:03,880;07:07,480;"Because I can't I got notes."
07:07,480;07:13,200;"All right, so Steve, do you think Gregory watch the game?"
07:13,200;07:14,960;"Absolutely not."
07:14,960;07:18,040;"Do you think you watch the highlights?"
07:18,040;07:20,000;"Probably."
07:20,000;07:22,080;"All right, Greg, let's hear your notes."
07:22,080;07:24,880;"I watched the highlights."
07:24,880;07:25,760;"OK."
07:25,760;07:28,800;"I looked at Luke McCown."
07:28,800;07:32,360;"I just diggin' about him."
07:32,360;07:35,160;"- This is the first ever NFL start in this game."
07:35,160;07:38,240;"- The lesser of the McCown brothers,"
07:38,240;07:39,540;"if you can believe that."
07:39,540;07:44,240;"- Every time I hear McCown, I just think of apples."
07:44,240;07:46,360;"- And he still played till 34 years old."
07:46,360;07:49,720;"- Goodness dude, he played 13 seasons in the NFL."
07:49,720;07:53,520;"He only started 10 games in his whole career."
07:55,040;07:56,640;"Oh, he's one of those."
07:56,640;07:57,640;"Okay."
07:57,640;08:03,040;"He played for the 13 seasons and threw nine total touchdowns."
08:03,040;08:05,240;"All nine of them were in this first two years."
08:05,240;08:06,240;"Holy shit."
08:06,240;08:08,840;"Oh, boy."
08:08,840;08:12,840;"And he made $17 million over his career."
08:12,840;08:15,840;"So what more than $1 million touchdown?"
08:15,840;08:17,640;"Yeah, that ain't bad."
08:17,640;08:19,640;"This guy's living the fucking dream."
08:19,640;08:23,040;"How much per like pass attempt is he making?"
08:23,040;08:23,840;"It's a good question."
08:23,840;08:24,840;"I'm sure we can figure it out."
08:24,840;08:27,840;"more than your yearly sounds of thousands of dollars for sure."
08:27,840;08:29,840;"156 passing attempts."
08:29,840;08:31,840;"He said 17 million."
08:31,840;08:33,840;"Do the math Steve."
08:33,840;08:35,840;"No, I got a calculator for that."
08:35,840;08:37,840;"Yeah, well, that's what I meant."
08:37,840;08:38,840;"That's Siri."
08:38,840;08:39,840;"What?"
08:39,840;08:41,840;"I'm called 365."
08:41,840;08:44,840;"46 K each."
08:44,840;08:47,840;"Oh, how's that?"
08:47,840;08:49,840;"That's not bad."
08:49,840;08:52,840;"I mean, in this game, how many attempts did he have?"
08:52,840;08:55,840;"too many and also not enough."
08:55,840;08:57,840;"We'll just get this out of it."
08:57,840;08:59,840;"So the Browns team coming in."
08:59,840;09:01,840;"You're not a money this game."
09:01,840;09:05,840;"The Browns coming in this game."
09:05,840;09:07,840;"You know, you don't have dollars this game."
09:07,840;09:09,840;"Damn, that's not too bad."
09:09,840;09:11,840;"I love that."
09:11,840;09:13,840;"I mean, this game, he probably earned it."
09:13,840;09:18,840;"Your first game ever going against the 2004 New England page"
09:18,840;09:23,560;"defense with an interim head coach is a tough ask."
09:23,560;09:24,880;"He did okay."
09:24,880;09:26,360;"He hung in there."
09:26,360;09:28,080;"He actually had better numbers and Brady at the half."
09:28,080;09:29,760;"Brady did not play very well."
09:29,760;09:33,920;"He was also losing 21 seven at the half."
09:33,920;09:37,320;"But it felt closer than that."
09:37,320;09:38,880;"I disagree."
09:38,880;09:42,240;"I thought the game sort of turned on that scoop and score to make it 28."
09:42,240;09:45,440;"So the first play."
09:45,440;09:48,800;"So, yeah, so here let's let's let's just run it down as real quick."
09:48,800;09:55,440;"quick. So before we get to that, the, I think we talked about it last week because the highlights"
09:55,440;10:01,640;"were part of the, the game that we watched the video, where it was that shootout was the"
10:01,640;10:06,240;"second highest scoring game ever in NFL history. All right. Between these Cleveland Browns,"
10:06,240;10:11,960;"and this is Eddie Bengals, and the Browns scored 48 points and got out scored by two scores."
10:11,960;10:17,680;"Lost 58 48. I watched the 15 minutes extended highlights of that game"
10:17,680;10:23,380;"The brows did not look like they're a team that scored 48 points. They were was it was it?"
10:23,380;10:30,520;"It wasn't a count. All right. It was welcome. Right. Yeah. Yeah, it wasn't my count ended up in there like at the end of it"
10:30,520;10:32,120;"Or someone"
10:32,120;10:35,260;"They had somebody else in at the end. I can't remember who was this first"
10:36,040;10:41,960;"first touchdown. Yeah, he was a fourth round pick. They're saying he was like, as high as a number two"
10:41,960;10:47,560;"quarterback in the country coming out of high school. Sure. Was McCown? Yeah, Luke McCown."
10:47,560;10:53,880;"Jesus. He played a lot. He had like a bunch of NCAA like top five records for yards and yeah,"
10:53,880;11:00,040;"he didn't want to he got recruited by Oklahoma and Florida State, but he ended up at Louisiana Tech,"
11:01,800;11:05,240;"Which like it's not even that local firm. He's from Texas. So"
11:05,240;11:09,880;"Maybe maybe it's"
11:09,880;11:17,480;"Another big god's water so that might add something to it. Yeah, like Texas isn't our Oklahoma isn't"
11:17,480;11:20,760;"But great you you touched on something here"
11:20,760;11:25,640;"Schools about the brown quarterback situation this year"
11:25,640;11:28,440;"Yeah, I started a bunch of guys, right?"
11:29,000;11:30,040;"They started three players."
11:30,040;11:31,520;"Jeff Garcia started the most game."
11:31,520;11:33,440;"So 10 games went three and seven."
11:33,440;11:35,680;"Notable gay athlete, one of the best ever."
11:35,680;11:36,800;"Really?"
11:36,800;11:39,400;"Chris, no, remember?"
11:39,400;11:40,240;"Terrell Owens."
11:40,240;11:45,680;"No, like started a rumor that Jeff Garcia was gay, even though he wasn't."
11:45,680;11:47,160;"Just because of Jeff Garcia."
11:47,160;11:48,160;"Yeah."
11:48,160;11:49,320;"Oh, man."
11:49,320;11:51,480;"Was this when he was on the 49ers or after?"
11:51,480;11:54,080;"I think it was like as he was pushing his way out the door."
11:54,080;11:56,560;"What a way to get your way out the door."
11:56,560;11:57,560;"I don't do it."
11:57,560;11:59,440;"And Jeff Garcia was like, what the fuck?"
11:59,440;12:01,560;"Hey, Jeff Garcia."
12:01,560;12:02,560;"Yeah."
12:02,560;12:03,560;"Oh, man."
12:03,560;12:04,560;"Yeah."
12:04,560;12:05,560;"So he was the main starter."
12:05,560;12:10,360;"I don't know if he's battling injuries or what, but he also only threw 10 touchdowns"
12:10,360;12:13,680;"and nine interceptions in 10 games."
12:13,680;12:17,640;"And then Luke McCown was their second leading quarterback, started four game including"
12:17,640;12:21,760;"this one went 0 and four, four touchdowns, seven interceptions."
12:21,760;12:26,000;"And then Kelly Holcomb is the wild card."
12:26,000;12:28,720;"He started two games, went one in one."
12:28,720;12:30,680;"One of those games was the game against the Bengals way"
12:30,680;12:33,360;"through from 413 yards, five touchdowns and two picks."
12:33,360;12:39,000;"And he ended the season with seven touchdowns"
12:39,000;12:41,160;"and five interceptions."
12:41,160;12:43,240;"So that's like a game that goes with great."
12:43,240;12:44,920;"- Two, two, three interceptions, not?"
12:44,920;12:46,040;"- Yeah."
12:46,040;12:50,400;"So not a great look when you're starting three quarterbacks"
12:50,400;12:52,240;"who all have similar numbers."
12:55,200;12:56,960;"This is just a bad team."
12:56,960;12:59,360;"And the-"
12:59,360;13:00,760;"- What do you know on their defense?"
13:00,760;13:03,880;"The whole roster except for Ebenezer, Ekubon?"
13:03,880;13:04,720;"- Yeah."
13:04,720;13:06,360;"- He barely played, he wouldn't even start her"
13:06,360;13:07,200;"at this point."
13:07,200;13:08,040;"- I recognize Robert Griffith,"
13:08,040;13:09,320;"but I always picture him as a Viking."
13:09,320;13:10,880;"I didn't know he played on the Browns."
13:10,880;13:11,800;"- Oh yeah, okay."
13:11,800;13:12,640;"- The third?"
13:12,640;13:14,320;"- No."
13:14,320;13:15,160;"- The first."
13:15,160;13:16,400;"- Oh God."
13:16,400;13:21,040;"- But their leading rusher was somebody named Lee Suggs."
13:21,040;13:22,160;"- Sorry to interrupt."
13:22,160;13:26,480;"Can I, I looked up the statements from Torelloans."
13:26,480;13:27,720;"- Oh, okay."
13:27,720;13:28,640;"- It's bad."
13:28,640;13:32,800;"First of all, it's in an interview with Playboy."
13:32,800;13:35,600;"- Oh, of course it is."
13:35,600;13:38,720;"- And he said, like my boy tells me"
13:38,720;13:42,440;"if it looks like a rat and smells like a rat by golly,"
13:42,440;13:47,480;"it's a rat when discussing his sexuality,"
13:47,480;13:48,640;"- Oh boy."
13:48,640;13:50,400;"- Yikes, dude."
13:50,400;13:51,240;"- Yum!"
13:51,240;13:52,560;"- That's rad."
13:52,560;13:54,060;"- It could be taken out of context,"
13:54,060;13:55,720;"but so I would like to see the whole."
13:55,720;13:57,040;"- Also, like, isn't this supposed to be a duck?"
13:57,040;13:58,400;"- It's disgusting sexuality."
13:58,400;13:59,840;"- If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck,"
13:59,840;14:01,280;"like why are you going with rat, man?"
14:01,280;14:03,200;"- Yeah, rat, I don't even think this."
14:03,200;14:05,400;"- And do like rats have a distinct smell?"
14:05,400;14:09,480;"I couldn't tell you what a rat smells like a duck."
14:09,480;14:10,920;"- And it's not even smell, right?"
14:10,920;14:12,960;"If it looks like a duck, if it quacks like a duck."
14:12,960;14:13,800;"- It's a duck, yeah."
14:13,800;14:15,120;"- It's a duck."
14:15,120;14:17,320;"- Yeah, that's a weird one there."
14:17,320;14:18,320;"- Yeah."
14:18,320;14:19,160;"- All right."
14:19,160;14:22,680;"when you did that in today's day and age. Oh my God. When I'm"
14:22,680;14:26,780;"Playboy and touted as straight guy as a back. Yeah. And"
14:26,780;14:28,040;"comparing it to a rat."
14:28,040;14:31,920;"I would have a meltdown."
14:31,920;14:34,520;"It's ridiculous."
14:34,520;14:36,880;"Apparently Garcia has just taken the IRA the whole time."
14:36,880;14:38,340;"No. Good for him."
14:38,340;14:40,120;"I mean, you kind of have"
14:40,120;14:42,800;"a little bit of trouble recently. Did you hear you got"
14:42,800;14:43,320;"in trouble?"
14:43,320;14:46,000;"You have got to see you? Yeah. For what?"
14:46,440;14:50,600;"He got he got mad at a mean of kinds."
14:50,600;14:52,040;"Yes, be in."
14:52,040;14:53,240;"Oh, yeah."
14:53,240;14:55,320;"And he like made that argument of like,"
14:55,320;14:57,000;"yeah, I forget who she was criticizing,"
14:57,000;14:59,400;"but he was like, if you've never played the sport."
14:59,400;15:00,600;"Oh, that was him."
15:00,600;15:01,880;"Yeah. Yeah."
15:01,880;15:02,920;"Yeah."
15:02,920;15:06,440;"And then everybody just came for came for a stroke."
15:06,440;15:07,960;"Yeah, they piled on you."
15:07,960;15:09,000;"Yeah."
15:09,000;15:11,000;"He's like, I'm getting canceled for this shit."
15:11,000;15:12,760;"T.O. Call me Game Play Boy."
15:12,760;15:16,200;"[LAUGHTER]"
15:16,200;15:17,460;"- Oh, it's too true."
15:17,460;15:19,560;"- I'm buried, I got kids, this is bullshit."
15:19,560;15:21,980;"(laughing)"
15:21,980;15:24,240;"- Hey, what do I tell you, Jeff, it looks like a rat."
15:24,240;15:25,320;"- Sounds like a rat."
15:25,320;15:28,160;"(laughing)"
15:28,160;15:29,920;"- Jeff, you know what a rat smells like?"
15:29,920;15:30,920;"(laughing)"
15:30,920;15:32,240;"- Oh man."
15:32,240;15:34,560;"- Yeah, so the only name I did recognize in this team"
15:34,560;15:35,880;"was William Green."
15:35,880;15:37,880;"They're running back, 'cause he played a B-S legend."
15:37,880;15:38,720;"- Exactly, yeah."
15:38,720;15:40,840;"- Mike, we talked about him last week."
15:40,840;15:42,880;"- Oh, that's right, we did."
15:42,880;15:44,000;"- He was a bust."
15:44,000;15:45,480;"He was the first round pick."
15:45,480;15:46,560;"Was he really?"
15:46,560;15:48,080;"- Yep, 16th overall."
15:48,080;15:49,520;"- Ooh, I think he..."
15:49,520;15:50,440;"- I mean, he might've been good."
15:50,440;15:52,080;"He was just stuck on the Browns."
15:52,080;15:56,800;"- Well, I mean, that's a pretty crazy stats in college."
15:56,800;15:58,400;"- Yeah, he was..."
15:58,400;16:00,640;"- Like the only BC name I remember."
16:00,640;16:01,920;"- Yeah, no he grew up."
16:01,920;16:06,520;"- In 10 games, he had almost 1600 yards"
16:06,520;16:08,640;"and 15 touchdowns."
16:08,640;16:09,960;"- That's not bad."
16:09,960;16:11,280;"- Pretty decent."
16:11,280;16:14,280;"- 10th average, 2.7 yards per carry."
16:14,280;16:16,280;"17 carries 46 yards."
16:16,280;16:19,280;"- As opposed to Court Dillon who rushed for 100 yards"
16:19,280;16:21,040;"in the first half."
16:21,040;16:22,040;"- No, excuse me,"
16:22,040;16:24,240;"you ran for 98 yards in the first half."
16:24,240;16:27,400;"And then you didn't see him at all in the third quarter."
16:27,400;16:30,120;"They had somebody named,"
16:30,120;16:31,960;"- Whoa."
16:31,960;16:34,400;"- Cedric Cobbs."
16:34,400;16:35,280;"- Yeah, who the fuck was that?"
16:35,280;16:36,440;"- I remember that."
16:36,440;16:37,480;"That name jumped out to me."
16:37,480;16:38,800;"- I had no idea what he said."
16:38,800;16:40,480;"- Yeah, I don't remember."
16:40,480;16:43,680;"- I don't remember Cedric Cobbs."
16:43,680;16:44,520;"- Yeah."
16:44,520;16:49,080;"- So back to William Green real quick."
16:49,080;16:49,920;"- Okay."
16:49,920;16:56,080;"- So this is last season during his 2003 season"
16:56,080;17:00,040;"was fraught with turmoil."
17:00,040;17:02,240;"After a good start to the year,"
17:02,240;17:05,800;"he was arrested for drunk driving in marijuana possession"
17:05,800;17:07,720;"and notoriously seen wearing one shoe"
17:07,720;17:10,400;"and one sock during the arrest."
17:10,400;17:12,920;"Then he got a four-gain suspension for that"
17:12,920;17:15,780;"While under suspension, Green's fiance, Asia Gray,"
17:15,780;17:19,500;"stabbed them in the back during a domestic disfuse."
17:19,500;17:21,300;"The league extended his suspension"
17:21,300;17:24,920;"through the end of the season for treatment purposes."
17:24,920;17:26,480;"(laughs)"
17:26,480;17:28,340;"- Yeah, it's a nice."
17:28,340;17:30,140;"- So he's coming off that year."
17:30,140;17:32,620;"- All right."
17:32,620;17:34,380;"So you can see how it would take him a little while"
17:34,380;17:35,580;"to like get ramped back up."
17:35,580;17:38,540;"You know, they're only 13 games into the season."
17:38,540;17:40,100;"It's no big deal."
17:40,100;17:42,700;"- He ran a 48, 540 yard dash."
17:42,700;17:44,900;"That guy's not making the NFL on today's league."
17:44,900;17:47,500;"No, he's a first round pick."
17:47,500;17:50,060;"Well, he wouldn't be a first round pick in today's league, that's for sure."
17:50,060;17:51,260;"No, no, no, no, no, for eight."
17:51,260;17:54,980;"Pat's had 50 carries in this game for one half yards a carry."
17:54,980;17:55,980;"Oh, yeah."
17:55,980;18:00,460;"This was this was the epitome of like a pass beating up on a bad team."
18:00,460;18:06,380;"Like they didn't look like they even had to break a sweat because this game literally"
18:06,380;18:06,940;"started."
18:06,940;18:09,140;"I'm telling you, I played pretty good at the beginning."
18:09,140;18:09,980;"It was over."
18:09,980;18:11,260;"No, it was over 30 seconds in."
18:11,740;18:14,380;"The Patriots, Bethel Johns will return the opening kickoff for touchdown."
18:14,380;18:15,820;"And the game is over."
18:15,820;18:16,480;"Like that was it."
18:16,480;18:19,100;"For the first half, they played them to a 14 seven."
18:19,100;18:21,420;"Brady, 21 seven."
18:21,420;18:26,980;"Well, take up the kicker turn touchdown after that one play is 14 7 1/2."
18:26,980;18:33,140;"Yeah, except like, you can say that, but yeah, it was a 90, what?"
18:33,140;18:35,080;"395 yard kickoff return."
18:35,080;18:38,460;"And then their next, um,"
18:39,020;18:46,820;"Major's next scoring drive was a 96 yard scoring drive where they just like ran it at will and then they did it again and started like a"
18:46,820;18:49,540;"78 yard scoring drive"
18:49,540;18:55,980;"And it's just like they were just doing kind of what they wanted and then there was a few like"
18:55,980;19:00,820;"Random mistakes like Corey Dylan had a fumble. Yep. I wanted to drive"
19:00,820;19:07,780;"I should throw a couple of interceptions in there. Yeah, but it was just like what I mean the intersection was just like"
19:07,780;19:09,700;"like, you know, garbage time. Yeah."
19:09,700;19:12,460;"Trying to get in a field go range and whatever."
19:12,460;19:16,580;"Didn't really matter. But they went four on fourth and down with a Patrick"
19:16,580;19:18,540;"past fucking run."
19:18,540;19:23,740;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. And they didn't run it with Corey Dillon randomly."
19:23,740;19:26,260;"They're from the 30. And I think Corey Dillon's hurt in this game because."
19:26,260;19:28,220;"That's what he said."
19:28,220;19:30,820;"That last carry. He doesn't come back for the whole press."
19:30,820;19:31,620;"The thing."
19:31,620;19:33,060;"That's what I'm saying. He didn't come back for a second."
19:33,060;19:37,540;"Well, he came back to get his two yards because he finished a half at 98."
19:37,540;19:43,100;"And so we had like one run to start the fourth quarter to make sure he got his 100 yard game and then he they pulled him"
19:43,100;19:48,100;"Probably a bonus for that exactly. Yeah, so you probably"
19:48,100;19:51,520;"Lobby and Bill Belichick to get back in there just we can get the you've only Kevin"
19:51,520;19:55,820;"87 yards pretty close to 100 Kevin Falk has some good runs in this game"
19:55,820;19:59,380;"Central Cobb not so much"
19:59,380;20:05,100;"29 on 16 carries though. That's what I'm saying. He looks like a poor man's Corey Dylan"
20:05,380;20:12,220;"Yeah, he was not not very good. Yeah, but this is you know, this is a great three phases game for your Greg"
20:12,220;20:15,860;"You're a big fan of that. Oh, yeah"
20:15,860;20:21,980;"They had to kick off return start the game for touchdown Corey Dylan had a couple of touchdown runs fall kind of touchdown run"
20:21,980;20:27,780;"Brady had a beautiful deep shot to Patton on third and 22 for 44. Yeah touchdown"
20:27,780;20:32,040;"That was this they ran at the play before he missed it ready missing. Yeah"
20:33,580;20:35,500;"- Yeah, fuck it, do it again."
20:35,500;20:38,060;"And that was definitely just that."
20:38,060;20:40,980;"As soon as that happened, I stopped keeping track"
20:40,980;20:41,980;"of drives and stuff."
20:41,980;20:42,820;"I just wrote garbage time"
20:42,820;20:44,900;"'cause that was literally the beginning of garbage time."
20:44,900;20:45,740;"- Yeah."
20:45,740;20:49,260;"- And then the pages also started the second half"
20:49,260;20:54,260;"with William Green fumbling and Randall Gay returning"
20:54,260;20:57,020;"for touchdown to start the blowout."
20:57,020;21:00,820;"'Cause you can see the play by McGinnis on that play."
21:00,820;21:01,820;"- Yeah."
21:01,820;21:02,660;"- That's sweet."
21:02,660;21:04,440;"or shitting on McGinnis for like holding the hat."
21:04,440;21:06,700;"- Commentators were all over it."
21:06,700;21:07,540;"- Really?"
21:07,540;21:08,380;"- Like Randy Brawers."
21:08,380;21:09,220;"- Not a guy coming."
21:09,220;21:10,380;"- He'd pick him off so he's like,"
21:10,380;21:12,620;"no, let me get in front of you so I can block that guy."
21:12,620;21:13,460;"- Correct."
21:13,460;21:14,300;"- And Randy Brawers."
21:14,300;21:15,220;"- Oh, great, explain what happens."
21:15,220;21:17,500;"- Yeah, so who,"
21:17,500;21:20,140;"Randall Gay picks up the fumble and like McGinnis"
21:20,140;21:21,740;"is like two yards behind him."
21:21,740;21:24,700;"And he grabs Randall Gay by the jersey"
21:24,700;21:28,100;"and kind of like yanks in back behind Willie"
21:28,100;21:30,700;"so he can get in front and leave block."
21:30,700;21:31,540;"And he does a good job."
21:31,540;21:33,220;"blocks them and a rental gay then score."
21:33,220;21:35,700;"So it's kind of like, it looked weird, but I think"
21:35,700;21:38,740;"yeah, but the car, the commentators were basically ripping"
21:38,740;21:41,060;"on McInnes saying, you know, if he hadn't done that,"
21:41,060;21:43,780;"Randall Gay would have been able to just like outrun everybody"
21:43,780;21:47,100;"anyway. And it would have been a whole lot. It's a 30 yard"
21:47,100;21:49,540;"return instead of a 50 yard return. Because K has to cut it"
21:49,540;21:52,340;"back all the way across the field. Like, okay, looky, it"
21:52,340;21:55,340;"would be a 50 yards instead of there. He's like, that was his"
21:55,340;21:58,620;"way of hazing. Like, I don't think I don't think you"
21:58,620;22:02,540;"who hates in the middle of a football game, but yeah. That's"
22:02,540;22:06,540;"dumb take. Oh, very dumb. This was also the same commentated"
22:06,540;22:09,300;"said if a patron Swiss army knife, you know how many attachments"
22:09,300;22:14,620;"they'd have? Mm. Twitch. You know, like I said, a lot. So"
22:14,620;22:18,100;"riveting stuff from these guys also said here's Don Davis at safety."
22:18,100;22:23,260;"And they're talking about the Patriots. Yeah. No, no, that"
22:23,260;22:24,260;"That was legit."
22:24,260;22:25,260;"I know."
22:25,260;22:30,700;"The amount of no name defensive backs on this 2014 is ridiculous."
22:30,700;22:35,900;"Oh, well, that's because Don Davis is a linebacker, but the Patriots came and this is something"
22:35,900;22:38,540;"I want to touch on too is the versatility that Don Davis is like, I didn't even know"
22:38,540;22:40,180;"Don Davis is right."
22:40,180;22:42,900;"And he's not a small linebacker."
22:42,900;22:48,180;"He was a big dude because they were all big linebackers back then, but they decided he's"
22:48,180;22:54,700;"He's number 51 and he's starting at deep safety because the Patriots decided, you know, Luke"
22:54,700;23:01,940;"McCown starting his first game with the interim coach, all the turmoil happening and the Browns"
23:01,940;23:03,340;"can't throw it deep over the middle."
23:03,340;23:06,260;"So like, you know what, we're going to put a linebacker back there because then he can"
23:06,260;23:14,140;"stop up to stop the run game because we have literally zero fear of this Brown team throwing"
23:14,140;23:17,100;"it deep down the middle and it worked perfectly."
23:17,100;23:23,480;"Counterpoint his then it's not fun was Dexter Reed and he says wow these guys both fucking suck who cares"
23:23,480;23:29,700;"Dexter Reed well Dexter Reed had a four-sumble in this game. He did a house against trip. Yeah, yeah"
23:29,700;23:33,460;"Earth and more limbs out there. Oh, yeah, Troy Brown"
23:33,460;23:39,660;"Making plays yeah, right Brown plays a lot out there. Yeah, Troy Brown. I think probably played more"
23:39,660;23:42,260;"defensive back in this game an interception, right?"
23:43,180;23:49,340;"Not in this game not in this game. No, he did have he did have a big big time play though"
23:49,340;23:53,580;"How's gonna be sure? I'm pretty sure he has an interception in this game"
23:53,580;23:57,860;"Troy Brown. Did you guys miss that one? Yes? Yeah, you're right"
23:57,860;24:01,580;"Did he really look at this?"
24:01,580;24:04,540;"Well, well"
24:04,540;24:07,780;"Yeah, I didn't watch the fourth quarter"
24:07,780;24:13,020;"Yeah, fourth quarter now I have to go back and watch and I gotta see the Troy Brown and a fun little recovery"
24:13,020;24:20,540;"That was on the pun. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. No, even I turned this game off. It was such a blow up."
24:20,540;24:24,680;"So we have to go back and watch that and make sure we get that because Troy Brown"
24:24,680;24:31,320;"interceptions are a big fucking old Uncle Greg. Oh, you don't watch the game, Greg."
24:31,320;24:38,620;"You didn't watch the game, Greg. You never watched the game, Greg. But he also made the tackle on"
24:38,620;24:43,620;"on the fourth down play. That was inside the red zone."
24:43,620;24:44,980;"Yeah, the second quarter."
24:44,980;24:46,540;"This is a classic Troy Brown game."
24:46,540;24:47,660;"He crushes it."
24:47,660;24:49,380;"Yeah, and he had some parrotarians,"
24:49,380;24:51,500;"you know, a couple of catches."
24:51,500;24:55,060;"No big deal, just Troy Brown being Troy Brown."
24:55,060;24:59,540;"And yeah, and there was a punt that it bounced short"
24:59,540;25:01,340;"and hit Randall Gay in the back of legs"
25:01,340;25:02,540;"that he recovered as well."
25:02,540;25:04,460;"Nice heads up play."
25:04,460;25:05,940;"You know, typical Troy Brown shit."
25:05,940;25:10,940;"That's why he's, uh, I wear the Troy Brown tank club on this, this podcast."
25:10,940;25:15,340;"It's like lightly where the Troy Brown stands."
25:15,340;25:17,820;"Troy Brown stands."
25:17,820;25:18,500;"I don't know."
25:18,500;25:21,740;"Isn't that like a thing to call someone to stand up when they're very"
25:21,740;25:22,620;"uh huh."
25:22,620;25:23,900;"Yep."
25:23,900;25:25,540;"The K-pop thing, right?"
25:25,540;25:28,140;"Uh, I don't know."
25:28,140;25:30,940;"I don't know either."
25:30,940;25:34,300;"It seems like it would be a K-pop sort of thing."
25:34,860;25:36,860;"Have you seen K-pop?"
25:36,860;25:39,860;"- Not really, more than like five seconds."
25:39,860;25:40,700;"- It's crazy."
25:40,700;25:43,700;"- How much K-pop have you watched?"
25:43,700;25:47,500;"- I watched like a performance that came across one"
25:47,500;25:49,940;"of that really popular group."
25:49,940;25:51,300;"- How BTS?"
25:51,300;25:52,300;"- BTS, yep."
25:52,300;25:53,300;"- No, I've heard of it."
25:53,300;25:54,700;"- There's like 12 of them."
25:54,700;25:59,700;"They're a huge group and they all sound like"
25:59,700;26:02,300;"they're like prepubescent boys."
26:02,300;26:04,540;"- Are they prepubescent boys?"
26:04,540;26:06,100;"Are they actually singing?"
26:06,100;26:07,180;"- It's hard to tell, because you know,"
26:07,180;26:09,820;"Asian people always look younger, not to generalize,"
26:09,820;26:10,980;"but yeah."
26:10,980;26:12,060;"- Yeah, they age well."
26:12,060;26:13,300;"- But they're incredible singers."
26:13,300;26:15,620;"Their voice is, and they're like great performers."
26:15,620;26:17,900;"It's not really my type of music, but like, I'm like,"
26:17,900;26:20,660;"okay, I could see why people like this,"
26:20,660;26:24,780;"but it's, it's like, it's out there."
26:24,780;26:27,020;"- I would think it's similar to like,"
26:27,020;26:30,420;"original in sync in, yeah, 98 degrees."
26:30,420;26:32,860;"- No, way more skilled, way more talented than that."
26:32,860;26:36,860;"It's what I would put it on par with like a glee performance, right?"
26:36,860;26:42,060;"Like those high school musical where it's like, yeah, they're really good singers and they're good performers."
26:42,060;26:46,860;"But it's very campy and very like, I don't know, it's like very scripted, very."
26:46,860;26:47,860;"Yeah. Yeah."
26:47,860;26:49,260;"You carry for me."
26:49,260;26:50,060;"Way too cheery."
26:50,060;26:50,860;"That's what it is."
26:50,860;26:52,460;"Yeah, they're all like smiling."
26:52,460;26:53,660;"Like in a good mood."
26:53,660;26:55,460;"It's like, you're way too much fun right now."
26:55,460;26:56,660;"I'm not about that."
26:56,660;26:57,660;"There is a."
27:00,660;27:06,540;"artist band, I'm not sure, called Baby Metal, which is kind of K-pop and heavy metal,"
27:06,540;27:07,260;"but together, yeah."
27:07,260;27:08,260;"Yeah."
27:08,260;27:09,660;"Interesting."
27:09,660;27:13,340;"So the internet was upset that Rob Zombie posted a picture with them."
27:13,340;27:14,380;"Really?"
27:14,380;27:17,020;"A lot of people were saying they're not metal."
27:17,020;27:20,340;"Rob Zombie, local guy, Kerpen Haverill."
27:20,340;27:22,140;"Really?"
27:22,140;27:24,060;"God, Mac was local."
27:24,060;27:24,700;"Yep."
27:24,700;27:25,900;"Uh, yeah."
27:25,940;27:31,180;"Now they, uh, him and his brother who is the lead singer of lead vocalist, I should say,"
27:31,180;27:33,460;"a singer is the strong word of power man 5000."
27:33,460;27:34,620;"That's right."
27:34,620;27:36,380;"I thought it was called the Haverhill."
27:36,380;27:38,860;"Shut up, Steve."
27:38,860;27:42,380;"Hey, bro."
27:42,380;27:46,740;"Twx, Barry."
27:46,740;27:49,620;"It's always the best game."
27:49,620;27:50,460;"What's that?"
27:50,460;27:52,220;"Yeah."
27:53,540;27:54,620;"- Gloucester."
27:54,620;27:56,820;"- Yes, so these commentators, I don't know,"
27:56,820;27:59,540;"who was this the Randy Cross and somebody else?"
27:59,540;28:00,900;"Don Krikke maybe?"
28:00,900;28:01,740;"I don't know."
28:01,740;28:04,660;"I would call this the B team."
28:04,660;28:06,100;"- Kevin Harlan."
28:06,100;28:07,660;"- Kevin Harlan. - No, I don't know."
28:07,660;28:13,100;"- But they were amazed at the versatility of the Patriots."
28:13,100;28:16,740;"Troy Brown playing defensive back."
28:16,740;28:18,740;"They literally called it out every time he was out there,"
28:18,740;28:20,700;"which is good on them."
28:20,700;28:22,420;"- The Don Davis playing free safety"
28:22,420;28:26,220;"and also you lined up a defensive end at 1.2 as a linebacker."
28:26,220;28:27,940;"So you just didn't play linebacker."
28:27,940;28:33,060;"There was one play where both Richard Seymour"
28:33,060;28:35,660;"and Mike Raibel reported as eligible"
28:35,660;28:40,580;"on one of the Corey Dillon touchdowns."
28:40,580;28:43,340;"And then Christian Fourier knocked down the Hail Mary"
28:43,340;28:45,140;"at the end of the first half"
28:45,140;28:47,980;"and they were ecstatic about this."
28:47,980;28:49,340;"- There, that's good point."
28:49,340;28:53,340;"That's a lot of players playing cross positions."
28:53,340;28:54,180;"- Oh yeah."
28:54,180;28:58,100;"- And you see very often this, especially this day and age,"
28:58,100;28:58,940;"you know?"
28:58,940;29:00,460;"- Well, when's the last time you've seen somebody play"
29:00,460;29:02,060;"both sides of the ball?"
29:02,060;29:04,060;"- Seymour was plowing people and I go online."
29:04,060;29:06,180;"He just made that touchdown."
29:06,180;29:07,420;"The tables are red on there"
29:07,420;29:09,900;"'cause he's already got like 16 Eats as a tight end."
29:09,900;29:13,780;"- Did you hear Bella check talk about someone asked him"
29:13,780;29:18,500;"about the long snapper and whether you needed a roster spot"
29:18,500;29:19,860;"for a long snapper."
29:19,860;29:20,860;"(laughs)"
29:20,860;29:21,860;"He's like, ""Could you just train"
29:21,860;29:24,820;"""like a regular offensive lineman to do that job?"""
29:24,820;29:25,660;"- No."
29:25,660;29:28,820;"- And he gave him like a like 10 minute response."
29:28,820;29:29,820;"(laughs)"
29:29,820;29:31,740;"And it was actually pretty interesting."
29:31,740;29:32,740;"- Always is."
29:32,740;29:35,060;"- You talked about how like the league is evolved"
29:35,060;29:36,340;"and that people have tried that"
29:36,340;29:38,460;"and then they ultimately, you know,"
29:38,460;29:40,300;"came down how decisions got made"
29:40,300;29:42,740;"and which players like set precedence"
29:42,740;29:44,180;"and that everyone kind of followed those."
29:44,180;29:46,660;"It was pretty cool."
29:46,660;29:47,500;"- I love that shit."
29:47,500;29:49,260;"He's a smart son of a bitch when he gets gone."
29:49,260;29:51,140;"- Oh, I love when he gets going on something like that."
29:51,140;29:52,700;"'Cause he does, he talked like 10, 15 minutes."
29:52,700;29:54,340;"- And I just wish he would do that more often."
29:54,340;29:57,140;"'Cause like, I feel like it's like a mood thing"
29:57,140;29:59,180;"where sometimes people ask him my questions."
29:59,180;30:01,020;"I'll be like, ""Oh, that's an interesting question."""
30:01,020;30:02,700;"And he'll still just shut it down."
30:02,700;30:03,540;"- Yeah."
30:03,540;30:08,540;"- So it's like, he's more open to answering them lately."
30:08,540;30:09,980;"Past few seasons."
30:09,980;30:12,660;"- That more effusive."
30:12,660;30:14,180;"Okay, more occasionally."
30:14,180;30:15,820;"- Ooh, Steve."
30:15,820;30:16,740;"- You like that?"
30:16,740;30:18,140;"That's a T word."
30:18,140;30:20,020;"Yeah, I looked at school."
30:20,020;30:23,680;"But if you were like, hey, Bill, what's the Patriots theory"
30:23,680;30:26,020;"in off season here, compared to last year?"
30:26,020;30:28,260;"Because obviously there's a big difference."
30:28,260;30:30,060;"He's not going to answer that question."
30:30,060;30:31,940;"Well, no, because as a competitive advantage he became,"
30:31,940;30:32,440;"right?"
30:32,440;30:32,940;"Yeah."
30:32,940;30:33,540;"He was one of the--"
30:33,540;30:33,540;"He's there."
30:33,540;30:34,540;"--what his strategy is."
30:34,540;30:34,980;"Yeah."
30:34,980;30:37,380;"Yeah, it's all strategy."
30:37,380;30:37,900;"He's got--"
30:37,900;30:40,900;"But when you're saying, well, in the context of NFL history,"
30:40,900;30:43,140;"why do you like left-footed punters more?"
30:43,140;30:43,640;"Right."
30:43,640;30:45,700;"Oh, there we go."
30:45,700;30:47,400;"Yeah, you go off about spin rate."
30:47,400;30:49,920;"It's people catching it."
30:49,920;30:50,960;"Aren't used to it coming up."
30:50,960;30:53,320;"Does that not give someone else's competitive advantage?"
30:53,320;30:58,120;"If they then go after left, you know, at that point, when he answered that, that's"
30:58,120;31:00,760;"pretty no, no, everyone knew he lost left footer punters."
31:00,760;31:01,800;"And it's just a left footer punters."
31:01,800;31:03,080;"They all started copying them anyways."
31:03,080;31:06,600;"And also, I don't think there's enough left footed punters for it to make that"
31:06,600;31:07,240;"much of a difference."
31:07,240;31:11,920;"I think it's left footed punters are like, it's another like checkbox to tick off."
31:11,920;31:15,400;"I don't think it's like he's only looking for left footed punters, you know."
31:15,640;31:18,940;"Speaking of that, how did Johnny Hecker not end up on the Patriots?"
31:18,940;31:21,500;"Has he been signed?"
31:21,500;31:22,940;"Yes."
31:22,940;31:24,420;"By whom?"
31:24,420;31:26,200;"I don't remember."
31:26,200;31:28,740;"Well, did you hear about this kid from college?"
31:28,740;31:29,760;"Yes."
31:29,760;31:30,460;"My God."
31:30,460;31:31,460;"Puncah."
31:31,460;31:38,020;"Who just basically has said fuck everything except for distance and punted"
31:38,020;31:38,980;"80 yards every time."
31:38,980;31:39,940;"No."
31:39,940;31:41,300;"That's his main thing."
31:41,300;31:43,980;"Yeah, but he's he's good at everything."
31:44,380;31:45,340;"Hecker to the Panthers."
31:45,340;31:48,420;"Like his like pin down punts are like really good too."
31:48,420;31:52,220;"He's like way above the percentile for that stuff."
31:52,220;31:55,220;"He's just like the best punter that's ever punted."
31:55,220;31:59,180;"By any metric or, you know, it's crazy."
31:59,180;32:01,500;"That's what one of the odd things."
32:01,500;32:02,580;"- Jack Mason for a fifth round pick"
32:02,580;32:04,500;"so you can go get this guy."
32:04,500;32:07,020;"- You know, he's gonna get available in the fifth round?"
32:07,020;32:08,980;"Yeah, I think people are gonna take him before that."
32:08,980;32:10,220;"- I think so too."
32:10,220;32:11,420;"- I mean, if you think about Hecker,"
32:11,420;32:14,260;"Heckers were like fifth round pick has got like might make your team"
32:14,260;32:19,500;"Johnny hecker is more important to the Rams a little past decade than"
32:19,500;32:22,500;"You know, they're back up"
32:22,500;32:25,340;"Guard or whatever, you know like"
32:25,340;32:31,600;"The punter is kind of important. Oh crack your son a lot like Bill Belichick right now. Are you sure?"
32:31,600;32:37,180;"Right, buddy. I thought you don't give a shit about special teams. Sure. I'm really drinking the cool later"
32:37,180;32:43,720;"right now. I'm just typing a little pun. God. So what are the odds that he ends up on the"
32:43,720;32:45,960;"Patriots? I think."
32:45,960;32:52,380;"Um, again, if we draft him with the pick we traded Shaq Mason for, it's gonna be a row"
32:52,380;32:59,240;"set. And you gave up a guard for a punter. Fucking right. But Greg's right. Can you"
32:59,240;33:02,240;"- Yes, you read it, they're projecting him."
33:02,240;33:05,000;"- Can you name the punter who is drafting the first round?"
33:05,000;33:07,240;"- Tom Tupa."
33:07,240;33:08,860;"- He's the first round fake."
33:08,860;33:10,380;"- Tom Tupa?"
33:10,380;33:11,220;"- Yeah."
33:11,220;33:13,920;"- Was he drafted as a punter?"
33:13,920;33:15,120;"I thought he was drafted as a quarterback,"
33:15,120;33:15,960;"but then he converted a punter."
33:15,960;33:18,320;"- But he plays a punter too."
33:18,320;33:19,760;"Tom Tupa can do everything."
33:19,760;33:20,760;"- Tom Tupa did do everything."
33:20,760;33:22,880;"Tom wasn't Tom Tupa the first player ever"
33:22,880;33:25,880;"to score a two-playing conversion, I think."
33:25,880;33:26,800;"- You may be right."
33:26,800;33:29,200;"as a holder for the Cleveland Browns under Bill Bell check."
33:29,200;33:33,400;"How about that for some who drafted a punter first round."
33:33,400;33:39,720;"Oakland Raiders, a draft of Ray Guy, 23rd player chosen 1973."
33:39,720;33:42,280;"Remember Ray Guy?"
33:42,280;33:42,760;"Yeah."
33:42,760;33:45,280;"He was a fucking punter."
33:45,280;33:47,360;"He was the original punt god."
33:47,360;33:50,680;"Monk god ran a four seven two forty."
33:50,680;33:52,160;"OK."
33:52,160;33:53,600;"Let's fast with Tom Brady."
33:53,600;33:56,200;"These projected fifth round."
33:56,200;34:00,320;"Oh, so that's Jack Maryson pick is definitely going to the punk."
34:00,320;34:01,840;"Let's go baby."
34:01,840;34:06,000;"That's not really green, right?"
34:06,000;34:08,720;"I think it is."
34:08,720;34:10,520;"Oh, man."
34:10,520;34:15,800;"There's only been one punt in the NFL since 2014 that has traveled 80 yards."
34:15,800;34:19,720;"Ariaza did it twice last season."
34:19,720;34:22,720;"She has that as."
34:22,720;34:25,560;"That's the punk."
34:25,560;34:32,240;"He put 39 puns inside the opponent's 20 yard line, average 52 yards per punt."
34:32,240;34:35,840;"And set pretty much every record you could imagine."
34:35,840;34:36,360;"Yeah."
34:36,360;34:40,760;"People are watching his college games just to see him punt."
34:40,760;34:42,880;"He's going to the Jets then."
34:42,880;34:45,000;"That's where he can really fucking shine."
34:45,000;34:51,840;"No, he's going to Jackson, the kicker that Tampa Bay drafted."
34:52,680;34:56,800;"Oh, from Florida State, Roberto's mother."
34:56,800;34:57,240;"Yeah."
34:57,240;34:57,640;"Yeah."
34:57,640;34:59,840;"And they had a blanket shit."
34:59,840;35:04,880;"They had the HBO show that year and we just watched him like just mentally"
35:04,880;35:06,720;"collapsing from our eyes every week."
35:06,720;35:08,280;"It's crazy."
35:08,280;35:08,760;"It's crazy."
35:08,760;35:09,520;"Just yeah."
35:09,520;35:11,520;"And he was like a second round picker, some right?"
35:11,520;35:14,160;"And everybody wrote some like on draft day for it."
35:14,160;35:14,960;"Mm hmm."
35:14,960;35:16,480;"He was also like legit in college."
35:16,480;35:17,720;"And the big moments, too."
35:17,720;35:17,920;"Yeah."
35:17,920;35:19,600;"He was like one of the best college kickers ever."
35:19,600;35:21,720;"And then he did absolutely nothing in NFL."
35:21,720;35:29,660;"terrible. They can came back. I think like he bounced back. He did. But I don't think he ever like stuck. No, he was more of a journeyman. Yeah. I think the"
35:29,660;35:40,220;"pages tried him out before they settled on Nick Folk would have known because I wanted him bad. Why? Because he's got the sick"
35:40,220;35:48,140;"wreck specs in that guy is the blanket wrong. Wrong. Not blanket ship. No, we're not talking about. Oh, damn it. I want to give is the man. Yeah."
35:48,300;35:49,340;"Who is the fucking man?"
35:49,340;35:52,500;"Sucks a cold scot."
35:52,500;35:54,100;"They want to be a good kicker."
35:54,100;35:55,540;"Benatarian and blanket shit."
35:55,540;35:58,460;"And what's his name?"
35:58,460;36:00,620;"Oh, a manager."
36:00,620;36:02,060;"A manager."
36:02,060;36:03,500;"Oh, man."
36:03,500;36:09,940;"Speaking of which, this is the year that manning is on pace to break."
36:09,940;36:12,980;"Dan Marino's touchdown pass record."
36:12,980;36:13,380;"That's right."
36:13,380;36:14,860;"The yellow graphic in this game about it."
36:14,860;36:16,660;"Because I'm super shaded about that, I guess."
36:17,220;36:19,340;"Yeah, I think he was four behind or something."
36:19,340;36:20,820;"Does he break it in 2004?"
36:20,820;36:22,060;"That's a good question."
36:22,060;36:25,940;"Reno's record was 48 and Brady got 50 and no seven."
36:25,940;36:29,900;"Yeah, but then Manning got 55."
36:29,900;36:31,500;"One a couple years later."
36:31,500;36:33,340;"Really two things."
36:33,340;36:34,500;"10 or 11."
36:34,500;36:35,540;"That's still the record."
36:35,540;36:37,860;"Yes, Manning still has that record."
36:37,860;36:40,340;"Let's see."
36:40,340;36:42,100;"55 in 2013."
36:42,100;36:45,220;"I'm paying Manning."
36:45,220;36:48,540;"the Denver Broncos. What are you getting? Oh, four that he actually"
36:48,540;36:48,820;"break."
36:48,820;36:53,820;"Marine nose. I'm trying to find 2004, painting Manning through 49,"
36:53,820;36:58,740;"which was the most. Yeah. Beating. Marina by one. He threw 48."
36:58,740;37:02,460;"And then Brady beat him up. And then oh, seven, Brady through 50. And"
37:02,460;37:06,660;"2013, Manning through 55. That 50th touchdown pass from Brady. Well,"
37:06,660;37:09,740;"I've never lost it in my mind. Oh, yeah. That was insane. That was"
37:09,740;37:14,300;"another run it again. It really was. Yeah. Yeah. Kind of crazy."
37:14,300;37:17,340;"You see these like the most touchdown passes in a year."
37:17,340;37:24,140;"Jesus, the lowest, wow, the lowest since 19,"
37:24,140;37:25,560;"no, that's still lower than that."
37:25,560;37:28,660;"How far back I go back to 1992."
37:28,660;37:33,020;"Steve Young led the league with 25 touchdown passes"
37:33,020;37:36,320;"for the 49ers, did it again in '93 with 29."
37:36,320;37:39,780;"The next time somebody would win it with less than 30"
37:39,780;37:42,180;"was Tom Brady in 2002 with 28."
37:42,180;37:43,020;"Kind of low."
37:43,020;37:48,120;"Touchdowns 2002. Yeah, the 20th touch chance make a pro ball and miss the playoffs"
37:48,120;37:51,240;"but"
37:51,240;37:55,200;"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I don't care about individual stats. I'll give a shit about his winning"
37:55,200;37:58,280;"That's crazy"
37:58,280;38:01,000;"Now he's like I don't care about retirement all I care about is"
38:01,000;38:04,840;"Winning do you want to talk about this NFL off season?"
38:04,840;38:11,020;"Yep, the car one been ridiculous. Yeah, I probably should touch on me. Yeah, it has been"
38:11,280;38:13,640;"There is no more meat on this browns bone."
38:13,640;38:14,000;"It's."
38:14,000;38:15,840;"Oh, yeah."
38:15,840;38:17,040;"No, there's."
38:17,040;38:19,240;"I mean, if you want to, if you like watching"
38:19,240;38:22,360;"patients blowouts, this is the one for you because it is"
38:22,360;38:26,960;"over 30 seconds in three quarters and then you get a fast"
38:26,960;38:28,280;"forward to the trade round interception."
38:28,280;38:29,640;"Apparently, yeah, you're going to go find that."
38:29,640;38:31,800;"We'll put the highlight on the website so you can watch it there."
38:31,800;38:32,320;"Obviously."
38:32,320;38:33,880;"Passtimesy.com."
38:33,880;38:35,600;"Yeah."
38:35,600;38:37,600;"So Greg, do you want to you want to touch on?"
38:37,600;38:40,560;"What are your thoughts on this free agency?"
38:40,560;38:43,200;"period of 2022."
38:43,200;38:46,640;"- I say we power rank the moves."
38:46,640;38:47,460;"- Yep."
38:47,460;38:48,660;"- I think that's a good idea"
38:48,660;38:51,560;"'cause there's so many that it's like, yeah."
38:51,560;38:52,400;"- Okay."
38:52,400;38:53,400;"- What do you want to power rank them by?"
38:53,400;38:55,520;"Most shocking?"
38:55,520;38:58,160;"- Yes, the ones you didn't, you were just like, what?"
38:58,160;38:59,160;"- Yeah."
38:59,160;39:01,000;"Number one, Russell Wilson."
39:01,000;39:03,800;"- Russell of the Broncos."
39:03,800;39:04,960;"- Yeah, for the Broncos."
39:04,960;39:06,120;"- Let's just put them out there."
39:06,120;39:08,080;"Russell of the Broncos."
39:08,080;39:09,280;"- Wats into the Browns."
39:09,280;39:10,400;"- Wats into the Browns."
39:10,400;39:10,900;"That was for you."
39:10,900;39:13,640;"Roger is staying in Green Bay."
39:13,640;39:15,560;"And that is why I just leave."
39:15,560;39:19,640;"Devante leaving and MVS just left too."
39:19,640;39:21,040;"Hill leaving."
39:21,040;39:21,600;"Hill leaving."
39:21,600;39:22,240;"Although the fins."
39:22,240;39:22,640;"Yeah."
39:22,640;39:23,600;"That's a big one."
39:23,600;39:25,360;"Matt Ryan to the Colts."
39:25,360;39:27,160;"Yep."
39:27,160;39:37,320;"Are some wen to the Reds to the"
39:37,320;39:40,040;"Malcolm Butler back in the Patriots."
39:40,040;39:41,880;"Yes, back."
39:41,880;39:43,840;"Quick question."
39:43,840;39:47,120;"Who do you think any more former Patriots come back?"
39:47,120;39:48,880;"Trey Flowers, perhaps, someone like that?"
39:48,880;39:49,400;"Oh, yeah."
39:49,400;39:51,080;"Flowers, for sure."
39:51,080;39:52,080;"KVN."
39:52,080;39:53,080;"Is that what I heard about?"
39:53,080;39:54,720;"Is that what I got to resign?"
39:54,720;39:56,720;"I wouldn't call Ben, like coming back since he's--"
39:56,720;39:58,440;"I thought I didn't know I got cut."
39:58,440;39:59,440;"He did."
39:59,440;40:01,520;"Can you see him coming back?"
40:01,520;40:03,960;"Maybe."
40:03,960;40:05,640;"We'll find out next week."
40:05,640;40:06,880;"Gilmore."
40:06,880;40:09,280;"kill more. Yeah, I could see Gilmore coming back."
40:09,280;40:12,400;"I think Gilmore come back to maybe. I think Gilmore wants to"
40:12,400;40:16,240;"bag though. Now I think he's going to get a bag. That's"
40:16,240;40:19,960;"the problem. That's that pretty much covers it. Right, Greg?"
40:19,960;40:25,040;"Yeah, I mean, Khalil Mack to the Chargers. That one like is"
40:25,040;40:25,760;"a huge,"
40:25,760;40:29,720;"jacie Jackson to the charges. Jackson von Miller to the"
40:29,720;40:30,440;"bills."
40:30,440;40:31,200;"Oh, yeah."
40:31,200;40:32,040;"That happened."
40:32,040;40:36,680;"That's a shit's on the money too. For yeah, an aging"
40:36,680;40:38,480;"- I'm Ron Miller, but yeah."
40:38,480;40:39,320;"- Who else?"
40:39,320;40:45,600;"- So to me, I think the best off season is the bangles."
40:45,600;40:48,840;"You see what they did?"
40:48,840;40:50,880;"- They stacked up their offensive line."
40:50,880;40:52,720;"- Dude, they stacked it."
40:52,720;40:57,720;"Lael Collins, Ted Karis, and that guy Kappa from Tampa Bay."
40:57,720;41:00,120;"That's center, that's a fucking beast."
41:00,120;41:01,120;"- Oh, we need one more on this."
41:01,120;41:03,320;"I already mentioned it though, Brady, unretiring."
41:03,320;41:04,480;"- Brady unretiring."
41:04,480;41:06,120;"- Yeah, yeah."
41:06,120;41:07,560;"retired for 40 days."
41:07,560;41:08,840;"- So which one do you think,"
41:08,840;41:12,000;"which one do you have the highest expectations of"
41:12,000;41:13,840;"and which one do you think is gonna fall?"
41:13,840;41:14,680;"- Well, let's go shocking."
41:14,680;41:17,480;"What was the most shocking to you and least shocking?"
41:17,480;41:20,400;"- I think Wilson to the Broncos."
41:20,400;41:22,080;"- Yeah, that was my biggest."
41:22,080;41:24,880;"- I don't know that one."
41:24,880;41:27,800;"- 'Cause Watson you kind of knew was coming back."
41:27,800;41:30,440;"- Yeah, you knew Watson was going somewhere."
41:30,440;41:32,480;"The fact that one's the Browns was pretty shocking."
41:32,480;41:33,320;"- Right."
41:33,320;41:34,160;"- Yeah."
41:34,160;41:38,920;"also do Wilson was sort of go in somewhere too. Well, if there's a lot of smoke around"
41:38,920;41:43,540;"that has been. But it was it felt like similar smoke to our Rogers where he just wanted"
41:43,540;41:49,140;"more of a say mine is hell to the dolphins. Yeah, that was a pretty good joint because"
41:49,140;41:53,060;"I didn't see that. Yeah, he didn't think he was like bitches about his contract. He's"
41:53,060;41:57,120;"under contract for a couple more years like they did no need to move him. And all of a"
41:57,120;42:00,960;"sudden it's like, Oh, yes, between the dolphins and the jets. And then like half an hour"
42:00,960;42:02,280;"later, they're like, yep, done."
42:02,280;42:04,720;"It happened really quick."
42:04,720;42:05,000;"Yeah."
42:05,000;42:05,800;"They're really good."
42:05,800;42:06,560;"Adjustment."
42:06,560;42:09,120;"You're like, you're just like, maybe the sun went down to it."
42:09,120;42:11,280;"It was like, GK."
42:11,280;42:14,200;"So let's talk about that one."
42:14,200;42:21,480;"What is the reason for the chiefs to do that?"
42:21,480;42:25,000;"Because they don't want to pay them when it comes to do."
42:25,000;42:28,560;"I think because they can't really pay when he comes to you, because of how"
42:28,560;42:30,880;"much I'm either paying my homes is what I'm."
42:30,880;42:38,200;"I don't know, but that doesn't make any sense because none of these contracts appear to hit a salary cap in any way."
42:38,200;42:43,720;"Like I, that I looked up Hill and what he, what kind of hit he has for the dolphins."
42:43,720;42:47,160;"It told me that he's a 3% cap hit this year."
42:47,160;42:49,160;"He's like 10th in the team."
42:49,160;42:53,560;"And you just sound like you're one because you have a shitload of signing."
42:53,560;42:54,240;"Exactly."
42:54,240;42:54,760;"Yeah."
42:54,760;43:00,840;"Because I think he had like 50 million or something guaranteed as a signing bonus."
43:00,840;43:07,200;"Well, you can spread that signing bonus over the course of the contract, which is why you always get converted to a bonus"
43:07,200;43:14,580;"Because then you can just like our group chat Matt Ryan's cap hit this year combined across both his teams is like 75 million"
43:14,580;43:24,440;"Paying him 40 million to play for the cults not play. Yeah, they're playing Julio still 16 million to not play"
43:25,720;43:29,220;"It's a ridiculous amount of cap that kept out of the Saints are just as bad"
43:29,220;43:35,320;"But the Saints did the whole the same thing, but they just kicked all of that can down the road to where they have like"
43:35,320;43:38,240;"like only a handful of"
43:38,240;43:42,600;"Dollars left like next year already without having resigned anybody no"
43:42,600;43:47,440;"They're because they kicked everything down the road so that they could actually make room enough to sign"
43:47,440;43:54,120;"To Sean Watson. Yeah, then you decide to go with the Browns. Anyway, they create a bunch of space for Watson and Elvis"
43:54,120;43:55,880;"And he was like, not Browns."
43:55,880;44:02,880;"So it almost feel like there's going to be a year where they just can't afford to pay 53 players to roster."
44:02,880;44:05,120;"Well, that's why they had to let their left tackle go."
44:05,120;44:10,200;"People say that about the Rams and they're just like, oh, yeah, they're just kicking the can down on the celery cap."
44:10,200;44:11,320;"And they."
44:11,320;44:15,480;"Resign Matt Stafford to talk about resigning Aaron Donald."
44:15,480;44:20,200;"Yeah, but we're talking about resigning Beckham. How can they afford that? I don't understand."
44:20,200;44:22,400;"The other they're mortgaging the future."
44:22,400;44:23,800;"that the Patriots do that."
44:23,800;44:25,040;"They already did mortgage a future."
44:25,040;44:27,600;"It is the future now for when they started"
44:27,600;44:30,000;"mortgageing it and they're re-signing all their best players."
44:30,000;44:31,000;"I don't understand."
44:31,000;44:34,720;"The Rams and the Cowboys, especially pay like their top players"
44:34,720;44:37,320;"a shitload and then pay the rest of their team shit."
44:37,320;44:38,160;"Nothing."
44:38,160;44:41,680;"Right. I think that's I think that's part of it is that they don't have."
44:41,680;44:42,760;"They don't have the depth."
44:42,760;44:45,120;"So if they saw from injuries, they're fucked."
44:45,120;44:46,560;"Yeah. Right."
44:46,560;44:49,760;"But that's where the opposite."
44:49,760;44:50,560;"It's worked for."
44:50,560;44:54,440;"have a ton of top guys, but they have a bunch of guys,"
44:54,440;44:57,720;"big at six million. Yeah. Yeah, they have the biggest middle"
44:57,720;45:00,480;"class. And they have a lot of Rex Burkheads on their team."
45:00,480;45:03,680;"Right. Exactly. Yeah. A lot of special teamers, right? The"
45:03,680;45:08,600;"Justin Bethels and the Matthew Slater's and special teams"
45:08,600;45:12,080;"guys. Because all three phases, right? Great."
45:12,080;45:14,160;"Hill is going to be good on the dolphins."
45:14,160;45:16,800;"So you question depends on what you feel about to a hot and"
45:16,800;45:19,680;"I'm not super sold on them. Yeah, me either. At least you get"
45:19,680;45:22,280;"to find out now. Yeah, no excuses."
45:22,280;45:26,760;"The thing tackle and we traded for like the best receiver in the league last year."
45:26,760;45:28,600;"So do you think the Chiefs will be good?"
45:28,600;45:31,520;"So well, here's a question."
45:31,520;45:35,760;"Who has who has a better statistical season Hill or Devonta Adams?"
45:35,760;45:37,960;"Adams Adams."
45:37,960;45:41,160;"OK, he's probably getting"
45:41,160;45:44,080;"better balls, more target share."
45:44,080;45:48,200;"And I like, I think the I just think the Raiders are more complete"
45:48,200;45:49,700;"Because they have a run."
45:49,700;45:51,900;"I think I can sling too."
45:51,900;45:54,700;"I think people underestimate how much he can actually gun sling."
45:54,700;45:57,100;"I think Josh is going to do well second time around it."
45:57,100;45:57,500;"Right."
45:57,500;46:01,500;"It's also, yeah, if somebody can get the best out of a quarter back."
46:01,500;46:01,900;"It's coming."
46:01,900;46:03,400;"Yeah."
46:03,400;46:04,100;"Oh, yeah, Mike."
46:04,100;46:04,300;"I'm new."
46:04,300;46:06,700;"And who's a ROC?"
46:06,700;46:08,200;"I got to even another ROC is either."
46:08,200;46:08,900;"I don't know."
46:08,900;46:09,500;"I don't care."
46:09,500;46:14,800;"But so I made the mistake today because I had I've actually been driving to work."
46:14,800;46:16,100;"So I've run out of podcasts."
46:16,900;46:21,140;"So I just had a quick drive to do this afternoon."
46:21,140;46:22,700;"So I turn on the Sports Talk radio."
46:22,700;46:24,000;"- You're standing?"
46:24,000;46:25,540;"- Of course I do."
46:25,540;46:26,780;"- Solo podcast?"
46:26,780;46:28,260;"- I know this is our podcast."
46:28,260;46:30,140;"I've heard it once, that's more than enough."
46:30,140;46:30,980;"- You don't have to listen."
46:30,980;46:32,260;"- I say if you listen to the solo"
46:32,260;46:33,900;"and Andy can just listen to yourself."
46:33,900;46:37,220;"- I do that, I just have that on repeat."
46:37,220;46:38,600;"- Yeah."
46:38,600;46:42,100;"- But yes, I made the mistake of turning on Sports Talk radio."
46:42,100;46:46,420;"And they were talking about how it's a given"
46:46,420;46:48,720;"that Tom Brady is going to be traded to Miami."
46:48,720;46:50,080;"Miami."
46:50,080;46:52,620;"Miami, isn't it?"
46:52,620;46:57,680;"Because there's rumors that Tom Brady is going to buy ownership"
46:57,680;47:02,100;"stake in the Dolphins or has already or something."
47:02,100;47:05,300;"And there was all that smoke around him."
47:05,300;47:09,240;"Like Brian Flores was supposed to be like trying to tamper"
47:09,240;47:10,860;"to get him to come."
47:10,860;47:14,900;"I take that as truth verbatim that they're"
47:14,900;47:16,740;"trying to recruit Brady and Flores,"
47:16,740;47:18,400;"she said, ""No, fuck this."""
47:18,400;47:19,240;"- Yeah, probably, yeah."
47:19,240;47:20,080;"- Yeah, I could see it."
47:20,080;47:21,380;"- Flores, Brady probably would have been on the Dolphins"
47:21,380;47:23,180;"and they would have made it as well as a new beyond there."
47:23,180;47:24,460;"- Maybe."
47:24,460;47:26,420;"But they're saying now that Brady doesn't want to play"
47:26,420;47:27,620;"for Arians."
47:27,620;47:29,700;"And so it's basically a done deal that he's going"
47:29,700;47:32,260;"to Miami and how does Patriots fans think of that?"
47:32,260;47:35,460;"- So I will put Brady unretiring at the bottom"
47:35,460;47:37,560;"of my surprise list."
47:37,560;47:40,660;"That and J.C. Jackson going somewhere"
47:40,660;47:42,140;"and getting a bunch of money."
47:42,140;47:44,580;"- Yeah, I wouldn't say this is a bottom."
47:44,580;47:46,060;"I was pretty surprised."
47:46,060;47:49,100;"I was a little surprised, but not."
47:49,100;47:50,300;"I wasn't shocked."
47:50,300;47:53,220;"I was uninterested, as far as the word I would use."
47:53,220;47:56,100;"- Yeah, I'm just happy that I'm not going through the"
47:56,100;47:57,780;"Izzy, Izzy knee, you know?"
47:57,780;47:58,700;"- Oh yeah."
47:58,700;47:59,900;"- That's nice to not be apart."
47:59,900;48:01,220;"- It just sucks that he's under the breath"
48:01,220;48:03,020;"far of phase of his career, you know?"
48:03,020;48:03,860;"- Yeah."
48:03,860;48:05,140;"- Yeah, he's tough."
48:05,140;48:06,460;"I always thought he's better than that, but--"
48:06,460;48:08,620;"- Well, I know that the Bills did surprise me too."
48:08,620;48:11,620;"They usually don't make big signings like that."
48:11,620;48:13,580;"- Well, this is their window, right?"
48:13,580;48:16,780;"Yeah, yep, this is their chance."
48:16,780;48:19,620;"They got the AFC on the ropes, although."
48:19,620;48:23,040;"This is going to be a tough year for any team"
48:23,040;48:27,220;"at the agency, which is another reason why I think Brady stays in the NFC because"
48:27,220;48:29,340;"who's you got to go through?"
48:29,340;48:31,780;"Aaron Rodgers with no weapons."
48:31,780;48:34,220;"Yeah, I'm receiving cars socks now."
48:34,220;48:37,420;"The Falcons with no."
48:37,420;48:38,460;"I mean, say no quarterback."
48:38,460;48:39,380;"Marcus Mariola."
48:39,380;48:42,660;"The Saints with no quarterback."
48:43,020;48:43,860;"- James."
48:43,860;48:45,940;"- I'll stand by that."
48:45,940;48:49,260;"- Anther's with Sam Darnold and Johnny Hecker."
48:49,260;48:50,600;"- Giants."
48:50,600;48:53,260;"- Right, with no quarterback."
48:53,260;48:56,380;"- Carson Wentz on the commanders."
48:56,380;48:57,380;"- Yeah."
48:57,380;49:00,220;"- That one is a guaranteed disaster."
49:00,220;49:02,060;"I can't wait to watch it."
49:02,060;49:03,780;"It's gonna be a disaster from day one."
49:03,780;49:05,180;"And everybody knows it."
49:05,180;49:06,580;"And we're all gonna sit there and be like,"
49:06,580;49:08,140;"""Yes, we're all wicked smart"
49:08,140;49:10,780;"""because we knew this was not gonna work."""
49:10,780;49:13,380;"I bet Eagles fans are ecstatic about that."
49:13,380;49:14,220;"- Oh, yeah."
49:14,220;49:17,020;"- Imagine if he turns out to be awesome"
49:17,020;49:18,020;"on the commander's style,"
49:18,020;49:20,620;"fucking ridiculous, I would hate that."
49:20,620;49:22,900;"- That would be the most shocking thing of the season."
49:22,900;49:26,140;"- It'd be Kristoff-Porzingis all over again."
49:26,140;49:30,380;"We're like, oh, the Knicks just drafted this fucking seven foot"
49:30,380;49:32,980;"lot-vian guy that we've only seen playing against"
49:32,980;49:34,140;"like folding chairs."
49:34,140;49:35,860;"He's gonna be fucking awful."
49:35,860;49:38,020;"And then he came in and he's just slayed."
49:38,020;49:39,220;"He's like, what the hell?"
49:39,220;49:48,760;"This is the next. This is the goddamn next. Well, who does better? Matt Ryan or Carson"
49:48,760;49:49,760;"once? Ryan."
49:49,760;49:55,120;"Yeah, Ryan without a doubt. I think Matt Ryan is a good year. Matt Ryan. Yeah, fantasy"
49:55,120;49:59,460;"sleeper. Matt Ryan's making the playoffs with that team. Yep. They're offensive sneaky"
49:59,460;50:05,700;"guys. AFC though. It's going to be tight in the AFC. It is not the AFC South though. Yeah."
50:05,700;50:08,140;"I mean, Jacksonville, Jack spoke at the run."
50:08,140;50:15,140;"They signed Christian Kirk to a fucking $20 a year contract."
50:15,140;50:17,140;"84 dumbest shit ever."
50:17,140;50:17,700;"Yeah."
50:17,700;50:20,580;"They said they basically tried to do what the pages did, but just signed a whole"
50:20,580;50:22,820;"bunch of mediocre guys for the pages money."
50:22,820;50:23,100;"Yeah."
50:23,100;50:30,020;"I looked up that that Christian contract deal looks like he has like dirt on the"
50:30,020;50:34,500;"owner or something because there's no way anybody that knows anything about sports"
50:34,500;50:36,060;"looks that and goes, yeah, this makes sense."
50:36,060;50:37,380;"He has this."
50:37,380;50:42,140;"He has like, he's like a top 10 paid receiver in the league now."
50:42,140;50:42,860;"Yeah."
50:42,860;50:44,940;"Where did he use to play?"
50:44,940;50:46,260;"Cardinal."
50:46,260;50:46,900;"Exactly."
50:46,900;50:47,340;"Like that."
50:47,340;50:49,340;"This is exactly where he used to play."
50:49,340;50:52,460;"He's never had a fucking thousand yard season in his career."
50:52,460;50:53,980;"Do you feel I like Christian Kirk?"
50:53,980;50:54,900;"I would have loved him on the path."
50:54,900;50:56,500;"He would have been good, but not."
50:56,500;51:00,460;"I mean, having said that the didn't the Jaguars have like stupid amounts of money."
51:00,460;51:02,220;"So, you mean, you got it."
51:02,220;51:03,220;"You got to send it somewhere, right?"
51:03,540;51:09,220;"That's the only thing that makes sense to me is that like no one wants to go there because they're in such shambles that they have to like"
51:09,220;51:13,380;"Super overpay to get anybody to sign. Yeah. Well, just trade for"
51:13,380;51:20,260;"Tyree kill and throw him even more than that. That's what I'm saying. Oh, yeah, go get to vante Adams"
51:20,260;51:25,300;"I'm sure you've got the draft capital and the money. You always have the money. Who's their coach?"
51:25,300;51:30,900;"Fuck"
51:30,900;51:33,300;"Urban Meyer"
51:33,300;51:37,380;"There's some awesome stories about Urban Maya this week."
51:37,380;51:38,300;"Do you see those?"
51:38,300;51:39,300;"Doug Peterson."
51:39,300;51:42,300;"Didn't know who Aaron Doll was."
51:42,300;51:44,300;"That was just 99 guys."
51:44,300;51:45,300;"I used to always try watching."
51:45,300;51:47,300;"It's got to be a hit piece."
51:47,300;51:48,300;"It has to be."
51:48,300;51:50,300;"But I just, I really want it to be true."
51:50,300;51:51,300;"So I'm believing it."
51:51,300;51:52,300;"I'm going with it."
51:52,300;51:54,300;"Jax coaches Doug Peterson, by the way."
51:54,300;51:55,300;"Really?"
51:55,300;51:56,300;"Doug?"
51:56,300;51:57,300;"Mm hmm."
51:57,300;52:01,300;"So I'll be one of those, you know."
52:01,300;52:04,580;"They also signed Zae Jones for 10 million per"
52:04,580;52:09,840;"Guys never been no he averaged 32 yards a game"
52:09,840;52:14,740;"It is the season"
52:14,740;52:20,700;"Yeah, this is this will be good. I'm I think the judges can be sneaky good. I like their moves. Oh, yeah"
52:20,700;52:24,280;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, there's something wrong there though that they"
52:24,280;52:31,120;"It's a couple years in a row now that they've had like a really good team on paper and there's something that's not"
52:31,120;52:32,120;"not working."
52:32,120;52:33,120;"Coach is struggling."
52:33,120;52:34,120;"He's got a vision."
52:34,120;52:43,480;"He seems like he's like the players like him."
52:43,480;52:44,480;"Right."
52:44,480;52:46,480;"He's pretty forward thinking."
52:46,480;52:51,880;"Yeah, he blew it last year, right?"
52:51,880;52:56,880;"Yes, right at the end of the season to not make the playoffs."
52:56,880;52:57,880;"Wasn't that him?"
52:57,880;53:02,440;"Yeah, well, he had to play for a tie to make the playoffs him into whoever they were playing."
53:02,440;53:08,200;"Yes, the Raiders maybe the Raiders. Yeah. And if they tied that game, the Steelers would"
53:08,200;53:11,180;"miss the playoffs. Right. I was definitely not going to happen. It was like, that game"
53:11,180;53:19,520;"was awesome. Three quarters away through overtime. And he's stupid. Do the Chiefs make the playoffs?"
53:19,520;53:25,560;"Yes. Yes. Why are you so confident? They have like the hardest division of football."
53:25,560;53:32,040;"It's true. Yeah. Ross at the Broncos now. And if they started like they did"
53:32,040;53:35,400;"started this year we kind of just say the Chiefs of the Chiefs. They have no"
53:35,400;53:40,200;"receivers really. Yeah. I don't know. I think they have a really good coach and"
53:40,200;53:44,640;"really good quarterback and to me that means playoffs. You're gonna be hard for"
53:44,640;53:48,280;"the you're gonna have to have two wildcards come out of there. They got to be"
53:48,280;53:52,760;"an all the other good. The division is gonna be so sick. I can't wait to watch"
53:52,760;53:57,000;"that. But yeah, those division games can be worthwhile. I hope they get like every Sunday night game."
53:57,000;54:03,560;"Yeah, yeah, absolutely. It really should be prime to you to the Chiefs, right? Yes. I think that"
54:03,560;54:08,680;"might be a sneaky good one. That's a good well him in fantasy sleeper pick there. Yeah,"
54:08,680;54:16,520;"him in the vault is scandal. He sucks. He's just fast. But now the Packers will know. So that's"
54:16,520;54:18,080;"- That's gonna be fun."
54:18,080;54:23,080;"- Have you heard the USFL rule chain,"
54:23,080;54:26,160;"or I guess rules that are different?"
54:26,160;54:28,320;"You know, they could try them out in USFL?"
54:28,320;54:29,840;"- Yeah, yeah."
54:29,840;54:31,600;"Like they did with XFL, right?"
54:31,600;54:32,960;"- Yeah, I wrote a couple down"
54:32,960;54:34,800;"'cause I thought they were pretty interesting."
54:34,800;54:35,640;"- I must say."
54:35,640;54:38,520;"- So one of them is the on-side kick thing,"
54:38,520;54:39,920;"option that we've talked about"
54:39,920;54:43,040;"where it's the fourth in 12 from your own 33."
54:43,040;54:44,080;"- Oh, interesting."
54:44,080;54:46,640;"You can do that in lieu of a on-site kick."
54:46,640;54:47,120;"Okay."
54:47,120;54:50,120;"I've personally loved that one."
54:50,120;54:51,440;"I think that's a great idea."
54:51,440;54:53,040;"I feel like you take it every time, but okay."
54:53,040;54:54,480;"Fourth and 12 from your own."
54:54,480;54:57,000;"If you get, if you don't get it, they get the ball in your 33 yard."
54:57,000;54:57,200;"Yeah."
54:57,200;54:58,600;"Twelve and 12 yards is a lot."
54:58,600;54:59,280;"I can't get your **** too."
54:59,280;55:01,360;"All right."
55:01,360;55:04,440;"Less chance to even get that on-site kick chances are so low."
55:04,440;55:05,040;"Yeah."
55:05,040;55:08,440;"Well, they've they've done the math and it's"
55:08,440;55:09,160;"I'm feeling the math."
55:09,160;55:11,080;"That's why that's why it's fourth and 12, but not"
55:11,080;55:11,680;"fourth and anything."
55:11,680;55:12,920;"That's exactly."
55:12,920;55:13,120;"Yeah."
55:13,120;55:16,400;"a three point conversion."
55:16,400;55:20,000;"How's that work from the 10 yard line?"
55:20,000;55:23,120;"That should be from the 12 yard line too."
55:23,120;55:26,520;"If you're going to do 12, right?"
55:26,520;55:28,000;"You may as well just even there."
55:28,000;55:29,520;"Yeah, 10 things will close."
55:29,520;55:31,880;"I feel like I just go for that every time when you're when you're going into the"
55:31,880;55:37,360;"end zone 10 is more than like that's harder to get than a more than two and from your own 30, you know, whatever."
55:37,360;55:38,000;"Yeah, yeah."
55:38,000;55:40,000;"Because you don't have to carve as much of the field."
55:40,000;55:41,720;"But in concept, do you like that one?"
55:42,800;55:44,000;"I don't know, that'd be too much."
55:44,000;55:44,920;"That's a field goal."
55:44,920;55:48,600;"- I feel like it changes the dynamic of strategy way too much"
55:48,600;55:51,040;"because right now, like having those,"
55:51,040;55:54,280;"like it's a two score game, those things like"
55:54,280;55:56,320;"are hugely impactful to games."
55:56,320;55:57,440;"And if you change that one rule,"
55:57,440;56:00,320;"you're gonna change all sorts of strategy,"
56:00,320;56:03,240;"which I kind of like that strategy as it is now."
56:03,240;56:04,600;"- Yeah, yeah."
56:04,600;56:06,120;"- And you're not really solving a problem."
56:06,120;56:08,000;"You're just adding kind of a gimmick rule for it."
56:08,000;56:10,240;"- And it's like a field goal too, you know?"
56:10,240;56:14,840;"I mean, if it was like a 50 yard field goal for three points, I'd be like, okay, let's try that."
56:14,840;56:16,800;"Three-punk operation."
56:16,800;56:18,560;"That would be from midfield."
56:18,560;56:19,760;"Yeah."
56:19,760;56:22,400;"Justin Tucker would be a fucking MVP."
56:22,400;56:23,720;"Exactly."
56:23,720;56:25,920;"Hit three pointers every time."
56:25,920;56:31,040;"What did they have a role change about overtime as well?"
56:31,040;56:31,440;"What's their overtime?"
56:31,440;56:31,680;"Yeah."
56:31,680;56:34,480;"So the overtime one is overtime shootout."
56:34,480;56:37,600;"So it's similar to like a penalty kick in soccer,"
56:38,120;56:42,680;"where each team gets three two point conversion attempts."
56:42,680;56:43,960;"Okay."
56:43,960;56:47,160;"And then whoever has more successful ones."
56:47,160;56:48,760;"I see. And then you go one for one."
56:48,760;56:50,520;"And then you do sudden death. Yeah."
56:50,520;56:52,400;"Interesting. That's too bad."
56:52,400;56:53,960;"That's better than what they got."
56:53,960;56:55,640;"Yeah. I mean, it's not for long."
56:55,640;56:57,960;"I think you just follow college, but and just speak, maybe."
56:57,960;57:00,560;"But it's kind of kind of his formula."
57:00,560;57:01,760;"It's something similar."
57:01,760;57:05,240;"It's kind of hokey that you don't actually play."
57:05,240;57:06,280;"Right."
57:06,480;57:12,060;"Like it's like, yeah, it's like one play to which you could say about soccer or hockey to be fair."
57:12,060;57:12,240;"Yeah."
57:12,240;57:12,240;"Yeah."
57:12,240;57:14,940;"That's pretty hokey way to finish the game."
57:14,940;57:15,960;"Yeah, I've always had a pain."
57:15,960;57:16,700;"It's true."
57:16,700;57:19,400;"That's honestly college college has got it."
57:19,400;57:20,680;"I don't know why you need to rethink it."
57:20,680;57:24,800;"Just fucking keep playing quarters until somebody leaves at the end, right?"
57:24,800;57:25,440;"Fuck it."
57:25,440;57:28,360;"Make him make him play for a fucking three days."
57:28,360;57:29,000;"It's exciting."
57:29,000;57:33,440;"College is college overtime is the best gambling."
57:34,640;57:36,540;"It affects the point spreads."
57:36,540;57:37,460;"Yeah, it's over."
57:37,460;57:38,920;"Over is hit way more."
57:38,920;57:40,460;"Yeah, well, then just make the winning team only"
57:40,460;57:45,140;"scored by seven or whatever it is, whatever the score is."
57:45,140;57:46,040;"I saw something."
57:46,040;57:46,720;"I agree."
57:46,720;57:49,620;"I think that's a good way to do it."
57:49,620;57:51,180;"Whatever the difference in overtime is,"
57:51,180;57:52,740;"is what's because added to the winning team"
57:52,740;57:55,260;"real estate score."
57:55,260;57:57,860;"Yeah, it's like bag toss."
57:57,860;58:01,580;"OK, or if you both score, they cancel each other out."
58:01,580;58:02,100;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
58:02,100;58:03,100;"All right."
58:03,100;58:03,600;"Yeah."
58:03,600;58:05,600;"So it's just whatever the plus my"
58:05,600;58:07,600;"You play football bag toss"
58:07,600;58:12,880;"Punter punter bag toss would be sick too"
58:12,880;58:19,120;"Traffic on God and just that fucking drop"
58:19,120;58:22,720;"The second oh so here's what you do right you get"
58:22,720;58:25,840;"You get kitty pools right you put them on the corner of each end zone"
58:25,840;58:30,320;"You have the punters punt from midfield and whoever hits whoever hits the bikini pool"
58:30,720;58:32,160;"I love this idea."
58:32,160;58:33,120;"See?"
58:33,120;58:35,600;"Yeah."
58:35,600;58:39,760;"What about what about a what about a punt pass kick?"
58:39,760;58:43,360;"But the same thing where it's a kitty ball and they have to throw it."
58:43,360;58:43,600;"Yeah."
58:43,600;58:45,200;"They have to punt it and you have to have kickers."
58:45,200;58:49,280;"They have three separate position to the challenge."
58:49,280;58:50,080;"Yeah."
58:50,080;58:53,040;"And then it's it's the bag toss scores."
58:53,040;58:55,440;"So yeah, whatever plus minus you get."
58:55,440;58:56,640;"Yeah, it's your final score."
58:56,640;58:57,600;"Love it."
58:57,600;58:58,800;"Three rounds."
58:58,800;59:02,640;"So each, no, it should just be, I think we've already solved this."
59:02,640;59:08,520;"It should be a sumo wrestling match between the two fattest, uh, assistant coaches."
59:08,520;59:09,560;"Isn't that what we said?"
59:09,560;59:10,600;"KY Jolly, though."
59:10,600;59:11,360;"Got to have it."
59:11,360;59:14,720;"And whichever coach pushes the other coach, I like they started the 50,"
59:14,720;59:17,440;"whichever one pushes the other coach to the other opposite teams, 40"
59:17,440;59:19,200;"yard line wins the game."
59:19,200;59:22,880;"If I get any read, he's going to the fucking, that's what I mean."
59:22,880;59:23,360;"Yeah."
59:23,360;59:27,080;"Bell check's got to bulk up for the shit, but they're tied together."
59:27,080;59:29,640;"because they we don't want to like oh yeah yeah."
59:29,640;59:30,560;"Oh, they felt critical."
59:30,560;59:31,080;"So yeah, whatever."
59:31,080;59:31,600;"Yeah."
59:31,600;59:32,280;"Yeah."
59:32,280;59:36,200;"Or remember the challenge MTV's the challenge."
59:36,200;59:37,320;"Yeah."
59:37,320;59:39,360;"Tate tied these back to back."
59:39,360;59:39,720;"Yes."
59:39,720;59:40,360;"Yes."
59:40,360;59:41,800;"They had to like go."
59:41,800;59:42,760;"It was like a yeah."
59:42,760;59:46,960;"Like a boy and CT just picked that dude up on his back."
59:46,960;59:48,160;"And he was like, dang,"
59:48,160;59:49,600;"I just like there."
59:49,600;59:53,240;"Dude, then he like threw him into the thing."
59:53,240;59:54,240;"Yeah."
59:54,240;59:54,800;"Classic."
59:54,800;59:55,640;"- CT."
59:55,640;59:57,720;"- Classic CJ."
59:57,720;01:00:00,480;"- That was a psycho."
01:00:00,480;01:00:02,440;"- I don't know what that is."
01:00:02,440;01:00:04,160;"- You don't remember CT from Boston?"
01:00:04,160;01:00:09,000;"He was like the most stereotypical Boston guy ever."
01:00:09,000;01:00:11,400;"Just love starting fights and being a meathead."
01:00:11,400;01:00:13,080;"- I really should just rewind the original."
01:00:13,080;01:00:14,080;"- Yeah."
01:00:14,080;01:00:17,480;"- It's 'cause they were from real world, right?"
01:00:17,480;01:00:18,880;"- Yeah, I think so."
01:00:18,880;01:00:19,720;"- Originally?"
01:00:19,720;01:00:21,080;"- Yeah, or road rules."
01:00:21,080;01:00:21,920;"- Right."
01:00:21,920;01:00:23,840;"- There's real world, world rules challenge."
01:00:23,840;01:00:25,940;"Yeah. It really should be watch real world"
01:00:25,940;01:00:28,200;"'cause that shit was Wild West back in the day."
01:00:28,200;01:00:30,700;"Yeah. Oh yeah. The original ones were fucking crazy."
01:00:30,700;01:00:31,520;"Yeah. Oh yeah."
01:00:31,520;01:00:34,880;"So with all of these free agent moves,"
01:00:34,880;01:00:39,240;"which Patriots game are you most looking forward to this year?"
01:00:39,240;01:00:41,800;"I'll give you a quick rundown."
01:00:41,800;01:00:42,920;"Okay."
01:00:42,920;01:00:45,320;"At Cleveland, at Green Bay,"
01:00:45,320;01:00:47,560;"obviously Home & Away Miami,"
01:00:47,560;01:00:51,400;"at Minnesota, Home & Away Buffalo, Home & Away Jets,"
01:00:51,400;01:00:53,460;"Home verse the Ravens,"
01:00:53,460;01:00:56,260;"Home verse Bengals, Home verse Bears,"
01:00:56,260;01:01:00,040;"Home verse Lions at Pittsburgh,"
01:01:00,040;01:01:04,880;"at Arizona, at Vegas, Home verse the Colts,"
01:01:04,880;01:01:05,980;"at Vegas."
01:01:05,980;01:01:08,120;"- Yeah, it's a good one."
01:01:08,120;01:01:09,120;"- Yeah, it's a good one."
01:01:09,120;01:01:12,320;"- Yeah, Josh McDaniel's Raiders were surgeon."
01:01:12,320;01:01:13,760;"Second would be the, I can't believe it"
01:01:13,760;01:01:15,280;"in the sense of the Browns."
01:01:15,280;01:01:16,640;"- I was thinking, at Cleveland,"
01:01:16,640;01:01:19,720;"against Tishawn Watson."
01:01:19,720;01:01:20,920;"Where does Baker go?"
01:01:20,920;01:01:26,720;"Still missing one. Seattle?"
01:01:26,720;01:01:28,440;"Who's left? Yeah, who's left?"
01:01:28,440;01:01:31,720;"The Lions have heard that thrown around."
01:01:31,720;01:01:33,320;"Now, Lions are"
01:01:33,320;01:01:36,640;"Seattle sign and Colin Kaepernick."
01:01:36,640;01:01:38,080;"And then draft next year."
01:01:38,080;01:01:44,560;"I think Seattle has got to be right."
01:01:44,560;01:01:46,720;"Oh, he says."
01:01:46,720;01:01:48,000;"They're signing Kaepernick, Steve."
01:01:48,000;01:01:49,320;"You haven't heard this?"
01:01:49,600;01:01:51,640;"No, Pittsburgh. So I don't know."
01:01:51,640;01:01:52,560;"Pittsburgh."
01:01:52,560;01:01:55,960;"After Nick is still getting floated as a."
01:01:55,960;01:01:59,560;"I did. He did one of his little thirst traps online where you"
01:01:59,560;01:02:02,680;"could work out with some Seattle wide of zero."
01:02:02,680;01:02:04,040;"I remember. Yeah."
01:02:04,040;01:02:06,040;"Tyler Lockett. Was it? Okay."
01:02:06,040;01:02:07,480;"I think so. I might not be."
01:02:07,480;01:02:09,120;"There's some rumors that he's not going to be."
01:02:09,120;01:02:12,120;"Well, if that happens, then we have a new number one,"
01:02:12,120;01:02:13,280;"most unexpected."
01:02:13,280;01:02:15,640;"This is true."
01:02:15,640;01:02:17,680;"This is your cabinet coming out of retirement."
01:02:17,680;01:02:19,360;"I've only got five fucking years."

01:02:20,800;01:02:23,160;"Yeah, I'll put that on top of the list for sure."
01:02:23,160;01:02:24,120;"- That could dope."

01:02:27,960;01:02:30,040;"- 'Cause if you have to listen to sports analysts"
01:02:30,040;01:02:34,200;"talk about politics and you'd wanna shoot yourself"
01:02:34,200;01:02:35,040;"and you'd be like,"

01:03:01,640;01:03:04,520;"No, it's Robert Griffin, the third versus Kaepernick."
01:03:04,520;01:03:10,280;"No, have you seen RG three lately in the Super Bowl?"
01:03:10,280;01:03:14,760;"Did you see it was like RG three and Andrew Luck?"
01:03:14,760;01:03:16,760;"Well, that's a Super Bowl or something."
01:03:17,160;01:03:20,720;"Or maybe, oh, maybe it was like a college playoff football game or something."
01:03:20,720;01:03:22,020;"They were like commentators, something."
01:03:22,020;01:03:23,480;"Was a picture of them."

01:03:24,680;01:03:26,880;"Andrew, look, looks rough."
01:03:26,880;01:03:28,400;"Does he?"
01:03:28,400;01:03:30,320;"Yeah."
01:03:30,320;01:03:33,640;"He has always kind of like, he had the Greg Brown mustache."
01:03:33,640;01:03:35,080;"Oh, and he's lost like a shit on a weight."
01:03:35,080;01:03:36,560;"And he's just like all head now."
01:03:36,560;01:03:39,720;"He looked for a lot of Andrew luck."
01:03:39,720;01:03:41,600;"And yeah, I can see if I can."
01:03:41,600;01:03:44,760;"Yeah, let me see if I can share this."
01:03:44,760;01:03:47,120;"Oh, speaking of your mustache, I heard that."

01:04:07,240;01:04:12,400;"the third looking like a snack. Yeah. He looks like any looks,"
01:04:12,400;01:04:15,920;"you looking very well together. Right. Lost a lot of that"
01:04:15,920;01:04:22,840;"He's lost a lot of weight. I actually three look a real good though. Look at that man. Wait stress. That's a nice fit and suit"
01:04:22,840;01:04:25,780;"And he like looks like he's just like me"
01:04:25,780;01:04:29,720;"Like he's going on national TV"
01:04:29,720;01:04:37,360;"Yeah, well, that's always been his thing right. You look like looks like he didn't realize he was going on television that day"
01:04:37,360;01:04:42,400;"Good for somebody so he's got like the the collared shirt on"
01:04:42,660;01:04:45,940;"But then like a jacket that's probably not his over it"

01:05:29,940;01:05:30,940;"These classes or these classes?"
01:05:30,940;01:05:38,420;"They would float you boat, you know like a bad RG3 likes that shit and Andrew luck doesn't so let them dress how they want correct"
01:05:38,420;01:05:40,420;"That's very understanding of you"
01:05:40,780;01:05:42,980;"Thanks Steve especially for you"
01:05:42,980;01:05:47,700;"That look at that mustache mustache is pretty sweet"
01:05:47,700;01:05:55,960;"How long did you have it died for did you die it came up bad and immediately shaved it off because you don't have it"
01:05:55,960;01:06:02,780;"See what the quote says there from RG3 Steve. Let's use words to build bridges not walls, okay"

01:06:17,420;01:06:22,420;"- I tried to die using the old man gray beard shit."
01:06:22,420;01:06:24,780;"- And how did you not take photos of this"
01:06:24,780;01:06:25,620;"and send it to the family for that?"
01:06:25,620;01:06:27,020;"- 'Cause it didn't really work."
01:06:27,020;01:06:29,140;"It didn't like make it very dark."
01:06:29,140;01:06:31,380;"- You didn't double down like that, get some pink?"
01:06:31,380;01:06:32,540;"- Nah, it's a whole process."
01:06:32,540;01:06:35,900;"You gotta like, you gotta put the paint together,"
01:06:35,900;01:06:37,740;"mix it and then you paint your shit"
01:06:37,740;01:06:40,420;"And then you got to like at exactly five minutes,"
01:06:40,420;01:06:41,660;"wash it off."
01:06:41,660;01:06:42,700;"So it was this whole thing."
01:06:42,700;01:06:44,020;"And I was like, yeah, it didn't work."
01:06:44,020;01:06:45,340;"Fucking I threw it all away."
01:06:45,340;01:06:47,140;"And then I shaved it the next day."
01:06:47,140;01:06:50,660;"Oh, it's typical."
01:06:50,660;01:06:52,900;"- So who's paying the mortgage now?"
01:06:52,900;01:06:53,900;"- It's a good question."
01:06:53,900;01:06:54,740;"- That's a good question."
01:06:54,740;01:06:57,500;"(laughing)"
01:06:57,500;01:06:59,020;"- Stocks are going down."
01:06:59,020;01:07:02,340;"The shareholders are very disciplined."
01:07:02,340;01:07:03,500;"- I shaved it and then all of a sudden"

01:07:45,160;01:07:46,440;"on the ball of your foot."
01:07:46,440;01:07:48,040;"And you took a colored pencil."
01:07:48,040;01:07:50,440;"Put it through one end, slid it under,"
01:07:50,440;01:07:51,360;"poked it out the other end,"
01:07:51,360;01:07:52,800;"then took a picture of it."
01:07:52,800;01:07:53,640;"- Yeah."
01:07:53,640;01:07:54,480;"- What the hell out of your head?"
01:07:54,480;01:07:55,320;"- Yeah, I did."
01:07:55,320;01:07:56,160;"- 'Cause that went like the whole like--"
01:07:56,160;01:07:58,000;"- She found out later when she was going through her photos"
01:07:58,000;01:08:00,080;"of her time at our house and was like,"
01:08:00,080;01:08:01,840;"what the fuck is this?"
01:08:01,840;01:08:03,560;"- Is that went like the whole like,"
01:08:03,560;01:08:06,160;"the skin on the entire ball of foot comes loose."
01:08:06,160;01:08:07,000;"- Yeah."
01:08:07,000;01:08:08,920;"- I've had that, that's just, that's sketch."

01:08:11,000;01:08:11,840;"Indoor saga."
01:08:11,840;01:08:12,680;"- I've never had it."
01:08:12,680;01:08:14,600;"- Fucking shitty turf."
01:08:14,600;01:08:16,160;"- Yeah, I don't get that anymore."
01:08:16,160;01:08:17,320;"- I've seen it."
01:08:17,320;01:08:18,800;"- 'Cause I saw a picture."
01:08:18,800;01:08:20,400;"- It's awful."
01:08:20,400;01:08:21,320;"Here it is."
01:08:21,320;01:08:22,640;"- Well, apparently you could put a colored pencil"
01:08:22,640;01:08:23,840;"through it, so that's cool."
01:08:23,840;01:08:25,000;"- Oh, you definitely could."
01:08:25,000;01:08:28,120;"Usually you have to drain it too, which is also a good time."
01:08:28,120;01:08:29,560;"- Maybe that's why Greg had the colored pencil"
01:08:29,560;01:08:30,440;"in the first place."
01:08:30,440;01:08:32,000;"- Good being, pop it."

01:08:48,840;01:08:51,560;"- You're just fucking weird dude, Greg."
01:08:51,560;01:08:52,520;"(laughing)"
01:08:52,520;01:08:53,640;"- That one was cool."
01:08:53,640;01:08:54,480;"All right."
01:08:54,480;01:09:00,160;"On that note, I think we've driven this into the ground."

01:10:28,340;01:10:37,300;"Well, I one more thing about like fans being names and stuff. Did you ever hear when Justin Bieber visited Ann Frank's house and he wrote in the guest book?"
01:10:37,300;01:10:40,220;"I would have liked to think that Anne Frank would be a believer."
01:10:40,220;01:10:44,380;"Like a tough look."
01:10:44,380;01:10:47,820;"I mean, she's probably a guy."
01:10:47,820;01:10:49,420;"He was like, I mean, it is defense."
01:10:49,420;01:10:51,140;"She's right in his demographic wheelhouse."
01:10:51,140;01:10:51,780;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
01:10:51,780;01:10:53,540;"And he was like 13 at the time."
01:10:53,540;01:10:54,700;"So it's like, I'll give him a break."
01:10:54,700;01:10:58,220;"I think Kim Kardashian talking about how people need to work hard is probably"
01:10:58,220;01:11:04,540;"More a bigger. Oh, yeah, she's she's the worst stuff. Yeah, Carter make more sex takes. Come on people. Yeah"
01:11:04,540;01:11:12,780;"All right, my worst is Aaron Rogers putting us through all this crap just to stay where he is"
01:11:12,780;01:11:16,540;"Inside a massive fucking contract. What he says all he wants to do is win"
01:11:16,540;01:11:17,980;"Yeah, oh, yeah"
01:11:17,980;01:11:22,940;"Yeah, that's not about the money and apparently he knew about deviante items before he signed the deal too. So like"
01:11:22,940;01:11:24,940;"Okay, dude"
01:11:24,940;01:11:28,460;"What happened to this whole like I want to like keep the team together."
01:11:28,460;01:11:29,420;"Yeah, run it back."
01:11:29,420;01:11:30,140;"Strong team."
01:11:30,140;01:11:30,460;"Yeah."
01:11:30,460;01:11:31,100;"Oops."
01:11:31,100;01:11:32,220;"Dude, he's in."
01:11:32,220;01:11:33,180;"He's a dumb ass."
01:11:33,180;01:11:34,380;"What happens?"
01:11:34,380;01:11:35,100;"I Jordan love."
01:11:35,100;01:11:37,900;"Yeah, they got a trade in my bank."
01:11:37,900;01:11:39,100;"He's still there."
01:11:39,100;01:11:41,820;"Jordan loves the Seahawks."
01:11:41,820;01:11:42,460;"Wow."
01:11:42,460;01:11:43,260;"Grappolo 2."
01:11:43,260;01:11:44,140;"There's an idea."
01:11:44,140;01:11:45,020;"Jordan loves."
01:11:45,020;01:11:46,140;"Where does he go?"
01:11:46,140;01:11:47,180;"Seahawks."
01:11:47,180;01:11:47,900;"Seahawks."
01:11:47,900;01:11:48,540;"49ers."
01:11:48,540;01:11:50,780;"Now they're down."
01:11:50,780;01:11:51,580;"Kaepernick."
01:11:51,580;01:11:51,980;"Bucket."
01:11:51,980;01:11:52,220;"Bucket."
01:11:52,220;01:11:55,780;"in the years and the Bucks trade Brady of the 49ers."
01:11:55,780;01:11:57,420;"See, that's what I thought."
01:11:57,420;01:12:03,700;"I had heard that Brady wanted to sneak back into San Francisco area."
01:12:03,700;01:12:08,820;"He was on the Gronk where he's like fake retire and then get leverage to trade him."
01:12:08,820;01:12:09,820;"Yeah."
01:12:09,820;01:12:10,820;"Yeah."
01:12:10,820;01:12:11,820;"I mean, it might still happen."
01:12:11,820;01:12:12,820;"That'd be cool."
01:12:12,820;01:12:16,940;"I would much rather be good idea for San Francisco."
01:12:16,940;01:12:21,220;"I'd much rather Tom Brady come back and play for a different team than run it back with"
01:12:21,220;01:12:22,060;"the Bucks."
01:12:22,060;01:12:26,900;"I don't give a fuck about the bucks anymore. Like he's done that. I don't think he does either and Aaron's as a garbage coach"
01:12:26,900;01:12:30,140;"And if you get rid of if you trade Jimmy"
01:12:30,140;01:12:31,420;"Yeah"
01:12:31,420;01:12:37,340;"You give Trey Lance another year because it sounds like he's still pretty raw and then you give Brady a chance to play in front of his"
01:12:37,340;01:12:42,100;"His hometown like that seems like a win win win. Yeah"
01:12:42,100;01:12:49,980;"When let's make it happen and then Jordan love to the bucks with Baker may feel backing him up"
01:12:49,980;01:12:59,060;"I want Baker to go to Detroit because I think they just fit from a personality standpoint."
01:12:59,060;01:13:00,060;"That feels right actually."
01:13:00,060;01:13:01,060;"Yeah."
01:13:01,060;01:13:05,820;"Like on a fuck you tour and like a fan Williams or something as a head coach there."
01:13:05,820;01:13:08,300;"And Quinn, my channey caps off."
01:13:08,300;01:13:09,300;"That's exactly."
01:13:09,300;01:13:10,300;"You probably love them too."
01:13:10,300;01:13:11,300;"Oh yeah."
01:13:11,300;01:13:12,300;"Yeah."
01:13:12,300;01:13:13,300;"Okay."
01:13:13,300;01:13:14,660;"The whole state of Michigan would love them."
01:13:14,660;01:13:15,660;"Stan Campbell though."
01:13:15,660;01:13:16,780;"Dan Quinn's a guy from the family."
01:13:16,780;01:13:17,780;"That's a fan."
01:13:17,780;01:13:20,580;"All right, Steve, give me a best or worse."
01:13:20,580;01:13:26,160;"My worst is Dylan's fumble, where he got brushed by one guy's index finger and fumbled"
01:13:26,160;01:13:27,160;"it."
01:13:27,160;01:13:28,160;"Yeah, it was tough luck."
01:13:28,160;01:13:30,800;"Super soft versus a hard runner."
01:13:30,800;01:13:31,800;"That happened."
01:13:31,800;01:13:33,160;"It happened there once in a while."
01:13:33,160;01:13:35,960;"I've seen more fumbles this season from Corey Dillon and I remember."
01:13:35,960;01:13:39,320;"Like he's put the ball in the ground a few times."
01:13:39,320;01:13:44,240;"Is that one point Josh McCown had no Luke McCown?"
01:13:44,240;01:13:45,240;"Luke."
01:13:45,240;01:13:46,240;"Luke."
01:13:46,240;01:13:47,420;"completion to each team."
01:13:47,420;01:13:49,040;"- I am your father."
01:13:49,040;01:13:50,840;"- His first new completion is when I spread"
01:13:50,840;01:13:51,840;"in the ball around the fourth time."
01:13:51,840;01:13:53,840;"(laughing)"
01:13:53,840;01:13:56,240;"- Well, speaking of spreading the ball around,"
01:13:56,240;01:13:59,480;"this isn't my best, it's just a step."
01:13:59,480;01:14:04,480;"They showed a picture of the receivers"
01:14:04,480;01:14:05,880;"for the Patriots this season."
01:14:05,880;01:14:11,280;"Any guesses on who the leading receivers so far this year?"
01:14:11,280;01:14:14,400;"I'm a little surprised."
01:14:14,400;01:14:15,960;"- I saw this guy."
01:14:15,960;01:14:20,640;"David Patton. No, he is number two. 31 catches 556 yards."
01:14:20,640;01:14:26,520;"The on branch. He is two, three, four, fifth with 19 catch, two, six, two,"
01:14:26,520;01:14:28,160;"because he's been hurt for a few weeks."
01:14:28,160;01:14:32,800;"Daniel Graham, like Daniel Graham is third 24 catches, two, ninety six."
01:14:32,800;01:14:36,360;"Kevin Falk. Fourth, 23 catches, 200 yards, even"
01:14:36,360;01:14:39,040;"given."
01:14:39,040;01:14:41,640;"Givens is number one. 50 catches, seven and sixty."
01:14:41,640;01:14:43,080;"Yeah. So far in the season."
01:14:43,080;01:14:45,280;"I think Dion branch makes a comeback."
01:14:45,280;01:14:49,280;"50 catches already on the season. From 60."
01:14:49,280;01:14:51,280;"From Notre Dame."
01:14:51,280;01:14:53,280;"Given? He's from Notre Dame."
01:14:53,280;01:14:56,280;"Oh, I was saying in branch. Oh, yeah. Branch from Louisville."
01:14:56,280;01:14:59,280;"Troy Brown from Santa Renown."
01:14:59,280;01:15:05,280;"From Marshall. Marshall."
01:15:05,280;01:15:08,280;"Same as. So what I've decided I'm going to do."
01:15:08,280;01:15:13,280;"I'm going to try our damnedest to get Troy Brown in the"
01:15:13,280;01:15:16,160;"on the podcast by the end of this season."
01:15:16,160;01:15:17,920;"- Which is probably gonna be like 2026."
01:15:17,920;01:15:18,840;"- Try hard to understand this already Andy."
01:15:18,840;01:15:19,680;"- What the fuck?"
01:15:19,680;01:15:21,840;"- 2026 by the time that this season ends,"
01:15:21,840;01:15:24,240;"by the way that we're losing episodes."
01:15:24,240;01:15:28,120;"But yeah, so, and I wanna ask him"
01:15:28,120;01:15:31,640;"if he had anything to do with Randy Moss coming to New England"
01:15:31,640;01:15:33,600;"'cause they both went to Marshall."
01:15:33,600;01:15:34,920;"- Well, obviously you want Tread Brown."
01:15:34,920;01:15:36,080;"I thought that's the whole point of this thing"
01:15:36,080;01:15:37,480;"was to get Tread Brown on."
01:15:37,480;01:15:41,120;"- Yeah, but I'm putting a concerted effort into like"
01:15:41,120;01:15:42,520;"actually making this happen instead of reaching it."
01:15:42,520;01:15:43,360;"- He's touching it."
01:15:43,360;01:15:44,180;"- He's touching it."
01:15:44,180;01:15:46,040;"- Presuming to send him tweets."
01:15:46,040;01:15:48,040;"- Yeah, while the people that we've talked to"
01:15:48,040;01:15:49,440;"would be like, ""Oh yeah, I thought I'd trade"
01:15:49,440;01:15:51,320;"""but everyone's well, I'm gonna hound them."""
01:15:51,320;01:15:53,320;"- Until they actually reach out to them."
01:15:53,320;01:15:54,160;"- Wasn't even possible."
01:15:54,160;01:15:55,160;"- You know what they say, Andy?"
01:15:55,160;01:15:57,700;"It's not who you know, it's who you blow."
01:15:57,700;01:15:59,960;"(laughing)"
01:15:59,960;01:16:01,440;"- Well, you'll be back at some point, Craig."
01:16:01,440;01:16:03,860;"So I'll just coordinate that with you."
01:16:03,860;01:16:06,960;"- Is that why you had to get rid of the mustache?"
01:16:06,960;01:16:08,640;"(laughing)"
01:16:08,640;01:16:09,720;"- Hey, this is my joke."
01:16:09,720;01:16:11,160;"Let's not turn this around, okay?"
01:16:11,160;01:16:12,480;"(laughing)"
01:16:12,480;01:16:18,180;"too late. Oh, and just to round out the the rest of the receivers."
01:16:18,180;01:16:21,920;"After the Emperor is Troy Brown, 13 catches 145 Patrick past the full"
01:16:21,920;01:16:23,960;"back. 11 catches 103 yards."
01:16:23,960;01:16:27,320;"Yeah. 10 yards a catch. Patrick passes with you."
01:16:27,320;01:16:29,000;"Not easy. He's not too shabby."
01:16:29,000;01:16:33,080;"So my best is Troy Brown had an interception this game."
01:16:33,080;01:16:36,200;"My worst is that I didn't watch long enough to see it."
01:16:36,200;01:16:37,920;"So I'm gonna have to go back and finish watching this game."
01:16:37,920;01:16:39,520;"Stupid fucking blowout."
01:16:39,520;01:16:42,040;"So there's a there's a punt return."
01:16:42,040;01:16:45,040;"You know one of those ones where the guy just throws his trade off and he just like"
01:16:45,040;01:16:51,280;"Fuck it his lap. Yeah. Hey, there's that just after that who better to catch a punt return exactly"
01:16:51,280;01:16:54,400;"The Troy Brown am I right? Oh?"
01:16:54,400;01:16:57,520;"Right"
01:16:57,520;01:16:59,520;"You right"
01:16:59,520;01:17:02,820;"Then Troy fits Gerald's brow"
01:17:02,820;01:17:08,280;"And you really missed an opportunity not naming your son Chadwick Pennington"
01:17:10,720;01:17:12,720;"Why would I name him after Chad Pennington?"
01:17:12,720;01:17:17,720;"Because the chat penning thing was legit. We've talked about this. Yeah, but I'm not named my kid after Chad Pennington"
01:17:17,720;01:17:22,120;"I'm not named my kid after a jet. That's fucked up. I'm so I am"
01:17:22,120;01:17:25,080;"He was a jet. He was a bit offended"
01:17:25,080;01:17:32,840;"He is the reason the pages miss the playoffs those two those two years the only time the pages of miss the playoffs is because of"
01:17:32,840;01:17:34,840;"It's out of respect. No"
01:17:35,600;01:17:42,600;"That's fucked up Steven. I may as well name him Adolf Hitler out of respect because fucking I don't know like that's just stupid"
01:17:42,600;01:17:45,600;"Because he was such a scary fall in World War two"
01:17:45,600;01:17:59,120;"I will say I did fight hard for you guys. I did fight hard for Troy is at least a middle name, but"
01:17:59,120;01:18:01,560;"Didn't happen"
01:18:01,560;01:18:04,520;"So it's tough. Yes"
01:18:04,520;01:18:05,360;"- Yes."
01:18:05,360;01:18:08,440;"I'm naming my kid Genghis Khan."
01:18:08,440;01:18:10,780;"(indistinct)"
01:18:10,780;01:18:12,480;"- He's my middle name idea."
01:18:12,480;01:18:13,320;"- Nice people are."
01:18:13,320;01:18:14,720;"- What's your middle name?"
01:18:14,720;01:18:15,840;"What is it?"
01:18:15,840;01:18:17,000;"- What's your middle name?"
01:18:17,000;01:18:18,880;"- What?"
01:18:18,880;01:18:21,760;"- You make their middle name, what's your middle name?"
01:18:21,760;01:18:23,440;"So then when the kid is in elementary school"
01:18:23,440;01:18:24,560;"and gets asked what's your middle name,"
01:18:24,560;01:18:26,240;"they say what's your middle name?"
01:18:26,240;01:18:27,440;"And they say my middle name is David."
01:18:27,440;01:18:28,280;"What's your middle name?"
01:18:28,280;01:18:29,360;"That's what's your middle name?"
01:18:29,360;01:18:32,200;"(indistinct)"
01:18:33,360;01:18:35,840;"- What about if it was just like who?"
01:18:35,840;01:18:36,840;"- Yeah. - What's your middle name?"
01:18:36,840;01:18:37,840;"Who?"
01:18:37,840;01:18:39,600;"- I also thought about shades of brown,"
01:18:39,600;01:18:42,920;"like nut, hazel, light or dark."
01:18:42,920;01:18:45,000;"- Hmm, poopy?"
01:18:45,000;01:18:46,520;"- Yeah."
01:18:46,520;01:18:48,280;"- Gerald Poopy Brown."
01:18:48,280;01:18:49,120;"- Oak."
01:18:49,120;01:18:50,680;"- Oh, all right."
01:18:50,680;01:18:53,920;"Do you guys have any other,"
01:18:53,920;01:18:56,000;"anything else you'd like to talk about?"
01:18:56,000;01:18:59,160;"- Yeah, go US men, watch them tonight, 10 PM."
01:18:59,160;01:19:00,000;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:19:00,000;01:19:01,680;"- All right, okay."
01:19:01,680;01:19:03,440;"accidentally eight tacos for dinner."
01:19:03,440;01:19:04,680;"I fucking blow it."
01:19:04,680;01:19:07,200;"Craig, so it's your fault."
01:19:07,200;01:19:08,960;"But Italy is out of the World Cup"
01:19:08,960;01:19:09,840;"'cause they lost the--"
01:19:09,840;01:19:11,200;"- The North Macedonia."
01:19:11,200;01:19:12,040;"- Correct."
01:19:12,040;01:19:14,400;"So there's your soccer talk for the day."
01:19:14,400;01:19:15,240;"- Yep."
01:19:15,240;01:19:16,440;"- All right, next week."
01:19:16,440;01:19:18,560;"So much better than South Macedonia."
01:19:18,560;01:19:19,940;"- Oh, fuck South Macedonia."
01:19:19,940;01:19:21,240;"(laughing)"
01:19:21,240;01:19:22,080;"- Warsed."
01:19:22,080;01:19:22,960;"- Why would you call it your tea?"
01:19:22,960;01:19:25,640;"Why a country in North Macedonia is no--"
01:19:25,640;01:19:27,680;"There's no South, there's no east and the west."
01:19:27,680;01:19:28,680;"(laughing)"
01:19:28,680;01:19:30,800;"Right, call Macedonia."
01:19:30,800;01:19:32,240;"Yeah, just like West Virginia."
01:19:32,240;01:19:34,480;"- But Virginia is dead."
01:19:34,480;01:19:35,320;"- Not only it, not only it is."
01:19:35,320;01:19:37,200;"- But Virginia is dead, at least got Virginia."
01:19:37,200;01:19:40,520;"- But yeah, but you don't name a whole other state West Virginia"
01:19:40,520;01:19:43,200;"because it's not like there's an East Virginia,"
01:19:43,200;01:19:44,920;"it's just Virginia."
01:19:44,920;01:19:47,240;"- Well, you need to distinguish it from Virginia."
01:19:47,240;01:19:50,160;"- But Virginia already has a West."
01:19:50,160;01:19:52,040;"So what if you're in Western Virginia"
01:19:52,040;01:19:55,080;"and then you cross the border to West Virginia?"
01:19:55,080;01:19:56,520;"That's fucking confusing."
01:19:56,520;01:19:58,800;"And there's not enough schools in either of those states"
01:19:58,800;01:20:00,900;"for that to work at all."
01:20:00,900;01:20:03,420;"Their educational funding is horrible."
01:20:03,420;01:20:04,700;"- How do you know that?"
01:20:04,700;01:20:05,900;"- Yeah, what do you mean?"
01:20:05,900;01:20:08,300;"Northern Virginia has like when the richest zip codes"
01:20:08,300;01:20:10,180;"in the entire country."
01:20:10,180;01:20:11,020;"- And Western Virginia."
01:20:11,020;01:20:12,980;"- I'm talking Western Virginia."
01:20:12,980;01:20:15,140;"- One of the highest struggle overdoses."
01:20:15,140;01:20:15,980;"- Exactly."
01:20:15,980;01:20:20,980;"- The highest methamphetamine use per capita in the country."
01:20:20,980;01:20:22,740;"- No."
01:20:22,740;01:20:23,660;"- No."
01:20:23,660;01:20:25,420;"- No, that's Manchester."
01:20:25,420;01:20:26,260;"- It's not the math."
01:20:26,260;01:20:27,100;"- That's Manchester."
01:20:27,100;01:20:27,940;"- I'm not sure."
01:20:27,940;01:20:28,760;"- I'm not sure."
01:20:28,760;01:20:29,600;"- I don't know."
01:20:29,600;01:20:31,100;"- No, we have a..."
01:20:31,100;01:20:34,200;"- Best Chester?"
01:20:34,200;01:20:35,040;"- No, what's his name?"
01:20:35,040;01:20:35,880;"- Me and B."
01:20:35,880;01:20:36,720;"- Chest hair."
01:20:36,720;01:20:39,560;"- What's the name?"
01:20:39,560;01:20:40,400;"- Every animal."
01:20:40,400;01:20:41,240;"- I know what it is, Andy."
01:20:41,240;01:20:43,220;"You're talking about Manchganistan."
01:20:43,220;01:20:45,500;"(laughs)"
01:20:45,500;01:20:47,280;"- I'm not talking about Manchganistan very much,"
01:20:47,280;01:20:48,280;"but yes."
01:20:48,280;01:20:49,380;"- Oh, no, it's not."
01:20:49,380;01:20:53,760;"- Oh, what's their drug of choice though in Manchester?"
01:20:53,760;01:20:55,060;"- Like, uh,"
01:20:55,060;01:20:55,900;"- Fentanyl."
01:20:55,900;01:20:56,740;"- Fentanyl."
01:20:56,740;01:21:00,340;"Yeah, the highest fentanyl overdose per capita."
01:21:00,340;01:21:02,340;"Thanks a lot, Sacklers."
01:21:02,340;01:21:03,940;"Yeah, fucking missiles."
01:21:03,940;01:21:05,540;"Yeah."
01:21:05,540;01:21:07,540;"At least they can keep their money though, huh?"
01:21:07,540;01:21:08,340;"Yeah."
01:21:08,340;01:21:09,740;"Speaking of keeping their money,"
01:21:09,740;01:21:11,740;"Paige is playing with House money."
01:21:11,740;01:21:13,440;"They're now 11 and 1."
01:21:13,440;01:21:14,940;"Next week they are..."
01:21:14,940;01:21:16,540;"I thought you were going to make a free agency joke."
01:21:16,540;01:21:18,140;"That would have been where it was at."
01:21:18,140;01:21:19,140;"Yeah, well, I should have."
01:21:19,140;01:21:20,140;"But, you know, because they're..."
01:21:20,140;01:21:21,640;"I'm trying to bring it back to 2004"
01:21:21,640;01:21:23,940;"because we haven't talked much about that this week."
01:21:23,940;01:21:26,140;"And our listener is going to be pissed"
01:21:26,140;01:21:31,980;"All one of the we're talking about the Browns for good. We did a little bit, but that blowout that"
01:21:31,980;01:21:33,820;"Shootout win"
01:21:33,820;01:21:36,700;"Cincinnati bangles winners of that come to Foxboro"
01:21:36,700;01:21:38,460;"To play the new England Patriots"
01:21:38,460;01:21:40,460;"So we'll see we get both teams back to back"
01:21:40,460;01:21:45,420;"And we'll see if they can fare better than the Cleveland Browns who brown themselves"
01:21:45,420;01:21:49,100;"Right Greg Brown their pants the what's the receivers name?"

01:22:00,660;01:22:02,060;"Who's the crazy mama?"
01:22:02,060;01:22:03,660;"Corey Dylan's revenge game."
01:22:03,660;01:22:05,660;"Oh, this is a Corey Dylan revenge game."
01:22:05,660;01:22:10,560;"So we'll see how that works out next week on the Patriots"
01:22:10,560;01:22:15,560;"Dan C. Parkes. T-Day. - Yeah, it's a real hater."
01:22:15,560;01:22:18,160;"Who's your mama? (laughs)"

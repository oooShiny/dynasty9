00:00,000;00:06,720;This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,
00:06,720;00:10,920;you have the choice not to. My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying
00:10,920;00:15,720;to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid. You still want to listen? Go right
00:15,720;00:22,080;ahead. I am not your mother.
00:22,080;00:27,700;Welcome back to the Patriots Dynasty podcast. I'm your host, Andy Brown. We are the podcast
00:27,700;00:30,940;that is going back and rewatching every game of the
00:30,940;00:34,260;Dynasty era Patriots. We are we've made it through the 2004
00:34,260;00:38,180;regular season. And we are getting to I'd say one of my
00:38,180;00:44,380;sneaky favorite games, the 2004 AFC Championship game, Patriots
00:44,380;00:50,000;traveling to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the old ketchup
00:50,000;00:55,860;bottle itself. Rest in peace. Right? Yeah. But with me today,
00:56,380;01:02,140;As always, my trusty brothers, Steve Brown, all the way from Virginia.
01:02,140;01:03,540;Going on, Steve.
01:03,540;01:05,780;This is, this is exciting.
01:05,780;01:08,820;This isn't just a podcast where we do games with names.
01:08,820;01:10,460;We do every game, including the games.
01:10,460;01:11,420;That's right.
01:11,420;01:12,340;We'll get to that.
01:12,340;01:13,020;Yeah.
01:13,020;01:13,700;Fucking.
01:13,700;01:14,940;Yeah.
01:14,940;01:16,180;So Greg is also here.
01:16,180;01:16,980;Greg, how are you doing?
01:16,980;01:18,180;I'm doing great.
01:18,180;01:19,220;Just dandy.
01:19,220;01:19,980;Yeah.
01:19,980;01:21,900;Only two games left guys.
01:21,900;01:24,180;Two games left.
01:24,180;01:24,740;Yeah.
01:24,740;01:27,820;We're stopping after the third Super Bowl, right?
01:27,820;01:28,820;Oh, is that right?
01:28,820;01:29,820;Yeah.
01:29,820;01:30,820;So then one game left?
01:30,820;01:32,780;I've seen what I need to see.
01:32,780;01:37,460;We'll pick this back up in 2016-ish.
01:37,460;01:38,460;Yeah.
01:38,460;01:39,460;Mm-hmm.
01:39,460;01:41,820;I mean, that is one way of doing it.
01:41,820;01:45,940;But then everything I've set up to this would be a lie, and we can't do that to people.
01:45,940;01:46,940;Should we trash that on me?
01:46,940;01:47,940;I think we should.
01:47,940;01:48,940;Well, we're in a topic.
01:48,940;01:49,940;Yeah.
01:49,940;01:50,940;Yeah.
01:50,940;01:56,480;Steve, you want to give your thoughts on Julian Elnold or explain what's happening for those
01:56,480;01:57,720;that aren't in the know?
01:57,720;01:59,400;Oh, you think I'm in the know?
01:59,400;02:02,040;I don't know anything.
02:02,040;02:03,040;You came in hot with that.
02:03,040;02:04,040;I figured you do.
02:04,040;02:05,040;I was seeing Greg up.
02:05,040;02:07,000;I thought it would trigger him.
02:07,000;02:10,680;It did trigger him, but he kept it under control there for a little bit.
02:10,680;02:11,680;That's a surprise.
02:11,680;02:13,040;Greg, are you feeling all right?
02:13,040;02:14,440;Well, it's not just that one.
02:14,440;02:16,000;There's another one too.
02:16,000;02:17,000;Really?
02:17,000;02:18,000;Yeah.
02:18,000;02:19,000;See, I am not in the know.
02:19,000;02:20,000;I just know about the one.
02:20,000;02:30,840;Greg, can I catch us up? Well, I was watching the preseason game and like halftime, they
02:30,840;02:40,400;did like legitimately like a 15 minute segment on a podcast, Pats from the Past. Yeah. And
02:40,400;02:43,820;basically that it's like the same thing as what we're doing. They're like, do you want
02:43,820;02:50,300;go back and relive all the greatest Patriots memories. And I was like, yeah, do I like
02:50,300;02:55,180;had all these guys got infused with blood. So with Will Fork, all these guys, it's like,
02:55,180;03:00,540;this is bullshit. So you know, one of the guys that does that, right, or used to do it, Brian
03:00,540;03:06,700;Morry, we've had him on the podcast. Yeah, Greg, the guy that runs the Patriots Hall of Fame.
03:06,700;03:13,580;He talked about that podcast on our podcast. Okay. So we already had the
03:13,580;03:18,660;idea. Yeah, they've been doing it before. All they do is interviews with players. So
03:18,660;03:23,780;we're actually approaching on now. Yeah, we're encroaching on their shit by interviewing
03:23,780;03:29,900;people like Kevin Falk and Matt Chatham. What's that? What's that white girl comedian that
03:29,900;03:34,940;steals all jokes? The one that Amy Schumer. Yeah, we're getting Amy Schumer right now,
03:34,940;03:39,140;guys. We are Amy Schumer right now. We're like the fucking Dave Chappelle. They're the
03:39,140;03:40,940;We did this first.
03:40,940;03:43,940;Well, let's talk about something we did do first.
03:43,940;03:47,740;Greg, you came up with, I think it's actually quite a good,
03:47,740;03:51,240;I mean, especially for you, idea in terms of rating these games.
03:51,240;03:54,700;Because we were doing it by Lombardi trophies.
03:54,700;03:56,140;So out of six Lombardis, how many?
03:56,140;03:57,340;And I think that still works.
03:57,340;04:00,500;But you came up with your own system.
04:00,500;04:02,740;Remind me exactly what it was.
04:02,740;04:04,340;I remember all of them.
04:04,340;04:05,340;Well, some of them.
04:05,340;04:07,100;I guess the take home point is one of them
04:07,100;04:15,980;was the name game where you can say three words and define a game like snowball, right?
04:15,980;04:22,180;We all know what game that is. It has a name to it. That's right. Yes. I had three words
04:22,180;04:31,020;or less. Right. I have the snowball Andy. Go fuck yourself. And apparently Edelman's
04:31,020;04:35,700;got his fucking nose to the ground here. Yeah. What's, what's his podcast called? I
04:35,700;04:38,860;I don't know. It's something like names with names.
04:38,860;04:39,800;Games with names.
04:39,800;04:41,580;Games and names.
04:41,580;04:42,900;Right. That's what Schumer does.
04:42,900;04:45,300;She takes the joke and she just like makes it worse.
04:45,300;04:47,700;- The brain does the words and then it's a new joke.
04:47,700;04:49,180;- To make it not as good.
04:49,180;04:50,020;- Yeah.
04:50,020;04:51,740;- I feel like Ellermann might get better guests though,
04:51,740;04:52,580;than we have.
04:52,580;04:55,980;- You would think, but his first episode that came out,
04:55,980;04:58,740;the first game with names that they did,
04:58,740;05:00,800;the helmet catch.
05:00,800;05:02,660;- Oh, geez.
05:02,660;05:04,740;- With guest Eli Manning.
05:04,740;05:06,340;Whoa. What are you doing?
05:06,340;05:08,060;It's rather disrespectful.
05:08,060;05:11,100;And like, what audience are you trying to get with that?
05:11,100;05:13,500;Well, not not New England audience.
05:13,500;05:15,100;I guess he already has that, right?
05:15,100;05:17,540;Did you listen to it, Andy? No.
05:17,540;05:20,180;I'm refusing to listen to his podcast until he comes on ours.
05:20,180;05:24,540;So I'm going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to find Greg's
05:24,540;05:27,180;when he announced his rating system.
05:27,180;05:29,780;And I'll share it with you.
05:29,780;05:31,980;Just fucking remember what it is.
05:31,980;05:35,460;And I'm going to tweet that at Julian Edelman and all of their
05:35,460;05:39,460;podcast related accounts until he comes on the podcast. So
05:39,460;05:42,820;pair with a bunch of highlights too. So you can just this is the
05:42,820;05:43,860;word from Kevin fall.
05:43,860;05:47,660;Yeah. Well, yeah, no, we're taking a different approach with
05:47,660;05:51,300;it with Julian Edelman. We're going to shame him into coming
05:51,300;05:52,460;on the podcast instead of
05:52,460;05:54,940;only is going to work in is no shame on Twitter, dude.
05:54,940;05:59,420;Well, say it's like the point of Twitter is you just say things
05:59,420;06:00,180;without shame.
06:00,180;06:01,580;We shall say
06:01,700;06:08,820;just a big old sess not corporate Twitter though he's part of corporate Twitter he is oh yeah he's
06:08,820;06:13,940;all about branding and all that stuff he is a brander yeah and his podcast is a big brand
06:13,940;06:17,940;you can tell it's a lot of money behind they have a bunch of fancy graphics and shit
06:17,940;06:24,740;I bet there are fancy graphics Andy yeah I mean it's the same sound bite from mom that he's been
06:24,740;06:30,340;been using for fucking three and a half years now. Naughty boy, right?
06:30,340;06:30,940;That's right.
06:30,940;06:34,940;Very naughty. Brilliant.
06:34,940;06:38,340;They're all new ones. Don't you Andy that we haven't heard yet?
06:38,340;06:40,340;Yeah, we're going to save those.
06:40,340;06:41,340;Okay.
06:41,340;06:42,740;But yeah, those will be coming up.
06:42,740;06:46,540;Don't you worry about it, but speaking of things we haven't talked
06:46,540;06:49,240;about talk about these Steelers.
06:49,240;06:52,540;Well, this is a let's talk about this rate this game that if
06:52,540;06:53,940;we're on the topic of the rating system.
06:53,940;06:55,540;Yes, this is.
06:55,540;06:57,260;It is a name, a hidden gem, right?
06:57,260;06:58,580;Because that was one of the.
06:58,580;07:01,180;Yeah, that was right below name game.
07:01,180;07:03,660;What would you call it?
07:03,660;07:05,220;The flu game.
07:05,220;07:08,020;Oh, that's not bad.
07:08,020;07:10,180;I don't know the Brady flu game.
07:10,180;07:12,140;OK, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
07:12,140;07:14,900;I think you got to put a poll out there
07:14,900;07:16,940;and people can recognize what game it is.
07:16,940;07:18,260;OK, all right.
07:18,260;07:19,060;I will do that. Yeah.
07:19,060;07:23,340;Let me let me make note of that because I have ADHD
07:23,340;07:25,340;And I will forget if I don't.
07:25,340;07:26,980;You know, look that sick.
07:26,980;07:27,880;He did not look sick.
07:27,880;07:28,940;He did not look at all.
07:28,940;07:30,680;And this burger looked sick.
07:30,680;07:33,420;Yeah, but not the good kind of sick, the bad kind of sick,
07:33,420;07:36,080;the flu kind of sick hung over.
07:36,080;07:41,920;To spend too much time in the barroom bathrooms.
07:41,920;07:43,620;Kind of sick.
07:43,620;07:47,320;To fire.
07:47,320;07:49,260;No, that's not fair game.
07:49,260;07:53,240;That's maybe it was not too long after this airing of this here.
07:53,240;07:57,960;He was flying on top of the world, but I did remember a little differently. I remember,
07:57,960;08:04,200;I thought Big Ben was like, lighten it up this year. But they were talking in the game that
08:04,200;08:07,400;he hadn't, he'd really cooled off during the season.
08:07,400;08:16,760;Exactly. Yeah. He, it was one of those things where he hadn't lost, but it's almost like
08:16,760;08:24,040;defenses had figured him out at this point. And so his his splits, I think I have him
08:24,040;08:30,840;somewhere. His splits were like, not great. Second, how many is split in the splits? All right.
08:30,840;08:35,240;Let's hear some fucking splits. Do you want some splits? All right. Let me,
08:35,240;08:38,600;I'm pretty sure I took a screenshot of this. So watch this. Okay. Here you go. Hitting the
08:38,600;08:45,400;rookie wall this season. First 11 games completion percentage 67.7 not too shabby last five games,
08:45,400;08:52,280;59.4 not so great touchdown interception ratio 14 to 6 first 11 games now it's 4 and 9
08:52,280;08:59,560;his last one has four touchdowns nine interceptions so his passer rating went from 103.2 to 65.7
08:59,560;09:07,400;and they also had i thought was actually kind of a impressive stat for um you know who are the
09:07,400;09:14,680;commentators in this gym dance yeah that was a film yeah i just made it up um
09:14,680;09:18,880;Yeah, so they came out and said that because.
09:18,880;09:22,640;Ross's burgers first pass in this game was like a third play
09:22,640;09:25,440;of the game was an interception to.
09:25,440;09:28,520;Greg Brown Jean Wilson Eugene.
09:28,520;09:33,280;And so that was the first throw of the game for him was
09:33,280;09:37,080;interception and they said in seven of his 15 games that he's
09:37,080;09:39,960;played, he's been picked off within the first four throws of
09:39,960;09:40,360;the game.
09:42,080;09:44,360;Which is kind of bananas.
09:44,360;09:47,480;And he also has eight interceptions in his last 87 attempts.
09:47,480;09:48,620;So he has cooled off.
09:48,620;09:50,120;That is bad.
09:50,120;09:53,180;He also won eight to three picks in this game.
09:53,180;09:55,100;Should have shown from five.
09:55,100;09:56,040;Oh yeah.
09:56,040;10:00,260;I wrote down that, um, uh, uh, a Sante Samuel was dropping interceptions
10:00,260;10:03,680;like he's practicing for the giant super bowl because he could have
10:03,680;10:05,480;had three easily by himself.
10:05,480;10:07,980;And this first one was one of them.
10:07,980;10:11,180;It hit him right in the hands and he bobbled it straight up in the air,
10:11,180;10:13,820;fell over and Eugene Wilson dove and caught it.
10:13,820;10:17,260;Rob Thiberg has a really bad throws in this game,
10:17,260;10:22,740;but he, but he still hasn't lost the game in 27 games dating back to college.
10:22,740;10:26,100;Right. Yeah. Where'd you go to college, Steve?
10:26,100;10:28,460;Miami of Ohio.
10:28,460;10:30,140;Yeah. The shitty Miami.
10:30,140;10:34,580;Steve nicely done. I did not think you were getting that.
10:34,580;10:36,420;You would go to Miami of Ohio.
10:36,420;10:39,460;You probably thought it was the other Miami. He's like, yeah, he definitely did.
10:40,140;10:42,220;Hey guys, we're going to university. I'm a heavy dude.
10:42,220;10:45,580;I'm going to get so many bitches there. It's going to be party nonstop.
10:45,580;10:47,660;Guys, where's the beach?
10:47,660;10:52,580;Went to the U has some dude in his neighborhood go accidentally to Miami,
10:52,580;10:56,180;Ohio and apply and accepted and then had to do his freshman year there before he
10:56,180;10:57,020;transferred.
10:57,020;11:01,780;I bet that happens all the time. Yeah. Oh my God.
11:01,780;11:07,780;Oh also Ben Ross burgers first ever throw in his first ever start was an
11:07,780;11:11,700;interception. So true to form. Good throw in peace.
11:11,700;11:12,700;Rookie of the year.
11:12,700;11:17,700;Was it he was officially? Yeah. Yeah. Offensive rookie of the
11:17,700;11:18,100;year.
11:18,100;11:23,700;But I think the criticism that he wasn't getting is a lot that
11:23,700;11:28,500;you see the criticism that Mack Jones got last year as a rookie.
11:28,500;11:33,620;Because the Steelers team had I think it was a second ranked
11:33,660;11:38,780;rushing offense in the league because they had the deuce is
11:38,780;11:42,620;loose. Exactly. So they had deuce Staley, who started off the
11:42,620;11:47,300;season as a starter because Betis was getting old and actually
11:47,300;11:50,660;got hurt in the first Patriots game week eight on Halloween.
11:50,660;11:56,700;When the Steelers blew the doors off the pads. And then the
11:56,700;12:01,140;bet the bus drone Betis was, you know, rested and healthy for
12:01,140;12:03,900;first half of the season. So he started running really well. So
12:03,900;12:06,780;they showed some stat where do Staley had the majority of the
12:06,780;12:10,300;yards, but he had one touchdown in the season and Jerome
12:10,300;12:12,940;Betis had like a quarter of the yards that he had, but he had
12:12,940;12:15,300;14 rushing touchdowns on the season.
12:15,300;12:16,860;That makes sense.
12:16,860;12:19,660;Right? Exactly. Yeah. And then even the commoners like most of
12:19,660;12:23,060;those touchdowns are probably within one yard. It was that
12:23,060;12:23,500;season.
12:23,500;12:26,300;Yeah, fantasy honors nightmare.
12:26,300;12:28,740;Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only either of those.
12:29,180;12:31,860;Do Staley sees a on hard knocks this year.
12:31,860;12:33,780;Is he coaches?
12:33,780;12:35,400;A fucking psychopath, dude.
12:35,400;12:36,980;Color me short.
12:36,980;12:41,700;The whole, the whole staff of the lions is all ex players.
12:41,700;12:44,280;It's like, remember Aaron Glen from the jets.
12:44,280;12:47,260;Oh, the one that Mike Mel thought was in the hall of fame.
12:47,260;12:47,460;Yeah.
12:47,460;12:50,700;He's there still time.
12:50,700;12:52,820;Yeah.
12:52,820;12:53,700;Could get him for coaching.
12:53,700;12:54,260;Yeah.
12:54,260;12:55,740;He's the defensive coordinator.
12:55,740;12:58,340;And then I think do Staley is the offensive coordinator.
12:58,580;13:02,340;Oh God, that team is either going to be, I think it's going to be exciting to watch.
13:02,340;13:02,860;Yeah.
13:02,860;13:08,180;I think they're probably going to be like the nineties Cowboys where they're just
13:08,180;13:12,620;the most penalized team or not, not the Cowboys, the, um, the Raiders, the most
13:12,620;13:14,420;penalized team, but don't give a fuck about it.
13:14,420;13:16,300;They're Dan Campbell rules.
13:16,300;13:19,740;He is batshit insane, like legitimately insane.
13:19,740;13:20,700;He's awesome.
13:20,700;13:26,940;It's probably a terrible coach, but well, he gave his, he gave his players a
13:26,940;13:31,380;players only practice the other day. Like you set all the coaches home and just like
13:31,380;13:34,860;sat there and watch from the bleachers or something and just like let them practice
13:34,860;13:35,860;themselves.
13:35,860;13:41,700;Yeah, they probably just did like tick tock dances all practice and shit. Yeah, but imagine
13:41,700;13:45,700;what they're gonna do when they score a touchdown. Those celebrations, those choreographed celebrations
13:45,700;13:47,740;are gonna be on point.
13:47,740;13:50,740;That's you're implying that they're gonna score touchdowns this year, Andy.
13:50,740;13:53,460;Hey, everybody gets lucky.
13:53,460;13:54,620;- What is the least amount of touchdowns
13:54,620;13:55,860;the team has ever scored?
13:55,860;13:58,220;- I don't know.
13:58,220;13:59,060;- I don't either.
13:59,060;13:59,980;I'm asking the stat check guy,
13:59,980;14:02,340;but he's not reaching for his computer
14:02,340;14:03,780;so I guess I don't even know.
14:03,780;14:07,260;If you know, tweet at us and let us know
14:07,260;14:10,300;what the least amount of touchdowns ever scored was.
14:10,300;14:12,820;- I bet Julian never did.
14:12,820;14:14,620;- I bet it was like one of those like 60s.
14:14,620;14:15,580;- His producer knows.
14:15,580;14:16,980;- We need a producer.
14:16,980;14:18,180;- We do need a producer.
14:18,180;14:20,860;But we have an intern.
14:20,860;14:22,980;We should probably have him on in the background
14:22,980;14:26,440;looking to shut up. We'll have him on at some point.
14:26,440;14:30,320;No front center. All right. Yeah. Get Tim on here.
14:30,320;14:35,720;We will a week one of 2005 is when you can look forward to seeing Tim on the
14:35,720;14:40,840;shout out Tim shout out Tim. All right. Uh, let's see other Steelers of note.
14:40,840;14:46,480;Are there any number one, Rick defense in the league points and yards.
14:46,480;14:49,480;Correct. Yep. Absolute steel curtain sort of thing.
14:50,880;14:51,720;against the run, right?
14:51,720;14:56,480;Real good against the run. Yeah. Um, which you could see in this game, uh,
14:56,480;14:58,080;and actually the last time the Patriots played them,
14:58,080;15:03,360;they tied the record for least amounts of rushing attempts in a game
15:03,360;15:06,320;with six because
15:06,320;15:10,280;it's something like that. Yeah. Cause Corey Dillon was injured for that game.
15:10,280;15:15,200;So they were back in this one. And I have to say, um,
15:15,200;15:17,880;I enjoyed this game so much. I kind of watch it twice.
15:18,880;15:23,440;I watched the regular version on YouTube, and then I also watched the three games of glory version.
15:23,440;15:30,920;And the, the, you know, the NFL films, like narrator guy who does it was throwing some bombs.
15:30,920;15:32,840;Like it was here.
15:32,840;15:33,520;Let me, uh,
15:33,520;15:35,080;I didn't say anything.
15:35,080;15:39,240;And it was actually the video quality in the three games of glory is significantly.
15:39,240;15:39,980;So good.
15:39,980;15:40,200;Yeah.
15:40,200;15:41,040;It's like, it's high def.
15:41,040;15:41,800;Oh yeah.
15:41,800;15:47,680;Um, so this is talking about the, uh, halftime, like going into
15:47,680;15:49,040;halftime with the Steelers.
15:49,040;15:53,840;So for the defending world champion, the Steelers predicted they would beat the
15:53,840;15:59,980;stuffing out of the Patriots, but with a 21 point lead, it was the Patriots doing
15:59,980;16:00,640;the stuffing.
16:00,640;16:03,040;Cheers.
16:03,040;16:06,000;Oh, she stayed on the fucking cutting room floor.
16:06,000;16:08,120;Absolutely not.
16:08,120;16:09,520;This is amazing.
16:09,520;16:11,080;The Steelers like a Thanksgiving turkey.
16:11,080;16:12,880;Gobble, gobble, bitch.
16:12,880;16:17,240;It was the Steelers getting pounded in the ass.
16:17,240;16:22,240;And this is the one that triggered my memory.
16:22,240;16:26,640;It was, for those that can't see it, because this is obviously an audio medium.
16:26,640;16:31,400;Others, it's a, the video is a Steelers fan holding a sign that says Corey who?
16:31,400;16:33,920;Because Corey Dillon didn't play in the last game.
16:33,920;16:35,320;And this is the voiceover.
16:35,320;16:38,800;On Halloween, Pittsburgh didn't get a glimpse of Corey Dillon.
16:38,800;16:44,680;Now, after a long hard look, they will likely remember his last name.
16:44,680;16:48,140;[MUSIC]
16:48,140;16:50,680;>> You guys just spell out CBS on a sign, too.
16:50,680;16:52,600;I can't make it out, it's like Cory better or something.
16:52,600;16:55,160;>> Yeah, stay home or something, yeah.
16:55,160;16:58,960;>> Then this was, I think, in the fourth quarter.
16:58,960;17:04,360;The Patriots up by two touchdowns and the Steelers got sick.
17:04,360;17:08,200;>> Inexplicably, the Steelers continued to preem,
17:08,200;17:10,920;despite sitting on a 14-point deficit.
17:10,920;17:12,840;Patriots now taking their time.
17:12,840;17:15,120;- That sounds about right.
17:15,120;17:19,240;- Which we've seen in past games with like the Steelers
17:19,240;17:20,760;getting their doors blown off by the Patriots.
17:20,760;17:24,160;I think like whatever that week one game was in 2003,
17:24,160;17:27,520;maybe where the Patriots came out and stomped them or 2002.
17:27,520;17:28,880;After yeah, after it was 2002,
17:28,880;17:33,160;after the after the Patriots beat him in Pittsburgh
17:33,160;17:35,680;the year before, they opened the season against them
17:35,680;17:36,800;and the Patriots blew their doors off
17:36,800;17:39,920;and they were still like celebrating tackles for loss
17:39,920;17:41,240;and something like in the fourth quarter.
17:41,240;17:42,480;- It's Joey Porter.
17:42,480;17:44,520;Yeah, yeah, that's right. It was Joey Porter. Yeah.
17:44,520;17:47,460;He's an idiot, but the whole team is like that. Oh yeah.
17:47,460;17:49,140;Specifically Joey Porter.
17:49,140;17:54,660;And they, uh, they actually had James Farrier mic'd up for this game.
17:54,660;17:59,400;And he, like, he, you could just like at the beginning was so hyped and he was
17:59,400;18:03,360;obviously like the, the type of guy who was super hyped, like all the time,
18:03,360;18:07,020;you know, he was like the hype guy for the team. Um, like the, you know,
18:07,020;18:11,660;the energy guy and like even at halftime, he was like, guys, we can't go out like
18:11,660;18:13,420;this, this isn't how it's going to end.
18:13,420;18:16,780;They came out and got stomped in second half too.
18:16,780;18:20,540;And he was just like, you could just like slowly see him kind of melting
18:20,540;18:21,860;down throughout the entire game.
18:21,860;18:22,780;It was fantastic.
18:22,780;18:24,460;It was funny to watch him shut the fuck up.
18:24,460;18:24,700;Yeah.
18:24,700;18:28,980;Just like getting less and less enthusiastic all the way through,
18:28,980;18:31,100;which you could tell is really hard for him.
18:31,100;18:33,620;Is this Troy Paul Amalu rookie year?
18:33,620;18:35,740;Because the second year.
18:35,740;18:38,260;Yeah, I thought they said it was his rookie year and going to
18:38,260;18:39,100;- It's a second.
18:39,100;18:39,920;- It's a second.
18:39,920;18:40,760;- It's a second.
18:40,760;18:43,100;- He was rookie of the year last year, right?
18:43,100;18:44,100;- Something like that.
18:44,100;18:46,020;- I think he was.
18:46,020;18:49,300;- No, I don't think he actually even started last year
18:49,300;18:52,260;'cause I looked it up in like, in 2003,
18:52,260;18:55,700;he played 16 games that didn't start any.
18:55,700;18:57,860;So this is his first year as a starter.
18:57,860;18:59,020;- He's a pro-roller.
18:59,020;19:00,660;- Yeah, and like an all pro too, I think.
19:00,660;19:02,380;This was his coming out year.
19:02,380;19:06,780;But he got played like a fiddle by Tom Brady
19:06,780;19:09,860;on the first touchdown pass, which we should probably talk about.
19:09,860;19:13,500;Well, you want to want to give a quick rundown of final score?
19:13,500;19:20,980;Yeah. All right. Give it to me. Patriots win 41 to 27.
19:20,980;19:26,940;And it wasn't that close up 24, three at halftime still has made a kind of a run
19:26,940;19:33,940;in the second half. Yeah. Within two to five yards of making a one score game.
19:35,540;19:37,540;And then the put it pats put him to bed.
19:37,540;19:38,180;Yeah.
19:38,180;19:40,500;So really wasn't that close.
19:40,500;19:43,820;No, it never felt like it was getting away from him.
19:43,820;19:44,700;Yeah.
19:44,700;19:45,060;Yeah.
19:45,060;19:45,420;Yeah.
19:45,420;19:48,940;And I mean, the pay one points against the number one ranked defense in the league.
19:48,940;19:53,820;When this isn't really an offensive team is pretty impressive.
19:53,820;19:54,380;Right.
19:54,380;19:57,940;It was actually, um, they said it.
19:57,940;19:59,420;No, I have it.
19:59,420;20:02,720;They, the Steelers defense allowed more points in this game than in
20:02,720;20:04,300;their previous five games combined.
20:04,300;20:06,100;I think it was a steal.
20:06,100;20:10,560;I mean, Big Ben gifted the Patriots at least 10 points with the
20:10,560;20:13,340;intermediate interception and the pick six.
20:13,340;20:13,940;Yeah.
20:13,940;20:14,900;Yeah.
20:14,900;20:15,900;Big Ben was bad.
20:15,900;20:16,540;Yeah.
20:16,540;20:19,740;Three interceptions looked lost.
20:19,740;20:23,140;But the whole Steelers team, like they, so they go for it on fourth,
20:23,140;20:27,180;fourth in a yard way early on the Patriots 40.
20:27,180;20:28,740;They don't get it.
20:28,740;20:28,980;Yeah.
20:28,980;20:29,580;Big best.
20:29,580;20:30,860;The bus gets stuffed.
20:30,860;20:31,500;Yeah.
20:31,500;20:34,500;And immediately they throw that bomb 60 yards the other way.
20:34,500;20:34,940;Yeah.
20:34,940;20:36,380;The defense let them down.
20:36,380;20:37,340;Betts let them down.
20:37,340;20:38,760;Big Ben let them down.
20:38,760;20:39,900;They're all just shit.
20:39,900;20:43,940;It was a loud crowd and it first play big Ben interception field goal.
20:43,940;20:44,860;Second drive.
20:44,860;20:47,000;Don't get a fourth down conversion.
20:47,000;20:49,040;Immediate next place 60 yard touchdown.
20:49,040;20:52,200;You're down 10 nothing and really never recovered.
20:52,200;20:55,440;Then you kind of get a little close and Big Ben throws a pick six and it's like,
20:55,440;20:56,940;well, yeah, yeah.
20:56,940;20:59,320;As you're driving like in the second half in the second quarter,
20:59,700;21:04,860;before the half. Yeah, it was actually if you think about it
21:04,860;21:09,660;kind of similar to that land a Super Bowl, right? Google
21:09,660;21:13,900;Liguertt but fumbles. The way comp Brady's pick six or Robert
21:13,900;21:16,540;Alford and you're like 24 three or whatever it was.
21:16,540;21:18,860;I was thinking that yeah, and you're down 24 three and so
21:18,860;21:21,220;28 three when I saw that score. I'm like, that's it's kind of
21:21,220;21:24,740;similar actually at the half. Yeah, but most dangerous lead in
21:24,740;21:29,180;sports. 28. Yeah. If you're in the
21:29,180;21:31,940;the Patriots just kept pouring on because Corey, they thought Corey Dylan,
21:31,940;21:34,280;they just kept feeding him the ball. He's wear them down.
21:34,280;21:39,640;I thought that too, but I actually, if you look at it, Corey Dylan didn't have a
21:39,640;21:44,600;great day. He had one good run. It's a 25 yard touchdown run, which again,
21:44,600;21:49,100;I think came at a kind of a sneaky,
21:49,100;21:54,440;pivotal moment where the Steelers had just scored a touchdown.
21:55,040;21:59,360;Patriots were third and like 17 or something like that.
21:59,360;22:04,320;And then they tried a screen pass to Kevin Falk, but he got held like blatantly.
22:04,320;22:08,020;And so they got a five yard defensive holding call, got a first down.
22:08,020;22:14,320;And then I think it was the next play through it to Givens who caught the ball,
22:14,320;22:18,080;fumbled it as he went down and steals recovered it.
22:18,080;22:23,760;But then there was a late hit on a stealer, uh, on a Patriot after the play was
22:23,760;22:25,800;over, but the series like we don't give a fuck we got the
22:25,800;22:29,640;ball back. But then the play got overturned, because givens knee
22:29,640;22:33,500;was down, and they tacked on the 15 yards. So that was like first
22:33,500;22:38,440;in person 10 from the 25. Next play, Corey Dillon 25, our
22:38,440;22:41,400;touchdown run. And that was just like an absolute backbreaker for
22:41,400;22:42,080;that defense.
22:42,080;22:46,080;See, I disagree. Really? You see, he didn't have a good
22:46,080;22:50,320;game 75 yards that game changing touchdown. And then he was also
22:50,320;22:54,080;like they were so keyed on Corey Dillon, the defense, I would
22:54,080;22:56,620;agree with their play of the game, they come out and run and
22:56,620;22:59,440;end around and it works really well because they're all geared
22:59,440;23:02,400;to where it's talking Corey Dillon and then to put the game
23:02,400;23:06,100;absolutely away with that final touchdown, they did run the same
23:06,100;23:08,920;play again because everybody's ready for Corey Dillon's run and
23:08,920;23:12,720;they said, got you twice, bitch. It's true. Yeah. But Corey
23:12,720;23:17,160;Dillon also 24 carries 73 yards, which is about three yards carry.
23:18,080;23:23,080;So like his are his yards were hard earned. The bus who you
23:23,080;23:28,160;think didn't have a good game. 17 carries 64 yards. So about the
23:28,160;23:28,560;same.
23:28,560;23:31,240;There's some bullshit stuff at the end there.
23:31,240;23:34,360;Oh, yeah, yeah, there was. I don't think that was him. I
23:34,360;23:35,760;think that was the deuce daily.
23:35,760;23:41,800;Although deuce daily 10 carries 26 yards. Not great. Not not
23:41,800;23:45,520;great running. In general. I think the lone bright spot was
23:45,520;23:50,000;Kevin Falk 17 yard run in the fourth quarter there. And he had,
23:50,000;23:53,960;he had a fourth down conversion. The Patriots ran on fourth and one with Kevin
23:53,960;23:58,760;Falk to the exact same side that the bus got stopped to the left side of the line,
23:58,760;24:03,440;which I thought was a circle in, um, Falk picked it up because of course he did.
24:03,440;24:07,720;That's one of those play calls. If it goes wrong, Greg's real mad about it.
24:07,720;24:10,680;I didn't see that one.
24:10,680;24:13,800;The audacity of Bill Belichick.
24:13,800;24:17,240;Running the third down back on fourth and one from the shotgun.
24:17,240;24:24,600;Well, you know, like there was a play that to get on the Patriots play calling here.
24:24,600;24:25,400;Here we go.
24:25,400;24:31,640;It was in the first quarter and it was like third and 11. Then they got a penalty, went to third and
24:31,640;24:37,400;16. And in my head, I was like, Pat's run a draw play here. Because that's what they do now.
24:37,400;24:41,640;But they like threw it down the field and had a chance at a first down. It was like a drop.
24:41,640;24:46,200;But that was a play where I was like, in my head, I was already like past draw play.
24:46,200;24:50,760;That's Belichick. What the fuck happened? Where, how did we get to the point now where
24:50,760;24:53,080;we're fucking running drop plays on third 16?
24:53,080;24:57,800;Yeah, he was risky, Greg. He's almost turned that over. The hit was really well timed. The
24:57,800;25:01,080;ball popped up in the air could easily been an interception. But it wasn't. It could have
25:01,080;25:05,800;been a first down. Throw the fucking ball. But it wasn't. Charlie Weiss, right? It's Charlie Weiss.
25:05,800;25:10,120;That's right. Yeah. Weiss is second to last game too. I can already tell that
25:10,120;25:12,200;- In Romeo, Cornell's second last game.
25:12,200;25:14,880;You all three guys are the same in common, Greg.
25:14,880;25:17,360;- Matt, Patricia, oh no.
25:17,360;25:18,480;It'll be fine.
25:18,480;25:20,760;- No, what's Matt, Patricia, really good at?
25:20,760;25:23,360;Keeping offenses on the field on third down.
25:23,360;25:24,700;- I suppose, yeah.
25:24,700;25:27,240;- Kryptonite, baby.
25:27,240;25:32,240;- I'm not excited for the Patriots offense this year.
25:32,240;25:33,160;- Oh, I'm very excited.
25:33,160;25:34,040;- Shocking.
25:34,040;25:39,160;- Joe, judge, and Matt, Patricia, I'm all in.
25:39,160;25:43,960;Like, and then Belichick's son calling plays in defense.
25:43,960;25:44,160;Like,
25:44,160;25:48,840;you mean one of the top ranked defenses last year?
25:48,840;25:53,040;So everybody kind of got injured at the end of the season.
25:53,040;25:54,040;Yeah, they look great.
25:54,040;25:55,080;And that playoff game, Andy.
25:55,080;25:56,880;Well, you know, like I said, everybody was injured.
25:56,880;25:59,040;It happens.
25:59,040;26:03,640;Well, nice to see you calling into a lot of bosses and sports talk radio there,
26:03,640;26:04,000;Greg.
26:04,000;26:04,600;Right.
26:04,600;26:04,880;Yeah.
26:06,240;26:10,640;Dude, when even the beat reporter is saying it's going to be bad, that's when you know.
26:10,640;26:12,800;So you're lying with Boston's course, right?
26:12,800;26:14,000;Yeah, that's a good sign, Greg.
26:14,000;26:15,200;Right? Jesus.
26:15,200;26:20,000;No, I'm lying with what's his name. The beat reporter.
26:20,000;26:21,600;Then I was a down.
26:21,600;26:21,920;Mike Reese.
26:21,920;26:24,720;Mike Reese. Even Mike Reese is saying it's ugly.
26:24,720;26:26,240;Yeah, so.
26:26,240;26:29,520;Mike Reese says it's ugly. You know he's not just like blowing smoke up your ass.
26:29,520;26:30,480;He's not even fucking started, Greg.
26:30,480;26:31,200;Right. Mike Reese is.
26:31,200;26:32,720;They've only played one preseason game.
26:32,720;26:36,080;He's also saying pump the brakes because none of the players or coaches are concerned.
26:36,080;26:42,620;And there's like ironing out the kinks and he's he's willing to give them some patience. Oh god, you guys are brown
26:42,620;26:49,500;No, not so I'm telling you what Greg Reese said your boy Mike Reese. You're Greg you're
26:49,500;26:54,760;You're like back checking your life fucking Michael Felger, but the opposite
26:54,760;27:00,820;Someone has to be gonna bounce his shit out get those two into a room or something
27:00,820;27:02,500;our kid, Felger on this podcast.
27:02,500;27:04,580;Oh, and I will shank that bitch.
27:04,580;27:06,260;I will shank that bitch.
27:06,260;27:08,020;And the world will be better for it.
27:08,020;27:08,660;No, you won't.
27:08,660;27:10,740;You'll be extremely polite and probably be like,
27:10,740;27:11,780;Yeah, you're right.
27:11,780;27:12,580;No, not so much.
27:12,580;27:14,020;It's so great to meet you.
27:14,020;27:14,660;Absolutely not.
27:14,660;27:17,380;Because she's going on.
27:17,380;27:18,420;It's how are you?
27:18,420;27:20,900;Thanks for coming on the pod, Mr. Mass.
27:20,900;27:22,420;Mass, you fucking tool.
27:22,420;27:23,540;Mass.
27:23,540;27:25,380;How does Felger's butthole smell like?
27:25,380;27:28,340;She face buried in it.
27:29,940;27:32,900;I don't think they come on this podcast. Andy, you're on Twitter too much, buddy.
27:32,900;27:35,780;That's probably true. Twitter's getting to you.
27:35,780;27:42,740;Yep. But Twitter would, wouldn't Twitter make me more negative about the Patriots?
27:42,740;27:44,900;How many coffees did he have today, Andy? You were just talking about smelling
27:44,900;27:46,660;buttholes. Just Andy. It was a big one.
27:46,660;27:51,380;Smelling buttholes is a very Twitter thing. You know, you're all worked up. You're all angry.
27:51,380;27:54,340;You gotta let that go. No, that's not gonna happen.
27:54,340;27:58,340;This is my event session, boys. I know. I can tell.
27:58,340;27:59,340;- So, are you?
27:59,340;28:01,960;- What?
28:01,960;28:03,940;- We're looking at these therapists.
28:03,940;28:05,540;- Oh God, I hope not.
28:05,540;28:07,140;- Except we're not licensed
28:07,140;28:09,620;and you probably do more harm than good.
28:09,620;28:10,460;- Probably.
28:10,460;28:11,300;- Probably.
28:11,300;28:12,140;(laughing)
28:12,140;28:12,980;- Probably.
28:12,980;28:16,140;There's no probably about that.
28:16,140;28:17,420;- Yeah.
28:17,420;28:20,180;- Speaking of doing more bad than good,
28:20,180;28:23,740;they're talking about Corey Dillon in this game
28:23,740;28:27,240;and his time with the Cincinnati Bengals.
28:28,100;28:34,940;played seven seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals. And in 2004 alone, he had almost
28:34,940;28:42,940;half as many wins as he did in Cincinnati. And he would say he had half as many wins
28:42,940;28:46,660;this season in New England as he had in seven years in Cincinnati.
28:46,660;28:50,260;So if he did the same season again, he's got as many career wins.
28:50,780;28:51,780;So I looked it up.
28:51,780;28:58,980;In Cincinnati, the Bengals went 34 and 78 over his seven years.
28:58,980;29:01,780;In his three years on the Patriots.
29:01,780;29:03,820;Any guesses?
29:03,820;29:06,220;More or less wins?
29:06,220;29:07,220;More.
29:07,220;29:08,820;Yeah, more.
29:08,820;29:11,420;And 36 and 12 in three seasons of the Patriots.
29:11,420;29:15,740;So we had two more wins with the Patriots than he did in seven seasons with the Bengals.
29:15,740;29:18,700;And 12 losses versus 78?
29:18,700;29:19,580;Correct.
29:19,580;29:20,900;That's the real number right there.
29:20,900;29:22,460;Not the wins.
29:22,460;29:25,660;Just 78 gates is only this and 12 of them.
29:25,660;29:26,260;Yeah.
29:26,260;29:31,020;That's like, uh, I think Tom Brady finally passed Drew Bledsoe for most
29:31,020;29:34,100;interceptions on the Patriots or something like that, or, or no, he tied him for
29:34,100;29:38,260;most losses when he was on the Patriots with whatever it was, but he also had
29:38,260;29:41,540;like 200 more wins or something to get there.
29:41,540;29:44,140;You want to hear some of the quarterback names he played with though?
29:44,140;29:45,300;They're fucking hilarious.
29:45,300;29:49,180;Uh, I don't know if it went this far back, but new little Donald.
29:49,180;29:50,600;- I think you might have.
29:50,600;29:54,060;- Jeff Blake, Akili Smith, Scott Mitchell,
29:54,060;29:56,680;John Kitten, Gus Farat.
29:56,680;29:59,720;So, I mean, that explains a lot of it.
29:59,720;30:03,380;- Yeah, that was rough.
30:03,380;30:05,120;- Good old Gus, dude.
30:05,120;30:06,460;- Gus Farat.
30:06,460;30:09,100;- Pretty sure I had like 80 of his rookie cards
30:09,100;30:10,900;because every time I was Ferrari,
30:10,900;30:13,740;when I would collect football cards back in the day,
30:13,740;30:14,700;every time you'd open a pack,
30:14,700;30:16,420;there'd be a Gus Farat rookie card in there.
30:16,420;30:18,020;Like, well, he's fucking throw it away.
30:18,020;30:20,780;The fact that I have so many means he's not going to be very good because they wouldn't
30:20,780;30:21,780;give him good once.
30:21,780;30:23,980;Yeah, that's filler stock right there.
30:23,980;30:24,980;Yeah, exactly.
30:24,980;30:25,980;Yeah.
30:25,980;30:27,220;Like how we need to fill this pack up.
30:27,220;30:28,220;Just throw a gust rod.
30:28,220;30:29,220;Throw some, throw some gas at him.
30:29,220;30:31,060;He's a 7-thrown draft pick.
30:31,060;30:33,060;Why would he have rookie cards of them?
30:33,060;30:37,780;They had rookie cards of everybody, but he was filler like Steve said.
30:37,780;30:38,780;Rough.
30:38,780;30:39,780;Oh boy.
30:39,780;30:44,100;Akili Smith was a third overall pick.
30:44,100;30:45,100;Yeah.
30:45,100;30:46,100;Yeah.
30:46,100;30:47,100;Oh yeah.
30:47,100;30:48,100;Huge bust.
30:48,100;30:49,100;Yeah, not great.
30:49,100;30:53,100;But you could hear Corey Dillon running the ball in the fourth quarter.
30:53,100;30:56,100;He was like fucking high screaming at people out there.
30:56,100;30:59,100;Games were in your chin and he was ready for the Super Bowl.
30:59,100;31:00,100;Yes, he was.
31:00,100;31:02,100;Yeah, he was probably the most ready.
31:02,100;31:03,100;Oh, yeah.
31:03,100;31:11,100;Although in that, in the three games of glory at the end, there was a nice shot of Bell
31:11,100;31:16,100;of Belichick congratulating one,
31:16,100;31:20,860;the Tully Bentacain in there, TBC.
31:20,860;31:21,700;- Saw that.
31:21,700;31:22,540;- Yeah.
31:22,540;31:24,380;- And Matt Chatham citing too,
31:24,380;31:26,780;when Andy is hugging Kraft.
31:26,780;31:29,880;- Yeah, that's pretty great.
31:29,880;31:31,740;Hey, everybody plays a part, right?
31:31,740;31:32,860;- And yeah, can I get some more,
31:32,860;31:34,380;some better lighting here in this video,
31:34,380;31:35,860;like to see your face?
31:35,860;31:36,700;- You wanna see my face?
31:36,700;31:37,620;Okay, let's see what I can do.
31:37,620;31:38,460;- Yeah.
31:38,460;31:39,300;- Andy's in the car, Greg.
31:39,300;31:40,260;- Andy's in the car again.
31:40,260;31:41,180;- I'm in the car, yes.
31:41,180;31:43,740;- It's been relegated to the outdoors.
31:43,740;31:44,780;My child.
31:44,780;31:45,820;- Indoors, outdoors.
31:45,820;31:47,260;- Yeah, and the sun is setting,
31:47,260;31:51,260;so we're just seeing like a silhouette of Andy.
31:51,260;31:52,580;- Why do you wanna see his face look?
31:52,580;31:53,580;- I was gonna say, it's probably better
31:53,580;31:54,980;that you have the silhouette, really.
31:54,980;31:56,260;- This is like a nightmare.
31:56,260;31:58,700;It's just like a black image silhouette,
31:58,700;31:59,860;bitching and moaning.
31:59,860;32:00,700;- Because it's still sitting.
32:00,700;32:02,260;- Should I see him in my fucking yard?
32:02,260;32:03,260;- You can't really make out much more
32:03,260;32:04,860;besides the chin strap.
32:04,860;32:07,260;- Yeah, good, that's all you're getting.
32:09,700;32:11,460;I want you to dream of me tonight, Greg.
32:11,460;32:16,120;Wait, you don't dream of your brothers every night.
32:16,120;32:21,340;I do. Oh, okay. Yeah. I think we all do. All right. Good.
32:21,340;32:23,140;No, this should be. All right.
32:23,140;32:28,100;That's a one with Greg where he had these like massive feet to like flippers,
32:28,100;32:31,620;but it was actual fee. It was fucking weird. No, no, that was my penis.
32:31,620;32:32,860;And it was, it's,
32:32,860;32:37,860;I have the same stuff at nightmares. Let's be real.
32:38,220;32:40,220;You're a big dick dummy.
32:40,220;32:46,700;All right. Anything else that you want to talk about in this game?
32:46,700;32:48,740;I got lots of best and worst.
32:48,740;32:51,460;I got. Yeah, I got I got a handful.
32:51,460;32:53,380;Uh, well, let's make fun of it.
32:53,380;32:55,740;Let's make fun of the Steelers some more. OK.
32:55,740;32:57,740;You know, whipping boys, dude.
32:57,740;32:59,180;I'm not scared. I have a theory.
32:59,180;33:01,100;I have a theory that this loss
33:01,100;33:04,100;irreparably changes their franchise psyche forever
33:04,100;33:06,420;because they were flying so high after this.
33:06,420;33:07,680;No, they weren't, dude.
33:07,680;33:11,100;No, before this have been Ben, he's a rookie.
33:11,100;33:12,440;15-1.
33:12,440;33:13,440;Had losses with two.
33:13,440;33:14,800;Last year they were really good.
33:14,800;33:19,280;They got beaten thus by the, in the AFC championship game, the Cordell Stewart.
33:19,280;33:23,040;But then they came with, and they came into our house and, and
33:23,040;33:24,800;ended our end win streak, you know?
33:24,800;33:26,200;Well, we went to their house.
33:26,200;33:26,600;They're like, all right, this is it.
33:26,600;33:29,760;You know, if they win this game, I bet they, they actually win the Super Bowl.
33:29,760;33:31,120;And you know, who knows what happens.
33:31,120;33:34,600;But ever since then, they just haven't been able to beat the Patriots bugaboo.
33:34,600;33:38,160;We've been in their heads and I think it traces back to this game.
33:38,160;33:42,120;That's not a bad theory.
33:42,120;33:42,960;I don't hate it.
33:42,960;33:50,200;But they had been to what five of the last 10 AFC, they'd hosted five of the
33:50,200;33:52,200;last 10 AFC conference games.
33:52,200;33:52,920;Correct.
33:52,920;33:54,440;And it only won one of them.
33:54,440;33:58,920;I had lots of Patriots twice.
34:00,520;34:07,360;So, I mean, they're kind of like Ben here before with the hopes, you know, maybe not
34:07,360;34:13,000;big Ben, but you know, they're, they're kind of got that Eagles thing going where they're,
34:13,000;34:14,000;they're right there.
34:14,000;34:19,400;Yeah. But they just got this, this brand new quarterback who looks to be the franchise on
34:19,400;34:24,440;a rookie deal and they can build around one this year. They only won last and I was weak.
34:24,440;34:26,640;Never lost defense in the league.
34:26,640;34:30,560;Yeah. All like solid running game. And you have this quarterback who looks like he can
34:30,560;34:35,320;win games. It was basically it felt like a 2001 Patriots, right?
34:35,320;34:36,320;Yep.
34:36,320;34:39,880;Although probably more so because it's the Steelers and they're a well run organization.
34:39,880;34:45,120;They have a history of winning things when they put the pieces together.
34:45,120;34:49,720;It's kind of funny seeing Big Ben look almost athletic, but still not.
34:49,720;34:52,320;Yeah, you know, nothing really changed with them.
34:52,320;34:57,920;Yeah, more athletic than he did at the end of his career, but still not athletic.
34:57,920;34:58,920;It's hilarious.
34:58,920;35:04,020;But he like plateaus of this athleticism for like ever.
35:04,020;35:05,520;And then right at the end, he falls off.
35:05,520;35:08,280;Dude, he's like, it's athletic the rest of his career.
35:08,280;35:12,720;There's nothing that makes me happier than watching Big Ben get like sacked because it's
35:12,720;35:14,160;the least graceful shit.
35:14,160;35:19,520;And it's just, he just like stumbles around and looks super awkward.
35:19,520;35:21,340;He's, it's amazing.
35:21,340;35:23,800;I can't imagine rooting for someone like Big Ben.
35:23,800;35:25,300;It's gotta be horrendous.
35:25,300;35:26,140;- It's gotta be so awesome.
35:26,140;35:28,420;- It's like he's good enough that like,
35:28,420;35:29,700;you have to root for him.
35:29,700;35:31,420;- Yeah, you don't wanna move on from him, right?
35:31,420;35:33,720;- But there is just nothing likable about him.
35:33,720;35:35,980;He's not like pretty to watch.
35:35,980;35:37,340;He's ugly as sin.
35:37,340;35:39,100;He's a terrible person.
35:39,100;35:42,700;It's like, there's nothing besides like he wins games.
35:42,700;35:44,580;- Yeah, he doesn't come across as like a great teammate
35:44,580;35:45,420;or anything either.
35:45,420;35:47,660;Like, you know what that, he's not well spoken.
35:47,660;35:50,500;He's, he's raping chicks, left him, right?
35:50,500;35:53,640;- Like getting wrecked on motorcycles.
35:53,640;35:55,500;- Yeah, and you've got to support them.
35:55,500;35:56,820;- Yeah, you have to.
35:56,820;35:57,660;- Yep.
35:57,660;36:00,640;- So have you heard how that motorcycle accident went down?
36:00,640;36:01,780;- I don't think so.
36:01,780;36:04,360;I mean, I'm sure I did at the time.
36:04,360;36:05,860;- There is a thing in Pittsburgh,
36:05,860;36:08,540;and this is fucking wild, called the Pittsburgh left.
36:08,540;36:14,680;And what it is, is if you're in line,
36:14,680;36:17,220;you're trying to take a left across a lane of traffic,
36:17,220;36:18,420;right? - Yeah.
36:18,420;36:21,420;and you're sitting at the light and it's just green lights.
36:21,420;36:23,260;There's no left turn light.
36:23,260;36:26,300;And the light turns, the oncoming traffic will wait
36:26,300;36:30,280;for one car to make the left and then they go.
36:30,280;36:34,860;Which seems just stupid, right?
36:34,860;36:35,700;How do I know that?
36:35,700;36:36,740;I don't live in Pittsburgh.
36:36,740;36:38,140;Someone had, someone lived in Pittsburgh
36:38,140;36:40,940;and told me, "Oh yeah, that's the Pittsburgh left."
36:40,940;36:41,940;- Good.
36:41,940;36:43,380;- And he was doing one of those,
36:43,380;36:46,020;and the lady in the car coming in oncoming traffic
36:46,020;36:48,380;didn't think, was it from Pittsburgh or something?
36:48,380;36:49,780;I didn't know about the Pittsburgh left.
36:49,780;36:53,500;So he did the Pittsburgh left on his motorcycle and got plowed by like a lady
36:53,500;36:55,420;in a Corolla and only shit.
36:55,420;36:55,940;Right.
36:55,940;36:56,820;And she was very good.
36:56,820;36:57,060;The right.
36:57,060;36:58,180;She was like, I saw the green light.
36:58,180;36:58,740;I went go.
36:58,740;36:59,620;And he just like his bike.
36:59,620;37:00,580;I've right away.
37:00,580;37:01,220;Yeah.
37:01,220;37:03,580;And this dick out on the motorcycle.
37:03,580;37:07,760;Is it a law or is it just like, no, it's just like a regional thing.
37:07,760;37:08,980;People do supposed to be nice.
37:08,980;37:09,860;Like, Oh, I'll let you go.
37:09,860;37:10,180;You know?
37:10,180;37:10,460;Yeah.
37:10,460;37:10,620;Yeah.
37:10,620;37:12,860;Cause people get like stuck in the middle of the intersection.
37:12,860;37:13,420;Yeah.
37:13,420;37:14,460;If you're yeah.
37:14,460;37:16,460;You know, that's interesting.
37:17,940;37:21,600;That's so big. Not yielding and getting in trouble for it.
37:21,600;37:27,400;I looked into some of the, um, the allegations we'll call them.
37:27,400;37:33,440;Okay. So just, uh, maybe I'll go do a deeper dive later, but can't wait.
37:33,440;37:36,060;Couple of things that are kind of funny. So there was two of them.
37:36,060;37:40,980;If you remember the first one was in 2008 in Lake Tahoe.
37:40,980;37:46,540;And he, he called up by like a front desk lady being like,
37:46,540;37:48,840;"Yo, my TV's broken."
37:48,840;37:51,400;And then shut the door when she walked in
37:51,400;37:53,480;and tried to make out with her and shit.
37:53,480;37:55,340;- Jesus Christ.
37:55,340;37:57,640;And apparently he was there.
37:57,640;38:00,320;- So, DeShawn Watson, but just skipping a couple steps.
38:00,320;38:01,160;- Right, Jesus.
38:01,160;38:02,740;- Yeah, yeah.
38:02,740;38:07,340;So, he was there with Donald Trump, apparently.
38:07,340;38:08,260;- Oh.
38:08,260;38:13,020;- And he made it into Stormy Daniels' tell-all book.
38:13,020;38:19,660;She said, she said that he like tried to, he got introduced by Donald Trump to Stormy Daniels.
38:19,660;38:24,140;And she like rejected him. He like stood in the hallway and like kept knocking the door,
38:24,140;38:30,460;trying to like get in so he could do God knows what. Oh, we know what. Yeah. So then that chick
38:30,460;38:37,500;sues him, right? That first chick sues him. And while that case is still open in 2010,
38:37,500;38:44,700;he's at a bar in Georgia and he has his bodyguard like grab some girl by the arm and like bring her
38:44,700;38:50,940;into a hallway and then when she got in the hallway quote his penis was out of his pants.
38:50,940;39:01,660;Yeah and that one's a legitimate rape accusation like rape rape and she went to the hospital and
39:01,660;39:10,180;and everything, there was bruises, all the telltale signs of an actual rape occurring.
39:10,180;39:17,620;There only one officer actually investigated the case. And it turned out that officer had
39:17,620;39:26,220;asked for a photo with Big Ben earlier that evening. There's a photo of them two together.
39:26,220;39:30,100;He was somewhere on record as calling the girl a drunken bitch
39:30,100;39:34,300;So small town in Georgia, yeah
39:34,300;39:37,840;Gonna go. Yeah that got dropped. No
39:37,840;39:41,100;But the NFL still suspended him
39:41,100;39:45,220;Six games for like the con whatever player
39:45,220;39:47,540;detrimental. Yeah
39:47,540;39:52,260;But then it got dropped to four games for good behavior. What?
39:52,260;39:55,020;What?
39:55,020;39:57,900;Uh-huh. And it doesn't make me feel great about Deshawn Watson.
39:57,900;40:01,560;Yeah. Brian Leftwich got hurt in the preseason because it's supposed to be the
40:01,560;40:03,060;first six games. Yeah.
40:03,060;40:08,300;And then the day after they made the six games, four games,
40:08,300;40:12,620;because of a letter that Art Rooney wrote to Roger Goodell.
40:12,620;40:17,220;Holy shit. Do we have a copy of said letter? Um,
40:17,220;40:21,260;I didn't see it out there, but there was some quotes from it and like quotes from
40:21,260;40:24,560;Goodell and it's the most ball washy shit ever. Dude. He's like,
40:24,740;40:26,900;He's really shown growth in this off season.
40:26,900;40:30,380;He's like, dude, he has two open cases against him.
40:30,380;40:31,660;What do you mean he's shown growth?
40:31,660;40:33,060;Like you're a fucking idiot.
40:33,060;40:34,980;- Jesus Christ.
40:34,980;40:38,220;- Yeah, so neither of those look very good.
40:38,220;40:39,180;And the fact that they happen
40:39,180;40:42,700;within two years of each other, yikes.
40:42,700;40:43,780;- Not great.
40:43,780;40:44,700;- Yeah. - Big yikes.
40:44,700;40:47,060;- Not great.
40:47,060;40:47,980;- And then on the field,
40:47,980;40:51,580;he decided to play way past his expiration date.
40:51,580;40:53,060;- Yeah, and he's got like six chins
40:53,060;40:54,500;and he's fucking hideous.
40:54,500;40:55,340;- Yeah.
40:55,340;40:59,740;- He can't take spikes to save his shit.
40:59,740;41:01,420;- And he's addicted to alcohol and porn.
41:01,420;41:02,260;Did you see that?
41:02,260;41:05,400;- No, but you could just tell me whatever,
41:05,400;41:06,500;not believe it right now.
41:06,500;41:07,340;- Yeah, fuck it.
41:07,340;41:09,820;- Yeah, yeah, that was recent.
41:09,820;41:12,000;He was like doing some fucking talk.
41:12,000;41:14,560;He's like a Christian now.
41:14,560;41:16,740;Wait, he admitted to this?
41:16,740;41:19,580;Yeah, he was giving some talk at some like Christian thing
41:19,580;41:20,980;to like young people or whatever.
41:20,980;41:23,620;And he's like, I've been addicted to alcohol.
41:23,620;41:25,300;I've been addicted to porn.
41:25,300;41:28,540;I've been a bad husband and father.
41:28,540;41:29,740;- No, but you know what?
41:29,740;41:31,700;I'm a Christian and fucking, you know,
41:31,700;41:33,540;you gotta stick with it and yada.
41:33,540;41:34,860;- Yeah, yada, yada, yada.
41:34,860;41:36,660;- Yeah.
41:36,660;41:38,500;- Jesus fuck.
41:38,500;41:40,060;- Just picture in your head right now,
41:40,060;41:41,620;Big Ben jerking off, dude.
41:41,620;41:42,460;Just fucking.
41:42,460;41:43,860;- Dude, why are you gonna do that to me?
41:43,860;41:45,900;- Just grabbing his crank,
41:45,900;41:47,460;probably the grossest shit.
41:47,460;41:48,300;- Correct.
41:48,300;41:50,820;- God damn it.
41:50,820;41:52,260;- I'm supposed to be a football podcast.
41:52,260;41:53,760;- What disgusting is that image?
41:53,760;41:54,980;- Mom is a success.
41:54,980;41:55,820;- Got it.
41:55,820;41:58,300;- All right, let's bring it back a little bit.
41:58,300;41:59,380;- Mom is not happy.
41:59,380;42:01,140;- I'm hammering home the point that Big Ben
42:01,140;42:03,740;is a disgusting, despicable human.
42:03,740;42:06,020;All right, so the right way,
42:06,020;42:07,580;and I'm glad he threw three interceptions.
42:07,580;42:10,580;I think they should have started Antoine Randle.
42:10,580;42:15,340;They talked about bringing in Tommy Maddox at halftime.
42:15,340;42:18,500;If Big Ben didn't play better, what was the quote here?
42:18,500;42:20,700;'Cause he spent,
42:20,700;42:23,020;Bill Cowher spent the entire, or most of the half time
42:23,020;42:25,300;calming Ben Rossberger down.
42:25,300;42:26,140;And then the quote was,
42:26,140;42:27,700;"If Rossberger continues to struggle,
42:27,700;42:29,740;you will see Tommy Maddox."
42:29,740;42:30,580;- Yes.
42:30,580;42:32,740;- Tommy fucking Maddox.
42:32,740;42:38,480;But speaking of Big Ben, our buddy Tim, the intern,
42:38,480;42:42,280;cut up some Boston Globe articles for us.
42:42,280;42:43,940;And there's one about Rossberger,
42:43,940;42:45,840;and you might find this,
42:45,840;42:48,900;just based on everything that Greg told you,
42:48,900;42:55,940;find this pretty humorous. Ross's burger recalled Snodgrass, who I guess somebody who he knew growing
42:55,940;43:00,820;up, grew up with the idea of one day becoming a secret agent, perhaps working for the FBI.
43:00,820;43:06,260;To Snodgrass, that conjures up the idea of an escape artist, a trait he saw
43:06,260;43:10,020;Ross's burger display time and again on the basketball court and football field.
43:10,020;43:14,740;Quote, when you look at that wish, I mean, that's so him said Snodgrass,
43:14,740;43:18,740;you know, sly and undercover, always finding ways to do things that are beyond the norm.
43:18,740;43:24,300;He's like a James Bond 007 or an FBI agent thinking behind those sunglasses.
43:24,300;43:26,500;How am I gonna get out of this one?
43:26,500;43:28,180;Oh my God.
43:28,180;43:29,180;God.
43:29,180;43:30,180;God.
43:30,180;43:31,180;God.
43:31,180;43:33,180;Snodgrass said that.
43:33,180;43:34,180;Nodgrass.
43:34,180;43:35,180;Dude.
43:35,180;43:37,180;Fucking FBI agent.
43:37,180;43:44,340;That's like an SNL sketch that I, you know?
43:44,340;43:46,900;Ben Roethlisberger's FBI agent.
43:46,900;43:48,180;That's an SNL sketch.
43:48,180;43:50,520;So fucking man handling everything.
43:50,520;43:52,420;Yeah, just an absolute
43:52,420;43:54,180;plot in crime scenes.
43:54,180;43:56,280;Just yeah, you can now like a sore thumb.
43:56,280;43:57,320;Yeah, yeah.
43:57,320;44:00,180;Undercover quote unquote.
44:00,180;44:01,320;I'm not being discreet.
44:01,320;44:02,980;Raffensperger, put your penis away.
44:02,980;44:12,260;Fuck, exactly.
44:12,260;44:14,160;Oh, shit.
44:14,160;44:15,960;That's fucking hilarious.
44:15,960;44:18,140;And Greg, he says, well, you brought up
44:18,140;44:22,660;Randall L. He has some shit to say that you might sour you on
44:22,660;44:26,420;him as well since we're talking shit about people. This is also
44:26,420;44:29,480;on Bossing Globe. The X Factor in the Steelers game plan could
44:29,480;44:32,620;be Randall L. All the former Indiana University quarterback
44:32,620;44:34,860;did this season was lead the Steelers in punt return yards,
44:34,860;44:38,260;finished second kick return yardage and a haul in 43 passes
44:38,260;44:42,100;second on the team for 601 yards and three touchdowns. He also
44:42,100;44:44,860;threw his first touchdown passing NFL. He wants to do
44:44,860;44:48,100;more such play defensive back. "I'd like to get a chance to
44:48,100;44:52,980;to do that," said Randall L with a laugh. "Move over Troy Brown. When asked who was the better
44:52,980;44:58,420;all-around player, himself or Brown, Randall L laughed again. Quote, "That would have to be me,"
44:58,420;45:09,460;he said." That's he's got to say that. The fuck that. Yeah. Troy Brown's a goddamn pioneer.
45:09,460;45:15,380;I hope to live up to his greatness. If you're ever received, you're supposed to be super self-centered
45:15,380;45:18,020;and think you're the best. It's how they work.
45:18,020;45:19,780;Still, fuck them. Fuck them.
45:19,780;45:21,380;I like Randy though.
45:21,380;45:22,820;No, not at all.
45:22,820;45:23,860;I used to.
45:23,860;45:24,820;He's pretty crafty.
45:24,820;45:26,420;And Heinz Ward. I like Heinz Ward too.
45:26,420;45:27,700;So fuck him.
45:27,700;45:30,260;Do you like Heinz Ward, Andy?
45:30,260;45:32,100;No, fuck him. He's dirty.
45:32,100;45:34,900;I hate all steers.
45:34,900;45:35,940;I like Heinz Ward.
45:35,940;45:37,140;Andy's in the dark, I guess.
45:37,140;45:40,580;His light has gone out and I'm just hearing,
45:40,580;45:41,220;"No, fuck him."
45:41,220;45:43,620;Goddamn commentators.
45:44,740;45:46,660;Fuck. All right. Hey, you want some more hate?
45:46,660;45:49,460;How about this fucking Bill Cower thinks he's hot shit.
45:49,460;45:53,460;Again, from the Boston Globe, the Steelers, Bill Cower will be coaching
45:53,460;45:56,500;in his fifth AFC Championship game, his fourth at home.
45:56,500;45:59,500;But he's only won one in ninety five against Indianapolis.
45:59,500;46:02,140;Ask whether he's changed his approach, Cower said.
46:02,140;46:03,780;Any guesses?
46:03,780;46:05,260;You know, change his approach.
46:05,260;46:08,060;Quote, no, I think every game has been a pretty good football game.
46:08,060;46:10,740;We've just been coming out on the short end more times than not.
46:10,740;46:13,260;Fucking great coach.
46:13,260;46:15,980;What an asshole. What a dick.
46:15,980;46:18,180;What a fucking loser.
46:18,180;46:19,540;How dare he?
46:19,540;46:20,940;What a loser.
46:20,940;46:23,180;Who does he think he is with that mustache?
46:23,180;46:26,140;Right. What a loser.
46:26,140;46:28,740;What a fucking asshole.
46:28,740;46:32,340;And that let's let's let's contrast that with Bill Belichick,
46:32,340;46:35,500;a real NFL football coach.
46:35,500;46:39,140;One question to Bill to Belichick at his news conference yesterday
46:39,140;46:41,540;was a softball right in the coach's wheelhouse.
46:41,540;46:46,180;"If the Patriots can play defensively like they did against the Colts," Belichick swung away.
46:46,180;46:50,580;"If we play like we did against the Colts, we'll get killed," he said. "It'd be a lot worse than
46:50,580;46:54,420;whatever it was out there last time because Pittsburgh is not the Colts. And the Colts are
46:54,420;46:57,940;not Pittsburgh. You're talking about two totally different teams. Things that we did against the
46:57,940;47:02,100;Colts, if we tried to do them against the Steelers, it would be 55-0. That might be if they kneel on
47:02,100;47:06,180;the ball like they did at the end of the game last time. It's almost nothing that I would carry over
47:06,180;47:09,780;or correlate from that game to this game. We couldn't make a bigger mistake than to try to
47:09,780;47:10,980;I do that in my opinion.
47:10,980;47:13,180;- That's fair.
47:13,180;47:14,380;Those teams are very, very different.
47:14,380;47:15,820;- Fucking right.
47:15,820;47:16,660;- Almost as dichotomy as--
47:16,660;47:17,940;- As opposed to Bill Cowles like,
47:17,940;47:19,940;"No, I'll just do what I do."
47:19,940;47:22,100;Who else do you want me to shit on?
47:22,100;47:22,940;Anybody else?
47:22,940;47:25,300;- This is ridiculous.
47:25,300;47:26,740;- We just fired refs, Andy.
47:26,740;47:29,380;- They were fine.
47:29,380;47:34,060;Yeah, Jim Nance.
47:34,060;47:35,620;You can't hate Jim Nance, right?
47:35,620;47:36,860;- Yeah, it's tough.
47:36,860;47:38,940;- Yeah, what do you think of the refs though, Andy?
47:38,940;47:42,820;I like the personal foul called after the reverse given.
47:42,820;47:43,940;So what about Jerome?
47:43,940;47:45,780;That is you definitely a better.
47:45,780;47:47,100;Oh, yeah, I can't say best.
47:47,100;47:49,100;Yeah, he thinks he's good, but it's just fit.
47:49,100;47:54,100;The fact that he's like fifth all time in Russia is crazy.
47:54,100;47:57,700;He's just a fat offensive lineman or fast offensive lineman.
47:57,700;47:59,420;That's fucking bananas.
47:59,420;48:00,700;There's no he's fifth all time.
48:00,700;48:02,460;That's get the fuck out of here.
48:02,460;48:03,460;Dude, he had 16.
48:03,460;48:05,100;You know, I hate fucking Greg.
48:08,700;48:14,100;No, but there was a I actually had a football, not football from I don't know which one it was.
48:14,100;48:15,220;You shared your screen.
48:15,220;48:25,260;Uh, the, it was, uh, because right at the beginning of the game, Teddy Brouski basically took Betis on head first and just like stoned him like heavy.
48:25,260;48:28,940;That was, uh, it looked like both of them got the worst of it too.
48:28,940;48:30,300;Like, that looked like a car crash.
48:30,300;48:38,620;Um, but on the replay, I don't know which commentator was said, uh, quote, he can load it up and put some weight in his pants.
48:38,620;48:41,700;when he needs to. Oh, hell yeah, I did.
48:41,700;48:43,900;Oh, yeah. Just drop induces, baby.
48:43,900;48:45,820;Just when you need to.
48:45,820;48:47,900;Just just put some weight in those pants.
48:47,900;48:50,220;Steve, Steve. Yeah.
48:50,220;48:52,020;Put some weight in those pants when you need to.
48:52,020;48:53,660;You want me to take a shit in my pants right now?
48:53,660;48:56,700;I just want you to if you need to just you can, you know, load up
48:56,700;48:59,060;and put some expert sphincter control Andy.
48:59,060;49:02,180;I only think I want to believe that when I see it.
49:02,180;49:05,220;He's eight all time now.
49:05,220;49:07,180;Betis Jesus.
49:07,180;49:11,020;How the fuck did Jerome does play one more year after this 12 more games?
49:11,020;49:12,460;How many yards?
49:12,460;49:15,260;He got in 68 more yards.
49:15,260;49:17,420;But nine more touchdowns.
49:17,420;49:19,260;That's yeah, that's how I remember him.
49:19,260;49:21,260;I don't remember him as like an actual running back.
49:21,260;49:23,020;I remember him as a goal.
49:23,020;49:25,340;I had touchdowns at 13.
49:25,340;49:26,780;Yeah, bananas.
49:26,780;49:28,780;And he had like
49:28,780;49:32,060;because the last game before this, the Steelers played the Jets
49:32,060;49:35,220;and hung in there to win like he actually
49:36,180;49:39,060;betters had a fourth quarter fumble when the the Steelers were down.
49:39,060;49:43,220;Yeah, Greg went over this last week about how the Jets absolutely blew it.
49:43,220;49:44,260;Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah.
49:44,260;49:48,020;But he also re field goals to win. Yeah. Yeah.
49:48,020;49:53,140;Including one like at the end of the game too, right?
49:53,140;49:56,420;Yeah, it's like too many learning and like as time expired.
49:56,420;49:56,420;Yeah.
49:56,420;50:02,900;In this in this in this stadium. But yeah, betters went for 27 for one
50:02,900;50:05,940;101 last week against the Jets. So he had a fucking legit game.
50:05,940;50:11,780;Um, but that actually the talk about the missed field goals,
50:11,780;50:14,940;Adam and Terry and the first drive of the game,
50:14,940;50:18,980;open the scoring with a 48 yard field goal, which was the longest field.
50:18,980;50:23,820;You tied the longest field goal in Heinz fields history, 48 yards.
50:23,820;50:28,580;That's over four years, right? I think so. Yeah. Something like that. Yeah.
50:28,580;50:32,060;How was 48 yards the longest? Yeah.
50:32,060;50:36,300;for years by like by Steelers or visitors, kickers like any
50:36,300;50:37,980;kicker, the longest is 48.
50:37,980;50:42,140;Well, the open end, right? Yeah, it was like, renowned for being
50:42,140;50:45,740;tough to kick in. Yeah. Yeah. But and this game was a cold one
50:45,740;50:50,100;too. It was the second coldest game ever to in Pittsburgh was
50:50,100;50:54,500;13 degrees. Damn. That was surprising too. Yeah. Thought
50:54,500;50:57,740;there'd be colder games in that Pittsburgh. Right? Exactly. Yeah.
50:57,980;51:01,380;But yeah, all the the three games of glory, the Pittsburgh
51:01,380;51:04,320;defense is talking about like, oh, it's Pittsburgh weather.
51:04,320;51:06,520;Like, well, not really.
51:06,520;51:07,720;This is it's New England weather.
51:07,720;51:10,420;It just happens to be in Pittsburgh
51:10,420;51:13,920;because the coldest game in Pittsburgh was 1989 against.
51:13,920;51:16,820;These are the Patriots. Yeah.
51:16,820;51:17,760;Interesting.
51:17,760;51:20,260;I love how Andy thinks that we own cold weather.
51:20,260;51:22,660;We do. We have to tease.
51:22,660;51:23,260;Carinna.
51:23,260;51:25,660;Hold on. That's our weather, bitch.
51:25,660;51:26,840;We don't own cold weather.
51:26,840;51:29,200;We own here. No, it's our weather.
51:29,200;51:30,560;We own this.
51:30,560;51:32,840;And he's Tom Brady there.
51:32,840;51:33,400;Yeah, that's right.
51:33,400;51:34,760;Happens to be in Pittsburgh.
51:34,760;51:35,840;The same Mateo zone.
51:35,840;51:37,640;Tom Brady. This is his weather.
51:37,640;51:39,320;It's spicy.
51:39,320;51:40,200;I love this game.
51:40,200;51:42,000;And he's on one tonight, boys.
51:42,000;51:43,960;This is this is a great game.
51:43,960;51:45,040;It's the India at night.
51:45,040;51:46,160;India in the dark.
51:46,160;51:47,200;Fucking beautiful.
51:47,200;51:47,640;That's right.
51:47,640;51:50,080;India after dark.
51:50,080;51:52,000;Yeah, you don't want to be.
51:52,000;51:54,720;All right.
51:54,720;51:55,720;Greg, you got anybody else?
51:55,720;51:59,080;You want me to shit on or want me to shit on before we do best and worst?
51:59,080;52:02,280;Hmm. No. All right.
52:02,280;52:04,360;Then do you want to go first?
52:04,360;52:05,720;I think that's worse actually.
52:05,720;52:09,960;Just seeing his name come up gave me shit.
52:09,960;52:12,280;Me too. I didn't like seeing that.
52:12,280;52:12,520;Yeah.
52:12,520;52:12,920;I had.
52:12,920;52:16,760;He didn't catch the touchdown and like the meaningless garbage time one and he just he
52:16,760;52:17,560;didn't celebrate it all.
52:17,560;52:20,120;Which is refreshing because they had been celebrating all game.
52:20,120;52:20,920;Yeah.
52:20,920;52:24,120;It's your down thing as NFL film guys pointed.
52:24,120;52:29,080;It was like real close too. He caught it and then just dropped it. That was almost not a
52:29,080;52:35,240;football moment when you got that. That's very anti-paxical versus personality too.
52:35,240;52:37,720;Do you think of all the people that are going to be celebrating?
52:37,720;52:41,320;Wait, dropping things? Instead of 21 down, 14 down with a minute left.
52:41,320;52:45,480;I feel like him dropping things by accident and having them backfire on him.
52:45,480;52:49,880;It seems to be. Yeah, he tried to tuck it in his waistband a little bit and just slip right out.
52:49,880;52:51,460;- Yeah, exactly.
52:51,460;52:53,160;I'm glad you knew where I was going with that.
52:53,160;52:54,220;- All right. Great.
52:54,220;52:55,160;You want to do your best and worst?
52:55,160;52:56,000;Give me some best and worst.
52:56,000;52:56,840;- Yeah, I'm going first,
52:56,840;52:57,680;because you guys probably have more than me.
52:57,680;53:02,160;So my best is going to be like
53:02,160;53:05,620;celebrations from this game.
53:05,620;53:10,920;The pick six from Rodney Harrison.
53:10,920;53:14,720;So that came, it was like 17.3.
53:14,720;53:17,160;It was coming like towards the end of the half.
53:17,160;53:18,200;- Yep.
53:18,200;53:19,400;Steel's driving.
53:19,400;53:22,840;Steel's a drive in, pick six, like an 80 yard return.
53:22,840;53:27,020;And it's like Harrison and Vrabel with Big Ben,
53:27,020;53:29,760;the last guy back and Big Ben's like run with them
53:29,760;53:33,800;and like turn and turn, which is awesome to watch.
53:33,800;53:36,200;And Vrabel just like dumps them
53:36,200;53:39,360;and goes down like a bag of fucking potatoes.
53:39,360;53:40,200;Super awkward fall.
53:40,200;53:41,760;- Group and labor left in the process.
53:41,760;53:44,000;- Yeah, so like Harrison is like knowing
53:44,000;53:45,800;within 20 yards of him as he's going in.
53:45,800;53:48,760;So he like literally walks the last five yards.
53:48,760;53:54,200;Literally just staring up and just like start stomping as he crosses the line and just like
53:54,200;53:59,960;staring up into the crowd and it's like you guys are done 24 to 7. See you later. I just
53:59,960;54:05,800;walked in for a touchdown, which is like an iconic patch celebration. And I know where you go with
54:05,800;54:13,720;the next one too. The Dion branch. Yes. Yeah. Dion branch also had a couple sick touchdowns that
54:13,720;54:15,400;that was like super hype.
54:15,400;54:17,880;And the second one that like really put the game out,
54:17,880;54:21,320;he did like the Tyree kill last five yards,
54:21,320;54:23,760;like wave as a defender as he's like walking
54:23,760;54:25,020;over the goal line.
54:25,020;54:27,600;So that was another one that was like, all right.
54:27,600;54:28,440;- Once he got in the end zone,
54:28,440;54:30,000;you started waving to the crowd.
54:30,000;54:31,280;- Yeah.
54:31,280;54:34,800;- And then there was a clip in the three games to glory
54:34,800;54:35,760;where he's on the sideline,
54:35,760;54:38,220;I think after scoring that touchdown
54:38,220;54:40,600;and he's like, where are all your towels?
54:40,600;54:42,120;He's like waving one of his white toes,
54:42,120;54:43,240;like where are all your towels?
54:43,240;54:44,600;Where's everybody's towels?
54:44,600;54:47,400;- And that's a throwback to the 2001 too.
54:47,400;54:50,080;Cause remember the Pats did it in that game too.
54:50,080;54:50,920;- Yup.
54:50,920;54:52,920;- On the sidelines they were mocking the towel thing.
54:52,920;54:54,760;- Yeah, yeah, I bet everybody does though.
54:54,760;54:58,560;- Yeah, so good for Dion for knowing his Patriots history.
54:58,560;54:59,640;- Fuck yeah.
54:59,640;55:01,800;- Yeah, but even after the first one, the 60 years.
55:01,800;55:04,240;- That bye bye celebration generally I'm not a fan of.
55:04,240;55:07,800;Seems a little cocky, I don't think Bill liked it either.
55:07,800;55:09,080;- What side of that coin though,
55:09,080;55:12,680;that safety out of an open field and I don't know what he is,
55:12,680;55:17,960;like stood there flat footed in branches gave him a little wiggle and he was absolutely
55:17,960;55:18,960;right by him.
55:18,960;55:21,400;Wasn't that like that was to go up by three touchdowns.
55:21,400;55:26,080;I think at that point, that was the, that was the nail in the coffin game over.
55:26,080;55:27,080;That was it.
55:27,080;55:28,080;That was it.
55:28,080;55:29,920;Everyone that's you don't like the bye bye Steve.
55:29,920;55:30,920;I loved it.
55:30,920;55:34,000;Seems a little cocky to me just because it's the Steelers though.
55:34,000;55:36,960;Yeah, because the Steelers are the caucus football team in football.
55:36,960;55:37,960;Yeah.
55:37,960;55:41,240;But if like if Tyree kill hadn't ruined it for me, I would probably like it a lot.
55:41,240;55:43,360;I like it when Tyree because I think it's hilarious.
55:43,360;55:44,960;I hate Tyree kill a ton.
55:44,960;55:46,240;I hate him too as a person,
55:46,240;55:48,800;but I don't hate that celebration,
55:48,800;55:52,420;especially the fact that the Buccaneers did it to him
55:52,420;55:53,800;in the Super Bowl.
55:53,800;55:55,560;That was sweet, Winfields.
55:55,560;55:56,400;Was it Winfields?
55:56,400;55:57,520;That's all that's for you.
55:57,520;55:58,440;That's why I like it.
55:58,440;56:01,560;'Cause like you can like turn those things around on people.
56:01,560;56:02,400;Yep.
56:02,400;56:03,240;You know?
56:03,240;56:04,080;I fucking love it.
56:04,080;56:04,900;Yeah.
56:04,900;56:06,560;But even after the first touchdown,
56:06,560;56:09,760;Dion Branch was hyped that 60 yarder
56:09,760;56:10,800;that put him up 10 nothing.
56:10,800;56:14,700;He was like hopping around like stoked out of his mind.
56:14,700;56:16,960;And you could tell you're like, Oh yeah.
56:16,960;56:19,320;- I mean, that was a piece of passion.
56:19,320;56:23,040;- Well, that 60 yard touchdown was the longest play,
56:23,040;56:26,280;longest offensive play the Patriots had the entire season.
56:26,280;56:27,720;- And it's the longest play the Steelers
56:27,720;56:28,920;have given up too, right?
56:28,920;56:29,760;- I think so.
56:29,760;56:30,600;- All year.
56:30,600;56:31,920;- Yeah, not bad.
56:31,920;56:33,440;- Yeah. You got a worst?
56:33,440;56:34,880;Do you want to, well, do you want to, yeah.
56:34,880;56:36,280;We want to talk about that play for a second
56:36,280;56:38,540;'cause the Paula Marle aspect is interesting
56:38,540;56:39,380;from that play.
56:39,380;56:40,200;- Yeah, yeah.
56:40,200;56:42,680;all it was obviously like, you know, I don't know.
56:42,680;56:44,600;Is he Hall of Famer, right?
56:44,600;56:45,440;You got in this here, didn't you?
56:45,440;56:47,840;- Yeah, he was there.
56:47,840;56:48,680;- Yeah.
56:48,680;56:49,520;- That was the show, yeah.
56:49,520;56:50,600;- And like, was an amazing player,
56:50,600;56:54,080;but he used to do a lot of like off schedule shit, right?
56:54,080;56:54,920;- Yep.
56:54,920;56:59,400;- So he'd like, he was the high safety help for the post.
56:59,400;57:03,160;And you look at the replay and he clearly like took a chance
57:03,160;57:06,120;trying to undercut like a road underneath
57:06,120;57:08,720;and completely left his corner out to dry
57:08,720;57:10,560;and Brady just threw it over the top.
57:10,560;57:13,120;So like that's the other side of the coin
57:13,120;57:15,480;when it came to Paul Malo is Brady.
57:15,480;57:17,200;- He's awesome. - Brady knew how to bait him.
57:17,200;57:18,040;- Yeah. - He answered that.
57:18,040;57:18,880;- Yeah. - Yeah.
57:18,880;57:19,720;- Yeah. - And he just,
57:19,720;57:21,640;he made a call and it was wrong.
57:21,640;57:23,160;- His instincts.
57:23,160;57:24,000;- Yeah.
57:24,000;57:26,160;Well, I mean, sometimes they're wrong, right?
57:26,160;57:28,520;You can watch highlight clips of him just like timing
57:28,520;57:30,680;the snap and jumping over the center to get a sack
57:30,680;57:33,280;on what's supposed to be like a running play.
57:33,280;57:35,320;Those are my favorite things to watch.
57:35,320;57:36,400;- I love that, yeah.
57:36,400;57:38,080;And he had like all sorts of that.
57:38,080;57:42,080;And he's the only one that I've ever seen do that in any sort of consistency.
57:42,080;57:42,960;Yeah, that's true.
57:42,960;57:44,400;He was a man.
57:44,400;57:45,840;Junior Seo used to do it.
57:45,840;57:48,840;Yeah, maybe it was because he would like to run up to the line and like, just get
57:48,840;57:52,400;there and actually Rodney sometimes, Rodney Harris, not nearly as much, obviously,
57:52,400;57:55,560;but he was no trying to jump that snap too.
57:55,560;57:57,560;Um, but I think,
57:57,560;57:58,800;you got got though.
57:58,800;57:59,440;Yeah.
57:59,440;57:59,960;I think,
57:59,960;58:07,280;Paula Malo is kind of almost a poor man's Ed Reed and not to like, take away from
58:07,280;58:11,520;Paul Amalo, but Ed Reed was just like that, but he never made
58:11,520;58:12,760;the mistake. You know what I mean?
58:12,760;58:16,040;I would say Paul Amalo is more of a rich man, Bob Sanders.
58:16,040;58:20,720;Rich man's Bob Sanders.
58:20,720;58:25,160;I'm not even gonna ask you to explain that because I know you
58:25,160;58:25,520;can't.
58:25,520;58:28,600;Both crazy and instinct driven, you know?
58:28,600;58:30,040;All right. Okay.
58:30,040;58:31,320;Well, then I crazy here too.
58:31,320;58:33,200;I'll give it to you. Fuck it.
58:35,080;58:40,040;All right. So my worst, give me your worst. My worst is Bill Kauer.
58:40,040;58:41,360;You're going to like this, Andy.
58:41,360;58:42,400;I love it already.
58:42,400;58:48,840;Not going for the, for kicking it. So it's, they're down 14 in the
58:48,840;58:54,640;start of the fourth. Is that right? 13 29 left in the end of the third.
58:54,640;58:57,840;No, right. Right. The beginning of the fourth. Yeah. So it's the beginning of
58:57,840;59:03,160;the fourth. Yep. Yeah. And 31 17 you're down 31 17 and you have the ball,
59:03,160;59:08,940;the five yard line, you don't get in in three plays and he kicks a field goal to go down
59:08,940;59:15,360;11. Yep. And what was the next? What was also wrong doing or run post like the further
59:15,360;59:21,120;fade and then run it again. Yeah. But then Jerome Bettis, who's like, yeah, you have
59:21,120;59:26,280;the second ranked rushing offense in the entire league. Yeah. If Jerome Bennett scored 14
59:26,280;59:32,160;touchdowns, the quarter left in the AFC championship game. Go for it, dude. Yeah. And well, what
59:32,160;59:37,520;the cameras show next after they kick the field goal. The fans filing out of the stadium.
59:37,520;59:44,000;Yeah, because yeah, that's soft though. They all left so early. Yeah, that's pretty bad to leave
59:44,000;59:48,240;11 point game, but still, I mean, they were leaving before that. But that was when the
59:48,240;59:52,480;exit has happened. That's a pussy move. Dude. Yeah. I don't think anyone blames you if you go
59:52,480;59:55,520;for it there and you don't get it. Like there's not a fan in the world that's going to be like,
59:55,520;01:00:00,800;dog, you know, should have kicked it. Also, you know, when saying that also you have the top rank
01:00:00,800;01:00:04,720;defense in the league. Yeah. And so you're going to, so even if you don't score touchdown, you pin
01:00:04,720;01:00:09,840;the Patriots offense who admittedly Google and say, I'm going to trust my defense as well. And
01:00:09,840;01:00:14,320;it didn't work. Patriots went on a big ass drive. Yeah. The patient, well, the patient in the fourth
01:00:14,320;01:00:18,720;quarter put together two five minute drives that both entered in scores. If you'll go on touchdown,
01:00:18,720;01:00:26,080;you still need two scores. Yeah. Like what's the point? So dumb. Yeah. Love it. Join the dark side,
01:00:26,080;01:00:32,000;Greg. Both literally and figuratively. Turn your light off. Steve, best and worst.
01:00:32,000;01:00:38,480;I don't think anybody has like Pro Bill Coward here. Because the look on his face after
01:00:38,480;01:00:44,080;Rathasberger throws a pick, like seven minutes left and they're down 14. You're gonna see it.
01:00:44,080;01:00:49,760;He's like, Oh, well, we're done. And that was like, I was there for when he threw that fake spike
01:00:49,760;01:00:53,840;interception. That was the worst throw he's thrown in that stadium. But no, the one that was
01:00:53,840;01:00:56,440;- Snack breaking pick was like the worst throw.
01:00:56,440;01:00:57,280;- I don't know.
01:00:57,280;01:00:58,400;(laughing)
01:00:58,400;01:01:00,920;- He overthrows him by like four yards, right to the safety.
01:01:00,920;01:01:01,760;- Oh yeah.
01:01:01,760;01:01:02,640;- And then oh yeah, that's exactly what he did.
01:01:02,640;01:01:04,560;Last playoff game against the Jets.
01:01:04,560;01:01:05,400;- Yeah, that's true, yeah.
01:01:05,400;01:01:06,720;- So he's doing this every game?
01:01:06,720;01:01:08,800;- Yeah, this is what he's known for, cool.
01:01:08,800;01:01:11,360;- Yeah, Eugene Wilson, two interceptions, right?
01:01:11,360;01:01:13,480;- Yeah, yeah, I'm surprised I wasn't your best, Greg.
01:01:13,480;01:01:14,320;I was leaving that for you.
01:01:14,320;01:01:15,320;- Shout out my boy, Eugene.
01:01:15,320;01:01:16,600;- Yeah, boy Eugene.
01:01:16,600;01:01:17,600;- It's no love, dude.
01:01:17,600;01:01:19,880;Now we're going through and getting into the fucking weeds.
01:01:19,880;01:01:22,520;We realize how good he actually was.
01:01:22,520;01:01:23,520;That is correct.
01:01:23,520;01:01:24,520;He was great.
01:01:24,520;01:01:31,920;All right, Steve, give us gives you best and worst, but I have other worst was the punting.
01:01:31,920;01:01:36,280;And which they were like, Oh, the first half the pages dominate in every phase of the game.
01:01:36,280;01:01:38,680;Yeah, it was true, except for the punting.
01:01:38,680;01:01:40,840;That's the one thing they were just terrible at.
01:01:40,840;01:01:46,320;Well, I will say this, Josh Miller, his former team, Pittsburgh Steelers, just throwing that
01:01:46,320;01:01:47,320;out there.
01:01:47,320;01:01:50,880;So he was probably a double agent for them because he punted 50 yard line twice.
01:01:50,880;01:01:51,880;It wasn't great.
01:01:51,880;01:01:53,840;- He was fucking terrible.
01:01:53,840;01:01:56,800;- Although that's probably why he wasn't a stealer anymore too.
01:01:56,800;01:02:00,400;- And I also have a boned pick with a pro football reference.
01:02:00,400;01:02:01,240;- Ooh.
01:02:01,240;01:02:06,440;- There's nothing listed about Hank Poteet in this game.
01:02:06,440;01:02:08,780;- Okay.
01:02:08,780;01:02:10,960;- And he definitely has at least one tackle that I saw.
01:02:10,960;01:02:11,800;- He does, yeah.
01:02:11,800;01:02:16,400;- I don't know like what, and I didn't catch all of this.
01:02:16,400;01:02:17,640;I don't know if you did Andy.
01:02:17,640;01:02:19,000;The commentators are saying-
01:02:19,000;01:02:19,840;- Oh yeah.
01:02:19,840;01:02:24,040;like that pit the week before or he was working at a.
01:02:24,040;01:02:25,720;- No, no, no, no.
01:02:25,720;01:02:28,800;He was attending classes at the University of Pittsburgh
01:02:28,800;01:02:31,960;and he was signed off the street 11 days before this game.
01:02:31,960;01:02:36,540;And he was a former sealer who got cut
01:02:36,540;01:02:39,360;and he had two third down stops in this game.
01:02:39,360;01:02:40,480;One tackle that you're talking about.
01:02:40,480;01:02:43,800;And he also had a hit on the wide receiver
01:02:43,800;01:02:44,640;as he was catching the ball.
01:02:44,640;01:02:46,600;So you call it a pass break, break up.
01:02:46,600;01:02:49,400;So he had two third down stops all by himself.
01:02:49,400;01:02:52,400;He went to undergrad.
01:02:52,400;01:02:53,720;So he's like, who's real name is?
01:02:53,720;01:02:55,060;What's that?
01:02:55,060;01:02:57,720;And Henry Major Poteet the second.
01:02:57,720;01:03:00,640;He's not just a Poteet.
01:03:00,640;01:03:01,800;He's a Major Poteet.
01:03:01,800;01:03:02,800;Major Poteet.
01:03:02,800;01:03:06,160;Henry Major Poteet.
01:03:06,160;01:03:09,000;Fantastic.
01:03:09,000;01:03:11,440;It has him in his like career stats.
01:03:11,440;01:03:13,280;There was 2004 with New England.
01:03:13,280;01:03:15,320;I don't know if he plays in Superbowl or not.
01:03:15,320;01:03:15,960;I don't remember.
01:03:15,960;01:03:19,040;But man, there's something to find out.
01:03:19,040;01:03:21,000;- Troy Brown was out there a lot.
01:03:21,000;01:03:21,840;- Troy, yeah.
01:03:21,840;01:03:25,080;But like we're kind of almost used to seeing it now.
01:03:25,080;01:03:26,680;The comment was like, "Oh, Troy Brown's out there."
01:03:26,680;01:03:27,520;And then pointing him out, I'm like,
01:03:27,520;01:03:28,440;"Well, yeah, of course he is.
01:03:28,440;01:03:30,440;Like he's the nickel corner now.
01:03:30,440;01:03:32,320;What do you want?"
01:03:32,320;01:03:35,640;And they're not throwing it at him anymore.
01:03:35,640;01:03:36,480;Have you noticed that?
01:03:36,480;01:03:37,320;- I haven't.
01:03:37,320;01:03:39,040;- Like he doesn't have a lot of tackles or pass backups
01:03:39,040;01:03:41,280;'cause they're not going to him.
01:03:41,280;01:03:44,280;- Peyton definitely tried to pick on him.
01:03:44,280;01:03:45,360;- A little bit, yeah.
01:03:45,360;01:03:47,160;- He was successful at Stokely.
01:03:47,160;01:03:48,600;- A little bit, yeah.
01:03:48,600;01:03:50,520;But I mean, we haven't heard that in a while.
01:03:50,520;01:03:51,160;Yeah.
01:03:51,160;01:03:53,340;He's got like what three or four interceptions or someplace.
01:03:53,340;01:03:54,720;So yeah, we do throw out them.
01:03:54,720;01:03:55,320;Right.
01:03:55,320;01:03:55,500;Yeah.
01:03:55,500;01:03:55,940;Silly.
01:03:55,940;01:03:57,120;It's quite a lesson.
01:03:57,120;01:03:58,620;It's a bag of, why'd I go after Hank?
01:03:58,620;01:04:03,860;Do was it a goddamn college class down the street last week?
01:04:03,860;01:04:05,460;Clicking economics.
01:04:05,460;01:04:07,860;Taking third down breakups is what he's taking.
01:04:07,860;01:04:10,320;Ridiculous.
01:04:10,320;01:04:11,460;Absolutely ridiculous.
01:04:11,460;01:04:12,360;So is that your worst?
01:04:12,360;01:04:13,100;Yeah.
01:04:13,100;01:04:14,980;I have a, I have a real curve ball.
01:04:14,980;01:04:15,540;Best.
01:04:15,540;01:04:16,460;Oh, all right.
01:04:17,340;01:04:22,980;My best is the Patriots losing to the Steelers earlier this year.
01:04:22,980;01:04:28,020;Not only because I feel it's hard to be the same team twice and they got to
01:04:28,020;01:04:33,980;experience them and they beat them, but can you imagine if the night courage
01:04:33,980;01:04:39,620;wore orange was also the end of the Patriots winning at like 38 games?
01:04:39,620;01:04:41,300;That would be awful.
01:04:41,300;01:04:43,940;Oh, you bring up a great point, Steve.
01:04:43,940;01:04:46,020;I can't argue with terrible.
01:04:46,500;01:04:51,160;That would have been, that would have been, I think that would have been more
01:04:51,160;01:04:53,100;backbreaking, I think, than just losing to them.
01:04:53,100;01:04:54,500;Yeah.
01:04:54,500;01:04:56,140;I think that may have derailed the season.
01:04:56,140;01:04:57,060;I think you might be honest with me.
01:04:57,060;01:04:57,580;Yeah.
01:04:57,580;01:05:00,460;They might, they wouldn't, they would just never mentally recover for that.
01:05:00,460;01:05:02,620;But they already had one loss in the season, right?
01:05:02,620;01:05:02,900;Yeah.
01:05:02,900;01:05:04,460;It would have been undefeated at that point.
01:05:04,460;01:05:05,900;It would have been ahead of the Steelers.
01:05:05,900;01:05:08,860;And instead of just one of those like learning experiences of like, Hey,
01:05:08,860;01:05:11,500;don't get too fucking full of yourself because you can lose this
01:05:11,500;01:05:12,740;fucking garbage dolphin scene.
01:05:12,740;01:05:13,860;Yeah.
01:05:13,860;01:05:15,580;I would have been way more than that.
01:05:15,820;01:05:17,380;Kind of the opposite of 2007, right?
01:05:17,380;01:05:20,060;Where they just, they went and beat everybody and then like ran out of gas at
01:05:20,060;01:05:22,540;the end and just couldn't put that last one together.
01:05:22,540;01:05:23,520;That's right.
01:05:23,520;01:05:27,680;Where I think if they had lost to the giants in that week, 17 game,
01:05:27,680;01:05:28,540;things would have been different.
01:05:28,540;01:05:32,340;Is this Rodney Harrison's only Super Bowl ring?
01:05:32,340;01:05:35,080;No, he won last year.
01:05:35,080;01:05:37,660;He won his last year at the Bat-Sue?
01:05:37,660;01:05:38,400;Yeah.
01:05:38,400;01:05:39,460;2008.
01:05:39,460;01:05:40,860;Cause no, no, no.
01:05:40,860;01:05:43,020;Uh, uh, 2003 I'm saying.
01:05:44,180;01:05:46,580;Oh, the Panthers. Yes.
01:05:46,580;01:05:50,060;Because he that's when he broke his arm and the picture of him in the sling,
01:05:50,060;01:05:52,020;the confetti that was last year.
01:05:52,020;01:05:55,940;All right. Was that your best and worst?
01:05:55,940;01:05:57,940;That was it. All right.
01:05:57,940;01:06:03,180;My best is I'm going to say
01:06:03,180;01:06:09,740;this is perhaps Dion Branch's best two game stretch of his career between this
01:06:09,740;01:06:11,740;game and the week after. Yes.
01:06:12,660;01:06:16,360;Cause he was everywhere in this game.
01:06:16,360;01:06:20,120;He had the, the reverses both went for big yard.
01:06:20,120;01:06:22,860;I think he had like two rushes for 37 yards and a touchdown.
01:06:22,860;01:06:28,280;And then he had whatever catches and I think he had over a hundred yards receiving
01:06:28,280;01:06:29,840;the 60 yard bomb.
01:06:29,840;01:06:33,760;He had another long one that he took an absolute shot from Paula Malu.
01:06:33,760;01:06:36,280;Like as he caught the ball, I don't, I have no idea how he hung on to that.
01:06:36,280;01:06:41,320;Like that's something Paula Malu jars loose like 99 out of a hundred times.
01:06:41,600;01:06:42,600;It was a clean hit too.
01:06:42,600;01:06:43,640;Got him right on the ball.
01:06:43,640;01:06:45,120;But it was, yeah, exactly.
01:06:45,120;01:06:45,320;Yeah.
01:06:45,320;01:06:46,320;On his arms in the ball.
01:06:46,320;01:06:48,760;Literally as he caught the ball and he still hung on.
01:06:48,760;01:06:49,800;I have no idea how he did it.
01:06:49,800;01:06:50,920;So absolutely.
01:06:50,920;01:06:52,960;And this, and then he wins.
01:06:52,960;01:06:54,200;I mean, spoiler alert.
01:06:54,200;01:06:58,600;He wins the super bowl MVP the next week for setting the reception tracker.
01:06:58,600;01:07:00,520;It's just a great trivia question.
01:07:00,520;01:07:02,080;What's up?
01:07:02,080;01:07:04,760;Cause he's the, isn't he the only Patriot besides Tom Brady to win a
01:07:04,760;01:07:06,000;super bowl MVP for the bats?
01:07:06,000;01:07:08,000;Yes.
01:07:08,000;01:07:08,680;He is.
01:07:08,680;01:07:10,640;Did the Edelman win that one?
01:07:10,720;01:07:11,720;- You got some rams?
01:07:11,720;01:07:13,660;- Did he win it?
01:07:13,660;01:07:16,340;- Did they wanna give it to the punter?
01:07:16,340;01:07:19,780;- Oh, no, I think they should have given it to the punter.
01:07:19,780;01:07:21,300;But no, I think Craig might be right.
01:07:21,300;01:07:22,140;- I'll admit.
01:07:22,140;01:07:26,500;- The thief that he is also managed to steal a Super Bowl MVP.
01:07:26,500;01:07:28,500;- Yeah, he's stealing our podcast idea.
01:07:28,500;01:07:30,620;He's stealing Super Bowl MVPs.
01:07:30,620;01:07:31,620;- What a dick.
01:07:31,620;01:07:35,460;All right, what else we got?
01:07:35,460;01:07:37,860;Well, I was gonna talk about Hank Portite.
01:07:37,860;01:07:42,660;We got the worst in the three games of glory.
01:07:42,660;01:07:46,380;Gil and or Geno, wherever it was doing the commentating,
01:07:46,380;01:07:49,760;they think they had the radio commentators on Gil and Geno top notch.
01:07:49,760;01:07:52,460;Could not pronounce Troy Paul and Milo's name.
01:07:52,460;01:07:56,720;So he was Troy Palomalu entire game,
01:07:56,720;01:08:00,460;which I fucking love.
01:08:00,460;01:08:03,020;But tough look.
01:08:03,020;01:08:04,120;Troy Palomalu.
01:08:04,120;01:08:05,920;And what are you going to do? You know, yeah.
01:08:05,920;01:08:07,760;- It's only the third time they've seen him
01:08:07,760;01:08:09,680;and called the game with him.
01:08:09,680;01:08:11,580;- Yeah, I mean, I guess so, but still.
01:08:11,580;01:08:16,060;You're kind of paid to know the names and shit like that,
01:08:16,060;01:08:17,920;but I'll go with it, you know, fuck it.
01:08:17,920;01:08:23,880;So also shout out to the big tuna, Bill Parcells.
01:08:23,880;01:08:30,240;- Big fat tuna.
01:08:30,240;01:08:33,220;- Yeah, Boston Globe article clip.
01:08:33,220;01:08:35,600;Talking about Ben Ross Berger.
01:08:35,600;01:08:37,540;Now the NFL's hottest young quarterback,
01:08:37,540;01:08:39,360;anointed early in the season by Bill Parcells
01:08:39,360;01:08:43,200;as the game's best rookie quarterback since Dan Marino,
01:08:43,200;01:08:44,600;the 22-year-old, Ross Berger,
01:08:44,600;01:08:47,740;and the Steelers on Sunday night will take on the Patriots.
01:08:47,740;01:08:51,320;So, wasn't far off except Ross Berger actually won
01:08:51,320;01:08:53,220;a Super Bowl and wasn't nearly the quarterback,
01:08:53,220;01:08:54,140;Marino was.
01:08:54,140;01:08:56,960;Other than that, nailed it.
01:08:56,960;01:08:58,780;Did somebody else say, "Hey, Greg, that's for you."
01:08:58,780;01:09:00,200;Fucking hate him, Parcells.
01:09:00,200;01:09:02,380;Hope he never gets-- - Big fat tuna.
01:09:02,380;01:09:05,300;Do you think you'll ever get in the Patriots Hall of Fame?
01:09:05,300;01:09:08,660;Patriots? Probably not.
01:09:08,660;01:09:13,540;No. Yeah. Way more people at a way more people.
01:09:13,540;01:09:16,940;We got, he brought the Patriots back to relevance. Yeah.
01:09:16,940;01:09:19,980;He's got a lot of people to overcome who actually, you know, won Superbowls.
01:09:19,980;01:09:22,420;Yeah. So you're gonna say never know.
01:09:22,420;01:09:25,820;Even after they get through all the dynasty guys. Yup.
01:09:25,820;01:09:28,700;Cause there'll be a whole bunch of crew come bottle and Superbowls this year
01:09:28,700;01:09:29,540;that I need to get in.
01:09:29,540;01:09:33,240;the egg goes to you, Brad. And then after that, once Bela
01:09:33,240;01:09:37,100;Chuck retires, yeah, more and more. So just keep going. We
01:09:37,100;01:09:39,260;got to save room for Matt Patricia and Joe judge.
01:09:39,260;01:09:46,880;I can't judge if Joe judge is in the hall page itself. Hey,
01:09:46,880;01:09:51,780;I'll eat my hat on air. Okay. Great. What about your judge or
01:09:51,780;01:09:53,060;Matt Patricia? Give us
01:09:53,060;01:09:58,340;fine. Okay. If either of them are the pages all of fame. Yeah,
01:09:58,340;01:10:00,540;Greg will eat his hat.
01:10:00,540;01:10:02,940;I might have to clip that.
01:10:02,940;01:10:05,900;I'm going to send it to myself 10 years from now, just to see.
01:10:05,900;01:10:07,660;All right, you guys want to make some Patriot season
01:10:07,660;01:10:10,820;predictions on our way out since we are about to start the new year?
01:10:10,820;01:10:15,140;Oh, yeah. Greg, I feel like this is the time of the year
01:10:15,140;01:10:17,540;where we make a jersey bet.
01:10:17,540;01:10:20,780;And what's the Vegas?
01:10:20,780;01:10:23,780;I believe I want to say it's nine and a half.
01:10:23,780;01:10:25,900;Well, let me double check.
01:10:26,340;01:10:29,100;Oh, I should tell them what the fuck it is.
01:10:29,100;01:10:31,100;Oh, it's eight and a half.
01:10:31,100;01:10:33,100;Pager's eight and a half wins for 2022.
01:10:33,100;01:10:35,100;That's a good 10.
01:10:35,100;01:10:37,580;I'll take the end or you got the over.
01:10:37,580;01:10:38,980;And what 10 is a push?
01:10:38,980;01:10:39,980;Yeah.
01:10:39,980;01:10:40,980;All right.
01:10:40,980;01:10:41,980;You said that that high.
01:10:41,980;01:10:42,980;Confidence, huh?
01:10:42,980;01:10:43,980;I like it.
01:10:43,980;01:10:44,980;I think it's about right.
01:10:44,980;01:10:48,860;I think it was nine and a half last year.
01:10:48,860;01:10:50,260;So I'm fine taking the over.
01:10:50,260;01:10:51,260;Let's go.
01:10:51,260;01:10:53,260;What do you think it's going to be, Andy?
01:10:53,260;01:10:55,260;16, 17, whatever.
01:10:55,260;01:10:56,260;17.
01:10:56,260;01:10:57,100;- It doesn't matter.
01:10:57,100;01:11:01,000;- No, I think I said 14 and three on the season.
01:11:01,000;01:11:03,780;- 14 and three.
01:11:03,780;01:11:04,620;- Yeah.
01:11:04,620;01:11:06,020;- He's the anti-Felger Greg.
01:11:06,020;01:11:06,860;- Yeah.
01:11:06,860;01:11:09,220;- The Felger's are gonna be three and 14.
01:11:09,220;01:11:10,620;- They'll start off slow.
01:11:10,620;01:11:11,740;They'll lose one of the games
01:11:11,740;01:11:13,820;for Miami some bullshit like that.
01:11:13,820;01:11:16,340;- Maybe split with the Bills and the rest of that.
01:11:16,340;01:11:17,340;It's gravy.
01:11:17,340;01:11:18,580;Game on.
01:11:18,580;01:11:20,300;Steve, what do you think?
01:11:20,300;01:11:21,300;- I think about 10 wins.
01:11:21,300;01:11:23,380;I think they get pretty good early
01:11:23,380;01:11:28,180;despite everyone else's consternation, you know, they go like three and one,
01:11:28,180;01:11:31,780;they have a nice easy stretch there. Tisha Brown's before Sean's back.
01:11:31,780;01:11:37,060;And then the latter half probably put on that Vikings or Cardinals game and the Bills game.
01:11:37,060;01:11:39,780;That's really good. It's going to, you're going to find out if they're really good team or not.
01:11:39,780;01:11:43,460;But I think they can go 500, close the season out, get around to 10, 11 wins
01:11:43,460;01:11:51,380;back in the playoffs. So all right. 10 wins over, under, over. All right.
01:11:52,100;01:11:56,420;And Greg, you think under 10 wins? Yeah. Okay. What do you,
01:11:56,420;01:11:59,300;well give me a number. Like how under are you feeling it?
01:11:59,300;01:12:04,820;Eight, nine, nine and eight. Oh, then you're a 500 team.
01:12:04,820;01:12:09,860;Wow. Greg Brown, the pissy little moner of the Brown family. Who knows?
01:12:09,860;01:12:11,380;Yeah. Ye of little faith.
01:12:11,380;01:12:15,300;Right. Get some joy in your life, Greg.
01:12:15,300;01:12:18,020;I did. I have plenty of joy. I have plenty of joy.
01:12:18,020;01:12:18,820;Yeah. Sounds like it.
01:12:19,700;01:12:23,540;Andy, we just spent an hour and a half listening to you fucking complain about everything.
01:12:23,540;01:12:27,620;Yeah. And now I feel great. Sometimes you just got to get some shit off your chest.
01:12:27,620;01:12:32,660;And then, you know, I'm happy as a clam. And I go, snuggle my little bundle of joy inside.
01:12:32,660;01:12:36,740;That'd be great. Are these the things that are really on your chest or is this just...
01:12:36,740;01:12:41,700;Hey, I got nothing but love for everything else.
01:12:41,700;01:12:47,060;Fucking commentators and referees. Yeah. What about traffic, Andy, and people driving?
01:12:47,620;01:12:49,120;I was spending a car with you.
01:12:49,120;01:12:50,120;(laughs)
01:12:50,120;01:12:51,740;- Are you really mad at the referees, Andy,
01:12:51,740;01:12:52,980;or is it something else in your life?
01:12:52,980;01:12:54,220;- So what I--
01:12:54,220;01:12:56,060;- You're referring your rage onto these referees.
01:12:56,060;01:12:59,780;- Would you like to know what makes me mad?
01:12:59,780;01:13:00,940;And it's one thing--
01:13:00,940;01:13:02,820;- Let's just start with what doesn't make you mad.
01:13:02,820;01:13:04,500;- No, it's literally one thing.
01:13:04,500;01:13:06,980;And it's things that don't work the way they're supposed to.
01:13:06,980;01:13:09,740;- I'm not a good self. - And that includes people.

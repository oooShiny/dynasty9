00:46,680;00:51,960;"How's it going? You know, I just, just like Troy Brown, just whatever you guys asked me,"
00:51,960;00:58,520;"I'll, I'll get it out and make it happen. Well, unlike the Patriots defensive backfield"
00:58,520;01:02,840;"in this game, Steve actually showed up. So thanks for that. And we have Greg back. He"
01:02,840;01:07,480;"haven't had Greg in a while, kind of like Corey Dillon in this game. Haven't seen him in a few"
01:07,480;01:12,520;"weeks, but he's back to you. How you doing, James? Good summer Greg, you know,"
01:12,520;01:13,720;"- I'm a man."
01:13,720;01:14,720;"- Yeah."
01:14,720;01:16,860;"- He's a partian, living large."
01:16,860;01:18,760;"(banging)"
01:18,760;01:19,600;"- Oh yeah?"
01:19,600;01:21,600;"So what you been doing really?"
01:21,600;01:22,840;"- You know, nothing."
01:22,840;01:23,680;"- Work hard."
01:23,680;01:25,120;"(laughing)"
01:25,120;01:25,960;"- Not even."
01:25,960;01:26,800;"(laughing)"
01:26,800;01:28,240;"- There's a lot of YouTube."
01:28,240;01:29,960;"(laughing)"
01:29,960;01:32,600;"- Scrolling, you know, social media,"
01:32,600;01:33,960;"Reddit for hours on end."
01:33,960;01:34,800;"- Yeah."
01:34,800;01:36,960;"- Until I feel actually pain in my body."
01:36,960;01:39,200;"(laughing)"
01:39,200;01:41,360;"- So the usual, okay."
01:41,360;01:42,200;"- Yeah, yeah, you do."
01:42,200;01:43,040;"- Nice, all right."
01:43,040;01:49,640;"So this week we're talking about 2004, week nine."
01:49,640;01:53,440;"The Patriots headed to St. Louis, Missouri?"
01:53,440;01:55,360;"- Missouri, yeah, that feels right."
01:55,360;01:56,360;"St. Louis, Missouri."
01:56,360;02:01,440;"- To take on the St. Louis at the time Rams,"
02:01,440;02:02,680;"we're now the LA Rams."
02:02,680;02:07,480;"This is the rematch of Super Bowl 36."
02:07,480;02:09,720;"- These two teams haven't seen each other since then."
02:09,720;02:16,840;"the Patriots beat the Rams in that game. A lot of stuff is the same. Same head coach,"
02:16,840;02:25,600;"Mike Martz. Same offensive weapons. Isaac Bruce. Who else is on it? Tory Holtz, Marshall"
02:25,600;02:32,240;"Falk. But there's some new things. I didn't see Ricky Pearl show up. I don't think he"
02:32,240;02:36,640;"may have been on the team, but if he was, huh? He was on the Panthers. Oh, that's right."
02:36,640;02:38,840;"Yeah, he was on the Panthers in 2003."
02:38,840;02:39,680;"Yeah."
02:39,680;02:41,640;"Yeah."
02:41,640;02:44,640;"But there were some new names that we saw."
02:44,640;02:48,320;"Quarterback is no longer a grocery bagger."
02:48,320;02:50,920;"It is now Mark Bulger who coming into this game"
02:50,920;02:54,640;"was the winningest quarterback by win percentage,"
02:54,640;02:56,840;"who would start at least 10 games."
02:56,840;02:58,040;"I don't think that held up,"
02:58,040;03:00,400;"but we may need to stat check it."
03:00,400;03:02,640;"Yeah, I was pissed about that one."
03:02,640;03:05,000;"I saw that Kurt Warner wasn't starting,"
03:05,000;03:07,120;"that they just threw him on the trash heap."
03:07,120;03:07,960;"- They did, yeah."
03:07,960;03:10,720;"- Like two years ago,"
03:10,720;03:13,600;"he was starting in the Super Bowl Forum, winning MVPs."
03:13,600;03:15,480;"- Yeah, for like the greatest show on turf,"
03:15,480;03:17,560;"the best offense the NFL has ever seen."
03:17,560;03:18,640;"- Yeah."
03:18,640;03:20,720;"- I think he suffered at some injuries though."
03:20,720;03:23,280;"- He struggled a bit because of it."
03:23,280;03:25,880;"- So apparently he missed a bunch of games,"
03:25,880;03:28,360;"after the Super Bowl season against the Pats,"
03:28,360;03:30,560;"he missed a bunch of games,"
03:30,560;03:32,040;"and like he only played seven games."
03:32,040;03:34,360;"And the next year he only played one game"
03:34,360;03:36,120;"he fumbled six times."
03:36,120;03:37,320;"- Six times?"
03:37,320;03:38,160;"Holy crap."
03:38,160;03:39,520;"- That's a good one."
03:39,520;03:42,280;"- That's a, a broken thumb so he couldn't hold the ball."
03:42,280;03:44,800;"But then that, dude, just get off the field."
03:44,800;03:47,240;"- I think that, I can't hold the ball."
03:47,240;03:48,080;"- I just need to do it."
03:48,080;03:48,920;"- Yeah, yeah."
03:48,920;03:50,640;"- After the first three, you gotta realize something's not,"
03:50,640;03:53,160;"not right and this isn't gonna go well."
03:53,160;03:56,800;"And also, Steve, I'm glad you're here"
03:56,800;04:01,680;"because this is, I think it may have been your favorite player"
04:01,680;04:07,120;"while Steven Jackson. Is that right? No, just because his name is the same as mine."
04:07,120;04:11,520;"It doesn't mean no, I really thought you were a huge Steven Jackson fan. No. No. All right."
04:11,520;04:13,840;"Well, fuck it. Who's a big Steven? You can leave."
04:13,840;04:22,000;"The name spelled the same. Yeah, he spells with a V. Wouldn't ask. It's like Greg with two G's."
04:22,000;04:25,120;"Double G Greg's the word. Correct. Go to the halter. Now,"
04:25,120;04:29,760;"pitch to Greg Berhalter too. But who's the guy that he's right for you? Or maybe still does"
04:29,760;04:35,600;"right for you. It's been like a super pedantic prick. Yeah. I swear to God, every Greg with"
04:35,600;04:40,320;"three G's in it is just a decade. I didn't think of those three G's. Who was the who was"
04:40,320;04:45,960;"the coach in the in the bills for a while to Greg Greg Williams. Greg Williams. Yeah."
04:45,960;04:51,360;"I don't know. I don't know anything. Yeah. And the U.S. Men's national team coach right"
04:51,360;04:56,840;"now that's like shit in his pants every game playing like Trinidad and Tobago. He's a he's"
04:56,840;04:59,240;"a triple G to triple G."
04:59,240;05:00,080;"Jesus."
05:00,080;05:01,120;"Fucking wild."
05:01,120;05:01,840;"Yeah."
05:01,840;05:03,240;"See what I was going to say."
05:03,240;05:05,400;"They got a nickname is triple G."
05:05,400;05:09,280;"Everyone on Reddit calls them because they hate him so much."
05:09,280;05:12,840;"That feels right."
05:12,840;05:13,600;"Yeah."
05:13,600;05:15,200;"Um, yeah."
05:15,200;05:16,440;"So, um,"
05:16,440;05:22,640;"the other player who is still the same, but a little bit different in this game is Grant Williams,"
05:22,640;05:26,720;"offensive lineman who started in that Super Bowl."
05:26,720;05:32,520;"on the offensive line for the Patriots, but is now starting for the Rams and"
05:32,520;05:38,240;"That's also good for the Patriots because he was fucking terrible in this game. You gave a handful of sacks"
05:38,240;05:40,640;"It's good for him"
05:40,640;05:43,400;"And also I think we've already talked I"
05:43,400;05:49,680;"Think we did like a bit of a deep dive last time during the Super Bowl about Leonard little and how much of a scumbag he was"
05:49,680;05:54,840;"But he's an easy dude to dislike. Yeah, I just wanted that out there"
05:56,000;06:03,080;"Let's fuck that guy also the Rams are at two and a half point favorites coming into this game. Yeah, I found quite shocking"
06:03,080;06:06,360;"Right, I guess you get the three points are being at home"
06:06,360;06:10,900;"So it's a coming off a 20 whatever game win streak"
06:10,900;06:15,200;"Like against the four and three Rams it's like jeez"
06:15,200;06:21,200;"People must have been flying on Mark Bulger. I feel like I remember Mark Bulger being like a"
06:21,960;06:28,680;"The hot ticket. Yeah. Yeah, so Mike Mark Bulger 15 and one at home in his career coming into this game"
06:28,680;06:30,680;"So he doesn't lose a whole yeah"
06:30,680;06:33,760;"That didn't last"
06:33,760;06:36,880;"None of it. I don't think any of these stats lasted. Do you have his his?"
06:36,880;06:39,600;"His numbers like career-wise"
06:39,600;06:44,280;"My guess is he didn't win a ton of games down the stretch. But while you're looking that up"
06:44,280;06:47,600;"We'll talk about the Patriots coming in this game"
06:48,440;06:53,920;"Last week Steve I think may still be angry at me for continuing to talk about it"
06:53,920;06:56,360;"Because that was a bad game"
06:56,360;07:02,220;"But their doors blown off by the stele's why was it a bad episode?"
07:02,220;07:09,720;"Stephen doesn't like to talk about losses which we I think we had all forgotten because"
07:09,720;07:12,280;"We haven't had one in 20 something episodes"
07:13,680;07:18,500;"And I had other stuff I wanted to talk about because I actually watched the game and you weren't quick to go on"
07:18,500;07:21,920;"This stupid tangents and fill a bunch of time with a bunch of shit"
07:21,920;07:24,920;"So all I need to talk about was the Steelers and how the worst"
07:24,920;07:32,260;"Yeah, no, that's that's pretty accurate rendition of what happened last time"
07:32,260;07:36,560;"Is stat check mark Boulger"
07:36,560;07:40,160;"he"
07:40,160;07:42,880;"2007 he went two and ten"
07:42,880;07:45,880;"2008, two and 13 2009, one and seven."
07:45,880;07:50,240;"So yeah, I think the wheels came off a little bit there at the end."
07:50,240;07:50,960;"It sounds like it."
07:50,960;07:51,960;"Yeah. Yeah."
07:51,960;07:53,680;"Great. Okay. Oops."
07:53,680;07:56,800;"But coming into this, he was, he was hot."
07:56,800;08:00,920;"So maybe as the pages just rallied them or maybe they showed the, I don't know."
08:00,920;08:06,520;"Cause he had won a bunch of games coming into this, but the Patriots got their"
08:06,520;08:12,160;"doors blown off in Pittsburgh last week and came into this game with literally"
08:12,160;08:14,160;"No defense packs, huh?"
08:14,160;08:20,520;"Halloween, right? Yes, there we goes. You guys dress up. You should dress up for the Halloween game. I dressed up"
08:20,520;08:24,360;"Maybe a little Halloween spooky costume"
08:24,360;08:29,760;"He goes the game was spooky enough Steve. What's your Halloween costume this year gonna be?"
08:29,760;08:34,640;"I'm gonna be in Arizona for Halloween salt. I'm gonna have a costume. There's gonna be a card on"
08:34,640;08:37,200;"There's gonna be a cactus"
08:37,200;08:38,520;"Paint yourself green"
08:38,520;08:42,200;"Dude, that's a good one Andy. Just walk around with your arms up and like go post"
08:42,200;08:48,640;"Well cacti shave your head if you don't want to go all"
08:48,640;08:55,400;"You can just tell people to shut up and get away from me. He has to be exactly. I just be a complete people be a prick. Yeah"
08:55,400;08:59,040;"It's good. I might steal that"
08:59,040;09:04,720;"A lot of green paint, okay, you can be Greg Berhalter"
09:06,720;09:08,720;"The same thing right prickly"
09:08,720;09:12,600;"Greg Williams even"
09:12,600;09:17,520;"Yeah, but speaking of prickly this defensive back feel for the Patriots"
09:17,520;09:20,840;"Super prickly because there was nobody there"
09:20,840;09:24,080;"Yeah, how did we get here?"
09:24,080;09:27,720;"So tie law heard himself last game remember Steve"
09:27,720;09:33,400;"Right and that's that's when the wheels fell off for the imagine that"
09:34,920;09:42,980;"Right, but Steve was I think Steve's I thought that may have been his last snap as a patriot. Yeah, pretty sure. What's just that's a tough way to go out"
09:42,980;09:47,880;"And then Tyrone pool also I think I'd injured"
09:47,880;09:54,320;"I don't know if it was during that game or during the practice up to this but he didn't start at all and then on literally the second"
09:54,320;09:56,380;"defensive play from scrimmage"
09:56,380;10:00,220;"Asante Samuel tried to tackle someone and that's all all he needed to do"
10:01,240;10:06,040;"Try to tackle the tight end and I think separated shoulders and then like that. So he was out"
10:06,040;10:12,060;"Which meant your defensive backs were decks to read and Earthwind, Morland?"
10:12,060;10:17,080;"Which all-time all-time name team I think"
10:17,080;10:20,320;"Easy urban have a nickname for him"
10:20,320;10:23,320;"I was gonna be earth winded fire"
10:23,320;10:29,840;"Well, do you know how he got his name? No, he's got a birth winded fire, right? Yeah"
10:29,840;10:31,840;"Obviously"
10:31,840;10:42,340;"This is whole back. No, it's names earth when obviously his mom say your band is earth when in fire come on dumbass"
10:42,340;10:47,240;"Yeah, I could have been his dad's river band seriously was on his Wikipedia"
10:47,240;10:53,960;"I mean that's gotta be like the first line of Wikipedia is why the fuck is he named earthwind?"
10:53,960;10:58,840;"Hmm. I mean, that's a pretty badass name though earth when moorland is right"
10:58,840;11:01,840;"So fucking fire name in itself."
11:01,840;11:02,840;"Yeah."
11:02,840;11:03,840;"It really is."
11:03,840;11:07,320;"That's why they didn't put the fire in there is because it because you didn't."
11:07,320;11:08,320;"So fire it."
11:08,320;11:09,320;"It could be in middle name."
11:09,320;11:10,320;"You never know."
11:10,320;11:11,320;"Yeah."
11:11,320;11:12,320;"You know, I'm not just before you go."
11:12,320;11:13,320;"No, I looked into that."
11:13,320;11:18,760;"I don't know, but it starts with a C. Earth wouldn't see."
11:18,760;11:19,760;"Or Neelius."
11:19,760;11:20,760;"Yeah."
11:20,760;11:22,600;"It's got to be some badass."
11:22,600;11:23,600;"Chad."
11:23,600;11:24,600;"Chad wicked."
11:24,600;11:33,860;"So yeah, him and Dexter Reed and Randall Gay, I believe it was, are your three defensive"
11:33,860;11:39,420;"backs, which means, actually that's two defensive backs, two corner backs and the safety with"
11:39,420;11:42,180;"your boy Greg Brown."
11:42,180;11:43,180;"Wilson."
11:43,180;11:44,180;"Yeah."
11:44,180;11:45,180;"Eugene Wilson."
11:45,180;11:53,500;"So they needed a slot corner to play in the nickel because the rands like to run three"
11:53,500;12:01,780;"wide receiver sets a lot. And so this is a sneaky game because this is the first ever"
12:01,780;12:08,100;"appearance of two way player wide receiver and cornerback Troy Brown."
12:08,100;12:11,980;"Well, well, well, well, he's a three way player wide receiver. Yeah."
12:11,980;12:17,460;"Come on returner kick returner. That's true. All right. Four way play. He's lined up a"
12:17,460;12:21,740;"quarterback ones too. Running back. Throw it all in. Yeah, he's he's taking some"
12:21,740;12:26,300;"Gunner he's definitely a gunner at some point he must have been yet"
12:26,300;12:31,300;"Pun blocked slash pitch to other guy"
12:31,300;12:42,180;"Block that yeah, whatever the hell that player was so I think well obviously the AFC championship game in a one was his like"
12:42,180;12:46,140;"Peak Troy Brown moment. This may be like number two"
12:47,020;12:49,620;"Peak Troy Brown because he yeah"
12:49,620;12:52,900;"Because here's his stat line in this game, right?"
12:52,900;12:58,220;"I have a counter rocket. Go ahead. All right. Yeah a couple catches"
12:58,220;13:01,900;"one for a touchdown not off of Tom Brady"
13:01,900;13:05,220;"And played"
13:05,220;13:08,820;"He wasn't actually pun returning in this game because obviously another shit to do"
13:08,820;13:14,620;"but he also was in coverage for like half the game and"
13:16,620;13:20,980;"Actually had a pass breakup that probably would have been an interception if the ball wasn't tipped at the last scrimmage"
13:20,980;13:22,860;"so"
13:22,860;13:26,060;"Pass breakups, and I think you may have actually been in on one of the tackles"
13:26,060;13:31,680;"I don't think I credit for or not but it was definitely in the vicinity is three tackles three tackles"
13:31,680;13:34,220;"right, ha see there you go"
13:34,220;13:37,820;"So and he's covering the likes of Isaac Bruce and fucking"
13:37,820;13:40,980;"not Ricky proul whom I think of"
13:41,820;13:47,020;"Tori Holt, I forget his name every time Tori Holt, so it's not like he's covering scrubs either. He's uh"
13:47,020;13:50,220;"He did get turned around once, but that's okay"
13:50,220;13:55,900;"And he had a past interference call on the which I will say right now absolute bullshit"
13:55,900;14:01,020;"It was it was back in the time of the league where they were doing like face guarding that they don't call anymore"
14:01,020;14:06,140;"They didn't even touch the guy but like jumped in front of him and didn't turn his head in mouth. Yeah one of those bullshit calls"
14:06,140;14:08,540;"So he's saying he was sorry to call it"
14:08,540;14:11,420;"- Last breakups, one on the stat sheet."
14:11,420;14:14,780;"- It kind of makes sense to me though,"
14:14,780;14:18,280;"'cause it's like how much of playing cornerback"
14:18,280;14:19,800;"is like Xs and Os?"
14:19,800;14:22,060;"I can't imagine it's that much, right?"
14:22,060;14:26,700;"- I think having washed him,"
14:26,700;14:29,860;"the only time he got confused is when he had to play his own."
14:29,860;14:30,700;"- Yeah, that makes sense."
14:30,700;14:31,540;"- 'Cause that's tough."
14:31,540;14:34,140;"But if you just line up man to man, I think a lot"
14:34,140;14:35,340;"of the wide receivers stuff translate,"
14:35,340;14:37,220;"'cause he knows what the guy in front of him is trying to get."
14:37,220;14:41,660;"And it's like, just be quick, you know, quick feet, you know,"
14:41,660;14:43,660;"get your head turned around at the right time,"
14:43,660;14:46,620;"like technique stuff more so than like, yeah,"
14:46,620;14:49,260;"know your zone or like, you know,"
14:49,260;14:51,460;"- Yeah, you gotta know coverage things."
14:51,460;14:52,300;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
14:52,300;14:54,460;"- You gotta know how to pass off the guys or whatever."
14:54,460;14:56,540;"So it actually, it got me thinking,"
14:56,540;15:00,220;"obviously we know Edelman played in a similar situation."
15:00,220;15:01,700;"Is there anybody on today's team"
15:01,700;15:04,020;"that you think could do the same thing?"
15:04,020;15:04,860;"- Gunner."
15:06,180;15:09,420;"- Yeah, I think part of the turn is in general."
15:09,420;15:10,260;"- Cool."
15:10,260;15:14,220;"- So it's funny, because I actually like,"
15:14,220;15:16,660;"I was like, you know, I wonder if this has been done"
15:16,660;15:19,060;"more often and I looked it up and there was a Reddit threat"
15:19,060;15:21,380;"if someone asking that question."
15:21,380;15:24,220;"And it was back when Nelson Agler is on the Eagles"
15:24,220;15:26,580;"and he goes, he goes, ""Nelson Agler,"
15:26,580;15:28,380;"""please defensive back right now."""
15:28,380;15:30,020;"(laughing)"
15:30,020;15:31,540;"He's like, ""He's knocked down more passes"
15:31,540;15:32,700;"""than I can count."""
15:32,700;15:33,700;"- Ah, shit."
15:35,020;15:37,900;"I mean, that's a timely throwback right there."
15:37,900;15:39,780;"Considering you just watched the Cowboys game"
15:39,780;15:43,580;"and him throw a pass to the ground in overtime."
15:43,580;15:44,420;"- Awesome."
15:44,420;15:45,820;"- But he probably, if he had caught it,"
15:45,820;15:47,420;"would have gone for the distance."
15:47,420;15:51,340;"- Such a, such a filly spin joke to make though."
15:51,340;15:52,660;"I love that whole like,"
15:52,660;15:54,860;"making fun of Agilor a bit they do."
15:54,860;15:55,700;"- It's so good."
15:55,700;15:58,420;"- Oh my God."
15:58,420;16:00,420;"- So, do you, do you,"
16:00,420;16:03,740;"can you think of anybody else that's done it in the past?"
16:03,740;16:06,160;"- Two, eight."
16:06,160;16:07,600;"- Been like recent history,"
16:07,600;16:08,840;"'cause obviously like, you know,"
16:08,840;16:11,120;"the wicked old school guys all the way."
16:11,120;16:16,120;"- I know we saw Terrell Buckley line up as wide receiver."
16:16,120;16:20,480;"I'm gonna guess Dion Sanders probably did as well."
16:20,480;16:21,320;"- Yeah."
16:21,320;16:25,920;"- Do you have a list?"
16:25,920;16:26,760;"- Yeah, yeah."
16:26,760;16:28,080;"I mean, just from that Reddit thread,"
16:28,080;16:30,480;"it's not like I couldn't find anything like solved."
16:30,480;16:31,320;"- Right."
16:31,320;16:34,180;"- Yeah, hints that you can give us."
16:34,180;16:36,820;"- I mean, the thing that jumped out to me is,"
16:36,820;16:39,700;"there's not a lot of people going from receiver"
16:39,700;16:41,580;"to defensive back."
16:41,580;16:42,500;"- That's the other way around."
16:42,500;16:43,580;"- That's the other way around,"
16:43,580;16:44,580;"which I think is just like,"
16:44,580;16:46,500;"we have this really talented athletic guy"
16:46,500;16:48,220;"that's trying to get him involved."
16:48,220;16:49,580;"- Like a Devin Hester type of thing."
16:49,580;16:50,420;"- Devin Hester, Captain."
16:50,420;16:51,620;"- Just get him to God to be your son."
16:51,620;16:52,980;"- Yeah, yeah."
16:52,980;16:55,980;"- Oh yeah, there was one guy that led me down,"
16:55,980;16:57,220;"a little rabbit hole here."
16:57,220;16:59,660;"Have you heard the name Mike Furrey?"
17:00,620;17:03,020;"No, no, I don't know why I reckon."
17:03,020;17:03,900;"Bigly. Yeah."
17:03,900;17:04,420;"Big."
17:04,420;17:05,020;"Yeah."
17:05,020;17:06,300;"Mike Furrier."
17:06,300;17:08,060;"This is this guy's story."
17:08,060;17:12,340;"He's just he's like a white guy that's the same size and height as me."
17:12,340;17:13,860;"Six foot 170."
17:13,860;17:19,660;"He's like a he's like a all state in in high school."
17:19,660;17:21,180;"He sets all these high school records."
17:21,180;17:26,420;"He'd go he walks on at Ohio State, but he's sitting behind Terry Glenn and Eddie"
17:26,420;17:27,300;"George there."
17:27,300;17:29,460;"So he can't get any playing time."
17:29,900;17:32,780;"So he transfers to UNI, Northern Iowa."
17:32,780;17:33,780;"Okay."
17:33,780;17:37,500;"I think he might have played with current Warner 50 years lineup."
17:37,500;17:39,180;"No, no, he would have been after a question."
17:39,180;17:43,940;"But either way, he's a three time all American at UNI."
17:43,940;17:48,020;"Undrafted goes to the XFL."
17:48,020;17:54,380;"Yeah. XFL dispands goes to the arena league, sets a shitload of records in the arena league."
17:54,380;17:58,340;"Eventually gets picked up by St."
17:58,340;18:02,900;"Lewis. Okay. And of course it, it might be now."
18:02,900;18:07,700;"2004 ish. Yeah, 2004. I think he's on this team."
18:07,700;18:12,780;"So but he doesn't, they can't, they don't want him to play wide receiver,"
18:12,780;18:15,980;"which is what he was playing in college. So he's playing safety."
18:15,980;18:22,700;"So in 2005, he has four interceptions and 58 tackles playing free safety for"
18:22,700;18:27,060;"the ramps. He gets traded to Detroit."
18:27,060;18:30,740;"And they have all these injuries on the wide receiver."
18:30,740;18:36,460;"So he switches sides and the very next year he catches 98 balls for a thousand 86 yards"
18:36,460;18:37,460;"and six touchdowns."
18:37,460;18:39,940;"I had a picture as a pack."
18:39,940;18:40,940;"Yeah."
18:40,940;18:41,940;"Holy shit."
18:41,940;18:45,060;"What a fucking legend dude."
18:45,060;18:46,060;"Yeah."
18:46,060;18:47,060;"Yeah."
18:47,060;18:54,300;"In this area is Mike Furry three targets one catch eight yards in 2004 with the with the"
18:54,300;18:55,300;"Rams."
18:55,300;18:56,300;"Yeah."
18:56,300;19:00,000;"Jesus Christ, it's all over the place."
19:00,000;19:02,400;"And then doesn't really do much anything after that though."
19:02,400;19:03,740;"Like that one year was it."
19:03,740;19:08,560;"- But imagine how gratifying that year was for him."
19:08,560;19:09,400;"- Oh my God."
19:09,400;19:12,320;"- To just be like every coach that ever fucking doubted me"
19:12,320;19:13,400;"can suck you."
19:13,400;19:16,560;"- Thousand yard season baby."
19:16,560;19:17,800;"- I think so, you can't take that on."
19:17,800;19:20,760;"- You know like what Joey Harrington throwing on the ball."
19:20,760;19:22,400;"- Yeah, yeah."
19:22,400;19:23,840;"- Yeah, 2006, yeah."
19:25,760;19:29,060;"So shout out Mike Furry if you're out there listening."
19:29,060;19:31,180;"I'm a Mike Furry stand."
19:31,180;19:32,660;"- They both ways, good friend."
19:32,660;19:33,500;"- Yeah."
19:33,500;19:37,820;"- And also imagine a guy my size point in the NFL."
19:37,820;19:39,660;"That's safety."
19:39,660;19:42,500;"- The quarterback was John Kittena actually."
19:42,500;19:43,500;"Thank you very much Steve."
19:43,500;19:44,780;"- Nice."
19:44,780;19:47,500;"- Who actually threw for 4,000 yards that year?"
19:47,500;19:48,900;"- 21 touchdowns."
19:48,900;19:49,740;"- Pretty good."
19:49,740;19:50,580;"- Kaboodle."
19:50,580;19:51,420;"- 2,200 exceptions."
19:51,420;19:52,260;"Not so good."
19:55,020;20:01,200;"But yeah, that's that's fucking stuff. Yeah, the paradox of Kittena right there. Yeah. Yeah"
20:01,200;20:08,380;"That was the Roy Williams years Jesus. Okay, so any other notables that played both ways Greg"
20:08,380;20:11,180;"No, those are really only names that were"
20:11,180;20:16,020;"That jumped out. I mean I tried to do a lot of searchin on the internet. That's all I really found"
20:16,020;20:18,700;"Well, if any listeners have any"
20:18,700;20:21,700;"Guys that we mess let us know two-way players. Yeah"
20:22,500;20:24,500;"Geno capo letti"
20:24,500;20:29,940;"Did everything didn't they oh yeah some of those old-school guys played like fucking every play it again"
20:29,940;20:37,340;"Oh, yeah dick dick buck has played like tight end and linebackers. Yeah, or like quarterback and free safety. It's like"
20:37,340;20:42,580;"Yeah, well that trans that guy. That's also when they were playing part-time"
20:42,580;20:48,940;"When they weren't being doing their full-time job is you know a plumber. Yeah. Yeah smoking butts at halftime"
20:48,940;20:52,100;"Yeah"
20:52,100;20:56,580;"All right. Well, I'm going to watch this game."
20:56,580;20:59,820;"Sucker."
20:59,820;21:01,180;"Suck to be you."
21:01,180;21:05,620;"No, but I was thinking that Greg, your rating system, right?"
21:05,620;21:08,420;"Do you even remember what it is?"
21:08,420;21:09,420;"Yep."
21:09,420;21:10,420;"All right."
21:10,420;21:11,980;"Give me the rundown again."
21:11,980;21:16,420;"No, I don't remember."
21:16,420;21:17,980;"I think something you would remember."
21:17,980;21:19,700;"I remember there's a name game."
21:20,420;21:25,860;"the games that have a name like the yeah like the day of a patent game or the snowball yeah exactly"
21:25,860;21:32,100;"yeah um and then there was like the bottom was just like your normal was a loss and then it was"
21:32,100;21:40,260;"like your normal like like regular season's jett's getting it yeah yeah yeah yeah hidden gems hidden"
21:40,260;21:45,300;"gems all right so there was a hit was there hidden gems i couldn't remember yeah because i think this"
21:45,300;21:49,860;"falls, you wouldn't remember unless you actually looked it up again."
21:49,860;21:52,360;"Yeah, I think this falls under the hidden jobs one."
21:52,360;21:52,780;"Yeah."
21:52,780;21:56,180;"Close ones where like you don't remember it all but it's where it's"
21:56,180;21:58,460;"going back and rewatching because there was some great shit that"
21:58,460;22:03,240;"happened. And we're not going to go too deep into it just because"
22:03,240;22:04,620;"again, I'm going to watch this."
22:04,620;22:07,380;"Well, I have a quote from Bill Belichick to that point."
22:07,380;22:07,980;"Okay."
22:07,980;22:12,020;"He said, probably as complete a victory as I've ever been around."
22:12,020;22:13,220;"Wow."
22:13,220;22:13,740;"Okay."
22:15,020;22:16,020;"That's rich."
22:16,020;22:19,820;"Yeah, that's kind of surprising to hear from you."
22:19,820;22:22,660;"Defense special teams and offense, baby."
22:22,660;22:26,860;"Yeah, I mean, the defense at the end of the first half got"
22:26,860;22:30,100;"a strip sack of bulger that they turned into a field goal"
22:30,100;22:31,900;"at the end of the half."
22:31,900;22:33,660;"Yeah, five sacks, right?"
22:33,660;22:34,940;"Put them up in 1915."
22:34,940;22:36,300;"Yep."
22:36,300;22:39,380;"Got a bunch of sacks on this."
22:39,380;22:42,740;"I think it's supposed to be a pretty good offense still,"
22:42,740;22:44,460;"even in even though there's no current warrant."
22:44,460;22:50,060;"not the great issue on turf like this still weapons. And they held them to 22 points."
22:50,060;22:55,820;"That's one 40 to 22, by the way. Six in the NFL. Yeah, yards."
22:55,820;22:59,260;"Exactly. So this team could put it. This team could move the ball and they did kind of move"
22:59,260;23:06,300;"the ball. They just couldn't finish drives, basically. And that was also with Troy Brown"
23:06,300;23:11,020;"at defensive back. So that probably added something to it. But yeah, there was a lot of pressure. I"
23:11,020;23:15,300;"I mean, I think at least one or two of the sacks were on three-man rushes."
23:15,300;23:16,260;"It was like one of those."
23:16,260;23:17,260;"That's pretty bad."
23:17,260;23:17,860;"Yeah."
23:17,860;23:22,020;"It was like, it was pretty defensively overwhelming."
23:22,020;23:27,700;"Um, and then you had Adam Minnitary who probably gets the game ball in this, I would"
23:27,700;23:31,940;"think, at least shares it with Troy Brown because he went four for four"
23:31,940;23:34,300;"unfilled goals and none of them were gimmees."
23:34,300;23:36,860;"They were like 40 plus yarders."
23:36,860;23:40,100;"Uh, and he also had a touchdown pass, which."
23:40,100;23:46,100;"You want to you want to describe that? Yeah, probably play it again play. I'm a little surprised. We haven't seen it since I didn't even know"
23:46,100;23:48,100;"He had a touchdown pass"
23:48,100;23:49,940;"He does and it's right here"
23:49,940;23:55,080;"Did you see the play Stevie I did watch the highlight on the website? Yes"
23:55,080;24:00,040;"It's not yeah, it's actually pretty impressive play the"
24:00,040;24:03,620;"CBS coverage of it leaves a lot to be desired"
24:03,620;24:08,260;"Which I will rant on in a second, but let's talk about the play first"
24:09,140;24:13,700;"Basically, they send the--"
24:13,700;24:16,020;"trying to kick a field goal from the five-yard line,"
24:16,020;24:19,580;"they've already kicked four at this point."
24:19,580;24:21,900;"And this is their first drive of their quarter."
24:21,900;24:25,900;"So they're up like 1914 at this point."
24:25,900;24:29,940;"And they drive down to the five pretty easily,"
24:29,940;24:31,660;"but then stall, because they've been"
24:31,660;24:34,980;"struggling to get the ball in the end, out at the end."
24:34,980;24:36,620;"And so they send the kicking unit out."
24:36,620;24:40,100;"Troy Brown is part of that goes inside the numbers,"
24:40,100;24:41,380;"which is all you have to do,"
24:41,380;24:44,100;"which I think we've actually seen this season."
24:44,100;24:45,300;"Like the pages have got it."
24:45,300;24:47,020;"Yeah, the pages have got penalties called on them"
24:47,020;24:48,980;"because the wider receiver goes onto the field"
24:48,980;24:52,140;"but doesn't go, you have to go like from the sideline"
24:52,140;24:53,860;"on the inside of the numbers"
24:53,860;24:55,540;"and then you can line up wherever you want."
24:55,540;24:56,420;"So we did that."
24:56,420;24:58,060;"Went to the numbers, turned around and started"
24:58,060;24:59,300;"like walking off the field"
24:59,300;25:02,060;"as if he wasn't gonna be on the field."
25:02,060;25:05,660;"But then just stood like on the field but at the sideline."
25:05,660;25:09,060;"And so the Patriots lined up for the field goal, but snapped the ball directly to Adam"
25:09,060;25:10,780;"Vinittieri, like right to his hands."
25:10,780;25:11,940;"And he turned and threw up."
25:11,940;25:16,700;"I think it was a perfect spiral right to Troy Brown, obviously wide open uncovered"
25:16,700;25:18,660;"who just literally walked into the end zone backwards."
25:18,660;25:21,460;"The old hidden ball trick."
25:21,460;25:21,900;"Yeah."
25:21,900;25:22,780;"Yeah, it's perfect."
25:22,780;25:25,140;"The old hidden Troy trick."
25:25,140;25:29,540;"Just never seen that play elsewhere, like ever again."
25:29,540;25:32,140;"No, that's definitely happened before."
25:32,140;25:35,460;"Yeah, I'm sure it has, but it's it's uncommon."
25:35,460;25:43,060;"I'm gonna, but I am surprised we haven't seen the punt the punts team too if they don't have anybody to mark in the gunner"
25:43,060;25:46,820;"I've seen that a couple times this year. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you see that play by hunter Renfro"
25:46,820;25:52,140;"Yes, dude. So they do that so Oakland's there"
25:52,140;25:55,220;"They're punting to Oakland and Renfro's the returner"
25:55,220;25:55,740;"Yeah"
25:55,740;25:57,140;"And there's no mark in the gunner"
25:57,140;25:59,220;"So they just snap it and throw it to the gunner"
25:59,220;26:05,440;"Renfro recognized it like before it got snapped and started sprinting down the field and just"
26:05,440;26:09,840;"That's fucking unloads on their gunner like right at the right of marker."
26:09,840;26:10,600;"Yeah."
26:10,600;26:12,080;"And pops the ball loose and incomplete."
26:12,080;26:12,960;"It was perfect."
26:12,960;26:14,680;"I think I'm a baby catching."
26:14,680;26:17,480;"I was like, I thought I thought he dropped it."
26:17,480;26:21,280;"But yeah, well, you know, it was a turnover on downs and it was a fucking amazing"
26:21,280;26:21,920;"play by right."
26:21,920;26:21,960;"Yeah."
26:21,960;26:22,720;"Yeah."
26:22,720;26:23,400;"That's fantastic."
26:23,400;26:23,560;"Yeah."
26:23,560;26:26,600;"Front from the punt return of position is pretty impressive."
26:26,600;26:27,440;"Yeah."
26:27,440;26:28,080;"Yeah."
26:28,080;26:30,280;"But yeah, I have seen that work a few times."
26:30,280;26:32,760;"I think it was like last year they was one to you man."
26:32,760;26:33,640;"Panthers or someone."
26:34,080;26:38,320;"just like random NFC team, like tried a couple of times, like more than once in a"
26:38,320;26:42,640;"season. Yeah, we haven't seen it really on the field goal, not like that."
26:42,640;26:45,720;"Yeah, so you know, Belichick missed a conservative now."
26:45,720;26:49,520;"I guess so. Yeah, something's changed, but what are you going to do?"
26:49,520;26:51,600;"Let's let's loop back around to that."
26:51,600;26:53,560;"I have some thoughts. All right."
26:53,560;26:57,800;"Yeah, let me rant about CBS being fucking. Oh, yeah."
26:57,800;26:58,400;"Carve."
26:58,400;27:00,360;"Commentators are pretty good in this game, Andy."
27:00,360;27:05,200;"Commentators are fine commentators. I actually didn't have a problem with I don't know"
27:05,200;27:13,920;"Steve just says that yeah to start a rant because he yeah, I know I recognize that completely"
27:13,920;27:17,120;"But I'm not gonna I'm not gonna let him down. I'm I I'm a good brother"
27:17,120;27:21,120;"So I know that he hasn't watched the game. This is a good brother"
27:21,120;27:25,480;"Why the hell do we talk about the Steelers like 45 minutes last time Andy because I'm still your brother"
27:25,480;27:30,120;"Because I'm a good brother doesn't make I can't give you shit every once in a while. Yeah, it's not good brothers"
27:30,120;27:32,920;"Yes, it is. How would you know?"
27:32,920;27:35,080;"I would never do that to you, Steve."
27:35,080;27:36,000;"Yeah. See, that's fine."
27:36,000;27:37,360;"Oh, because Greg is such a good brother."
27:37,360;27:38,840;"Yeah."
27:38,840;27:43,240;"So that's not what I've heard."
27:43,240;27:51,080;"Is it? But CBS and I should I still feel they're like, they're kind of like this."
27:51,080;27:53,800;"They're probably, I think they're the worst of the"
27:53,800;27:58,040;"channels that air football games."
27:58,040;27:59,160;"Like Fox is fine."
27:59,160;28:03,320;"Yeah, mom would like to have a where with you about that, the old dancing robot on."
28:03,320;28:07,800;"Well, that's true. Yeah. But just from like a presentation standpoint, like they don't miss"
28:07,800;28:13,480;"it. They're never egregious. And I feel like CBS always tries to get like fancy with something"
28:13,480;28:20,120;"and they just like miss the actual like what's going on. Like they in this game, they actually"
28:20,120;28:23,960;"missed a kickoff, like they didn't come back from commercial in time. And so the, you know,"
28:23,960;28:27,720;"just had to tell you what happened, like why the page itself suddenly had the ball in the 35."
28:27,720;28:33,440;"And apparently it was a play that, you know, Patrick pass fumbled the kicker term. It's"
28:33,440;28:37,840;"still like recovered and marriage to like do something really impressive and get to the"
28:37,840;28:42,600;"35. It's like, well, cool. And then even on this play, like they're zoomed in on Adam"
28:42,600;28:46,640;"Vinotieri's face as he's lining up the field goal. So you miss like three quarters of the"
28:46,640;28:49,720;"actual play and live. And then they don't show a replay."
28:49,720;28:57,080;"I mean, it's live sports and you got to cut him a break. No. Yeah, but it's like the other"
28:57,080;29:03,160;"channels don't don't have these issues I feel like I feel like CBS is is the one"
29:03,160;29:08,480;"that's the most egregious they're all they're all they don't other don't miss"
29:08,480;29:14,280;"plays they don't have these awful camera angles and it's always CBS where I'm"
29:14,280;29:18,640;"like trying to pull the highlight I'm just like I can't get an actual highlight of"
29:18,640;29:23,280;"this play because you haven't shown it correctly oh fuck"
29:23,280;29:26,240;"- Fuck 'em. - C-B-S, dude."
29:26,240;29:27,080;"- Fuck 'em."
29:27,080;29:27,920;"What does that stand for, Greg?"
29:27,920;29:30,720;"- More like crappy broadcast system, right?"
29:30,720;29:32,040;"- Whoa."
29:32,040;29:34,920;"- Oh, thanks for that."
29:34,920;29:36,680;"See, that's being a good brother."
29:36,680;29:37,620;"- Yeah."
29:37,620;29:38,560;"- Take note, Steve."
29:38,560;29:40,680;"- Certified butthole suckers."
29:40,680;29:42,920;"(laughing)"
29:42,920;29:46,100;"- Very naughty."
29:46,100;29:47,100;"- Very naughty."
29:47,100;29:50,040;"- I don't know, they're all the same to me."
29:50,040;29:51,720;"I honestly like, I know they're different,"
29:51,720;29:56,720;"but I, if anything fox is the worst,"
29:56,720;29:59,420;"'cause they have the worst announcers."
29:59,420;30:02,560;"- Yeah, I would say there's one."
30:02,560;30:04,400;"- I watch a game on mute now anyways."
30:04,400;30:06,400;"- Chill bug and a manager just have been around"
30:06,400;30:07,560;"for too long for me."
30:07,560;30:11,280;"- Unless it's Tony Romo, I watch a game on mute."
30:11,280;30:12,120;"I don't care."
30:12,120;30:13,920;"- Gus Johnson."
30:13,920;30:15,240;"- Yeah, Gus Johnson."
30:15,240;30:16,080;"- But he does."
30:16,080;30:17,920;"- Does he still do football?"
30:17,920;30:19,800;"- Yeah, he every knows it."
30:19,800;30:21,500;"I think he does some Fox stuff."
30:21,500;30:24,740;"- Yeah, he's great."
30:24,740;30:25,700;"I love him."
30:25,700;30:29,900;"- And he's the best for if you're watching a highlight package"
30:29,900;30:32,500;"because he goes crazy when there's crazy plays."
30:32,500;30:33,340;"- Yeah."
30:33,340;30:34,740;"- So if the highlight package is just crazy plays,"
30:34,740;30:36,540;"it's like four minutes of Gus Johnson"
30:36,540;30:37,780;"just losing his mind."
30:37,780;30:38,940;"(laughing)"
30:38,940;30:40,620;"- He's a fucking high video, it's amazing."
30:40,620;30:41,660;"- Yeah, so awesome."
30:41,660;30:42,580;"- Love that shit."
30:42,580;30:43,420;"- Yeah."
30:43,420;30:46,260;"- So what were you gonna,"
30:46,260;30:48,660;"did you wanna, did you have a rant Greg?"
30:48,660;30:54,460;"felt like you were brewing something. Oh, that was more about Bill Belichick in 2021."
30:54,460;30:59,720;"And what a beta cuck soy boy. Can we talk about how bad the referees were in this game"
30:59,720;31:03,620;"first though? Oh, yeah. Good point, Steve. Yeah, we got to talk about that. Dude, how"
31:03,620;31:07,780;"about that call in the third quarter Andy? Oh, god, they totally missed it. And then"
31:07,780;31:11,580;"when they tried to try to replay, they they missed the replay on it. Yeah, they got the"
31:11,580;31:17,060;"number wrong when they announced it to such bullshit. How dare they? Now this was a who's"
31:17,060;31:20,840;"the one with the guns. Uh, and hockey. Yes. This is an ad"
31:20,840;31:25,060;"hockey hockey game. Dude loves to explain himself some calls."
31:25,060;31:29,640;"Fuck yeah, dude. But he also in this game love to have a fucking coffee"
31:29,640;31:32,900;"clatch about him too. Like every call took coffee clatch."
31:32,900;31:36,520;"Whether it's that we just get together and gossip for a while"
31:36,520;31:40,400;"over a couple. Oh, I never heard it called that. It's literally"
31:40,400;31:43,800;"what's calling Google. Yeah, it's funny. I was I was making a joke"
31:43,800;31:49,560;"the other day to tell you about your kitchen is all like in between being worked on. So"
31:49,560;31:53,520;"it looks like a homeless person's shelter. And I was like, I just picture Andy in there"
31:53,520;32:00,640;"like smoking his coffee crack pipe in the corner. Just to get a hit, man."
32:00,640;32:07,320;"Yeah, coffee has been a struggle. I will say that. Yeah. Don't think I have in person"
32:07,320;32:15,120;"veered though. Yeah, six bro. Hey, coffee's important. Coffee is"
32:15,120;32:20,240;"culinary, baby. Got the shirt to prove it. Now that the referees"
32:20,240;32:25,280;"were okay, there was one that they did take three minutes in to"
32:25,280;32:29,200;"to go to Steve Brown's favorite rants to validate the challenge"
32:29,200;32:32,840;"of a fumble. A little three minutes like I was doing the fast"
32:32,840;32:35,440;"forward, I made sure to check for Steve."
32:35,440;32:36,720;"Dude, I'll say this."
32:36,720;32:42,520;"The replay this year in the NFL is so much better with that booth."
32:42,520;32:45,600;"Yeah, because they have a specific guy."
32:45,600;32:48,280;"Yeah. So it's like, if it's obvious, they just knock it out."
32:48,280;32:49,680;"Yeah. That's beautiful."
32:49,680;32:52,640;"Dude, the fact that it's taken as long as garbage."
32:52,640;32:55,240;"Yeah. It's like, people have been talking about for years."
32:55,240;32:56,880;"Yeah. Yeah."
32:56,880;32:58,360;"And surprise, surprise."
32:58,360;33:01,480;"It's working seamlessly because there was no downside to it."
33:01,480;33:06,360;"And also like the that because they have the pylon cams now and they've got they set the"
33:06,360;33:14,440;"and a new one on the first down marker. Have you noticed that set a new one? So so they've"
33:14,440;33:19,000;"got an extra pylon that they put with the camera in it on the first down marker."
33:19,000;33:23,960;"That's for the camera. Yeah. So because then so they you can actually have like if it's a closed"
33:23,960;33:28,200;"call and the guy's diving for the first down, you can actually have the camera angle of it,"
33:28,200;33:31,640;"which I think Bill Belichick has been asking for probably since 2004 here."
33:31,640;33:36,920;"Also asking for lasers over the bill post as well."
33:36,920;33:42,360;"Lasers over the goal post. That's true. Like tracking in the ball, right? Yeah."
33:42,360;33:46,760;"Soccer is goal line technology. Why do we not have technology that shows if the ball crossed the"
33:46,760;33:53,320;"plane? I think because even if it does, you still have so many other variables. Like is the knee down?"
33:53,320;34:00,100;"Can you yeah, I know but you can stop it at a certain place and be like at this time in the video has the ball across the line"
34:00,100;34:06,580;"Yeah, I mean that's sure the video the video changes color filter when the ball crosses the line boom problem solved Andy"
34:06,580;34:12,340;"That's fair. I don't disagree. I'm a proponent for technology. I'm just a little surprise you are"
34:12,340;34:17,500;"Dude, have you seen the fucking tennis? They got that shit down to the millimeter. Hey, do yeah"
34:18,460;34:27,900;"To your third grad that's very expensive and the NFL has no money. Yeah, that's right. Bill Belichick has talked about starting a bake sale to raise money for it."
34:27,900;34:32,540;"So maybe maybe you make this a humor there. Oh, definitely."
34:32,540;34:41,900;"Crouchy dad humor. What about baseball? Should we get rid of umpires and just have strikes and balls called with a computer?"
34:41,900;34:42,740;"Yes."
34:42,740;34:45,820;"And I kind of like the baseball when they fuck around."
34:45,820;34:47,580;"I fucking Craig."
34:47,580;34:48,580;"God damn a lot."
34:48,580;34:54,580;"Get rid of the off sides too."
34:54,580;34:56,180;"No replays on off sides."
34:56,180;34:58,140;"No replays on off sides."
34:58,140;34:58,980;"Yeah, that's true."
34:58,980;35:00,620;"I got a question."
35:00,620;35:02,460;"Someone asked me this last week"
35:02,460;35:03,980;"and I didn't know the answer."
35:03,980;35:08,980;"When is it a false start versus a,"
35:08,980;35:11,340;"you know, sometimes it's just like,"
35:11,340;35:13,040;"turn around and look at the quarterback."
35:13,040;35:13,880;"- Yeah."
35:13,880;35:16,760;"- Where's that line drawn?"
35:16,760;35:23,440;"- I think once everybody is set for one second,"
35:23,440;35:26,760;"like everybody, all the offense players have to be set"
35:26,760;35:29,520;"and not moving for one second before you can snap the ball."
35:29,520;35:32,680;"But you can move and jump around until then."
35:32,680;35:33,520;"- Okay."
35:33,520;35:35,120;"- But if everybody has a set for a second."
35:35,120;35:37,840;"- Does it have anything to smoke your silly question?"
35:37,840;35:40,080;"Does it have anything to do with when the quarterback"
35:40,080;35:45,060;"says set hot. I don't believe so. Okay. No, yes, because he can"
35:45,060;35:48,520;"literally say that as many times as he wants. Right? Because they do"
35:48,520;35:50,780;"that. Like they'll run to the lines. I said hot and then nothing"
35:50,780;35:53,660;"will happen. And then they'll they'll change the formation. Yeah,"
35:53,660;35:56,060;"they reached. Yeah, they'll go back to like, yeah, instead of being"
35:56,060;35:57,780;"under center, they'll go there. Yeah."
35:57,780;36:04,820;"Paceman is the only god in time. Fucking pig ruins man ruin"
36:04,820;36:08,540;"Madden for me. Because all they would do is just make him change"
36:08,580;36:12,060;"audible every play at the line for fucking 45 minutes."
36:12,060;36:14,300;"It took forever to get a game through."
36:14,300;36:18,540;"Anything else you wanted to complain about?"
36:18,540;36:21,180;"Oh, oh, the referees, I wasn't finished."
36:21,180;36:22,700;"Thanks for reminding me, Steve, appreciate it."
36:22,700;36:23,540;"- Oh, thank God."
36:23,540;36:24,700;"(laughs)"
36:24,700;36:26,180;"- No, there was one play where,"
36:26,180;36:27,300;"I don't think I've ever seen this before,"
36:27,300;36:29,300;"but there was double offsetting penalties."
36:29,300;36:32,500;"Which is a new one."
36:32,500;36:37,220;"There was offensive and defensive holding on the same play."
36:37,220;36:39,940;"Then after the player was over, there was offensive and defensive taunting."
36:39,940;36:42,540;"Both penalties offset replay for."
36:42,540;36:44,540;"Don't can be started on taunting."
36:44,540;36:48,020;"Or is it the two guys?"
36:48,020;36:50,140;"No different players."
36:50,140;36:54,140;"The holdings were on two guys and then the taunting was on two other people at the end of the play."
36:54,140;36:57,300;"Both offset replay fourth down."
36:57,300;36:59,660;"That was on fourth down as well."
36:59,660;37:01,420;"Amazing."
37:01,420;37:03,900;"Edgium, my seat boys."
37:03,900;37:05,900;"the"
37:05,900;37:10,020;"Steve anything you want to get off your chest? No"
37:10,020;37:16,500;"Okay, good. I had another couple notes on our our good friend Marshall Falk. Yep"
37:16,500;37:19,100;"He's a scrub now"
37:19,100;37:22,700;"Just quick update on Marshall Falk in 2004. He sucks"
37:22,700;37:27,620;"He's not as good. Yeah, yeah. Well, that's why they drafted"
37:27,620;37:30,500;"Stephen Jackson Steve's favorite player"
37:31,300;37:33,300;"Yeah, I love that guy back in the day"
37:33,300;37:37,080;"Whereas the Patriots Patriots trending in the opposite direction"
37:37,080;37:44,780;"The leading Russia in 2003 was Antoine Smith who finished the season was 642 yards"
37:44,780;37:47,540;"Corey Dillon halfway through this game"
37:47,540;37:50,620;"676 yards and we are we nine"
37:50,620;37:55,300;"Good stat Andy. Yeah, so I think I think"
37:56,340;38:02,360;"Corey Dillon will finish with more rushing yards this season in 2004 than Antoine Smith did in 2003"
38:02,360;38:05,640;"You you want to hear my stat of the week and do"
38:05,640;38:14,100;"So I was looking into that Marshall Falk thing and you know the whole like running back cliff at 30 thing"
38:14,100;38:18,300;"Yeah, yeah, so I was looking into that is that how old he is in the season"
38:18,300;38:23,940;"Yeah, I think he's right about there. He's like 29 I think"
38:24,300;38:29,140;"So the cliff actually more strongly correlates to 29 that it does 30"
38:29,140;38:34,660;"Okay, which is interesting and then like there's a bunch of cool like if you're into statistics and stuff"
38:34,660;38:37,940;"There's a bunch of cool articles out there in the internet you can look up"
38:37,940;38:42,680;"Does it really didn't really translate well into like an audio medium?"
38:42,680;38:48,940;"Tell me the art value Greg. Yeah, yeah exactly so the one"
38:51,180;38:56,860;"Stat I did get out of that thought was interesting. So I was like, oh look and see this current season"
38:56,860;39:03,460;"of like NFL rushing leaders like how many of those guys are either 29 years or older. Yeah"
39:03,460;39:07,220;"so I looked up the list of the top 100 and"
39:07,220;39:16,220;"There are nine running backs in the top 100 that are 29 years or older"
39:16,220;39:19,920;"Jesus and there's also nine quarterbacks"
39:19,920;39:24,280;"in the top 100 that are 29 years are older."
39:24,280;39:26,000;"- Oh Brady, is he on that list?"
39:26,000;39:27,440;"- I don't believe Tom."
39:27,440;39:29,320;"- Is that top 100 Russia?"
39:29,320;39:30,160;"- Yeah."
39:30,160;39:31,160;"- Got some Russian yards."
39:31,160;39:32,320;"- Yeah."
39:32,320;39:35,320;"So this is many 29 year old quarterbacks"
39:35,320;39:37,640;"rushing out there as there are running back section."
39:37,640;39:39,720;"- I think pretty much kind of proves the point."
39:39,720;39:40,800;"- Yeah, I think so."
39:40,800;39:43,000;"- Which running back has pulled like a Tom Brady"
39:43,000;39:46,400;"where he runs really well for 40 years old."
39:46,400;39:48,240;"- I mean, obviously Frank Gore."
39:48,240;39:50,240;"- Oh my God, that's standard."
39:50,240;39:51,760;"- The poster boy."
39:51,760;39:56,760;"- Mark Ingram is the highest rushing yards for a..."
39:56,760;39:57,880;"- How old is he?"
39:57,880;40:01,400;"- 30. - 30, yeah."
40:01,400;40:02,520;"- Maybe even older."
40:02,520;40:04,240;"- Yeah, we just saw him on the--"
40:04,240;40:07,680;"- But he's 26 in the NFL in yards."
40:07,680;40:08,760;"So I mean, it's not like he's like"
40:08,760;40:09,840;"lighting the world on fire."
40:09,840;40:10,840;"- No, but he's always--"
40:10,840;40:12,520;"- Always put time too."
40:12,520;40:14,880;"Camara and--"
40:14,880;40:15,840;"- Yeah."
40:15,840;40:16,680;"- Yeah, that's true."
40:16,680;40:29,820;"quarter L Patterson was in there as a yes talking to the running back now is it all right that David Johnson with Tavis Murray where he most are like these are all scrubs really yeah."
40:29,820;40:35,020;"There let's just put this where there free agents in your fantasy league"
40:35,020;40:37,620;"maybe not mind but yes"
40:37,620;40:39,140;"who"
40:39,140;40:41,660;"how old is Derek Henry"
40:41,660;40:42,660;"That's a good question."
40:42,660;40:44,580;"Because I feel like he might..."
40:44,580;40:47,660;"He might buck that trend too, yeah."
40:47,660;40:49,660;"Because Derek Henry is just..."
40:49,660;40:50,660;"I don't know if that's really bad."
40:50,660;40:53,660;"He's just so big that I feel like it's..."
40:53,660;40:54,660;"Point seven."
40:54,660;40:58,060;"Yeah, so he's probably getting close."
40:58,060;41:01,020;"So keep this in mind for fantasy drafting though."
41:01,020;41:02,020;"Two years from now."
41:02,020;41:04,580;"Yeah, Derek Henry's..."
41:04,580;41:05,580;"He follows the trend."
41:05,580;41:06,580;"He's gonna fall off."
41:06,580;41:09,020;"What we'll do is we'll isolate you saying this, right?"
41:09,020;41:10,020;"Yeah."
41:10,020;41:11,020;"And I'll cut this."
41:11,020;41:13,180;"Steve treatment the Ryan Tanahill."
41:13,180;41:16,460;"Josh Allen."
41:16,460;41:17,660;"Yeah."
41:17,660;41:20,940;"I mean, 10 of hills cooled off."
41:20,940;41:21,580;"And the hell."
41:21,580;41:23,220;"Yeah, but Josh Allen."
41:23,220;41:26,420;"The hell less so tough, tough take on that one."
41:26,420;41:27,420;"You said I'm in the MVP."
41:27,420;41:30,900;"Well, if you convert anymore, fourth downs, it will."
41:30,900;41:35,020;"All right."
41:35,020;41:36,220;"Uh, let's see."
41:36,220;41:40,820;"Speaking of football, uh, you want your best and worst?"
41:40,820;41:44,740;"in this game? Sure. Steve, you want to go first?"
41:44,740;41:49,220;"Yeah, I didn't watch it. So I don't know if I have a best"
41:49,220;41:55,540;"row over the best is Troy Brown. Okay, is Greg Little"
41:55,540;42:01,840;"titties, leather little three G's Greg Little,"
42:01,840;42:04,220;"folks Greg Little. Okay,"
42:04,220;42:08,500;"Leonard, little thing. Well, if you hadn't realized it, it's"
42:08,500;42:10,140;"He's pulling this out of his ass."
42:10,140;42:12,220;"- No shit."
42:12,220;42:13,860;"I figure you just opened up my show notes"
42:13,860;42:15,700;"and just fucking pulls on from there,"
42:15,700;42:17,020;"but now he's just fucking reading it."
42:17,020;42:18,500;"- He ain't no nobody reads those."
42:18,500;42:19,340;"- Love it."
42:19,340;42:22,180;"Greg reads them, he definitely reads them."
42:22,180;42:23,180;"- That's right."
42:23,180;42:25,420;"- Because otherwise he wouldn't have said anything"
42:25,420;42:27,500;"about the Rams' favorite by two and a half."
42:27,500;42:30,940;"I highlight shit that I know of."
42:30,940;42:32,140;"- No, I didn't read them."
42:32,140;42:33,420;"That was from Wikipedia."
42:33,420;42:36,380;"- The two and a half?"
42:36,380;42:37,180;"No, it wasn't."
42:37,180;42:39,040;"Yeah, I don't believe it."
42:39,040;42:41,260;"I'm taking note of for the trick."
42:41,260;42:46,740;"The trick is to put some wild boy shit in those notes to see if people bring it up"
42:46,740;42:47,300;"during the"
42:47,300;42:48,220;"I probably should."
42:48,220;42:51,460;"You know, because that's what I do at work when like they're like, Hey,"
42:51,460;42:53,540;"can you write up the meeting minutes from this meeting?"
42:53,540;42:56,060;"And I know not a single fucking person's reading."
42:56,060;42:59,380;"I'll put some wild boy shit right at the end."
42:59,380;42:59,980;"Oh, yeah."
42:59,980;43:02,140;"I just like very boy shit."
43:02,140;43:02,780;"I don't know."
43:02,780;43:06,340;"Just be like, Oh, so and so said something ridiculous."
43:06,340;43:08,420;"(laughing)"
43:08,420;43:10,460;"and just see if they like acknowledge that."
43:10,460;43:12,660;"- There's a 20 minute argument about whether a hippo"
43:12,660;43:14,460;"would kill a rhinoceros or vice versa."
43:14,460;43:15,980;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
43:15,980;43:18,340;"Or be like, oh, this person said that they would take"
43:18,340;43:20,500;"the rest of the project and do all the work for us."
43:20,500;43:21,900;"You know, not like, you know,"
43:21,900;43:24,820;"fire wild boy shit, but just like, you know,"
43:24,820;43:26,140;"like something that if someone's reading it,"
43:26,140;43:27,140;"would be like, what the hell?"
43:27,140;43:28,540;"(laughing)"
43:28,540;43:33,100;"- I see that with my work email footers."
43:33,100;43:34,940;"You know, everybody's like, oh, this is prior property."
43:34,940;43:36,440;"- Yeah, I'll have bullshit."
43:36,440;43:37,860;"I think it has something where,"
43:37,860;43:39,340;"there's something along the lines of,"
43:39,340;43:43,940;"if you read this email you are,"
43:43,940;43:47,500;"it is assumed that you are agreeing to pay"
43:47,500;43:50,060;"the center of this email, like $2.5 billion,"
43:50,060;43:51,060;"or something like that."
43:51,060;43:53,940;"- Never saw any money."
43:53,940;43:54,760;"- Last thing."
43:54,760;43:55,760;"- Prank right there, Andy."
43:55,760;43:56,600;"- Bit of a shoot."
43:56,600;43:57,440;"- Got 'em."
43:57,440;43:58,360;"- Got 'em."
43:58,360;44:00,620;"- Or like when they put quotes in there,"
44:00,620;44:02,220;"or like have a picture of a horse,"
44:02,220;44:04,820;"you're like, ""Oh, I'm not gonna like this person."""
44:04,820;44:07,080;"(laughing)"
44:07,080;44:12,880;"- All right, great, you wanna do your best and worst?"
44:12,880;44:13,880;"- Sure."
44:13,880;44:20,140;"My best was a Venetary 4.4,"
44:20,140;44:21,900;"and a touchdown pass."
44:21,900;44:23,460;"- Yeah, game ball."
44:23,460;44:26,820;"- Game ball, my worst was..."
44:26,820;44:30,540;"John Gruden."
44:30,540;44:33,780;"(laughing)"
44:33,780;44:39,300;"Now we're in 2004, but just generally, you know, in general."
44:39,300;44:39,780;"Okay."
44:39,780;44:40,380;"I don't know."
44:40,380;44:40,740;"I love it."
44:40,740;44:42,820;"I think it was over multiple years."
44:42,820;44:44,300;"I'm sure it was."
44:44,300;44:45,780;"Yeah, it was probably happening at this point."
44:45,780;44:46,180;"So that's fair."
44:46,180;44:52,820;"Although clueless anti football pussy is the best."
44:52,820;44:54,100;"That's what I'm saying."
44:54,100;44:55,300;"That you all the time."
44:55,300;44:59,900;"That I must have said that like 15 times since I read it the first time."
44:59,900;45:01,940;"I should probably be at the bottom of your next."
45:01,940;45:03,380;"Yeah."
45:03,380;45:09,160;"Your next meeting we should change the description of our podcast to a bunch of clueless anti football"
45:09,160;45:15,400;"Don't tell me Greg don't tell me wow boy ship you're meeting"
45:15,400;45:22,360;"That's gonna be my my footer of my work email"
45:22,360;45:26,900;"So what do you think there are those emails like I?"
45:26,900;45:30,340;"Want to read them so bad"
45:31,780;45:37,380;"I want to know what anonymous is working on right now because I feel like they should be like finding these emails and releasing"
45:37,380;45:39,380;"Yeah to the public who?"
45:39,380;45:41,780;"Who do you think is like the craziest?"
45:41,780;45:43,220;"Dance nighter."
45:43,220;45:45,220;"Yeah, dance nighter."
45:45,220;45:53,940;"But that would be like, but that would be like, I'm thinking like the funniest, you know, like Rex Ryan or like Andy Reads emails."
45:53,940;45:55,940;"Imagine Andy Reads emails."
45:55,940;46:00,260;"Like all Andy Reads emails is just forting people like barbecue recipes."
46:00,260;46:10,100;"Yeah, he's actually just the caterer for the cheese. He's organizing post game meals and shit."
46:10,100;46:15,540;"I just have the picture of him wearing that like the face shield that was fogging up and"
46:15,540;46:20,740;"it's just like him thinking about food. Yeah. Yeah. I like to see Pete Carroll as if he's"
46:20,740;46:27,380;"just corny and email. If he if they're caught Pete Carroll being like an asshole, I'd be so"
46:27,380;46:32,660;"fucking pumped. Yeah. Well, he's isn't he like, uh, he's a conspiracy"
46:32,660;46:36,660;"theorist, isn't he? I don't know. I'm pretty sure that yeah, there was talk"
46:36,660;46:40,300;"about him being a conspiracy theorist. Like nine, like a nine 11"
46:40,300;46:45,660;"truth or an all sorts of bullshit. Ooh, I just watched loose change. Did you"
46:45,660;46:49,700;"remember that? Yeah. Yeah. Why? I don't know. I'm reading a book about"
46:49,700;46:54,780;"nine 11. And I was like, I remember that loose change thing. How was"
46:54,780;46:57,740;"- That's pretty dramatic."
46:57,740;46:58,740;"- Shocking."
46:58,740;46:59,580;"- Yeah."
46:59,580;47:00,900;"- Is that an Alex James thing?"
47:00,900;47:03,620;"- No, no."
47:03,620;47:06,620;"- It was really well produced though."
47:06,620;47:09,620;"Like, I must have put some money into it, but it was"
47:09,620;47:12,660;"clearly just like, let's throw a bunch of shit at the wall"
47:12,660;47:14,100;"and see what sticks, you know?"
47:14,100;47:15,660;"(laughing)"
47:15,660;47:18,780;"But they were like, here's an unanswered question,"
47:18,780;47:22,220;"one through 65, that's the documentary."
47:22,220;47:24,300;"(laughing)"
47:24,300;47:25,140;"Yeah."
47:25,140;47:25,980;"Yep."
47:25,980;47:27,340;"Yeah, I listened to,"
47:27,340;47:30,300;"here's a, here's a shout out for a podcast called Knowledge Fight."
47:30,300;47:34,460;"And as he's two guys who listened to the Alex Jones show"
47:34,460;47:37,340;"on Infowars and Alex Jones is awesome."
47:37,340;47:39,300;"And debunk all the stuff that he says."
47:39,300;47:42,020;"Just like point by point, it's like, actually,"
47:42,020;47:44,140;"this is what he's like, they'll play the clip of what he says."
47:44,140;47:46,420;"And he'll be like, so all he did was read the headline."
47:46,420;47:49,260;"And this is how, this is what the actual article says."
47:49,260;47:51,020;"And here's how he's misappropriating it"
47:51,020;47:54,100;"to get you to buy Dick Pills."
47:54,100;47:57,100;"So did see that another line because Alex Jones can't read."
47:57,100;47:58,620;"Oh, yeah."
47:58,620;47:59,140;"Yeah."
47:59,140;47:59,620;"He does."
47:59,620;48:00,860;"Alex Jones is the man."
48:00,860;48:02,580;"Like your bag."
48:02,580;48:03,620;"Alex Jones, guy Greg."
48:03,620;48:05,540;"Yeah, he's fucking hilarious."
48:05,540;48:06,140;"Oh, I agree."
48:06,140;48:06,580;"He's a natural guy."
48:06,580;48:08,300;"That guy doesn't make you laugh."
48:08,300;48:11,500;"I was also like in life too serious."
48:11,500;48:14,220;"He's also like a super racist anti-silent."
48:14,220;48:16,740;"But other than that, he's funny about it."
48:16,740;48:17,660;"Thank you."
48:17,660;48:18,020;"Yes."
48:18,020;48:19,300;"He's an absolute character."
48:19,300;48:20,540;"Yeah."
48:21,140;48:27,380;"And like his all those guys like court defenses are exactly how I feel like this dude's playing a character on TV"
48:27,380;48:29,380;"It's not a real person, you know"
48:29,380;48:32,380;"It's true, but then he goes on his show and like"
48:32,380;48:36,980;"Yeah, the same is that yeah, yeah, it's it's a little brutal"
48:36,980;48:38,580;"That was the only thing cross line for me"
48:38,580;48:43,700;"But the rest of the shit about like goblins and turn frogs. Oh, yeah, just fucking funny"
48:43,700;48:50,340;"It's it's a little ridiculous. Yeah, lizard people right lizard people. Yeah, that's a thing globalists"
48:50,340;48:51,980;"- The glow blush."
48:51,980;48:52,900;"- The glow blush."
48:52,900;48:53,740;"- Yeah."
48:53,740;48:54,580;"- This stuff when he gets so worked up"
48:54,580;48:55,940;"and his fucking goes real red."
48:55,940;48:56,860;"- Yeah."
48:56,860;48:59,380;"Well, he just does that as a show though."
48:59,380;49:00,500;"Like he doesn't even get,"
49:00,500;49:02,860;"he's not even really getting worked up apparently."
49:02,860;49:06,780;"- There's someone on YouTube that like animates his rants"
49:06,780;49:08,780;"and they're fucking so funny."
49:08,780;49:10,020;"- So I'll be on that."
49:10,020;49:11,220;"- Oh, that was an accomplishment too."
49:11,220;49:12,420;"And they're wicked plenty."
49:12,420;49:15,460;"- All right, I would definitely watch that."
49:15,460;49:16,300;"- Oh God damn."
49:17,980;49:21,980;"Speaking of Alex Jones and conspiracy theories,"
49:21,980;49:25,220;"here's a conspiracy theory for you, Greg."
49:25,220;49:33,020;"How is it that the Patriots during this 2004 timeframe,"
49:33,020;49:36,100;"how did they go 26 games without allowing"
49:36,100;49:38,420;"an opening drive touchdown?"
49:38,420;49:42,820;"And this was their 16th consecutive game scoring first."
49:42,820;49:44,540;"How is that even a possibility?"
49:44,540;49:47,620;"There's definitely some home cooking going on there, right?"
49:47,620;49:54,380;"coaching, but to score first in 16 consecutive games and they won the coin flip every even"
49:54,380;49:58,140;"the game that they lost last week and they got blown out. They still scored first. How?"
49:58,140;50:04,420;"Good preparation. I don't know. Loading the coin script in a row. I'm looking for God"
50:04,420;50:09,300;"damn conspiracy. Work me a little practice. One side of the coin before they give it to"
50:09,300;50:15,340;"the ref. Oh, see Steve, Steve's on the right path here. We got a correlation with the coin"
50:15,340;50:19,900;"flips there. I don't know. I don't know who won, but even then, like the Patriots deferring."
50:19,900;50:21,660;"So how does that work?"
50:21,660;50:25,340;"They're bugging the locker room. So here you go. Here you go. Yes, exactly. They're bugging the"
50:25,340;50:31,740;"locker room or they have, because you know how most teams will have a script for the first for"
50:31,740;50:36,860;"the first X amount of plays. Yeah. So the Patriots have found a way to get the opposing team's"
50:36,860;50:41,180;"script so they know what that first drive is going to be and so they can stop it every time."
50:41,180;50:45,900;"Therefore, you don't allow a touchdown, an opening drive touchdown in the first 26 games."
50:45,900;50:50,460;"And because of that, you're able to score first because the team, the other team doesn't have yours."
50:50,460;50:51,020;"Yeah."
50:51,020;50:51,500;"Done."
50:51,500;50:52,700;"Must be it."
50:52,700;50:54,860;"Makes sense."
50:54,860;50:55,740;"Alex Jones, here we come."
50:55,740;50:56,940;"Yeah."
50:56,940;50:57,980;"All right, that's it."
50:57,980;50:58,460;"Nailed it."
50:58,460;51:02,220;"Does he have a best and worst or?"
51:02,220;51:04,540;"Oh, would you like to hear my best and worst?"
51:04,540;51:06,380;"I can give you a few if you'd like."
51:06,380;51:08,060;"Yeah, let me get, let me get your to."
51:08,060;51:08,860;"Oh, here's a good one."
51:09,420;51:11,340;"My worst, I'll start off with my worst."
51:11,340;51:12,500;"Okay."
51:12,500;51:15,140;"They talk coming back from halftime."
51:15,140;51:19,260;"They talk about Mike Martz and all he wanted to talk about at halftime was the"
51:19,260;51:20,300;"referees and how bad they were."
51:20,300;51:22,540;"It's fucking loser mentality."
51:22,540;51:23,140;"Some bullshit."
51:23,140;51:24,260;"Who the fuck?"
51:24,260;51:26,580;"Who the fuck complains about referees?"
51:26,580;51:27,060;"Seriously."
51:27,060;51:29,740;"What kind of loser would complain about referees?"
51:29,740;51:31,260;"That is very much a loser thing."
51:31,260;51:36,940;"So that's definitely the worst."
51:38,900;51:41,620;"The other out of the bullshit path interference call that they call"
51:41,620;51:43,060;"enjoy, but it wasn't past appearance."
51:43,060;51:45,860;"Because fuck those referees, right?"
51:45,860;51:48,380;"And anybody complains about them."
51:48,380;51:51,820;"Um, my best."
51:51,820;51:53,980;"Let's take a look."
51:53,980;51:55,660;"Bribbit."
51:55,660;51:56,820;"Um,"
51:56,820;52:01,700;"commentators fucking professionalism and here you go."
52:01,700;52:03,900;"Here's, here's one while I was doing this."
52:03,900;52:06,860;"Disgusting beast over there."
52:06,860;52:08,180;"It was the, it was the gay frogs."
52:08,820;52:12,060;"Um, they were talking to be in the game."
52:12,060;52:15,060;"They're talking about Corey Dylan running in the way he runs and the deal."
52:15,060;52:18,000;"Uh, Dylan was battering the Rams defense, which I thought was nice."
52:18,000;52:20,100;"Oh, nice little word playing."
52:20,100;52:21,060;"Right."
52:21,060;52:25,540;"So, so shout out to, I don't know, was Chris Collins or maybe Phil's him."
52:25,540;52:26,580;"So it doesn't fucking matter."
52:26,580;52:27,660;"That wasn't bad."
52:27,660;52:31,540;"And then the fact that they had to talk us through the, the Patrick"
52:31,540;52:34,300;"pass kick return since broadcast fucking missed it."
52:34,300;52:36,980;"Do you have any, uh, Randall gay puns for a sandy?"
52:37,820;52:39,780;"I don't. Something about frogs."
52:39,780;52:41,220;"Don't that."
52:41,220;52:45,200;"Randall Randall turned the frogs"
52:45,200;52:45,700;"gay."
52:45,700;52:48,760;"It is a good"
52:48,760;52:51,420;"Sometimes a naughty boy."
52:51,420;52:52,700;"That's right. You tell him."
52:52,700;52:55,900;"I would tell that story on the"
52:55,900;52:56,780;"podcast of"
52:56,780;52:59,900;"at college at the kid on my team,"
52:59,900;53:00,860;"pack a"
53:00,860;53:03,940;"and we went we went to an away"
53:03,940;53:04,420;"game."
53:04,420;53:05,540;"So 10."
53:06,660;53:13,760;"Yeah, so there's like 10, 15, 20 kids that all showed up at one point in like"
53:13,760;53:16,740;"while we were warming up and they must have got a hole of our roster."
53:16,740;53:17,480;"Oh no."
53:17,480;53:21,760;"Cause they're like walking over the field and they're like, where's gay?"
53:21,760;53:24,800;"It's like raise your head gay."
53:24,800;53:27,560;"We want to know who you are gay."
53:27,560;53:32,000;"And they just made gay jokes for like a 90s straight minutes."
53:32,000;53:33,000;"Oh my God."
53:33,000;53:34,740;"Uh, so fucking funny."
53:34,740;53:35,400;"Yeah."
53:36,160;53:37,360;"That's brutal."
53:37,360;53:43,720;"They're like six feet, 160 pounds a day."
53:43,720;53:45,080;"Really?"
53:45,080;53:49,440;"Some of the shit they're saying was even making him laugh."
53:49,440;53:52,560;"I imagine he's probably heard it off."
53:52,560;53:55,440;"If your name is Pat Day, you've heard every single one."
53:55,440;53:56,240;"Yeah."
53:56,240;53:58,240;"And you went to middle school at any point."
53:58,240;53:59,000;"You're like, exactly."
53:59,000;53:59,400;"Oh, yeah."
53:59,400;54:00,400;"Especially in America."
54:00,400;54:00,600;"Yeah."
54:00,600;54:02,240;"It's like we've been heard all the poop jokes."
54:02,240;54:02,960;"Oh, yeah."
54:02,960;54:04,040;"I know all the brown ones."
54:04,040;54:04,560;"Yeah."
54:04,560;54:07,560;"I think it's down to Browntown, baby."
54:07,560;54:12,320;"Uh, oh, the one that we didn't talk about, uh,"
54:12,320;54:13,520;"Brady did throw a touchdown."
54:13,520;54:15,520;"Yeah, through to one to Bethel Johnson."
54:15,520;54:20,640;"Other one to, uh, fame's tight ends and touchdown catcher."
54:20,640;54:21,920;"Mike Rebel."
54:21,920;54:24,120;"It was nice catch."
54:24,120;54:24,480;"Yeah."
54:24,480;54:25,360;"Yeah."
54:25,360;54:26,400;"It was like a fallen day."
54:26,400;54:30,360;"It kind of reminded me of some of those grogg catches in the back, like that fade to the back corner."
54:30,360;54:34,040;"And grogg just got like grabs it and manages to hang on to it as he's fallen down."
54:34,040;54:42,200;"very similar. Andy, can I use your professional journalism test here?"
54:42,200;54:49,600;"Remember who man? Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, no, no. Oh, geez."
54:49,600;54:55,640;"Oh, pro is that for all? Is that what you're looking for? You want the pronunciation? Yeah."
54:55,640;55:01,520;"Yeah. That was really good. There was also in this game, the linebacker was actually pretty good."
55:01,520;55:06,520;"He led the team in tackles and tackles for loss."
55:06,520;55:10,440;"Pisa Teno Isam Moia."
55:10,440;55:12,680;"I don't know how I deal with that,"
55:12,680;55:15,780;"but definitely in all time, name team."
55:15,780;55:18,740;"Pisa Teno Isam Moia."
55:18,740;55:21,680;"- Sounds great to me."
55:21,680;55:25,120;"- And also the full back Joey Goodspeed,"
55:25,120;55:28,360;"which again, are perfectly named full back."
55:28,360;55:29,400;"'Cause it ain't great speed, is it?"
55:29,400;55:31,000;"It's good speed."
55:31,000;55:34,400;"three career carries, six yards, one touchdown, long as two."
55:34,400;55:37,360;"Good speed, not great speed."
55:37,360;55:39,240;"We're about there, tight end."
55:39,240;55:42,880;"Who's there to Brandon Brandon?"
55:42,880;55:44,560;"I don't see it anywhere."
55:44,560;55:45,280;"Where is it?"
55:45,280;55:46,680;"You try it."
55:46,680;55:47,480;"Let me know."
55:47,480;55:51,120;"Brandon, my new Malayuna."
55:51,120;55:52,080;"Oh, yes."
55:52,080;55:52,440;"Okay."
55:52,440;55:52,640;"Yeah."
55:52,640;55:53,080;"I remember him."
55:53,080;55:53,640;"I'm a new model."
55:53,640;55:55,120;"Monu Malayuna."
55:55,120;55:55,400;"Yeah."
55:55,400;55:56,440;"That sounds right."
55:56,440;55:56,640;"Yeah."
55:56,640;55:56,960;"Yeah."
55:56,960;55:58,040;"Yeah."
55:58,040;55:58,480;"You nailed it."
55:59,520;56:04,080;"pronunciation, we're okay at it on this where it's it's good speed."
56:04,080;56:04,440;"It's good."
56:04,440;56:10,400;"We're very international podcast around here."
56:10,400;56:10,920;"Yeah."
56:10,920;56:13,120;"We're huge and somewhere weird."
56:13,120;56:14,960;"Bulgaria or something."
56:14,960;56:15,760;"Something like that."
56:15,760;56:16,560;"Yeah, it was, wasn't it?"
56:16,560;56:18,920;"And then we were on the Mexican charts for a while."
56:18,920;56:22,720;"I think that was thanks to KBN."
56:22,720;56:25,520;"Well, thanks."
56:25,520;56:26,400;"It was thanks to you."
56:26,400;56:28,680;"It was thanks to Pat Scap."
56:28,680;56:30,240;"but I think it was for a bit."
56:30,240;56:31,080;"- All right."
56:31,080;56:33,600;"Anything else?"
56:33,600;56:36,600;"Patriots, oh, they had a goal line standing garbage time"
56:36,600;56:37,440;"from the three."
56:37,440;56:40,560;"They held the Rams out of the end zone, good for them."
56:40,560;56:45,040;"- Is that noteworthy?"
56:45,040;56:45,880;"- I think so."
56:45,880;56:47,040;"- You did it all Andy."
56:47,040;56:49,320;"Let's break the third wall here."
56:49,320;56:50,160;"- Okay."
56:50,160;56:51,600;"- You know?"
56:51,600;56:52,440;"- We never do that."
56:52,440;56:54,040;"- That one shouldn't make the cut."
56:54,040;56:55,160;"- Why not?"
56:55,160;56:56,000;"I don't know."
56:56,000;56:58,240;"- This was what the status game was like."
56:58,240;56:59,960;"It's a garbage tie. Yeah, it's garbage."
56:59,960;57:01,360;"I still go line stands."
57:01,360;57:02,560;"- I mean, it's a stuff that shouldn't have made me--"
57:02,560;57:05,440;"- Go line stand at four to 22, you know?"
57:05,440;57:06,280;"It's like,"
57:06,280;57:09,840;"- So it go lines and go line stand."
57:09,840;57:11,400;"I guess especially against this offense,"
57:11,400;57:13,280;"six ranked offense."
57:13,280;57:14,760;"- Pro logging or misery."
57:14,760;57:15,600;"- Yeah."
57:15,600;57:16,440;"- What else do you want to,"
57:16,440;57:17,280;"oh, there's one more thing."
57:17,280;57:19,520;"And this you actually probably will like."
57:19,520;57:21,360;"So Tom Brady in the Super Bowl,"
57:21,360;57:25,640;"because he was the MVP, he won a Cadillac."
57:25,640;57:30,640;"And so he decided to donate it to his high school."
57:30,640;57:34,040;"What was his high school grade?"
57:34,040;57:35,380;"- St. Mary's Vincent."
57:35,380;57:38,880;"- That was, that is incorrect, but good for you."
57:38,880;57:40,480;"(laughing)"
57:40,480;57:42,400;"- Eat some potatoes, something like that."
57:42,400;57:44,540;"- Same attack, okay."
57:44,540;57:45,640;"- Something's Sarah."
57:45,640;57:46,520;"- Yeah, I like that."
57:46,520;57:50,480;"- And so they are raffling off that car"
57:50,480;57:54,120;"at tombradycar.com, which sadly no longer exists,"
57:54,120;57:58,640;"But I think if it's available, we should buy Tom Brady Car.com"
57:58,640;58:01,120;"and redirect it to whatever we,"
58:01,120;58:02,840;"whatever we want to make it."
58:02,840;58:05,320;"'Cause that is a great one."
58:05,320;58:08,880;"- So they were raffling it at this point?"
58:08,880;58:09,720;"- Yeah."
58:09,720;58:10,680;"So they announced during this game"
58:10,680;58:13,320;"that they were raffling the Tom Brady's car."
58:13,320;58:16,040;"That Tom Brady Car."
58:16,040;58:19,320;"- We should fucking buy Tom Brady's cock.com."
58:19,320;58:20,320;"(laughing)"
58:20,320;58:21,480;"- We should go buy that car."
58:21,480;58:24,080;"And then just redirect it to a picture of my car."
58:24,080;58:27,180;"Or the picture of you with the inflatable."
58:27,180;58:28,840;"Well, or that."
58:28,840;58:29,240;"Yeah."
58:29,240;58:31,160;"Correct picture."
58:31,160;58:33,400;"Uh, let's see."
58:33,400;58:34,800;"Let's see if it's on the wayback machine."
58:34,800;58:37,240;"Oh, that was going to be my Halloween costume."
58:37,240;58:41,560;"This year it was going to be the, uh, a Mac Jones version of the same thing."
58:41,560;58:43,160;"Do you have a Mac Jones?"
58:43,160;58:43,400;"Jay."
58:43,400;58:45,480;"No, I didn't think so."
58:45,480;58:47,160;"That was where it all fell apart."
58:47,160;58:50,680;"Oh, oh, it's a, oh man."
58:50,680;58:56,320;"I found it. Hang on. Let me share my screen with you, boys."
58:56,320;59:00,680;"Make sure you ask if we can see it when it's up there."
59:00,680;59:04,440;"I won't do no such thing because I know you can because you're not the lonnides."
59:04,440;59:06,760;"This is win-tombre-card.com."
59:06,760;59:07,880;"I can't see it."
59:07,880;59:09,480;"Yeah, it's small."
59:09,480;59:10,480;"I don't care."
59:10,480;59:12,400;"It's my pet peeve at work."
59:12,400;59:13,880;"Can you guys see my screen?"
59:13,880;59:14,960;"Yeah, man."
59:14,960;59:16,880;"And then everybody's on mute so you don't inherit things."
59:16,880;59:17,880;"It's like, ""Oh, oh."""
59:17,880;59:19,880;"And then somebody finally on mute, too."
59:19,880;59:26,320;"So ticket $25 each or five tickets for a hundred bucks grand prize Tom Brady's Cadillac XLR. It's the one it's the"
59:26,320;59:33,720;"photos photo above not actual car, but the Cadillac XLR is the two-seater road stair with"
59:33,720;59:41,740;"Convertible that's nice with the trunk autograph I Brady and other Super Bowl participants to ensure authenticity"
59:41,740;59:45,400;"although they actually said in the broadcast that it was"
59:46,100;59:50,380;"Under the hood is where the entire team had signed it. So maybe that gets updated later"
59:50,380;59:55,340;"There you go. Drew DePero Sarah high school. That's where he was. So he"
59:55,340;59:59,100;"Gave it to his high school and they're raffling it. Yep"
59:59,100;01:00:04,660;"Yeah, that's why he gave it to them. So they were probably like what the fuck am I gonna do with this Cadillac?"
01:00:04,660;01:00:10,980;"Thanks Tom appreciate it. I know how I'm gonna work tomorrow"
01:00:10,980;01:00:14,700;"Something this school bus picks up one kid each year"
01:00:14,700;01:00:17,100;"Yeah, I won't give it a time."
01:00:17,100;01:00:20,740;"Yeah, the star quarterback doesn't drive with the rest of the team."
01:00:20,740;01:00:21,980;"He just goes in the caddy."
01:00:21,980;01:00:27,460;"Well, they have had some big alumni from this high school, because the same"
01:00:27,460;01:00:30,460;"high school Barry Bonds and Lynn Swan King from Mm."
01:00:30,460;01:00:32,500;"So a bit of a pedigree there."
01:00:32,500;01:00:37,820;"Same with a tie law and the rel Rivas."
01:00:37,820;01:00:39,220;"Oh, same high school."
01:00:39,220;01:00:39,660;"That's right."
01:00:39,660;01:00:40,180;"Yeah."
01:00:40,180;01:00:43,580;"I think there was someone else famous to Tony Dorsett, maybe something like that."
01:00:43,580;01:00:43,780;"Yeah."
01:00:43,780;01:00:46,140;"I remember them. I feel like we talked about that."
01:00:46,140;01:00:46,500;"All right."
01:00:46,500;01:00:49,060;"I'm going to have a win of that car so we can go buy it."
01:00:49,060;01:00:53,220;"By the way, find the Vin number of the car."
01:00:53,220;01:00:54,340;"We can go buy it."
01:00:54,340;01:00:56,180;"OK, let me look that up real quick."
01:00:56,180;01:00:58,340;"It's about the kid that worked at a dealership."
01:00:58,340;01:00:59,980;"Yeah, no shit, right?"
01:00:59,980;01:01:02,020;"We can have home Brady's car."
01:01:02,020;01:01:03,100;"I think it's quite cheap now."
01:01:03,100;01:01:05,020;"Well, what's what's the bit on that?"
01:01:05,020;01:01:05,980;"20 years old."
01:01:05,980;01:01:07,460;"I doubt it's cheap."
01:01:07,460;01:01:10,500;"OK, yeah, can we go?"
01:01:10,500;01:01:13,540;"Can we get the Vin just to make sure this is legit place?"
01:01:13,540;01:01:16,780;"I want to check the car facts."
01:01:16,780;01:01:20,980;"Well, they do have a phone number here that you can call."
01:01:20,980;01:01:22,700;"So I can give you that, Steve."

01:01:26,980;01:01:29,740;"No, I'm not going to do that."
01:01:29,740;01:01:32,660;"I'm too busy trying to see if I can buy Tom Brady Card.com."

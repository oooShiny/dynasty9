00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,000;"I am not your mother."
00:18,000;00:25,080;"Welcome back to the Patriots Darnancy Podcast."
00:25,080;00:30,160;"And the host Andy Brown with me today is nobody."
00:30,160;00:36,160;"Brown brothers are off gallivanting on vacation and the sticks of Maine for the most part."
00:36,160;00:40,320;"But I got too excited to be able to wait for them because this next game that we're going"
00:40,320;00:45,060;"to talk about is kind of the reason that I started this podcast in the first place."
00:45,060;00:50,080;"Not this game specifically, but the game's just like this because most people when you"
00:50,080;00:52,720;"talk about the 2004 week five game."
00:52,720;00:56,560;"Three and oh, Patre's at home versus the Owen four dolphins."
00:56,560;00:58,720;"It don't really think about it much."
00:58,720;01:04,080;"Even though this was the game that the Patriots would spoiler alert, break"
01:04,080;01:06,640;"the all time wind streak record."
01:06,640;01:09,480;"It was 18 games coming in, which the Patriots shared with a bunch of teams,"
01:09,480;01:13,000;"including the 72 dolphins, funnily enough, on their way to the Patriots,"
01:13,000;01:15,440;"on their way to setting this for, I think it was 21 or 22 games."
01:15,440;01:18,800;"Most people still don't necessarily remember this game because it wasn't."
01:19,640;01:21,800;"in all fairness, like a great game."
01:21,800;01:26,120;"But the patient will go on to win this in kind of a bit of a snooze fest 24/10."
01:26,120;01:29,080;"So they won by two touchdowns, not a big deal."
01:29,080;01:35,560;"But the reason that it's worth rewatching really doesn't have a lot to do with the game itself."
01:35,560;01:41,320;"But it has to do with kind of one of the small stories in here that only really"
01:41,320;01:43,240;"makes sense looking back."
01:43,240;01:44,680;"And I'll get into that in a sec."
01:44,680;01:46,440;"But first I'm just going to set the scene a bit."
01:46,440;01:50,680;"This 2004 Miami Doll, I already talked to the Patriots there on their way to, you know,"
01:50,680;01:54,040;"four and O'Star at this point and they will win a bunch of games in a row."
01:54,040;02:00,120;"I haven't lost in a lot of episodes since the beginning of the 2003 season against Steve"
02:00,120;02:02,280;"Spariar's Redskins, believe it or not."
02:02,280;02:07,560;"And then so they've come off the 2003 Super Bowl, rebooted with pretty much the same roster,"
02:07,560;02:13,000;"except they traded for Corey Dillon as their workhorse running back and he is putting up"
02:13,000;02:19,960;"great numbers and also they've drafted Vince Wolfork who rookie Vince Wolfork in this season is"
02:19,960;02:25,880;"an absolute gem to watch and there's nothing like seeing somebody that big"
02:25,880;02:31,080;"and that much of a mountain of a man be able to move that quickly it's something else but the"
02:31,080;02:36,360;"dolphins are kind of on the other end of the spectrum. Last time we saw them last year their"
02:36,360;02:41,800;"team their offense was they had a great defense with let's see Patrick Sertane, Sammy Knight,"
02:41,800;02:45,880;"Jason Taylor and Zach Thomas, that kind of core, especially the Jason Taylor's"
02:45,880;02:47,020;"act Thomas in the middle there."
02:47,020;02:50,420;"They, they are one of the, again, top ranked defenses."
02:50,420;02:54,480;"They have been for a few years now, but their offense was built around"
02:54,480;02:55,320;"Ricky Williams."
02:55,320;02:58,080;"He was there, you know, high pick."
02:58,080;03:06,160;"He has been running for, you know, over a thousand yards, like over 1500 yards"
03:06,160;03:11,360;"here and there, but this was the season where Ricky Williams announced his"
03:11,360;03:19,920;"retirements kind of the week before the season started. And so the dolphins were kind of left"
03:19,920;03:24,880;"holding the bag because they had built this team around him offensively and now they had nothing."
03:24,880;03:31,040;"So their starting quarterback was Jay Fiedler, who actually got hurt in this game towards the end"
03:31,040;03:38,640;"and was removed. And then AJ Feely came in in relief and two plays later, he was also hurt and"
03:38,640;03:43,280;"removed, but the dolphins didn't get the ball back to see who the third stream was,"
03:43,280;03:47,760;"but both of those quarterbacks would finish the season at about the same, both less than 2000"
03:47,760;03:51,600;"yards passing, both with more interceptions and touchdowns. Not great. The top running back"
03:51,600;03:56,720;"in this team was Sammy Morris, who we will also see. And they also had wide outs their top wide"
03:56,720;04:03,600;"receivers or Chris James and Marty Booker, but there was one other wide receiver on this team who"
04:04,480;04:09,920;"it was his rookie year and it's a name that patrons fans might recognize he's a shifty little"
04:09,920;04:16,640;"slot wide receiver by the name of was Walker and this is was Walker's rookie season he was i believe"
04:16,640;04:23,520;"an undrafted the undrafted or a light draft picked by the chargers originally"
04:23,520;04:30,720;"was he drafted i don't think you know it doesn't i don't think he was drafted they they talked about"
04:30,720;04:35,840;"in the game. I mean, it's fucking dandy or if we get him, we're not going to get into that because"
04:35,840;04:41,680;"I don't need to get myself angered. But yeah, so he spent a lot of time in their camp and like"
04:41,680;04:48,000;"made it through all the cuts, but then the dolphin signed him after that. And so he was basically"
04:48,000;04:52,160;"just like a punt and kick return specialist at this point. I think he finished 2004 with,"
04:52,160;04:58,800;"did he have any receiving yards? He did not. Nope, zero catches, but he did return kicks and punts."
04:59,600;05:07,120;"But weirdly enough in this football game, he did a bit more than that because before opening kickoff"
05:07,120;05:13,120;"and warmups, dolphins kicker, Alindomare, who you know, it's kind of a longstanding"
05:13,120;05:20,240;"kicker, really good, really accurate guy, been there kind of stalwart for ages, re-injured his,"
05:20,240;05:23,520;"I think his hamstring or his calf or something like that in the, he had heard it in the game"
05:23,520;05:28,080;"before and managed to get through it, but then like re-aggravated it warmups of this game. So"
05:28,080;05:33,000;"So they found out that Wizwalker had kicked in college."
05:33,000;05:38,160;"He had attempted one, I think, extra point, which according to Wizwalker was tipped and"
05:38,160;05:39,160;"sent wide."
05:39,160;05:40,520;"But they're like, all right, well, that's good enough."
05:40,520;05:41,520;"That's all we got."
05:41,520;05:43,160;"So they sent him out there for kickoff."
05:43,160;05:47,160;"And there's actually a blog post on the past, I see website, the new one that you can read"
05:47,160;05:48,160;"about this."
05:48,160;05:54,840;"But basically this was the intro to the NFL of Wizwalker."
05:54,840;06:00,160;"And probably more specifically, intro to Bill Belichick of Wes Walker, which makes a lot"
06:00,160;06:04,240;"of sense that you would see the Patriots spend the capital that they did."
06:04,240;06:09,420;"I think it was a second and a seventh round pick, something like that, before the 2007"
06:09,420;06:13,440;"season, which was actually more than they spent on getting Randy Moss to the Patriots"
06:13,440;06:14,440;"that same year."
06:14,440;06:21,240;"And everybody was like, why would you spend more on this, you know, little short white,"
06:21,240;06:26,040;"just scrappy Jim Rat sort of guy who hasn't put up great numbers for the dolphins."
06:26,040;06:27,880;"I think let's see. What do you do for the dolphins?"
06:27,880;06:37,020;"Three years of the dolphins. He had three starts, 96 catches in three years and one touchdown."
06:37,020;06:39,380;"In New England, he would put up more numbers than that."
06:39,380;06:45,700;"37 touchdowns in 78 games and thousands of yards receiving."
06:45,700;07:03,700;"And I think he'll see, and then he averaged more than 100 catches per season for all five seasons that he was there, which is bananas, including Jesus 123 and nine and 122 in 2011 before moving to Denver."
07:03,700;07:10,180;"But yeah, so he was kind of an unknown, but in this game, he showed that he was a prototypical"
07:10,180;07:11,180;"patriot."
07:11,180;07:15,840;"We talk a lot about Troy Brown on this podcast about how he, you know, did everything he"
07:15,840;07:16,840;"asked."
07:16,840;07:18,980;"He played wide receiver."
07:18,980;07:19,980;"He returned puns."
07:19,980;07:24,740;"He's returned a couple of kicks before, but he also played defense."
07:24,740;07:30,220;"And in one preseason game, he lined up as the emergency quarterback and handed it off only"
07:30,220;07:33,540;"for the webler running back was to fumble it."
07:33,540;07:37,440;"I don't know why I remember that, but I think it's just because it's Troy Brown and he played all the positions."
07:37,440;07:43,300;"So we're no stranger to this, but in this game, the opening kickoff was by was Walker and then"
07:43,300;07:49,580;"Patriots would score on the opening touchdown of the game and then the ensuing kickoff"
07:49,580;07:53,060;"was returned by none other than was Walker for 27 yards."
07:53,060;07:54,660;"Not too bad. And then"
07:54,660;07:59,820;"not much would happen generally in this first half."
07:59,820;08:02,700;"The Patriots would score a couple touchdowns."
08:02,700;08:09,140;"off of Miami issues. There was an interception by Randall Gay that the"
08:09,140;08:13,380;"page is turning to Brady to Graham touchdown and then the in the second"
08:13,380;08:19,100;"quarter Miami accidentally tried to fake punt because the the long snap or"
08:19,100;08:23,300;"snapped it too far to the left of the punter and he decided he wasn't gonna be"
08:23,300;08:26,140;"able to kick it in time so he tried to but did not get anywhere close to the"
08:26,140;08:30,420;"first down. Let's pay his turn that don't touch down but in between those Miami"
08:30,420;08:36,740;"did actually put one drive together, which was a surprise because this Miami offense was one of"
08:36,740;08:44,260;"the worst in the league. They finished 28th and points four and 29th in yards four. So like,"
08:44,260;08:48,580;"this team literally was built around Ricky Williams, it's like taking the engine out of a car and"
08:48,580;08:54,900;"like they were just pushing it everywhere. It was that. And so they managed, they did manage to"
08:54,900;08:58,260;"to actually score one touchdown, where was it?"
08:58,260;09:02,900;"Chris Chambers actually duped Tylot of his pants, surprisingly."
09:02,900;09:04,220;"So they managed to score touchdown"
09:04,220;09:09,220;"and outcomes our own Wes Welker to kick the extra point."
09:09,220;09:11,580;"And strangely enough, this is something you can take"
09:11,580;09:13,460;"to parties with all the other passengers"
09:13,460;09:16,420;"that I'm sure you know because you listened to this podcast."
09:16,420;09:19,180;"But that extra point of all the points"
09:19,180;09:21,740;"Wes Welker scored in the NFL, that was his first,"
09:21,740;09:23,260;"was kicking an extra point in this game."
09:23,260;09:26,040;"He had never scored before this on any kick return,"
09:26,040;09:28,660;"pen return reception because he didn't have any of those"
09:28,660;09:29,660;"because it wasn't seeing the field."
09:29,660;09:30,480;"So yeah."
09:30,480;09:33,340;"And then of course he's kicks the ensuing kick off,"
09:33,340;09:36,860;"returning punts and then towards the end of the game,"
09:36,860;09:41,220;"Wes Welker, Dolphins trailing 24/7"
09:41,220;09:43,340;"and they drove again down,"
09:43,340;09:46,100;"it's like end of the third quarter, it's like two minutes left."
09:46,100;09:47,900;"They drive down to page 11 line,"
09:47,900;09:50,940;"11 yard line, it's fourth in long-ish."
09:50,940;09:56,940;"So they actually send Wes Welker out for, I think like a 28 year field goal, something like that."
09:56,940;09:59,500;"Which is pretty impressive."
09:59,500;10:00,700;"He kicks it just barely."
10:00,700;10:06,540;"Squeech it through, which for somebody who hasn't kicked since, I think, like legitimately"
10:06,540;10:07,940;"kicks in high school is what he said."
10:07,940;10:13,260;"Inside note, there was actually more words written about Wes Welker in this than I think any actual"
10:13,260;10:15,540;"patriot in the bossing globe the next day."
10:15,540;10:18,420;"That's a whole like section and a whole article about him."
10:18,420;10:21,420;"But he was talking about, he didn't know the reason he really knew what he was doing,"
10:21,420;10:24,580;"because he played soccer growing up and then kicked for his high school team."
10:24,580;10:26,820;"And once in college."
10:26,820;10:30,540;"So, but yeah, they sent him out there and he kicked the field goal to, you know,"
10:30,540;10:35,820;"bring the dolphins within two touchdowns, ish, then went out, kicked the into and kick off."
10:35,820;10:40,780;"And also on that answering kick off was involved in making the tackle on the kick"
10:40,780;10:41,780;"returner."
10:41,780;10:47,100;"So this was more than anything, more than, you know, the Patriots setting the record"
10:47,100;10:51,820;"was actually kind of the Wes Welker game, believe it or not, even though he wasn't yet playing"
10:51,820;10:56,300;"for the Patriots. But I remember this was kind of a similar time. This is October 2004."
10:56,300;11:03,820;"So similar time with the Red Sox doing their comeback with against the Yankees in the"
11:03,820;11:09,180;"ALCS, I think it was. Down three games, nothing. And you know, how it all ended with that."
11:09,180;11:13,740;"So I think they were actually down three nothing. And I come home from college to hang out with"
11:13,740;11:17,820;"family and it's just me and my dad sitting around and he turned to me and he was talking about the"
11:17,820;11:22,140;"Yankees. This is his claim to fame. He was talking about the Red Sox games game and he turned to me"
11:22,140;11:28,300;"and said, ""If the Red Sox are going to break an 86-year curse, what better way to do it than coming"
11:28,300;11:33,020;"back three games down to the Yankees and some has never been done before."" And of course that happened."
11:33,020;11:36,940;"And so watching this game too, I don't know if it was the same weekend or it was around the same time"
11:36,940;11:41,180;"but then I turned to him and this was Walker. It's a matter of time before he was on the"
11:41,180;11:43,820;"the pages because this is like a bill Belichick person."
11:43,820;11:46,260;"And two years later, that's exactly what happened."
11:46,260;11:50,740;"So me and dad, no, Sir Thomas, I guess it runs in the family."
11:50,740;11:55,380;"And as long as you exclude my brothers, because according to mom, they are very naughty."
11:55,380;11:55,780;"That's right."
11:55,780;11:56,180;"Thanks, Bob."
11:56,180;12:02,660;"But as good as was Walker was in this game, both offenses."
12:02,660;12:05,340;"Weren't you could watch this game?"
12:05,340;12:08,420;"I might just watch the highlights to power you because it'll probably be"
12:08,420;12:15,660;"most about was Walker, because there wasn't much else going on. Brady was, I believe this"
12:15,660;12:21,380;"was the first time in his career that he had thrown for less than 100 yards. He was 7"
12:21,380;12:28,880;"of 19 for 76 yards, two touchdowns and an interception as well. So just not great. Having"
12:28,880;12:35,780;"said that, Jay Fiehler was perhaps worse. I think he went into halftime. They said"
12:35,780;12:39,780;"four of 11 for not very many yards."
12:39,780;12:44,300;"He did, I mean, they had to start slinging at the end because they were down to touchdowns"
12:44,300;12:48,260;"and they were trying to move the ball on the pages, were trying to grind clock."
12:48,260;12:52,980;"You know, as they do in these AFC East divisional battles, typical game."
12:52,980;12:56,700;"So he ended up with 250 yards, but did not look great."
12:56,700;13:00,500;"Had the one reception three sacks and just not making great decisions."
13:00,500;13:05,020;"Like none of the plays looked like even when it was successful, it looked like it probably"
13:05,020;13:11,340;"shouldn't have been, strangely. So yeah, I would probably skip this one personally."
13:11,340;13:20,540;"It's nice to watch Wes Welker before he became Wes Welker. And also it's nice that the Patriots"
13:20,540;13:27,220;"broke the record set by the 72 Dolphins of 18 wins in a row by winning their 19th."
13:27,220;13:32,620;"But also the fact that this isn't an NFL record, I'm going to bring it up again, is garbage."
13:32,620;13:37,100;"NFL does not consider this an official record because it includes playoff games."
13:37,100;13:41,820;"So something else that we can rail on Goodell for because fuck that dude."
13:41,820;13:46,780;"Yeah, but this it was not great. I try to keep track of how all the drives ended."
13:46,780;13:52,780;"And there are a lot of a lot of turnovers pretty through a pick on the third play of the game"
13:52,780;13:57,020;"to start the game. Miami started the 50 and they went three and a really bunted and it just"
13:57,020;14:02,780;"And that was it. And then Miami through a pick. And it's just like this all the way down."
14:02,780;14:08,380;"There was the fake punt fail. There was trying to scramble on third down and getting popped and"
14:08,380;14:13,980;"fumbling it by Ronnie Harrison, Patrick covered. There was some, I think a lot of the reason for"
14:13,980;14:20,700;"this, the Patriots side of things, not performing was because they didn't have any wide receipt that"
14:20,700;14:26,860;"were healthy for this game. They, of their top three, Troy Brown, Dion Branch, and let's call him"
14:26,860;14:31,820;"David Patton top three. Troy Brown was out with a shoulder injury. Deon Branch out with a knee injury."
14:31,820;14:37,740;"Bethel Johnson out, it was just inactive. They didn't actually say why, which has happened before,"
14:37,740;14:41,500;"where I think he just maybe doesn't particularly practice well or something like that."
14:41,500;14:47,180;"So they were left with David Gibbons, who was the only one who actually really caught anything."
14:47,180;14:53,900;"David Patton, who missed a bunch of deep balls and of all people, Kevin Casper, if you remember"
14:53,900;15:00,380;"him. Number 10, who was kind of the epitome of a street free agent, was out there as a bit of a"
15:00,380;15:06,460;"warm body, but didn't seem to know which routes to run Brady through to him a couple of times."
15:06,460;15:11,420;"And he was just like in the wrong spot every time, just a tough and also Daniel Graham was kind of"
15:11,420;15:17,660;"the only other person that Brady was even trying to target and in true, Dan Dearder fashion."
15:17,660;15:21,580;"Because Daniel Graham has actually caught a few touchdowns to start the season, he had four"
15:21,580;15:26,460;"touchdown in the first three games and he caught another one in this one like a short play action"
15:26,460;15:30,700;"one that they always run. Dan Doudorf decided to say that Daniel Graham is being compared to"
15:30,700;15:35,740;"Shannon Sharp and Tony Gonzalez because of his prowess and we haven't seen the best of them because"
15:35,740;15:41,260;"he can really split a defense running seam routes down the middle because of his speed. But as we"
15:41,260;15:47,260;"all know that didn't quite work out because he had hands of stone which is a shame because I think"
15:47,260;15:50,700;"if he was able to catch the ball, he might have been the original Gronk before Gronk,"
15:50,700;15:57,740;"but did not happen. Other Dan Deodor-fism, since they're going to get into it, I'm going"
15:57,740;16:02,300;"to try to restrain myself because there's nobody to calm me down. He didn't say Charlie"
16:02,300;16:08,060;"Weiss is the mic marks of the AFC, which I think had to do with play calling and belt size, but"
16:08,060;16:16,860;"I don't quite understand that because I don't think we've seen a lot of trickery lately out of"
16:16,860;16:21,740;"Charlie away. So for him to be able to say that with such a vanilla game plan lately,"
16:21,740;16:25,740;"especially because since it's give it to Corey Dillon and watch him run for 100 yards,"
16:25,740;16:31,740;"the game was a little out of that field. And I think I finally figured this out. And you'll"
16:31,740;16:36,380;"probably hear me say it again once the brothers are back. But I finally figured out what it is"
16:36,380;16:44,780;"about Dan Deodorf that bothers me so much. And it's almost like he's never watched a football"
16:44,780;16:51,820;"game before because even simple things surprise him. And he's like, there was one where I think"
16:51,820;16:59,180;"it was Kevin Falk was returning a punt and the punt was short. So he was waving off the gunners"
16:59,180;17:06,700;"and stuff to get away from it. And Dan Deeter of couldn't recognize it that wasn't a fair catch"
17:06,700;17:13,100;"call. So he assumed it was a fair catch call, commentated as a fair catch call, and then Kevin"
17:13,100;17:16,460;"and fuck took off with the ball and he got all upset that you can't run with."
17:16,460;17:19,900;"And then the replay clearly showed it wasn't a very catch call."
17:19,900;17:23,100;"And it's just those sorts of things. They all surprise him."
17:23,100;17:30,820;"And he gets things so blatantly wrong like that, like just the little simple things."
17:30,820;17:33,580;"That's what bothers me."
17:33,580;17:37,820;"And I can't explain why that bothers me."
17:37,820;17:40,940;"Well, I have to think about that until next week. So."
17:42,020;17:47,740;"But yes, so I'm going to stop talking about Dan Düdorf because I can't but New England Patriots."
17:47,740;17:50,660;"I'm going to keep this short because it is just me."
17:50,660;17:52,300;"And we'll do best and worst real quick."
17:52,300;17:57,620;"Patriots have now scored first in 12 straight games and have won all 12 of them, which is great."
17:57,620;18:01,900;"And they've also now this is their 24 straight game that they've won while leading at the half."
18:01,900;18:08,220;"So basically don't let them take a lead at all or you're not going to, you're not going to win this game."
18:08,220;18:13,860;"This is a good game to watch for any of the Brady"
18:13,860;18:17,420;"is soft crowd because he got absolutely battered in this game"
18:17,420;18:19,500;"and just popped up every single time."
18:19,500;18:22,260;"None of this, looking for flags everybody complains about,"
18:22,260;18:25,060;"just popped back up, getting hit at the knees,"
18:25,060;18:27,740;"getting thrown in the ground, took a beating,"
18:27,740;18:29,500;"didn't really throw the ball well"
18:29,500;18:31,100;"because he had nobody throw it to."
18:31,100;18:32,620;"Even when he had time to throw it,"
18:32,620;18:34,740;"there was just literally nobody open,"
18:34,740;18:36,700;"had to try four things in there and it didn't work."
18:36,700;18:39,660;"But you know, never really got fired up like you see him do now."
18:39,660;18:42,340;"Just kind of like took on the chin and kept on going."
18:42,340;18:45,740;"And literally actually he took one on the chin and was bleeding and they had to"
18:45,740;18:47,820;"like get him cleaned up before they could send him back in the game."
18:47,820;18:49,180;"See David Gibbons again."
18:49,180;18:52,980;"Also, this is, I think why Steve Brown started to love him."
18:52,980;18:57,300;"This is probably the season where he crept into Steve Brown's heart because"
18:57,300;19:02,900;"he was the only one I think today and probably for the next few weeks in the"
19:02,900;19:06,620;"past couple of weeks, who's actually catching anything, becomes Brady's kind"
19:06,620;19:10,700;"favorite kind of like a security blanket. Like he always tends to find somebody, you know,"
19:10,700;19:16,540;"it's if it's not the Wes Walker or the, the Julian element before it was Troy Brown and"
19:16,540;19:20,340;"Kevin Falk, that guy that can just like keep the chains moving until you can find your"
19:20,340;19:25,740;"playmakers towards the end zone. This, this 2004 season, that was David Gibbons. All he"
19:25,740;19:30,860;"does is catch first dance. And on the dolphin side, I think the dolphins are probably the"
19:30,860;19:36,340;"worst. The Patriots were like, those were the best of this game. But the dolphins, like"
19:36,340;19:41,340;"This is an abysmal season, I think, to be a dolphin."
19:41,340;19:44,100;"It's from the only bright spot they went for in 12."
19:44,100;19:45,940;"I think I forgot to mention that earlier."
19:45,940;19:48,300;"They beat one team with a winning record."
19:48,300;19:51,980;"And as a spoiler alert, we will actually see that game"
19:51,980;19:55,180;"because it is coming up this season against the Patriots."
19:55,180;19:58,060;"But this was kind of a season of futility"
19:58,060;19:59,900;"a couple of weeks from now in week six."
19:59,900;20:02,340;"It might be next week, actually."
20:02,340;20:04,620;"In week six, yeah, 'cause this is week five."
20:04,620;20:08,940;"The next week, the Dolphins will play the Bills"
20:08,940;20:12,940;"and it will be the only time the NFL since 1968,"
20:12,940;20:14,540;"the last two winless teams will meet."
20:14,540;20:18,380;"So the last two teams winless in this 2004 season,"
20:18,380;20:21,580;"both in the AFC East, tough look."
20:21,580;20:23,020;"But this is what happens when you build"
20:23,020;20:26,500;"an offense around one guy and he decides to retire"
20:26,500;20:28,100;"to go smoke weed around the world,"
20:28,100;20:30,220;"which yeah, they're barely blaming for."
20:30,220;20:32,620;"The Dolphins did their defense."
20:32,620;20:35,700;"Stellar, they've allowed 17 points against all season,"
20:35,700;20:38,940;"or they haven't allowed that many points in a game per season, all seasons."
20:38,940;20:41,980;"And again, this was the most they allowed, it was a 24."
20:41,980;20:46,860;"And but on the other side, the offense has been shut out in the third quarter."
20:46,860;20:51,820;"This entire season up until Wesbalkers feel goal in this game."
20:51,820;20:55,060;"So that was the first third quarter points they had scored all season."
20:55,060;20:56,100;"So that's not great."
20:56,100;20:58,460;"They've been out scored 37 to nothing up until then."
20:58,460;21:02,340;"And this team also finished for this game."
21:02,340;21:06,900;"with more penalty yards than rushing yards by a decent margin by almost 20 yards."
21:06,900;21:10,100;"So not, not a good offense."
21:10,100;21:15,020;"And I don't think it would get any better except for Wes Walker, who actually was on the fields offensively."
21:15,020;21:18,540;"He was only there during kickoffs and a field goals."
21:18,540;21:19,820;"And that was about it."
21:19,820;21:22,340;"Yeah, this was a decent game for Corey Dillon."
21:22,340;21:25,860;"He had 90 something yards, but kind of didn't really see the field in the second half."
21:25,860;21:29,380;"Oh, there was one thing towards the end of the game that they showed."
21:29,380;21:32,100;"One of those screens when they're coming back from commercial."
21:32,100;21:37,060;"They call it portrait of a quarterback for the Patriots, and this is what they look for,"
21:37,060;21:40,900;"which I think might come in."
21:40,900;21:50,820;"It might make a bit more sense now as to the Patriots draft class this year with Mac Jones."
21:50,820;21:54,860;"It was kind of what the Patriots look for in a quarterback when they're trying to find"
21:54,860;21:59,420;"one and why they drafted Tom Brady."
21:59,420;22:01,700;"Those four points to it."
22:01,700;22:03,340;"Number one is mentally toughest."
22:03,340;22:05,700;"He has to be the hardest worker on the team,"
22:05,700;22:07,300;"which obviously Tom Brady was."
22:07,300;22:08,900;"We've seen that for 20 years"
22:08,900;22:11,180;"and he's still doing it in Tampa Bay."
22:11,180;22:15,100;"And it sounds like from all accounts so far early"
22:15,100;22:16,940;"that Mack Jones is very similar."
22:16,940;22:20,020;"A lot of coaches waking up at 6.30 with texts from him."
22:20,020;22:21,380;"You know, they're quarterbacks as well"
22:21,380;22:23,380;"with questions about certain things."
22:23,380;22:24,780;"He has to be able to take a big hit"
22:24,780;22:26,220;"and call the next fly."
22:26,220;22:28,380;"So he has to kind of be not just mentally tough,"
22:28,380;22:29,180;"but physically tough."
22:29,180;22:32,240;"We haven't really seen Mac Jones take any hits yet"
22:32,240;22:33,640;"because it's still training camp,"
22:33,640;22:36,480;"but I think we'll see that pretty quick if that's the case."
22:36,480;22:39,520;"But from what I understand, he was doing that in college."
22:39,520;22:42,560;"So perhaps that will carry over."
22:42,560;22:45,800;"He is kind of scrawny, but as was Tom Brady to start."
22:45,800;22:47,920;"And number three, he has to be able to handle pressure"
22:47,920;22:50,520;"and kind of because that's what this position is."
22:50,520;22:54,280;"And again, you know, Mac Jones has seen a lot of big games"
22:54,280;22:56,560;"in his college career, like Tom Brady"
22:56,560;22:58,760;"always performed well in bowl games."
22:58,760;23:01,480;"And so I think a lot of that is what the page is looking for."
23:01,480;23:02,720;"You know, have you played in a bowl game?"
23:02,720;23:03,480;"Did you play well?"
23:03,480;23:04,660;"Were you able to handle the pressure?"
23:04,660;23:09,860;"And a number four, this one was kind of interesting because the other three"
23:09,860;23:11,240;"is kind of that makes a lot of sense."
23:11,240;23:17,080;"But number four was complete passes under a heavy rush, which I don't really"
23:17,080;23:18,480;"know how you grade that."
23:18,480;23:19,700;"I guess you could see that."
23:19,700;23:23,620;"I mean, maybe less so with Mac Jones because he was on such a high end"
23:23,620;23:29,880;"team in Alabama, where they had kind of a stellar offensive line where maybe at Michigan"
23:29,880;23:35,260;"back in 2000 wasn't necessarily the case or 99, I suppose. But I think again, that's"
23:35,260;23:39,660;"something we'll see pretty early too, as these preseason games come along. But yeah,"
23:39,660;23:43,700;"there's another interesting that that is what the Patriots look for in a quarterback"
23:43,700;23:48,220;"are those top four things. That's why they drafted Tom Brady. And it sounds like that's"
23:48,220;23:53,540;"what they were looking for in Mac Jones. So we'll see if he works out the same way that"
23:53,540;23:59,700;"Brady did based on those criteria. We can kind of keep those in mind as this 2021 season takes off."
23:59,700;24:06,660;"And remember, you can listen back to this if you're chiming in after the 2021 season and let us"
24:06,660;24:11,540;"know what we thought. All right, so that is about it for me. Hopefully next week it won't be just me"
24:11,540;24:16,100;"because it might be a little bit funnier if it's everybody else. Telling jokes to yourself,"
24:16,100;24:21,140;"sitting in a bedroom doesn't really have the same effect, I'm afraid. So yeah, until then,"
24:21,140;24:28,500;"If you got any comments, you can text me on the Dinesy hotline, 603-505-8043."
24:28,500;24:29,500;"I won't get back to you."
24:29,500;24:33,500;"If you got anything to say, if you liked it without the brothers, if you need the brothers"
24:33,500;24:35,460;"next week, either way, just let me know."
24:35,460;24:38,620;"Also you can check out the new site, patspod.com."
24:38,620;24:41,580;"Whole lot of new work going on there."
24:41,580;24:42,900;"And yeah, I think that's it."
24:42,900;24:45,580;"So until next week, we will..."
24:45,580;24:48,020;"Actually, what is next week?"
24:48,020;24:53,340;"have broken the record so now it's all gravy but actually if we have Mike"
24:53,340;24:58,500;"Holmgren and the Seattle Seahawks coming to town wow I do not remember this game"
24:58,500;25:03,900;"at all but all right apparently it happened and we will see what that looks"
25:03,900;25:10,300;"like next week on the Patriots Dynasty podcast. See ya later!"

00:06,840;00:08,280;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,280;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:14,320;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,320;00:15,560;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,560;00:16,560;"Go right ahead."
00:16,560;00:18,320;"I am not your mother."
00:18,320;00:25,800;"Welcome back to the Page of Stimes of Podcast."
00:25,800;00:28,840;"This is a 2002 season working our way through."
00:28,840;00:33,280;"We're on week 14 against the Buffalo Bills"
00:33,280;00:36,080;"with Drew Bletsoe's return to Gillette Stadium,"
00:36,080;00:38,200;"even though he never actually played there."
00:38,200;00:39,040;"- That's good."
00:39,040;00:42,080;"- But before we get into this game,"
00:42,080;00:44,040;"we have a very special guest on."
00:44,040;00:47,240;"So I'm an I personally am super excited to talk to."
00:47,240;00:50,480;"And we have with us today Brian Morrie."
00:50,480;00:54,400;"And you may not recognize the name,"
00:54,400;00:56,620;"but you'll recognize what he does"
00:56,620;00:59,420;"so i'm actually gonna let him explain"
00:59,420;01:01,400;"what he's doing these days"
01:01,400;01:03,360;"right"

01:09,360;01:10,800;"technology"
01:10,800;01:12,960;"and uh... you know after"
01:12,960;01:16,760;"of covering the team back in two thousand two for patreon for weekly but"
01:16,760;01:17,800;"uh..."
01:17,800;01:20,720;"run the museum now having a great time doing that"
01:20,720;01:23,500;"and get the talkable patron history more."
01:23,500;01:26,120;"- Yeah, and you're also doing the"
01:26,120;01:28,600;"paths from the past podcast too, correct?"
01:28,600;01:29,960;"- That's correct."
01:29,960;01:31,640;"- Which is something we enjoyed doing"
01:31,640;01:34,560;"and talking to a lot of alumni about their careers"
01:34,560;01:37,480;"and just kind of reminiscing a little bit."
01:37,480;01:39,240;"- Yeah, for those that haven't listened to it,"
01:39,240;01:40,600;"I highly recommend it."
01:40,600;01:41,680;"- It's great."
01:41,680;01:44,400;"- It's the top of my playlist whenever it comes out."
01:44,400;01:47,560;"It's some great stories that you wouldn't expect to hear"
01:47,560;01:48,400;"from--"
01:48,400;01:49,880;"- Yeah, that's how you can hear."
01:49,880;01:54,040;"Yeah, I actually enjoyed the one about Andre Tippet."
01:54,040;01:58,360;"And just kind of like how he was a little salty"
01:58,360;02:00,120;"about his time with the Patriots."
02:00,120;02:01,640;"I was surprised about that."
02:01,640;02:05,560;"'Cause that was kind of my first ever real,"
02:05,560;02:09,600;"like first name I recognize on the Patriots, you know?"
02:09,600;02:10,440;"Growing up."
02:10,440;02:13,400;"- Well, that was a lot guys, you know, they talk to you."
02:13,400;02:17,040;"I'll give you a quick story and I probably shouldn't share it."
02:17,040;02:17,880;"But--"
02:17,880;02:18,760;"- He's the best."
02:18,760;02:20,040;"Yeah, I could start."
02:20,040;02:21,520;"I want to go on."
02:21,520;02:24,600;"When we brought a lot of the Hall of Famers"
02:24,600;02:27,280;"will come back from a far induction."
02:27,280;02:33,120;"And so in 2009, when Robert Kraft decided"
02:33,120;02:38,280;"to induct Billy Sullivan in the 50th anniversary season"
02:38,280;02:40,600;"for the team, obviously the original owner"
02:40,600;02:44,600;"and the founder of the Patriots, John Hana said to me,"
02:44,600;02:45,240;"you know what I mean?"
02:45,240;02:46,160;"Don't sit me anyway."
02:46,160;02:48,160;"know the Sullivan family."
02:48,160;02:59,560;"Because he was salty and you never got over his holdout and I think 77 maybe it was."
02:59,560;03:04,600;"Where you know him and Leon Gray both held out on the left side of the offensive line"
03:04,600;03:11,100;"there and I think he just felt like you know the Sullivan's weren't committing financially"
03:11,100;03:12,640;"to the success of the team."
03:12,640;03:15,340;"And so he was a bit sloppy about that."
03:15,340;03:17,560;"And if you know John, he doesn't certainly"
03:17,560;03:18,320;"hide his opinions."
03:18,320;03:21,600;"So he said that."
03:21,600;03:22,920;"I was like, OK, John, whatever."
03:22,920;03:30,280;"How have you been the director of the Hall of Fame?"
03:30,280;03:33,200;"Since it opened in 2008, I actually went back."
03:33,200;03:38,200;"So I was at the Patriots from 1997 to 2005, covering the team"
03:38,200;03:41,080;"as the editor of Patriots Football Weekly."
03:41,080;03:44,920;"And then left in 2005 and went down to work"
03:44,920;03:47,480;"at the score in Providence."
03:47,480;03:48,960;"I told him this afternoon drive,"
03:48,960;03:50,760;"talk show with Scott Corducci,"
03:50,760;03:53,480;"down in Providence from three to seven on weekdays."
03:53,480;03:56,440;"And then when the whole thing was under construction,"
03:56,440;04:01,240;"I went back to the Patriots in December of 2007"
04:01,240;04:03,520;"and helped finish the exhibit development"
04:03,520;04:07,200;"and get the building opened and been there ever since."
04:08,120;04:14,120;"So you're in charge of kind of like designing all the exhibits and things like that and putting those together?"
04:14,120;04:20,120;"Yeah, we have a great group that does that and thankfully the craft is very committed to it."
04:20,120;04:30,120;"You know, in terms of the fan experience and really staying committed to making sure that the Hall of Fame stays updated."
04:30,120;04:33,820;"have probably spent, since winning the Super Bowl"
04:33,820;04:37,360;"against Seattle in 2014, they've probably"
04:37,360;04:40,040;"spent close to $3 million renovating the building."
04:40,040;04:42,640;"So they're really committed to making sure"
04:42,640;04:45,600;"that the fans are getting a great experience there."
04:45,600;04:47,080;"And to be honest with you, I think"
04:47,080;04:52,720;"when we opened, our Super Bowl gallery was just OK."
04:52,720;04:55,720;"And the impetus to really change that"
04:55,720;04:59,960;"was the win over Seattle, the way that game finished,"
04:59,960;05:05,360;"with Malcolm Butler, and it really may have paused and sink and make some changes."
05:05,360;05:11,800;"We actually got it the gallery and the gallery in front of it, which was called the fan zone,"
05:11,800;05:14,920;"and we really expanded the Super Bowl exhibit."
05:14,920;05:20,520;"And then, of course, when the Falcon Super Bowl happened, we had to do something special"
05:20,520;05:25,360;"for that, and so we actually built floor out over the pro shop and expanded the exhibit"
05:25,360;05:26,360;"even further."
05:26,360;05:29,120;"And then we had that whole home went against the Rams."
05:29,120;05:31,320;"So that was easy."
05:31,320;05:34,600;"Yeah, so they're actually making your job harder every time"
05:34,600;05:36,600;"they win a Super Bowl, is what you're saying."
05:36,600;05:38,560;"Well, yeah, you know what though?"
05:38,560;05:40,280;"It's invigorating."
05:40,280;05:41,360;"I truly love it."
05:41,360;05:44,800;"I mean, I love the-- when we get to do something new like that,"
05:44,800;05:47,800;"that really kind of gets me going."
05:47,800;05:50,440;"You get motivated to see that stuff."
05:50,440;05:52,640;"So if they want to keep adding trophies,"
05:52,640;05:55,760;"we'll figure out where to put them."
05:55,760;06:00,760;"- How does somebody get into a job like that?"
06:00,760;06:04,960;"'Cause did you have any experience in this sort of thing?"
06:04,960;06:08,240;"- I had none and I made that very clear in fact."
06:08,240;06:13,760;"So when I was, they had reached out to me about coming back"
06:13,760;06:16,520;"and they really have the role defined yet,"
06:16,520;06:20,360;"but they knew that, you know, they knew me."
06:20,360;06:22,680;"I knew them, I knew the culture."
06:22,680;06:26,840;"So I think, so when I sat with Jonathan Kraft"
06:26,840;06:30,640;"before I decided to accept the position,"
06:30,640;06:34,400;"I said to him, you know I have no idea what I'm doing, right?"
06:34,400;06:38,560;"And he said to me, you'll learn."
06:38,560;06:40,320;"And that to me was kind of,"
06:40,320;06:43,120;"that was kind of exciting that he had that faith in me."
06:43,120;06:46,120;"Knowing I had never run a museum"
06:46,120;06:47,920;"and didn't really know that business,"
06:47,920;06:48,880;"and that I would learn it."
06:48,880;06:51,600;"And maybe someone would argue whether I have or not,"
06:51,600;06:57,480;"But I actually went out and bought books on how to run a museum."
06:57,480;06:58,760;"And I read them."
06:58,760;07:00,360;"And I just dove in."
07:00,360;07:03,040;"And the exhibit part of it was easy for me,"
07:03,040;07:05,840;"because that's just the storytelling."
07:05,840;07:07,200;"But it was all the other things that"
07:07,200;07:08,760;"go into operating a museum."
07:08,760;07:09,880;"Now I'm still learning."
07:09,880;07:12,920;"There's still things that come up from year to year"
07:12,920;07:13,480;"that I learned."
07:13,480;07:16,440;"But the exhibit part, the storytelling part,"
07:16,440;07:18,320;"that's still very exciting for me."
07:18,320;07:20,560;"And the other stuff was a great challenge"
07:20,560;07:22,000;"that I hope I've learned."
07:22,000;07:25,280;"And I think, you know, we've run a pretty good venue"
07:25,280;07:27,080;"for the last 12 years."
07:27,080;07:28,400;"So it's been, it's been great."
07:28,400;07:29,240;"I've loved it."
07:29,240;07:32,880;"- For all our listeners who are like all three of them"
07:32,880;07:36,480;"or whatever, for mom."
07:36,480;07:39,040;"What is the like ticket price?"
07:39,040;07:41,240;"When you guys open, like what's the availability"
07:41,240;07:42,080;"for a beautiful company?"
07:42,080;07:44,160;"- Wow, I'm so proud of it."
07:44,160;07:46,480;"- We haven't been open since March 15th,"
07:46,480;07:51,480;"But typically, in a non-COVID situation,"
07:51,480;07:55,600;"we're open seven days a week."
07:55,600;07:58,960;"We're open Monday through Friday 10 to five,"
07:58,960;08:02,760;"Saturday 10 to nine, and Sunday 10 to seven."
08:02,760;08:06,680;"We are looking at reopening very soon,"
08:06,680;08:10,400;"depending on when this is aired."
08:10,400;08:14,900;"But, I mean, so yeah, we should be open in September."
08:16,000;08:19,180;"Okay, but we're gonna be limited our hours will be limited. I think"
08:19,180;08:25,020;"The other baby just be just weekends to start off. Yeah, that makes sense. See how it goes and then go from there"
08:25,020;08:27,800;"So let's address the question on all of our minds"
08:27,800;08:33,020;"Troy Brown is as awesome as we all think he is right"
08:33,020;08:36,420;"Yeah, we're very pro Troy Brown"
08:36,420;08:44,460;"Podcasts okay, so that's a great question. So what I will tell you on that is that when I was covering the team"
08:45,100;08:48,100;"People would act in my favorite player."
08:48,100;08:52,100;"And I would say, I'd have to say Troy Brown."
08:52,100;08:58,100;"Because I was talking to Troy one day and he made this comment to me that has always stuck with me."
08:58,100;09:05,100;"He said, ""I come in every day and just make sure my stuff is still in my locker."""
09:05,100;09:10,100;"Meaning he never took one day in the NFL for granted."
09:10,100;09:14,100;"He came in every day trying to prove that he belonged."
09:14,100;09:16,580;"I thought that was a great message."
09:16,580;09:17,900;"And something that's always stuck with me"
09:17,900;09:19,820;"and something that I try to keep"
09:19,820;09:22,060;"as far as my mentality goes."
09:22,060;09:25,460;"Hey, nothing is guaranteed, nothing is promised to us."
09:25,460;09:29,380;"Community justify your job every day that you come in."
09:29,380;09:30,300;"And that's what he did."
09:30,300;09:31,140;"- Yeah, thank you."
09:31,140;09:32,300;"I love it."
09:32,300;09:35,220;"- Yeah, the more, I mean, we were"
09:35,220;09:38,460;"Troy Brown fans growing up because our last name is Brown,"
09:38,460;09:42,940;"so it fit and, you know, he was the Troy Brown you see on TV."
09:42,940;09:45,340;"was that prototypical patriot."
09:45,340;09:50,140;"But more we hear about him, the happy eye of that decision."
09:50,140;09:53,660;"In fact, in fact, it's the top of the show I already talked about."
09:53,660;09:58,380;"And talk about the bill 2002 visit to July."
09:58,380;09:59,420;"Oh, that wasn't the game."
09:59,420;10:01,300;"It was 2004 where he intercepted Drew."
10:01,300;10:02,460;"Yes."
10:02,460;10:02,980;"Yes."
10:02,980;10:05,180;"I almost know."
10:05,180;10:05,980;"We'll get to that."
10:05,980;10:11,900;"But he was always just that guy who when you needed to play, he's the one that'll get it for you."
10:12,340;10:15,340;"Absolutely, there's a few guys like that."
10:15,340;10:18,340;"You know, the old cliche was, if you need it, you get your nine."
10:18,340;10:20,340;"If you need three, get your four."
10:20,340;10:22,340;"Can't talk with the other guy in that category."
10:22,340;10:23,340;"I agree."
10:23,340;10:30,340;"You know, guys, I just, I mean, before I was even covering the team, I still remember vividly"
10:30,340;10:31,340;"the play."
10:31,340;10:36,340;"He made 1996 lie on his back against the Giants in the final week of the season."
10:36,340;10:40,340;"And they clenched out, they clenched the division and a buy in the playoffs."
10:40,340;10:43,740;"uh... it was a third long-playing was really lying on his back when you"
10:43,740;10:44,900;"caught the ball"
10:44,900;10:49,180;"uh... i don't know if this play i'm going to write out that"
10:49,180;10:53,620;"finally found someone who knows more about troy brown and i do jesus"
10:53,620;10:56,780;"and of course you got to play in two thousand one of the football that put"
10:56,780;10:58,540;"them into the world"
10:58,540;11:00,740;"and also uh..."
11:00,740;11:03,980;"sixty-four max all in with the play call on it"
11:03,980;11:05,660;"it's terrible"
11:05,660;11:06,660;"protection"
11:06,660;11:08,340;"everyone right"
11:08,340;11:09,480;"that's amazing"
11:09,480;11:11,560;"and of course you have the uh..."
11:11,560;11:14,440;"the two thousand one a_c_ chain trip game to where he"
11:14,440;11:15,760;"has a way with all two"
11:15,760;11:18,080;"scoop up the the block kick and"
11:18,080;11:20,080;"lateral it"
11:20,080;11:22,800;"so that it goes for a touchdown instead of just a big game at the end of the"
11:22,800;11:23,400;"half there"
11:23,400;11:27,320;"i really like this direction this interview is taking just"
11:27,320;11:30,080;"about how awesome robert is"
11:30,080;11:32,320;"and i think that"
11:32,320;11:35,000;"well the fight for a touchdown i think"
11:35,000;11:37,520;"i don't know if you guys remember this but"
11:37,520;11:39,760;"they they've put the ball"
11:39,760;11:40,680;"and"
11:40,680;11:42,060;"he feels it"
11:42,060;11:45,720;"and bounce to the big stealers down to end up in like a sixty-yard plan"
11:45,720;11:49,120;"and the people who have been on the plane i can't remember exactly for what"
11:49,120;11:50,560;"side to something"
11:50,560;11:52,900;"and when they respond to all the"
11:52,900;11:54,400;"wrong"
11:54,400;11:56,400;"yes on the recheck"
11:56,400;11:57,440;"and so"
11:57,440;12:00,880;"while he was trying to angle the kick you get it on the right angle try caught"
12:00,880;12:01,600;"it"
12:01,600;12:03,240;"and took it back to the house"
12:03,240;12:08,240;"And of course, you know, making guys run down the field two times in rope and punk coverage is always challenging."
12:08,240;12:10,320;"I think if I'm not mistaken,"
12:10,320;12:12,580;"uh, Gerard Cherry,"
12:12,580;12:17,520;"uh, was like the vice guy on the punt and he, I think he, him, I think he flocked their gun"
12:17,520;12:19,080;"our all the way back into the end zone."
12:19,080;12:19,580;"Yeah."
12:19,580;12:22,220;"And that was the guy that committed the penalty too."
12:22,220;12:24,320;"Yeah, he ran out of bounds and he was the owner."
12:24,320;12:25,920;"And that's what the penalty was."
12:25,920;12:26,720;"Yeah."
12:26,720;12:30,960;"Oh, we did you have a watcher recently?"
12:30,960;12:31,440;"Yes."
12:31,440;12:32,040;"We just did."
12:32,040;12:32,440;"Yeah."
12:32,440;12:34,440;"One couple of weeks ago."
12:34,440;12:36,800;"Well, I think in the first"
12:36,800;12:38,400;"picture that he didn't ever catch"
12:38,400;12:39,520;"a hundred passes in the season."
12:39,520;12:40,320;"Yep."
12:40,320;12:41,360;"It sure was."
12:41,360;12:42,800;"And when it'll be"
12:42,800;12:45,320;"probable and he didn't go to"
12:45,320;12:45,760;"the problem."
12:45,760;12:46,240;"You did he?"
12:46,240;12:48,680;"Is it like a good one?"
12:48,680;12:51,120;"I thought it was always"
12:51,120;12:51,680;"an alternate."
12:51,680;12:52,280;"Yeah."
12:52,280;12:52,880;"Yeah."
12:52,880;12:53,280;"They're going."
12:53,280;12:54,840;"That's only one."
12:54,840;12:55,320;"Oh, he went."
12:55,320;12:55,720;"And he won."
12:55,720;12:57,560;"So I remember the picture"
12:57,560;12:59,120;"of the the top wall guys at"
12:59,120;12:59,680;"the Super Bowl."
13:00,200;13:02,760;"Because they laugh like the Super Bowl to go to Hawaii."
13:02,760;13:03,760;"Right, right."
13:03,760;13:05,360;"That was a whirlwind that year."
13:05,360;13:06,360;"Pretty exciting."
13:06,360;13:07,400;"Yeah, I remember his."
13:07,400;13:10,840;"I think we talked about it."
13:10,840;13:15,280;"His his first cat, his 100th catch actually got overturned"
13:15,280;13:16,840;"because it hit the ground or something,"
13:16,840;13:17,680;"rebobbled it."
13:17,680;13:20,480;"And so we had to go and do it again to get the 100th catch."
13:20,480;13:22,000;"After this made a big deal of it."
13:22,000;13:23,640;"Yeah."
13:23,640;13:26,880;"In every 70, it's 101."
13:26,880;13:28,000;"Yeah, probably."
13:28,000;13:53,360;"one of the one of the line of scrimmage out here. Oh, yeah. And then it looked like a punt return from there, just making guys look really, really ugly. Although I believe he did catch the pass and David Patton had in the net. Yes, David, David, David, through for down ran for touchdown and call it. Yep. That was him. Oh, I like how this is just turning into the Troy Brown. Yeah. Happy. Yeah, this is it. Yeah, this is perfect."
13:54,160;13:56,660;"He ever couched"
13:56,660;13:58,200;"rait in Grace Hall?"
13:58,200;14:01,540;"He yeah Yup on the fake"
14:01,540;14:04,880;"it was fake extra point or something. I don't remember it was"
14:04,880;14:11,880;"yeah, Yeah. It was O4 because I think it was also put a game. He really started playing defensive back"
14:11,880;14:15,880;"sitting here watching a Troy Brown highlight video and they just showed that strip of Marlon McCreepe"
14:15,880;14:18,440;"how do we forget that"
14:19,120;14:20,120;"Yeah, yeah."
14:20,120;14:21,120;"Yeah."
14:21,120;14:22,120;"Huge fight."
14:22,120;14:24,120;"But I'm not that funny."
14:24,120;14:25,120;"Yeah."
14:25,120;14:30,120;"Oh, we would never do it in the final minute loss in Indianapolis."
14:30,120;14:32,120;"Yeah, we don't talk about that."
14:32,120;14:35,120;"Well, we will eventually, we won't enjoy it."
14:35,120;14:36,120;"I'm pretty sure."
14:36,120;14:38,120;"Maybe we'll just watch the first half of that game."
14:38,120;14:39,120;"Yeah."
14:39,120;14:40,120;"Skip it."
14:40,120;14:42,120;"21 to three is the break."
14:42,120;14:43,120;"Yeah."
14:43,120;14:44,120;"We're good."
14:44,120;14:45,120;"Yeah."
14:45,120;14:47,680;"And then we'll just, you know, we'll pretend like that was the Super Bowl and."
14:47,680;14:50,800;"Try to guess who would have watched that here too."
14:50,800;14:54,800;"Oh, that was the, that was the Super Bowl of that game because either team"
14:54,800;14:55,720;"was going to beat the Bears."
14:55,720;14:57,600;"Absolutely."
14:57,600;15:02,960;"I would talk a little bit about your podcast."
15:02,960;15:11,440;"My first question is when you had Ty Law on, did he let you keep the ball of vodka he brought?"
15:11,440;15:12,920;"He did it."
15:14,840;15:15,640;"I can't do it for him."
15:15,640;15:16,640;"I'm not."
15:16,640;15:19,880;"Oh, yeah, we can hear that part."
15:19,880;15:22,360;"I didn't know if we could keep doing this."
15:22,360;15:23,480;"But yeah, he gave me a bow."
15:23,480;15:24,440;"Yeah, very good."
15:24,440;15:25,440;"That's what I'm going to do."
15:25,440;15:26,160;"All right."
15:26,160;15:32,120;"Yeah, we did a-- in the 2001 A.S.E. Championship game,"
15:32,120;15:36,160;"we did a Drew Bledso celebration."
15:36,160;15:39,440;"So we bought his wine and drank that for a night."
15:39,440;15:40,200;"And that's really good too."
15:40,200;15:41,200;"You did, Andy."
15:41,200;15:41,700;"Yeah."
15:41,700;15:42,880;"Yeah, I was only going to find it, actually,"
15:42,880;15:44,080;"because I'm the only one that's still alive."
15:44,080;15:46,880;"Yeah, I got to try his wine when we"
15:46,880;15:54,480;"We brought the 2001 team back for its 50th anniversary. He supplied the wine at the event so nice"
15:54,480;16:01,120;"Even here. Well, also has his own mind. David Hewitt has his own wine. Yeah"
16:01,120;16:03,680;"Add it to the list boys"
16:03,680;16:09,760;"David Hewitt episode that David Hewitt appreciate the real taman here or is it like Josh McDane"
16:09,760;16:13,600;"Did you know what blood so's business partner is Josh McDaniel's?"
16:13,600;16:16,720;"But it's not the it's not the Josh. Yeah"
16:16,720;16:19,840;"Got us all sir. It's a confused"
16:19,840;16:24,960;"I think in the wine world they say yeah the painters office of coordinator is"
16:24,960;16:32,080;"It's a different one"
16:32,080;16:35,680;"That's awesome"
16:35,680;16:37,840;"Yeah, I should do a tie law"
16:37,840;16:42,460;"Yeah, I think we absolutely should do a tie law episode where we drink his vodka"
16:42,460;16:44,940;"But I think that might get a little messier than that."
16:44,940;16:46,140;"I could get ugly."
16:46,140;16:48,420;"Or I'd have to say."
16:48,420;16:52,380;"And then we got to do his trampoline park after."
16:52,380;16:52,860;"That's really--"
16:52,860;16:54,620;"Oh, he felt those."
16:54,620;16:56,100;"Oh, he did?"
16:56,100;16:58,860;"So I got an attitude getting to the V1 business."
16:58,860;17:01,500;"Oh, tough."
17:01,500;17:02,100;"That's good."
17:02,100;17:03,100;"That was a good company."
17:03,100;17:03,860;"I could come up."
17:03,860;17:05,860;"Broken ankle win half."
17:05,860;17:07,180;"Or at least throw it out dead."
17:07,180;17:08,660;"Someone's jinking."
17:08,660;17:11,420;"It wasn't there a sport that they had back in the day"
17:11,420;17:13,420;"where it was yes slam the ball"
17:13,420;17:15,420;"baster ball slam ball that's right"
17:15,420;17:17,420;"well you know you know who was good"
17:17,420;17:19,420;"but we did you know tell the funny story"
17:19,420;17:21,420;"i don't know if you heard the lawyer molloy podcast"
17:21,420;17:23,420;"oh yeah but if you've heard the story about"
17:23,420;17:25,420;"when he went to the Super Bowl"
17:25,420;17:27,420;"in St. Louis"
17:27,420;17:29,420;"I mean in New Orleans against the Rams in"
17:29,420;17:31,420;"Super Bowl 36"
17:31,420;17:33,420;"when he gets to his hotel room he's got this"
17:33,420;17:35,420;"really small hotel room"
17:35,420;17:39,420;"and Richard Seamrock was by and he's like"
17:39,420;17:42,060;"Yeah, you can see my hotel and I got this great big room."
17:42,060;17:43,340;"It's awesome."
17:43,340;17:46,620;"And Laura Maloy was like, what are you talking about?"
17:46,620;17:48,700;"The rookie got a better room than I did."
17:48,700;17:50,180;"(laughs)"
17:50,180;17:51,260;"Yeah."
17:51,260;17:56,020;"So he goes down the bill and he goes, ""Coach, I don't want"
17:56,020;17:59,100;"""to sound like I'm grateful or I'm not focused on anything,"
17:59,100;18:01,540;"""but my hotel room sucks."""
18:01,540;18:04,700;"And Bill was like, ""Really, Laura?"
18:04,700;18:06,180;"""That's what you're worried about?"""
18:06,180;18:07,660;"(laughs)"
18:07,660;18:08,820;"So Laura was like, ""You know what?"
18:08,820;18:10,540;"""Yeah, you're right, coach, I'm sorry."""
18:10,540;18:12,180;"They walked away."
18:12,180;18:14,380;"So way around, Bill, the assistant goes up to him."
18:14,380;18:16,180;"Bill, the assistant bears."
18:16,180;18:18,580;"The doctor says, ""Hey, here's the key to your new room."""
18:18,580;18:23,140;"So, Laura's like, ""Oh, awesome, thanks."""
18:23,140;18:25,980;"He goes up to the room, and he goes in the room,"
18:25,980;18:27,820;"and there's a treadmill in the room."
18:27,820;18:31,340;"And he's like, ""Ah, I got this awesome room."""
18:31,340;18:34,420;"And so Coach sees him way down the stairs,"
18:34,420;18:36,020;"and he goes, ""How do you like your new room?"""
18:36,020;18:37,980;"He's like, ""Ah, Coach, thanks so much."
18:37,980;18:41,780;"It's awesome because I'm on the line, but they put a treadmill in my room."
18:41,780;18:46,260;"And they'll go, yeah, because it was my room."
18:46,260;18:47,940;"Bill gave me his room."
18:47,940;18:49,460;"Oh, shit."
18:49,460;18:51,900;"Oh, cross the walk away."
18:51,900;18:53,540;"He's like, ah, thanks, coach."
18:53,540;18:55,900;"Yeah, how do you say to that?"
18:55,900;18:59,340;"Did Bill stay in his room in the other room?"
18:59,340;18:59,700;"I think."
18:59,700;19:01,500;"I think so."
19:01,500;19:03,700;"I mean, that makes sense."
19:03,700;19:08,420;"and only created the best defensive game plan in the history of the league that night."
19:08,420;19:16,660;"From where Malice craft room. I wonder if we can get that room if we can go down to book the"
19:16,660;19:23,300;"whole hotel room. It was the family hotel. See there we go. We'll find it where it was."
19:23,300;19:26,420;"We can probably afford the cheap room. Small one."
19:28,420;19:34,660;"So I traveled with the team and back then we would stay on, you know, as a writer of the"
19:34,660;19:38,260;"Patriots Football Weekly, we would stay on the floor with the players. Like there was no"
19:38,260;19:43,620;"separation. So like, Tylock could have been sleeping in the room next door to me. Now that"
19:43,620;19:50,580;"doesn't happen. Coupling years later, they'll change that whole thing. We got to put separate"
19:50,580;19:55,140;"floors and the players had their own floors. But that's not suitable. I say the same floor with"
19:55,140;19:59,380;"a bunch of the players so you walk out of your room and it would be time Laura walking down the hall."
19:59,380;20:07,540;"That is so cool. But not anymore. But the best part about that was when you get off the elevator"
20:07,540;20:12,420;"there'd be tub drinks and stuff and snacks and drinks right out of your floor which is pretty cool."
20:12,420;20:18,340;"You get spoiled. Yeah, it's free shit. Yeah, I mean it's a Super Bowl right? Gonna go all out."
20:21,060;20:25,220;"It's only $121 in let's go. Oh, all right"
20:25,220;20:30,740;"They asked for the last for the lawyer. Molloy. Thanks. So the heart can't just blacked it"
20:30,740;20:36,820;"Yeah, there is"
20:36,820;20:41,420;"Further towards Texas. I think they really took the brunt of that. Yeah"
20:41,420;20:48,920;"Lake Charles, I think it was that sounds familiar. All right. Um, did you boys have any questions? You want to ask Brian?"
20:49,580;20:53,500;"I have one but I'll save it for the end here because we don't know what I'm gonna ask"
20:53,500;20:57,380;"It's true"
20:57,380;21:01,180;"I got a question. How does the decision making?"
21:01,180;21:08,580;"How are the decisions made and who gets into the the Hall of Fame for the Patriots specifically?"
21:14,260;21:18,820;"year in about April. A lot of media people have covered the team in for a case"
21:18,820;21:21,260;"when it's on the tip it is on it. The case when it's not a Hall of"
21:21,260;21:25,900;"Amr who might invite Stephen Nelson or Steve Grogan just to get some of that"
21:25,900;21:31,540;"perspective from players who played you know back in the 70s and 80s and then"
21:31,540;21:35,580;"you know media members, a couple of staff, Phil Frank Kirsch, who's the Vice"
21:35,580;21:39,220;"President of Content for the Patriots, Paul Perrillo covers the team's"
21:39,220;21:39,260;"Phase"
21:39,260;21:40,660;"Football Weekly still."
21:40,660;21:44,200;"Matt Smith from our production studio."
21:44,200;21:46,440;"Guys, it had been around for quite a while."
21:46,440;21:48,960;"So that committee meets and"
21:48,960;21:55,000;"anyone can nominate a player who has been retired for at least four years."
21:55,000;21:58,180;"So or coach for that."
21:58,180;21:59,440;"Head coach."
21:59,440;22:02,920;"So if I want to nominate a player, I will stand up."
22:02,920;22:05,080;"I'd like to nominate Laura Maloney."
22:05,080;22:09,200;"Might give a couple reasons why, but we really, we go through a nomination process."
22:09,200;22:15,600;"And then we go through each nominee and discuss or debate their merits."
22:15,600;22:18,640;"So those conversations pretty much stay in the room."
22:18,640;22:24,000;"You know, there's reporters in the room obviously, but we like to keep it private so people can"
22:24,000;22:28,840;"speak their mind on either for or against a player or coach."
22:28,840;22:33,960;"You know, people can report on their own opinions all they want and just not really"
22:33,960;22:36,920;"reporting on other people's opinions."
22:36,920;22:43,400;"So once we go through the whole nomination process, discuss the nominees, everybody's"
22:43,400;22:47,160;"given a ballot and you can vote for your top three choices, five points for first place,"
22:47,160;22:52,200;"three points for second place, one point for third place, and the top three vote getters"
22:52,200;22:58,960;"become our finalist and they go on pictures.com for the fans to vote and determine who that"
22:58,960;22:59,960;"year's inductee will be."
22:59,960;23:06,360;"We also have a senior selection committee to every, it's kind of sporadic."
23:06,360;23:11,080;"every three years could be longer, could be quicker,"
23:11,080;23:14,000;"but the senior selection committee,"
23:14,000;23:16,760;"which has been able to attend most senior members"
23:16,760;23:21,760;"of that year's committee, can meet and decide"
23:21,760;23:23,680;"if there's a player who has been retired"
23:23,680;23:28,680;"for 25 or more years, and has been a previous finalist"
23:28,680;23:33,160;"but not selected by the fans, the senior selection committee"
23:33,160;23:38,160;"can vote that person in with eight out of ten votes."
23:38,160;23:39,160;"- Cool."
23:39,160;23:42,200;"- So it's a pretty rigorous process at that point."
23:42,200;23:43,840;"You know, it's really to make up,"
23:43,840;23:46,800;"it really came out of John Morris"
23:46,800;23:48,160;"not being elected by the fans."
23:48,160;23:51,360;"John Morris was the first player"
23:51,360;23:53,040;"that the committee voted number one,"
23:53,040;23:54,200;"that the fans didn't,"
23:54,200;23:57,560;"and it happened like two, three years in a row."
23:57,560;24:01,880;"And so we decided that there needs to be a mechanism in place"
24:01,880;24:06,760;"John Morris was a center in the 60s and 70s and there's going to be a lot of fans that"
24:06,760;24:07,760;"don't remember him."
24:07,760;24:12,120;"You know, it's not like he was catching touchdown passes, you know."
24:12,120;24:17,800;"So we put the system into place where the senior committee could, if a player had been"
24:17,800;24:22,840;"elected a finalist by the committee and was retired for 25 more years and got eight of"
24:22,840;24:25,800;"ten votes from the senior committee that they would be inducted."
24:25,800;24:29,720;"So there's Ben John Morris, Houston Antwine,"
24:29,720;24:33,080;"and who did we just do?"
24:33,080;24:37,560;"Couple years ago, Leung Ray."
24:37,560;24:40,560;"That's how the three players that have been inducted"
24:40,560;24:41,640;"by the senior committee."
24:41,640;24:44,000;"- That's really cool."
24:44,000;24:44,840;"- Interesting."
24:44,840;24:46,920;"- Can you nominate as many people as you want"
24:46,920;24:49,040;"in that first nomination?"
24:49,040;24:50,400;"- If you could, yeah."
24:50,400;24:51,240;"- Yeah."
24:51,240;24:54,440;"- How many typically are like raised?"
24:54,440;25:01,440;"uh..."
25:01,440;25:05,200;"there's a lot of all of these all the famous coming up"
25:05,200;25:06,520;"ish right"
25:06,520;25:11,800;"well and so yes and so that you know you you're running to the situation where"
25:11,800;25:13,680;"or players from"
25:13,680;25:15,720;"you know earlier"
25:15,720;25:17,120;"going"
25:17,120;25:20,520;"not gonna have a lot to pretend and frankly yeah"
25:20,520;25:23,720;"you know they are but"
25:23,720;25:28,040;"But the guys who, especially the guys who are part of multiple Super Bowl teams, and"
25:28,040;25:33,480;"were major contributors on those teams, well, they're probably in many cases, and not all"
25:33,480;25:37,040;"cases, but in many cases, more worthy anyway."
25:37,040;25:39,840;"So it kind of fits the bill."
25:39,840;25:45,000;"I look at pro football Hall of Famers, and I want to took Andrei Tippett to get in."
25:45,000;25:50,960;"And Andrei Tippett, it's one of Alon and Taylor in that era."
25:50,960;25:53,840;"the best linebacker out there."
25:53,840;25:56,760;"And so, but the Patriots weren't very good for a lot of those years."
25:56,760;25:58,680;"They certainly weren't competing for championships."
25:58,680;26:03,200;"They were competitive a number of times, but they weren't a perennial playoff team."
26:03,200;26:07,000;"They didn't really compete for championship consistently, and I think that hurt Andre."
26:07,000;26:13,680;"Conversely, the guys who won championships here, I think that the feather in their cap."
26:13,680;26:18,080;"And if at the end, oh, no, but I think that it's a piece of the puzzle."
26:18,080;26:25,080;"if you're a solid contributor above average player on championship teams, I think that matters."
26:25,080;26:26,080;"Yeah."
26:26,080;26:31,080;"So speaking of piece of the puzzle, I know there's a lot of things."
26:31,080;26:37,080;"By the way, I'm just a member of the committee, so I have no saying who gets a lucky document."
26:37,080;26:43,080;"So there's been a lot of discussion in like the pro football fame and other hall of"
26:43,080;26:47,120;"of like how do you evaluate off the field stuff?"
26:47,120;26:49,360;"Is that something that comes into those conversations"
26:49,360;26:50,360;"when you're doing it?"
26:50,360;26:51,200;"- Good question."
26:51,200;26:55,280;"- I, you know, we haven't had a lot of guys"
26:55,280;26:59,720;"where I think that's been an issue whose name has come up."
26:59,720;27:03,600;"I mean, I could tell you that I think Rodney Harrison"
27:03,600;27:06,900;"was hurt for a couple of years by his suspension."
27:06,900;27:08,880;"When he got sent."
27:09,880;27:13,200;"So I think that heard him, but eventually, you know,"
27:13,200;27:16,200;"I think the committee came around on that."
27:16,200;27:19,400;"You know, there are people, there are,"
27:19,400;27:21,480;"there were people in the room that were big advocates"
27:21,480;27:26,480;"for what he did on the field and the impact that he made"
27:26,480;27:29,040;"and the impact he made in the locker room."
27:29,040;27:31,680;"I think, you know, when push came to shove,"
27:31,680;27:34,400;"that kind of rose to the top."
27:34,400;27:37,560;"But that's the only time I can think of an issue"
27:37,560;27:39,200;"that we've had with an office."
27:39,200;27:43,280;"like Bill Parcels almost in terms of like"
27:43,280;27:49,200;"Bill Parcels has been a finalist three or four times now."
27:49,200;27:51,200;"I'm hard. No."
27:51,200;27:58,200;"Yeah, I think there's a lot of divisiveness between fans about whether or not to have him in."
27:58,200;28:04,200;"Well, like, remember, I used to hate Curtis Martin and then I shifted all my hate from Curtis Martin to Bill Parcels."
28:04,200;28:06,200;"Right. And I think you're not alone in that."
28:06,200;28:09,760;"that i could make it i could make it one of those things are probably on the"
28:09,760;28:13,200;"debate team i could argue either side on the part of the"
28:13,200;28:15,880;"yeah and so i'll give you my opinion"
28:15,880;28:18,160;"in that"
28:18,160;28:22,280;"i think the big argument i i i should read this every year whether it's"
28:22,280;28:25,520;"you know everybody at the boss in the law of writing it or whatever right"
28:25,520;28:27,000;"shauncee this year"
28:27,000;28:29,240;"okay i think shauncee wrote this year"
28:29,240;28:32,140;"there's no page of tall fan without bill part"
28:32,140;28:36,040;"which is you know i i respect him but i don't i certainly don't agree with"
28:36,040;28:38,040;">> You respect them?"
28:38,040;28:51,200;">> I will say about coach Parcels, the big argument I hear people make is that she brought"
28:51,200;28:54,640;"into the incredibly to the patients."
28:54,640;28:56,840;"In a time where they had none."
28:56,840;28:59,480;"That's not debatable."
28:59,480;29:00,480;"That's true."
29:00,480;29:01,480;"Yeah."
29:01,480;29:02,480;"I was arguing that"
29:02,480;29:03,480;"[inaudible]"
29:03,480;29:04,480;"[inaudible]"
29:04,480;29:05,480;"[inaudible]"
29:05,480;29:06,480;"[inaudible]"
29:06,480;29:07,480;"[inaudible]"
29:07,480;29:08,480;"[inaudible]"
29:08,480;29:09,480;"[inaudible]"
29:09,480;29:12,480;"because he had two Super Bowl rings on this."
29:12,480;29:14,480;"One of those with a giant."
29:14,480;29:17,480;"That's what's the -- that doesn't put him in the Patriots, all the time, just because"
29:17,480;29:18,480;"he had credibility."
29:18,480;29:23,480;"Now, his record -- his record in four years was 32 and 32."
29:23,480;29:25,480;"But I threw out the first year."
29:25,480;29:29,480;"In the first year, he was remaking that team, changing the culture, which he did."
29:29,480;29:30,480;"change the culture."
29:30,480;29:31,480;"Okay?"
29:31,480;29:36,840;"And then, you know, if you look at the players he drafted that continued to make impact after"
29:36,840;29:38,160;"he was gone."
29:38,160;29:44,520;"You got Bledso, Troy Brown, Chris Slade, Willie McGinnis, Curtis Martin, Ted Johnson, Teddy"
29:44,520;29:46,720;"Brudsky, lawyer Maloy, Terry Glenn."
29:46,720;29:51,360;"Although you can't really give him credit for Terry Glenn, so I take that more."
29:51,360;29:56,600;"But, you know, so there are a number of guys that he drafted and he changed the culture"
29:56,600;29:57,600;"for sure."
29:57,600;30:02,480;"Now, throughout the first year, the second year, the three and six, they ran off seven"
30:02,480;30:04,880;"in a row and make the playoffs."
30:04,880;30:09,480;"You know, that was the seven game winning streak that started with Pledso's 45 of 70"
30:09,480;30:11,480;"game in Foxborough against the Vikings."
30:11,480;30:12,480;"The Vikings."
30:12,480;30:13,480;"Twenty over time win."
30:13,480;30:18,480;"Okay, so then they went seven in a row, they finished with Beatty Chicago, and they play"
30:18,480;30:23,520;"actually Cleveland, Bill Belichick's Cleveland Browns in the wildcard game, and they lose."
30:23,520;30:32,000;"They come back in 95 with some higher expectations and they go six and ten blood so separates his non-trolling shoulder during the season"
30:32,000;30:36,520;"Parcells plays him through it. He struggles and they go six and ten"
30:36,520;30:39,440;"During that season"
30:39,440;30:45,080;"You know Parcells didn't do a didn't do his press conference after the game in Kansas City"
30:45,080;30:47,400;"Said he was dehydrated"
30:47,400;30:53,320;"consultant that came and asked for the final year office contract. His people reach out to the owners to the craft"
30:53,320;30:55,880;"asked for the final year office contract"
30:55,880;31:02,120;"So they give it to him and putting in the stipulation into his contract that he can't coach anywhere else in 1997"
31:02,120;31:08,600;"So um, so they go through the 95 season and they get to the draft"
31:08,600;31:15,720;"Now he wants to draft that they give with a defensive lineman from humson and bobby grayer wanted to draft terry glen"
31:16,280;31:22,120;"right so robert has to step in and make a decision if i go with my head coach"
31:22,120;31:28,520;"or my personnel guy well my head coach is in the final year of his contract and half for"
31:28,520;31:34,600;"the 97 year to be eliminated from his contract my personnel guy is in it for the long haul yeah"
31:34,600;31:40,600;"so he goes with body rightly or wrong but he's decided he goes with body to draft terry glenn"
31:41,320;31:47,320;"And which leads to the if they want you to cook the meal, it should at least fight you shot for the grocery."
31:47,320;31:49,320;"By the grocery, yeah."
31:49,320;31:51,320;"So, you know, so..."
31:51,320;31:54,320;"I don't know if he'd already asked for the last year out of his contract. That's crazy."
31:54,320;31:56,320;"I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah."
31:56,320;32:00,320;"And then, you know, during the '96 Super Bowl season, his house was to sail."
32:00,320;32:06,320;"So, you know, I mean, I think that there's a lot of things that enter into the fray."
32:06,320;32:11,320;"And so the supporters of his Hall of Fame candidacy,"
32:11,320;32:17,240;"first of all, I think the media supports him"
32:17,240;32:20,520;"more so than the fan base as a whole."
32:20,520;32:23,880;"And I think the media enjoyed covering him."
32:23,880;32:26,280;"You know, he's a very charismatic guy."
32:26,280;32:27,440;"I never covered him by the way."
32:27,440;32:30,600;"I started covering the team right after he left."
32:30,600;32:34,160;"But so I don't have any personal experiences with him."
32:34,160;32:35,840;"So those guys, I think while the media,"
32:35,840;32:37,040;"He's filled with notebooks."
32:37,040;32:38,120;"He gave them great quotes."
32:38,120;32:39,520;"He was good TV."
32:39,520;32:40,720;"They all liked him."
32:40,720;32:42,520;"They all enjoyed covering him."
32:42,520;32:46,720;"So I think that's a part of it."
32:46,720;32:51,120;"And he definitely had a major impact now."
32:51,120;32:52,640;"People talk about the guys he drafted"
32:52,640;32:55,120;"that were part of the Super Bowl teams in the early 2000s,"
32:55,120;32:56,440;"and that's true."
32:56,440;32:59,160;"However, they also don't bring up the fact"
32:59,160;33:04,840;"that after he left with those guys, Kevin 6, 9, 7, 8,"
33:04,840;33:14,000;"eight, five and 11. And it wasn't until 2001 when Coach Belichick brought in a lot of"
33:14,000;33:22,720;"good veteran leader guys Roman Pfeiffer, Brian Cox, Anthony Plutton, Otis Smith, you know,"
33:22,720;33:30,200;"a number of guys that were Mike Ravel, David Patton. These guys that were veteran guys that"
33:30,200;33:33,640;"really added some character to the locker room because,"
33:33,640;33:35,760;"and listen, I'm not taking anything away"
33:35,760;33:37,920;"from those Parcels draft picks."
33:37,920;33:41,040;"They were all tremendous, but I don't think they were ready"
33:41,040;33:43,760;"to step into leadership roles when Parcels left."
33:43,760;33:47,880;"Okay, and so they really evolved,"
33:47,880;33:50,400;"and I think that bringing in those character guys"
33:50,400;33:53,960;"into the locker room was helpful."
33:53,960;33:56,840;"Even the guy like crying out,"
33:56,840;34:01,560;"He's got a great reputation in you now."
34:01,560;34:05,840;"Had his incidents with the fans."
34:05,840;34:11,520;"But Billy Coach, I'll never forget in 2001, week two."
34:11,520;34:15,080;"And they were playing the Colts in week three."
34:15,080;34:16,560;"Brady's first start, and the Colts"
34:16,560;34:18,960;"had scored 85 points or something in the first two games."
34:18,960;34:21,200;"And the Patriots had struggled to 0 and 2."
34:21,200;34:23,480;"And nobody gave the Patriots a chance."
34:23,480;34:25,760;"And Brian Cox was in front of his locker that week."
34:25,760;34:29,520;"and he basically said, I won't quote him."
34:29,520;34:31,840;"He said, I'll quote some of them."
34:31,840;34:33,920;"He said, Peyton Manning puts his pants on"
34:33,920;34:36,240;"just like I put my pants on."
34:36,240;34:40,280;"And I'm not the kind of guy to blank another man's blank."
34:40,280;34:42,280;"(laughing)"
34:42,280;34:47,000;"Okay, and he said one week in this league"
34:47,000;34:48,960;"has nothing to do with the next."
34:48,960;34:51,880;"And they went out one 44 to 13."
34:51,880;34:52,720;"- Oh, they did."
34:52,720;34:58,000;"Brady Brady didn't have huge numbers but Antoine Smith rushed for 90 something yards"
34:58,000;35:03,000;"They had a couple interceptions for touchdowns. Pylah had won Otis Smith had won"
35:03,000;35:09,840;"And didn't Brian and Cox set the tone in that game with a hit on whoever that wide receiver was"
35:09,840;35:13,840;"He laid out one of the Colts wide receivers early"
35:20,560;35:23,740;"Drone, Python yeah, let's look through my notes"
35:23,740;35:32,640;"Losing a bit there, yeah"
35:32,640;35:39,560;"But I said that slower"
35:39,560;35:44,640;"You still there Brian you guys got me yeah, we got you back now. Yeah"
35:49,080;35:55,720;"Yeah, that's a whole lot better. Yeah, yeah, you sound great. I lose ya. No, well, we lost you for a second. I can still see ya"
35:55,720;36:01,500;"Yeah, no, you're back. Can you hear us? No? No, you can't. We got you. It's down"
36:01,500;36:07,100;"Yeah, still there. I can see you. I just can't hear you. Oh"
36:07,100;36:12,760;"Turn the volume up"
36:12,760;36:15,860;"Hello, hey, hi, we gonna hear you"
36:17,160;36:19,160;"But you can't hear us"
36:19,160;36:26,720;"Yeah, sorry about that"
36:26,720;36:29,520;"It was your own paypal. Yeah"
36:29,520;36:32,320;"And you know"
36:32,320;36:39,680;"But those guys really kind of carried the torch a little bit that season and brought you know Roman Fyfer"
36:39,680;36:42,840;"I mean you couldn't have a better guy in the locker room in Roman Fyfer. Oh, yeah"
36:43,080;36:49,520;"And when you added those guys to the Troy Browns and the Teddy Bruce Keys and Ted Johnson's"
36:49,520;36:54,000;"that were already in the room, I think that made all the difference in the world."
36:54,000;37:00,240;"And then getting everybody to buy into the whole team concept and leave the egos at the"
37:00,240;37:02,880;"door made a big difference as well."
37:02,880;37:10,040;"So I just think that when you talk about Coach Parcells, yes, those guys made it impact,"
37:10,040;37:13,560;"it was later on and took some time."
37:13,560;37:16,120;"It wasn't like when Coach Parcelle's left,"
37:16,120;37:19,040;"that culture change didn't stay."
37:19,040;37:20,760;"Pete Carroll brought his own culture in."
37:20,760;37:21,760;"- Right."
37:21,760;37:25,880;"- And so, and at that time, it didn't work."
37:25,880;37:28,400;"And that was a number of reasons for that."
37:28,400;37:32,960;"But so, I think that people that say Coach Parcelle's"
37:32,960;37:34,760;"in our Hall of Fame is a no brainer,"
37:34,760;37:35,680;"I don't agree with that."
37:35,680;37:37,320;"I think it's a great debate."
37:37,320;37:39,040;"I think it would be a great induction ceremony."
37:39,040;37:39,960;"don't get me wrong."
37:39,960;37:42,600;"- Oh yeah, that speech would be great."
37:42,600;37:45,840;"- And I'm not trying to take anything away from the guy."
37:45,840;37:48,240;"He's a pro football Hall of Famer, hands down."
37:48,240;37:49,080;"- Yeah."
37:49,080;37:49,920;"- Yes."
37:49,920;37:50,760;"- Oh, you're mad at that."
37:50,760;37:51,600;"- But not pass Hall of Famer."
37:51,600;37:53,800;"- And some of the debates we've had in the room"
37:53,800;37:57,440;"center around a guy's amount of time with the team."
37:57,440;37:59,880;"So Curtis Martin, three years."
37:59,880;38:01,760;"Randy Moss, three years."
38:01,760;38:04,800;"Even Rodney came up, because Rodney I think was here"
38:04,800;38:07,280;"for six, but he was injured for a couple of those."
38:07,280;38:10,680;"So, but no one seems to really be bothered by the fact"
38:10,680;38:13,240;"that Parcels was only here for four."
38:13,240;38:16,240;"So, you know, like I said, it's a great debate."
38:16,240;38:19,360;"I don't think it's a no brainer by any stretch."
38:19,360;38:22,480;"I can't argue with people that say he changed the culture"
38:22,480;38:23,960;"and brought credibility to the team."
38:23,960;38:25,240;"He did those things."
38:25,240;38:26,520;"- Absolutely."
38:26,520;38:28,960;"- But I don't think it lingered when he left."
38:28,960;38:32,320;"So I don't, now the other thing people try to argue is that,"
38:32,320;38:35,560;"you know, Bill Belichick wouldn't be here"
38:35,560;38:37,560;"that wasn't to build ourselves."
38:37,560;38:39,560;"And there's definitely some truth to that."
38:39,560;38:43,200;"You know, Bill Belichick was introduced"
38:43,200;38:46,000;"to Robert Kraft in 1996."
38:46,000;38:49,600;"And so maybe Bill Belichick is in here"
38:49,600;38:51,200;"if it wasn't to build Parsel."
38:51,200;38:54,120;"I don't fall into the camp that Bill Parsel deserves"
38:54,120;38:57,040;"any credit for what Bill Belichick has done here."
38:57,040;38:59,320;"- Oh yeah, I agree with that."
38:59,320;39:01,160;"- So that's my two cents on that."
39:01,160;39:04,560;"How's, did that toe the line enough?"
39:04,760;39:06,060;"(laughs)"
39:06,060;39:08,020;"- No, I mean, I think you have a great conversation."
39:08,020;39:10,280;"- I feel you didn't take it involved in that stance, so yeah."
39:10,280;39:11,520;"(laughs)"
39:11,520;39:13,440;"I mean, listen, I think it would be great"
39:13,440;39:16,160;"if it would be great ceremony, for sure."
39:16,160;39:19,120;"I just, you know, I think it's a great debate."
39:19,120;39:20,520;"I don't think it's a no-brainer, it's my point."
39:20,520;39:22,160;"- Yeah, yeah."
39:22,160;39:23,600;"I think I'm in the same boat."
39:23,600;39:27,680;"So Steve's a hard no, I'm in the middle with Bryce."
39:27,680;39:28,800;"That must mean Greg's a hard idea."
39:28,800;39:33,800;"- Well, I think it's a very polarizing, you know, debate."
39:34,120;39:37,600;"And there are people that think like,"
39:37,600;39:39,640;"it's Sean of C, that, you know,"
39:39,640;39:41,760;"there is no Hall of Fame without him in it."
39:41,760;39:44,000;"And then there are people that do not forgive"
39:44,000;39:45,480;"the way he left."
39:45,480;39:46,840;"I mean, he didn't file home with the team"
39:46,840;39:47,680;"from the Super Bowl."
39:47,680;39:49,960;"I think again, a piece of the puzzle."
39:49,960;39:53,120;"Like I've argued, I've argued actually in the meetings,"
39:53,120;39:55,440;"well, we need to consider Chuck Fairbanks"
39:55,440;39:58,800;"because he was built for ourselves before Bill Parcels here."
39:58,800;40:02,120;"He took over a down trodden franchise in the early 70s"
40:02,120;40:05,640;"and he drafted multiple Patriots Hall of Famers,"
40:05,640;40:07,720;"including two pro football Hall of Famers"
40:07,720;40:09,920;"and John Hannah and Mike Haines,"
40:09,920;40:12,440;"but Stanley Morgan, Steve Nelson, Steve Grogan,"
40:12,440;40:16,320;"a number of guys through that period of the 70s."
40:16,320;40:19,720;"I mean, Darryl Stingley, who obviously is in the Hall of Fame"
40:19,720;40:21,040;"and his career was cut short,"
40:21,040;40:26,040;"but Pete Brock, Tim Fox, Sam Cunningham,"
40:26,040;40:30,320;"and he had that 76 team on the cusp of a championship"
40:30,320;40:33,320;"when they got screwed by Ben Dreyth on a phantom"
40:33,320;40:36,240;"roughing the pasta call, they were the only team"
40:36,240;40:38,920;"to beat Oakland that year and they hammered Oakland"
40:38,920;40:40,280;"in the regular season."
40:40,280;40:43,680;"Oakland went on to win the Super Bowl"
40:43,680;40:46,040;"and the Patriots left with a bitter taste."
40:46,040;40:47,440;"Took 25 years, by the way."
40:47,440;40:50,680;"Yeah, we got to have a half-track pool."
40:50,680;40:53,200;"(laughing)"
40:53,200;40:54,920;"And then the '78 team was the first team"
40:54,920;40:58,280;"to win the division, but Fairbanks left"
40:58,280;41:00,760;"under a similar cloud of controversy."
41:00,760;41:02,880;"You know, he had accepted a college job,"
41:02,880;41:04,840;"I think at the University of Oklahoma"
41:04,840;41:07,740;"and the Sullivan family got wind of it"
41:07,740;41:09,760;"going into their final game in Miami"
41:09,760;41:13,400;"and says, I guess suspended him would be the right word"
41:13,400;41:14,560;"for the final game."
41:14,560;41:16,680;"And the coordinators coached the game in Miami."
41:16,680;41:19,480;"They reinstated them for the playoff game against Houston."
41:19,480;41:23,720;"They got buried by the Oilers and then he was gone."
41:23,720;41:25,880;"And so there was a similar controversy"
41:25,880;41:27,080;"around his departure."
41:27,080;41:29,680;"And again, I think that's a piece of the puzzle."
41:29,680;41:32,200;"- Yeah, that doesn't sound as much like that's on him"
41:32,200;41:34,760;"as maybe the way Parcells left though."
41:34,760;41:36,880;"That almost sounds like ownership."
41:36,880;41:41,880;"- Yeah, I mean, listen, I think that Parcells,"
41:41,880;41:44,800;"put it this way, I know that when Parcells,"
41:44,800;41:47,680;"when Parcells was hired before craft bought the team,"
41:47,680;41:50,520;"when Robert bought the team,"
41:50,520;41:52,940;"one of his first calls came from coach Parcells"
41:52,940;41:54,680;"saying he was thinking about leaving."
41:56,120;41:58,760;"So I think it was always a year to year thing."
41:58,760;42:01,640;"And I think his career bears that out."
42:01,640;42:03,680;"Like he left here, he went to the Jets short term,"
42:03,680;42:05,000;"then to the Cowboys short term,"
42:05,000;42:07,040;"then he was with the Dolphins for a little bit, right?"
42:07,040;42:09,240;"Or vice versa on the Dolphins and the Cowboys."
42:09,240;42:11,840;"So he kind of jumped around a little bit."
42:11,840;42:13,680;"And I think he was just,"
42:13,680;42:15,400;"I think that phone call was probably made"
42:15,400;42:17,320;"to feel out ownership."
42:17,320;42:19,760;"But you know, Robert gave him what he wanted."
42:19,760;42:21,440;"I mean, he went and signed David Meggett"
42:21,440;42:24,080;"to a good sized contract."
42:24,080;42:26,520;"They traded Irving Fryer."
42:26,520;42:30,720;"They signed Bob Cratch and Robert,"
42:30,720;42:32,320;"the other offensive lineman that he had coached"
42:32,320;42:33,280;"with the Giants."
42:33,280;42:36,000;"I mean, he was doing what Parcells wanted him to do."
42:36,000;42:38,160;"And then over time, I think, you know,"
42:38,160;42:42,080;"I'm sure both sides would admit to making mistakes"
42:42,080;42:43,920;"in that relationship, but I think the trust"
42:43,920;42:47,680;"between the two eroded and it led to kind of a bit of breakup."
42:47,680;42:50,000;"- Yeah, and you know, that sort of thing happens,"
42:50,000;42:53,280;"especially in business, but I think a lot of businesses"
42:53,280;42:57,200;"don't have fans attached to the outcomes of those situations."
42:57,200;42:58,200;"Yeah."
42:58,200;43:03,200;"We find ourselves in having these conversations about football when you wouldn't about web"
43:03,200;43:08,040;"development, for instance, or marketing or whatever it is that Greg does."
43:08,040;43:10,200;"Greg does even know Greg does."
43:10,200;43:13,560;"No, he doesn't."
43:13,560;43:16,240;"Whatever it is, I'm in the hall of fame of it."
43:16,240;43:19,040;"Well, I'm not Danny."
43:19,040;43:20,880;"I just work in one."
43:20,880;43:24,620;"That's the counts during the Hall of Fame of Hall of Fame"
43:24,620;43:29,360;"They don't give me a red jacket"
43:29,360;43:36,400;"Jackets and nice. Yeah, leave it. They're way nicer than the ones I get in Canton"
43:36,400;43:39,860;"Yeah, I'll buy one from China for 35 bucks"
43:39,860;43:47,760;"Nice, yeah, I'm not gonna lie the fabric probably comes from China, but"
43:49,360;43:56,200;"But they're custom made so nice. Yeah, Steve you have you have one last question for Brian. Yeah"
43:56,200;43:59,880;"It's more of a favor than a question"
43:59,880;44:08,400;"Okay, I just you know I could die happy if Troy Brown knows who I am or knows who we are really"
44:08,400;44:15,540;"So we have a little paper it's down is the podcast. Yeah, so hey, there's these brown brothers that just love you Troy"
44:16,720;44:21,120;"You don't have to listen to it. I don't think I'm even allowed to see him right now"
44:21,120;44:28,080;"And those guys get tested every single day right now"
44:28,080;44:32,480;"So they're in like their own little bubble in terms of in the stadium"
44:32,480;44:36,360;"So we're not I'm not anyway, I haven't seen a player"
44:36,360;44:40,680;"You know so I'm a no hurry. I gotta I"
44:40,680;44:44,240;"Life"
44:44,240;44:45,080;"- Yeah, that's right."
44:45,080;44:46,400;"- What can Brown do for you?"
44:46,400;44:47,880;"(laughing)"
44:47,880;44:51,240;"- Well, we were gonna do a podcast about the Cleveland Browns"
44:51,240;44:52,940;"and do Browns on Browns."
44:52,940;44:53,780;"- There you go."
44:53,780;44:55,780;"- But there's not many games to tell you."
44:55,780;44:56,920;"- I wanna know what you thought,"
44:56,920;44:59,580;"so on week two of 2002 against Buffalo."
44:59,580;45:01,380;"- Oh, you wanna get into this?"
45:01,380;45:02,220;"We can talk about it."
45:02,220;45:04,420;"- If you want to listen to the podcast,"
45:04,420;45:06,260;"I can tell you you've already done that one."
45:06,260;45:07,820;"We're out of the second one."
45:07,820;45:09,820;"- I know in 2002, I was like,"
45:09,820;45:11,420;"""Oh, I'm gonna go to the next one."""
45:11,420;45:13,220;"- Oh, I'm gonna go to the next one."
45:13,220;45:15,620;"I know in 2002 we couldn't stop the run."
45:15,620;45:18,140;"Now we crushed blood."
45:18,140;45:22,220;"So that but that actually came about in the Kansas City game,"
45:22,220;45:23,700;"which might have been week three."
45:23,700;45:25,100;"That's when it kicked off."
45:25,100;45:26,100;"Free songs."
45:26,100;45:26,860;"Yeah."
45:26,860;45:29,700;"He's telling the game for us and send it to overtime."
45:29,700;45:30,460;"Yep."
45:30,460;45:37,340;"And Steve actually called it because it was one last play to tie the game up at the end of the game."
45:37,340;45:38,300;"And exactly."
45:38,300;45:38,660;"Yes."
45:38,660;45:41,340;"He was thinking that that it would be a pass play."
45:41,380;45:43,780;"But yeah, I throw a slap at these."
45:43,780;45:48,780;"That was the that was the day brought Steve Martin in."
45:48,780;45:51,100;"He was like the big fridge and acquisition."
45:51,100;45:52,940;"Yeah, I saw him in this game."
45:52,940;45:53,940;"I'm about to talk about it."
45:53,940;45:56,260;"Yeah, I think I don't think he worked out that well."
45:56,260;45:58,540;"No, no, no."
45:58,540;46:04,180;"I was actually reading the war room by Michael Holly."
46:04,180;46:05,380;"Yes, thank you."
46:05,380;46:06,380;"Yeah."
46:06,380;46:10,700;"And that was actually in there about how Bell check was."
46:11,180;46:13,100;"So angry over his tape."
46:13,100;46:14,540;"That's all they did one day."
46:14,540;46:16,820;"Let's just go over how bad he was on tape."
46:16,820;46:18,620;"Yeah."
46:18,620;46:20,100;"Well, they certainly struggled that year."
46:20,100;46:22,620;"They lost that game in San Diego and they couldn't stop LT."
46:22,620;46:22,980;"Although."
46:22,980;46:25,340;"No shame not being actually."
46:25,340;46:26,660;"Priest homes is pretty good too."
46:26,660;46:28,220;"But yeah, but both of those."
46:28,220;46:31,660;"Well, I think Priest homes went for almost 200 yards."
46:31,660;46:33,660;"LT did go over 200 yards."
46:33,660;46:34,260;"Yeah."
46:34,260;46:35,700;"And then who was it?"
46:35,700;46:37,140;"That was on a dolphins at that point."
46:37,140;46:38,900;"Oh, the Mars Smith."
46:38,900;46:39,660;"No, the Mars Smith."
46:39,660;46:40,020;"I think."
46:40,020;46:40,220;"Yeah."
46:40,220;46:48,520;"And then but I mean so those those two games and they lost to the Packers and the Broncos after that"
46:48,520;46:53,780;"Oh, by the way, they wore blue on blue in those two games"
46:53,780;46:57,600;"They did and after that Belichick say we're never doing that again"
46:57,600;47:01,660;"Is that why I was actually wondering if that was the case because that does sound like a Belichick"
47:01,660;47:08,340;"They and then they you know when the NFL brought out the color rush uniforms. They they caved in and"
47:09,620;47:11,620;"So they had a choice."
47:11,620;47:13,620;"And now they're wearing them again, right?"
47:13,620;47:15,620;"And that's what they're doing for now."
47:15,620;47:17,620;"That's their actual uniform."
47:17,620;47:19,620;"Well, the top is now, yeah, the top is essentially the new top."
47:19,620;47:22,620;"But yeah, are they wearing it blue and blue at home?"
47:22,620;47:23,620;"I think it's wrong blue."
47:23,620;47:25,620;"Oh, they might be. Yeah, you might be right."
47:25,620;47:27,620;"It's like real similar to the color of the rush."
47:27,620;47:30,620;"I know the jersey is basically that same exact jersey."
47:30,620;47:32,620;"Right. Yeah."
47:32,620;47:37,620;"But, um, yeah, so they lost those four games in 2002."
47:37,620;47:42,140;"And that is the longest losing streak in the past 20 years."
47:42,140;47:43,540;"- In the bell I take care."
47:43,540;47:44,460;"- Yeah, four."
47:44,460;47:45,300;"- They've been lost."
47:45,300;47:48,020;"- They've lost it, we have another 18 years."
47:48,020;47:50,900;"- Yeah, they've done it a couple times."
47:50,900;47:52,860;"- They've lost being in a row a couple times?"
47:52,860;47:54,100;"- Not very often."
47:54,100;47:54,940;"- Yeah."
47:54,940;47:56,780;"- We have a website to figure this out, right?"
47:56,780;47:57,620;"- We do, yeah."
47:57,620;47:58,460;"- Yeah, I'm good."
47:58,460;48:01,280;"- We have a website to figure this out, right?"
48:01,280;48:02,180;"- We do, yeah."
48:02,180;48:03,020;"- Yeah, I'm good."
48:03,020;48:04,860;"- We have a website to figure this out, right?"
48:04,860;48:05,700;"- We do, yeah."
48:05,700;48:06,540;"- Yeah, I'm good."
48:06,540;48:08,440;"It's tough on them."
48:08,440;48:10,520;"Yeah, I can't--"
48:10,520;48:11,360;"Are we just getting it?"
48:11,360;48:15,040;"It may have been around the beginning and end"
48:15,040;48:16,240;"of a season sort of thing."
48:16,240;48:17,240;"Yeah."
48:17,240;48:18,240;"Yeah."
48:18,240;48:20,520;"So I'll tell you something for you."
48:20,520;48:24,720;"So we just were kind of finishing up with the first year,"
48:24,720;48:26,560;"but we did an exhibit throughout last year called,"
48:26,560;48:28,440;"yes, it's still a dynasty."
48:28,440;48:32,520;"But we compared the Patriots since 2001"
48:32,520;48:36,440;"to every team in the NFL, and the dominance is remarkable."
48:36,440;48:39,880;"And don't listen to anyone that tells you they win because they're in the AFC East,"
48:39,880;48:41,680;"because they dominate every division."
48:41,680;48:44,280;">> Over 70% of winning percentage."
48:44,280;48:49,080;">> They have an over 70 winning percentage against every division except the AFC West,"
48:49,080;48:51,320;"and it's like 643 against the West."
48:51,320;48:58,880;"So anyway, that exhibit is now kind of ending its run and we're transitioning"
48:58,880;49:05,240;"to the all dynasty team, which will celebrate the individuals that made up the dynasty."
49:05,240;49:10,440;"So we had fans vote throughout last season on patreon.com to help pick that that team."
49:10,440;49:13,760;"And that will be unveiled here in the next couple, two, three weeks."
49:13,760;49:15,200;"OK, I did that."
49:15,200;49:16,280;"I did that vote."
49:16,280;49:18,280;"It's so much higher than you think."
49:18,280;49:19,200;"I know."
49:19,200;49:23,280;"I've tried to put that team together like now, friend down, like, Oh, pick three"
49:23,280;49:24,120;"cornerbacks."
49:24,120;49:28,240;"And it was, yeah, that's not going to say who your second who, who would the second"
49:28,240;49:28,880;"corner back be?"
49:28,880;49:30,680;"So, so who's your kid?"
49:30,680;49:33,040;"Who's your kid here?"
49:33,240;49:34,440;"We've had that talk to you."
49:34,440;49:35,580;"You've had this, maybe."
49:35,580;49:37,440;"I will."
49:37,440;49:40,100;"Who is selected, but you know,"
49:40,100;49:41,700;"I did."
49:41,700;49:42,960;"Yeah."
49:42,960;49:45,160;"It has to be even a Terry."
49:45,160;49:45,920;"Who's that?"
49:45,920;49:47,440;"I mean, my fire."
49:47,440;49:51,000;"Who's your quarterback?"
49:51,000;49:51,760;"Get the fuck out of here."
49:51,760;49:54,920;"Scott's on the lack."
49:54,920;49:57,000;"Scott's."
49:57,000;50:00,400;"Dude, I'm open."
50:00,400;50:00,800;"Zola."
50:00,800;50:01,760;"I can fucking love that guy."
50:02,120;50:05,960;"I just looked up there is no three game losing streaks either."
50:05,960;50:08,540;"Really? There's a couple."
50:08,540;50:12,840;"Uh, I saw one four in five games, but no three in a row."
50:12,840;50:14,560;"Wow."
50:14,560;50:17,800;"Pretty good."
50:17,800;50:23,160;"A lot of five game winning streaks though."
50:23,160;50:24,640;"Yeah."
50:24,640;50:25,400;"A couple of us."
50:25,400;50:28,960;"We're actually, yeah, we're coming up on the, uh, the big winning streak."
50:29,440;50:33,340;"Once we get through the 2002 season, this is where we're doing a"
50:33,340;50:36,880;"watching a lot of losses this season, but we'll never watch as"
50:36,880;50:38,540;"many in a season again."
50:38,540;50:42,400;"Yeah, after the starting with the Tennessee game in 2003, you'll"
50:42,400;50:43,220;"have a nice run."
50:43,220;50:44,020;"Yeah."
50:44,020;50:47,020;"Yeah, after that Washington game, that's looking forward to it."
50:47,020;50:47,520;"Correct."
50:47,520;50:47,900;"Yeah."
50:47,900;50:48,440;"Me too."
50:48,440;50:52,360;"Which Daniel Graham had only come down with that pass."
50:52,360;50:54,400;"Yeah, the game, they might have been able to win that one too."
50:54,400;50:55,380;"Yeah."
50:55,380;50:56,480;"Yeah, that was even a close one."
50:56,680;50:57,760;"is he on this podcast?"
50:57,760;50:59,080;"But you don't even know the idea."
50:59,080;51:02,560;"I'll just watch him again."
51:02,560;51:05,040;"I'll give you a quick story on the Tennessee game."
51:05,040;51:06,840;"I don't know if you guys remember this."
51:06,840;51:13,320;"But so Steve McNair runs for a touchdown in that game."
51:13,320;51:16,200;"I think that made it like 38 to 30, which was the final score,"
51:16,200;51:18,160;"because Ty Law had just returned an interception"
51:18,160;51:22,520;"for touchdown before that and limped into the end zone."
51:22,520;51:26,400;"McNair scores a touchdown at the same time"
51:26,400;51:30,920;"that David Ortiz doubles off Keith Folk."
51:30,920;51:31,760;"- Yeah, in the puns."
51:31,760;51:34,280;"- In the ALDS, I think it was,"
51:34,280;51:37,120;"'cause Folk was still playing for Oakland at the time."
51:37,120;51:39,400;"And there's so many fans in the stands"
51:39,400;51:42,680;"that have their headphones in, listen to the Socks game"
51:42,680;51:47,200;"that McNair scores a touchdown and the fans start cheering."
51:47,200;51:49,520;"(laughing)"
51:49,520;51:51,560;"And then they showed, I think they showed on the screen"
51:51,560;51:53,840;"after that Ortiz's double."
51:53,840;51:55,680;"But I remember after the game,"
51:55,680;51:59,040;"talking to Richard Seymour and he was pissed."
51:59,040;52:00,040;"- How bad?"
52:00,040;52:02,240;"- He was like, if you wanna watch the Red Sox,"
52:02,240;52:04,240;"go to the Red Sox."
52:04,240;52:05,760;"- I love that."
52:05,760;52:08,080;"- But it was just a funny anecdotal story"
52:08,080;52:09,360;"about that game that I remember."
52:09,360;52:10,880;"- I remember that, yeah."
52:10,880;52:13,080;"- It was awesome. - Realize it was that game."
52:13,080;52:17,960;"- And that started the 21 game win streak."
52:17,960;52:19,160;"- It did."
52:19,160;52:21,240;"It angered them so much."
52:21,240;52:22,560;"- They had the most impressive--"
52:22,560;52:25,840;"- I just had so many championship teams"
52:25,840;52:27,120;"to choose from the cheer for."
52:27,120;52:27,960;"- Oh, check."
52:27,960;52:29,480;"So, guys, we're gonna overtake the Red Sox."
52:29,480;52:30,320;"- Yeah."
52:30,320;52:31,880;"- Oh, missh, can you accomplish now?"
52:31,880;52:32,720;"- Exactly."
52:32,720;52:34,520;"- Oh, man."
52:34,520;52:35,360;"Yeah, we don't talk about that."
52:35,360;52:36,340;"- Yep."
52:36,340;52:37,180;"So."
52:37,180;52:41,360;"- All right, guys, anything else?"
52:41,360;52:45,160;"- Yeah, just let Troy Brown know that we love him"
52:45,160;52:46,880;"and we think he's the man."
52:46,880;52:48,680;"- Passing on Troy Baum's love."
52:48,680;52:49,520;"- Yes."
52:49,520;52:50,360;"- Got him."
52:50,360;52:51,200;"- Yeah. - Got it."
52:51,200;52:52,040;"(laughs)"
52:52,040;52:56,600;"Thank you so much for doing this. This has been awesome. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, Brian."
52:56,600;52:59,000;"Talk to you soon. Yeah."
52:59,000;53:12,680;"That's pretty good. Pretty good. All right. That was Brian from the Page of Tall fame."
53:12,680;53:20,360;"But what we're really here to talk about is the return of mom's golden boy, Drew Bledsoe,"
53:21,160;53:27,480;"to the hallowed halls of what used to be Foxboro stadium, but isn't because he never actually"
53:27,480;53:33,000;"played in July. So that's not really a return. It's a first time. It isn't it isn't. It's like"
53:33,000;53:38,280;"no, it's like driving past your old house that you grew up in, but then they knocked it down and"
53:38,280;53:42,360;"built another house like a little bit over and now your old house is a parking lot and a nicer house."
53:42,360;53:50,120;"Yeah. And they're way more successful now. Yeah. You're like damn that looks nice."
53:50,120;53:52,400;"- Oh man, look at those nice cars parked out there"
53:52,400;53:54,240;"as you're driving by in the jalabi."
53:54,240;53:56,840;"- Yeah, as soon as you left, they won the lottery."
53:56,840;53:59,120;"(laughing)"
53:59,120;54:00,560;"Very next year, yeah."
54:00,560;54:03,960;"- Amazing."
54:03,960;54:07,880;"- So yeah, but I think the announcers"
54:07,880;54:12,520;"and like the broadcast really wanted this to be a good game."
54:12,520;54:15,160;"Like the whole intro to it was"
54:15,160;54:18,200;"Bletsoe's coming back to the place that he built"
54:18,200;54:20,420;"And he, like the pages were nothing without him."
54:20,420;54:24,800;"And now he's come back to get vengeance on the team"
54:24,800;54:28,880;"to let him go because of Tom Brady and all this stuff."
54:28,880;54:30,680;"- They already kind of played that in the other game"
54:30,680;54:31,680;"in Northridge Park."
54:31,680;54:33,080;"- They did, but this was more like,"
54:33,080;54:34,040;"- It felt a little old."
54:34,040;54:36,040;"- It did, but this was like, he's coming home"
54:36,040;54:37,520;"and like how are the fans gonna react"
54:37,520;54:39,200;"and apparently game of standing ovation, which"
54:39,200;54:40,480;"- They definitely game of standing o."
54:40,480;54:42,320;"- As you should, yes."
54:42,320;54:45,720;"- Well, it was a big game for the standings too."
54:45,720;54:46,560;"- It was, yeah."
54:46,560;54:49,040;"You're talking about the seven and five"
54:49,040;54:51,480;"paths against the six and six bills."
54:51,480;54:52,920;"So I mean, right?"
54:52,920;54:54,920;"This is to decide the division."
54:54,920;54:55,880;"This is a big game."
54:55,880;54:56,200;"Yeah."
54:56,200;54:59,160;"And I think the Patriots needed to stay in first place"
54:59,160;55:01,400;"with dolphins, I want to say."
55:01,400;55:03,280;"Maybe even the Jets too."
55:03,280;55:04,920;"And the Bills game behind."
55:04,920;55:06,800;"So it was one of those--"
55:06,800;55:11,840;"it was like the only year that there was parity in the AFCEs."
55:11,840;55:12,840;"Isn't that what we've been saying?"
55:12,840;55:12,840;"Yeah."
55:12,840;55:14,440;"For the past like that, that graphic."
55:14,440;55:15,760;"The last time we lost."
55:15,760;55:21,360;"Yeah. We've already, like you said, though, we've already talked about these bills."
55:21,360;55:22,880;"We know that they'll finish 8-8."
55:22,880;55:31,680;"Last in the AFC East. Do not make the playoffs. We talked about Greg Williams in the last time."
55:31,680;55:37,120;"They, back this season, they were having people introduce the teens. We already"
55:37,120;55:41,120;"I forget who we were crapping on for. Oh, Joey Harrington, you guys are"
55:41,120;55:43,520;"- Oh yeah. - And they had the same thing"
55:43,520;55:46,920;"where somebody talks about what the game plans gonna be."
55:46,920;55:50,560;"And we had Troy Brown, you know, and Troy Brown's"
55:50,560;55:52,480;"saying, ""You know, we just gotta go out there"
55:52,480;55:53,320;"""and give it our all."""
55:53,320;55:55,560;"And you know, spread the ball around to our job."
55:55,560;55:56,440;"- Do our all-out job. - Do our receivers"
55:56,440;55:57,280;"who are really good."
55:57,280;55:58,720;"Just do our job. - Not including me."
55:58,720;56:00,200;"- And then they had Greg Williams"
56:00,200;56:01,920;"and he's going out there being like,"
56:01,920;56:03,560;"""You gotta kill the head first."""
56:03,560;56:06,320;"(laughing)"
56:06,320;56:09,040;"- Well he didn't say that otherwise I would have wrote it down."
56:09,040;56:10,960;"- But when they said, ""Okay, now Greg Williams"
56:10,960;56:12,440;"is gonna talk about the business like mine,"
56:12,440;56:13,280;"know what to expect."
56:13,280;56:14,720;"- Oh yeah, I got my pencil ready."
56:14,720;56:16,320;"I'm like, come on, give me a deep quote,"
56:16,320;56:17,160;"but it wasn't."
56:17,160;56:18,680;"- Attack the ACL."
56:18,680;56:23,080;"- No, but he was all like,"
56:23,080;56:25,240;"ah, this is stupid coach garbage,"
56:25,240;56:27,580;"instead of Greg Williams' garbage."
56:27,580;56:29,400;"So that was a shame."
56:29,400;56:30,240;"- Yeah."
56:30,240;56:33,080;"- You never know what goes on behind closed doors, you know?"
56:33,080;56:34,000;"- That's true, yeah."
56:34,000;56:35,000;"- Well, unless it's Troy,"
56:35,000;56:37,360;"but Troy's saying the same thing behind closed doors, you know?"
56:37,360;56:39,680;"- You never know, Steve, you never know."
56:40,920;56:42,680;"I think we know."
56:42,680;56:45,360;"I mean, we've already talked to like three people who know Troy Brown and they all said"
56:45,360;56:46,360;"he's the man."
56:46,360;56:47,520;"Yeah, but they barely know."
56:47,520;56:49,280;"I just say about him."
56:49,280;56:52,520;"That's stories about how we're going check his, uh, his old locker."
56:52,520;56:57,320;"Troy Brown would go check his own locker to make sure that, uh, stuff was still there."
56:57,320;56:57,920;"Every morning."
56:57,920;56:58,600;"Yeah."
56:58,600;57:00,520;"I'm just saying never meet your heroes."
57:00,520;57:09,080;"Well, yeah, Aaron Hernandez donated a lot of money to charity, but I tell you what, you"
57:09,080;57:10,160;"wasn't that cool."
57:10,160;57:12,420;"(laughing)"
57:12,420;57:14,860;"- Do you kinda like,"
57:14,860;57:17,520;"can't tell what you're like behind closed doors, Greg?"
57:17,520;57:18,360;"- I think we do."
57:18,360;57:20,020;"- I got some skeletons, baby."
57:20,020;57:21,360;"So don't you."
57:21,360;57:23,260;"Let's be honest with each other here."
57:23,260;57:26,100;"- We getting into those right now?"
57:26,100;57:27,860;"Is that what we're doing?"
57:27,860;57:28,900;"- Well, I do have a,"
57:28,900;57:31,460;"I did do a little bit of a dive on Travis Henry."
57:31,460;57:33,020;"- Okay."
57:33,020;57:35,540;"- That maybe is why I'm saying these things."
57:35,540;57:36,540;"- Perfect segment, well done."
57:36,540;57:37,540;"- Check our pasts."

58:11,060;58:13,380;"Yeah, that's all this bullshit tag lines."
58:13,380;58:16,300;"But they were talking about sign and blood cell"
58:16,300;58:18,180;"and like getting all these quotes from players,"
58:18,180;58:19,940;"talking about how much they loved them"
58:19,940;58:22,300;"and how he's like a blue collar guy"
58:22,300;58:24,780;"that fits in in Buffalo."
58:24,780;58:26,140;"And one of the guys said,"
58:26,140;58:30,220;"""There's no highfalutin' ways."
58:30,220;58:32,700;"He's a true buffalonian."""
58:32,700;58:33,740;"- What?"
58:33,740;58:34,980;"I flute and Andy."
58:34,980;58:36,220;"- I flute and."
58:36,220;58:38,900;"- We're not a high flute and podcast over here."

58:40,300;58:41,740;"We're big dink dummies over here."
58:41,740;58:45,540;"- We're staking potatoes kind of podcast."
58:45,540;58:47,340;"(laughing)"
58:47,340;58:49,740;"- My collar is literally blue right now."
58:49,740;58:51,300;"- You are wearing a blue collar."
58:51,300;58:54,940;"High flute."
58:54,940;58:55,780;"- What does that mean?"
58:55,780;58:58,660;"Like you're playing the flute and you're like keeping it high?"
58:58,660;59:01,940;"- Popis or pretentious is what guru.com says."
59:01,940;59:02,860;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
59:02,860;59:04,860;"So Travis Henry knows a word that I don't."
59:04,860;59:07,900;"- No, I don't think it was Travis Henry."
59:07,900;59:10,060;"Yeah, it was someone saying about blood, so."
59:10,060;59:10,900;"- Oh, okay, okay."
59:10,900;59:12,940;"It wasn't, I thought it was a quote from Travis Henry here."
59:12,940;59:13,980;"How is it?"
59:13,980;59:14,900;"Floor."
59:14,900;59:17,540;"- Yeah, but what does the other websites say about?"

59:42,100;59:43,940;"That's not very urban."
59:43,940;59:45,260;"That's not very good."
59:45,260;59:47,940;"Well, Urban Dictionary has like real definitions too."
59:47,940;59:50,140;"They're not just like funny ones."
59:50,140;59:52,340;"We need Urban Thesaurus."
59:52,340;59:53,340;"Yes, I think you're right."
59:53,340;59:55,420;"You should just go right there every time."
59:55,420;59:56,900;"We waste our time with Urban Dictionary."
59:56,900;59:58,660;"Urban Dictionary terms."

01:00:00,580;01:00:02,460;"I thought I had something to do with a flute."
01:00:02,460;01:00:06,260;"Andy can't spell it. He's trying to expect that check right now. Can you figure that out?"
01:00:06,260;01:00:10,920;"Try to find high flutein' him for some reason. I'm on high asshole on our imaginary"

01:00:59,620;01:01:00,620;"Ah, shit."
01:01:00,620;01:01:01,620;"All right."
01:01:01,620;01:01:02,620;"Love it."
01:01:02,620;01:01:06,620;"So what else about Travis Harry other than his highfalutin?"
01:01:06,620;01:01:09,620;"Speaking of come with us."
01:01:09,620;01:01:12,620;"Nicely done."
01:01:12,620;01:01:13,620;"Yeah."
01:01:13,620;01:01:18,620;"So I went back all the way through to like his high school years."
01:01:18,620;01:01:20,620;"He was the, he's from Florida."
01:01:20,620;01:01:24,620;"He was Mr. Florida football in his senior year."
01:01:24,620;01:01:25,620;"Yeah."
01:01:25,620;01:01:27,620;"Which is a huge deal."
01:01:27,620;01:01:39,460;"deal. Yeah. From Frostproof, Frostproof Florida. Frostproof. Yeah. That's a, that's a,"
01:01:39,460;01:01:46,500;"and then you went to find Frost. Yeah. So he ran for 4,000 plus yards and 42 touchdowns"
01:01:46,500;01:01:53,140;"in his senior year. In one year? Yeah. In 14 games, which averages about 300 yards a"
01:01:53,140;01:01:54,340;"game and three touchdowns."
01:01:54,340;01:01:54,840;"Yeah."
01:01:54,840;01:01:55,640;"Fuck me."
01:01:55,640;01:01:56,940;"Like every game."
01:01:56,940;01:01:58,540;"Backstone do that."
01:01:58,540;01:01:59,540;"Yeah."
01:01:59,540;01:02:01,540;"Yeah."
01:02:01,540;01:02:05,340;"So he was pretty highly touted coming out of the out of high school."
01:02:05,340;01:02:09,240;"He went to Tennessee, but I guess he was sharing carries with Jamal Lewis."
01:02:09,240;01:02:10,840;"Oh, yeah."
01:02:10,840;01:02:13,440;"So I took him a while to really get going."
01:02:13,440;01:02:23,040;"He was nicknamed cheese by his strength coast strength coach for being as tough as a block of government cheese."
01:02:23,040;01:02:25,440;"That's a stretch."
01:02:25,440;01:02:27,040;"- That's a bad nickname."
01:02:27,040;01:02:27,880;"- That's a bad nickname."
01:02:27,880;01:02:29,360;"It's an even answer stretch."
01:02:29,360;01:02:32,120;"- It's such a strength coach thing to say to."
01:02:32,120;01:02:32,960;"- I guess so, man."
01:02:32,960;01:02:34,040;"- Get a cheese."
01:02:34,040;01:02:37,720;"- I was raised on government cheese."
01:02:37,720;01:02:38,560;"(laughing)"
01:02:38,560;01:02:39,960;"- I turned out okay."
01:02:39,960;01:02:42,200;"- Breast milk?"
01:02:42,200;01:02:44,120;"- No, government breast milk."
01:02:44,120;01:02:46,000;"- You couldn't afford breast milk."
01:02:46,000;01:02:47,640;"My mom just made breast cheese."
01:02:47,640;01:02:49,880;"(laughing)"
01:02:51,160;01:02:56,160;"- Yeah, so he ends up getting drafted in the second round."
01:02:56,160;01:02:58,440;"- All right."
01:02:58,440;01:03:03,440;"- 2001 NFL draft, oh, in the draft,"
01:03:03,440;01:03:05,480;"so I kind of went down another rabbit hole"
01:03:05,480;01:03:08,400;"when they said his WonderLick score was a nine."
01:03:08,400;01:03:11,360;"- Out of how many?"
01:03:11,360;01:03:12,760;"- 27. - 50."
01:03:12,760;01:03:14,840;"(laughs)"
01:03:14,840;01:03:15,920;"Oops."
01:03:15,920;01:03:19,560;"- We'll come back to the WonderLick score"
01:03:19,560;01:03:21,300;"'cause I have more on that."
01:03:21,300;01:03:23,040;"Yeah."
01:03:23,040;01:03:28,000;"So, I mean, we all kind of know what he did in his career."
01:03:28,000;01:03:29,600;"You know, he had to bounce around a few teams,"
01:03:29,600;01:03:30,940;"had one pro-boy year."
01:03:30,940;01:03:33,840;"So let's get to his personal life."
01:03:33,840;01:03:35,240;"The more interesting stuff."
01:03:35,240;01:03:40,440;"He was actually married once at age 19"
01:03:40,440;01:03:42,620;"to a woman that was six years old in him."
01:03:42,620;01:03:48,360;"As of when this article was written,"
01:03:48,360;01:03:51,360;"He had 11 children by 10 different women."
01:03:51,360;01:03:57,540;"And then he's in jail, so he obviously can't pay"
01:03:57,540;01:03:59,720;"his child support payments."
01:03:59,720;01:04:00,560;"- Well."
01:04:00,560;01:04:03,480;"- Why is he in jail, you may ask?"
01:04:03,480;01:04:06,520;"Well, on September 30th, 2008,"
01:04:06,520;01:04:10,520;"Henry was arrested by the DEA after allegedly being involved"
01:04:10,520;01:04:13,720;"in a multi-kilogram cocaine transaction"
01:04:13,720;01:04:15,160;"that occurred in Colorado."
01:04:15,160;01:04:17,520;"- Multi-kilogram?"
01:04:17,520;01:04:23,520;"multi-kilogram cocaine. That's a shit. Yeah, Henry."
01:04:23,520;01:04:24,080;"Way for."
01:04:24,080;01:04:33,520;"Henry portrayed by court documents as quote, ""The ruthless money guy in a cocaine trafficking"
01:04:33,520;01:04:41,120;"ring faced 10 years to life on federal trafficking charges. They reached a plea agreement"
01:04:42,960;01:04:55,960;"And 10 years in prison plus $4 million in fines plus at least $170,000 a year in child support payments, which is unrelated."
01:04:55,960;01:04:59,960;"But that's why he can't pay his child support."
01:04:59,960;01:05:00,960;"Holy shit."
01:05:00,960;01:05:01,960;"But he's out now then."
01:05:01,960;01:05:02,960;"You're right."
01:05:02,960;01:05:03,960;"10 years."
01:05:03,960;01:05:04,960;"2008."
01:05:04,960;01:05:05,960;"Yeah."
01:05:05,960;01:05:06,960;"Yeah."
01:05:06,960;01:05:10,960;"You get him on the pod."
01:05:10,960;01:05:14,480;"to say for himself. We can't pay a man. How's it going to pay its"
01:05:14,480;01:05:17,860;"talent for you? That's fair. Well, started going fund me."
01:05:17,860;01:05:22,280;"Yeah, I love to get them on you. So raise that. How much money do you"
01:05:22,280;01:05:26,120;"have to spend a year on child support? 170,000. Yeah."
01:05:26,120;01:05:28,680;"All right. We can get $170,000. Maybe we'll get"
01:05:28,680;01:05:33,600;"transiting. How much does that per kid? Well, 10 or 11 kids,"
01:05:33,600;01:05:37,720;"right? Yeah. Yeah. Not even much, right? That's not even"
01:05:37,720;01:05:39,720;"much money. Yeah. Like 17 grand per"
01:05:39,720;01:05:42,440;"it's not even. Yeah, it's probably about a thousand bucks a"
01:05:42,440;01:05:43,320;"month per kid."
01:05:43,320;01:05:47,200;"That's 170 grand a year."
01:05:47,200;01:05:49,080;"Damn, man."
01:05:49,080;01:05:53,320;"I mean, they do say that kids are expensive, but fuck."
01:05:53,320;01:05:57,000;"Dude, he should have stayed with the lady married at 19."
01:05:57,000;01:05:58,680;"All this could have been avoided."
01:05:58,680;01:06:00,000;"That's true."
01:06:00,000;01:06:02,560;"You love the one you with Greg?"
01:06:02,560;01:06:06,360;"Yeah, that's why I stay with Kelly is, you know, I don't want"
01:06:06,360;01:06:10,600;"I don't want to I don't want to impregnate all these women if we break up"
01:06:10,600;01:06:15,880;"It'll be all over"
01:06:15,880;01:06:21,360;"Speaking of being all over things"
01:06:21,360;01:06:23,480;"Is that your Travis Henry deep dive?"
01:06:23,480;01:06:29,160;"Yes, that is the Travis I got some more stuff on the wonder look but that's that's what I got on Henry"
01:06:29,160;01:06:32,560;"Oh, all right. Let's do the wonder look then. I'm just gonna dive into the game"
01:06:33,160;01:06:36,380;"But I'm more interested in scoring nine on a wonderly"
01:06:36,380;01:06:39,300;"Yeah, so I"
01:06:39,300;01:06:45,640;"Mean I was like is nine good so I looked it up and it's it's quite clearly not good"
01:06:45,640;01:06:49,680;"It's one of the one of the lowest score is that in history"
01:06:49,680;01:06:55,800;"Well the lowest ever was a four by Darren Davis"
01:06:55,800;01:06:59,380;"So I was like, you know, I was like a let me figure"
01:06:59,380;01:07:03,120;"I want to see like what kind of questions they got on here. So I actually took the wonder like that"
01:07:03,120;01:07:09,480;"Yeah, you can take it right? So we have to guess what I get on the wonder like out of my life. I took it two times"
01:07:09,480;01:07:11,320;"Okay"
01:07:11,320;01:07:16,380;"So you want to try and guess my average score out of 50 out of 50 mm-hmm"
01:07:16,380;01:07:19,220;"nine"
01:07:19,220;01:07:25,900;"Every baby you just could you sit over your talking shit out of your case. So yeah, so here's the thing I"
01:07:27,600;01:07:31,100;"Think you have a tiny tiny penis, so I'm gonna say 35"
01:07:31,100;01:07:37,260;"It's a good point and so so either way"
01:07:37,260;01:07:42,480;"Either way you kind of fucking yourself Travis Travis Henry's definitely a big dick dummy"
01:07:42,480;01:07:50,620;"Baby 11 kids"
01:07:50,620;01:07:53,880;"Plus the 11 kids yeah"
01:07:55,480;01:08:02,160;"So I took it the first time and I got 29 and then I got the second time I got a 36. Oh"
01:08:02,160;01:08:10,560;"Yeah, right so pretty good Brady got Brady got a 33 so you're right now range. I'm like yeah"
01:08:10,560;01:08:15,520;"I'm in the Brady smarts and looks range. Oh, it's a shame. He's got a small dick. Mm-hmm"
01:08:15,520;01:08:21,320;"He had a massive heart until he went to Tampa Bay and then it shrunk right yeah"
01:08:22,120;01:08:28,940;"So the thing about it though is it's 50 questions, but it's only 12 minutes, right?"
01:08:28,940;01:08:36,120;"Yeah, so it's really you're racing against time which I think the first time I was like I ran out of time but"
01:08:36,120;01:08:41,880;"My guess is a lot of those people are getting nines or like single digits are"
01:08:41,880;01:08:43,360;"Just sitting there"
01:08:43,360;01:08:49,240;"They don't know how to take the test rather than they all the questions you could probably figure out if you had enough time"
01:08:49,240;01:08:51,240;"Yeah, but a lot of them are like"
01:08:51,240;01:08:53,600;"like they vary in difficulty."
01:08:53,600;01:08:55,280;"So if you know how to take the test of like,"
01:08:55,280;01:08:58,820;"all right, skip the hard ones and go to the ones that are easy."
01:08:58,820;01:09:01,240;"But that being said, some of the questions are,"
01:09:01,240;01:09:03,500;"I screen shot at some of them."
01:09:03,500;01:09:05,880;"I'll ask you this one,"
01:09:05,880;01:09:08,680;"which of the following numbers is the smallest?"
01:09:08,680;01:09:12,560;"0.685, 0.33 or 13?"
01:09:12,560;01:09:17,920;"That shouldn't take you 15 seconds to figure out, you know?"
01:09:17,920;01:09:18,920;"- That's six."
01:09:18,920;01:09:19,760;"- Yeah."
01:09:19,760;01:09:20,600;"- That's six, 13."
01:09:20,600;01:09:23,600;"The sixth month of the year is..."
01:09:23,600;01:09:24,600;"[laughter]"
01:09:24,600;01:09:27,600;"That's a very Marchable made June."
01:09:27,600;01:09:29,600;"Even that's not 15/7."
01:09:29,600;01:09:31,600;"Everybody should get that one."
01:09:31,600;01:09:32,600;"Yeah."
01:09:32,600;01:09:34,600;"But then there's other ones like this one."
01:09:34,600;01:09:43,600;"Four individuals invest in real estate together and agree to split the profits equally and invest 12,000 x6,000 y25,000 z7,000."
01:09:43,600;01:09:46,840;"the profits for the first year with 12,000, 120,000,"
01:09:46,840;01:09:50,280;"why I received blank less than if the profits were divided"
01:09:50,280;01:09:52,520;"in proportion to how much they missed."
01:09:52,520;01:09:55,480;"Like that one, I think you could probably figure it out,"
01:09:55,480;01:09:59,040;"but it's good, more than 15 seconds for sure, right?"
01:09:59,040;01:10:00,520;"So, I thought it was pretty interesting."
01:10:00,520;01:10:02,480;"You wanna hear some notable names?"
01:10:02,480;01:10:04,280;"- Oh, always. - Yeah, yeah."
01:10:04,280;01:10:06,840;"- Yeah, we're talking top or bottom?"
01:10:06,840;01:10:07,760;"- We got both."
01:10:07,760;01:10:11,000;"You wanna start on the top or wanna start on the bottom?"
01:10:11,000;01:10:17,860;"Let's save the bottom for for last. I want to say Brit. Okay, so there's one person ever this got a"
01:10:17,860;01:10:20,280;"Perfect score"
01:10:20,280;01:10:26,780;"Was it Fitzpatrick Ryan? No, he did go to Harvard Fitzpatrick got a 48. That's what yeah"
01:10:26,780;01:10:32,440;"I knew he got real high. Yeah, perfect. Pat McAnally some fifth brown pick in 1975"
01:10:32,440;01:10:36,620;"Where do you play wait those underlings been around that long - yeah, I guess so"
01:10:37,160;01:10:39,160;"Damn, what position did he play?"
01:10:39,160;01:10:43,160;"I don't know. Most of these are quarterbacks though. These guys that are high up there."
01:10:43,160;01:10:51,160;"Mike Mamoula got a 49. The other 48 on here is a New England patriot."
01:10:51,160;01:10:56,160;"No. Well you just said half his first name, didn't you?"
01:10:56,160;01:10:58,160;"Mike, Lonnie Paxton?"
01:10:58,160;01:10:59,160;"No."
01:10:59,160;01:11:01,160;"I thought you said Lonnie. What position does he play?"
01:11:01,160;01:11:02,160;"Yeah."
01:11:02,160;01:11:03,160;"Tight end."
01:11:03,160;01:11:04,160;"Aaron Hernandez."
01:11:04,160;01:11:06,420;"(laughing)"
01:11:06,420;01:11:09,160;"- He's on the other list."
01:11:09,160;01:11:12,160;"- Not Gronkowski's on the bottom end of the list."
01:11:12,160;01:11:13,000;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:13,000;01:11:13,840;"- You got a rock."
01:11:13,840;01:11:15,000;"- Imagine that."
01:11:15,000;01:11:16,360;"- Gron Rutledge."
01:11:16,360;01:11:19,040;"- So it's not your main wiggas."
01:11:19,040;01:11:20,040;"- Not me a wiggie."
01:11:20,040;01:11:22,400;"- It's not for ya."
01:11:22,400;01:11:23,520;"- Is there someone in this era"
01:11:23,520;01:11:24,440;"that we've been watching us on?"
01:11:24,440;01:11:25,560;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:11:25,560;01:11:26,400;"Really?"
01:11:26,400;01:11:27,400;"- Not for ya?"
01:11:27,400;01:11:28,240;"- No."
01:11:28,240;01:11:30,160;"- Bangcoats."
01:11:30,160;01:11:31,400;"- Cam Clueland."
01:11:31,400;01:11:33,160;"- Ben Watson."
01:11:33,160;01:11:34,600;"Oh yeah, he's a smart dude."
01:11:34,600;01:11:35,000;"Fuck, I should."
01:11:35,000;01:11:37,000;"Yeah."
01:11:37,000;01:11:39,240;"I get about the Ben Watson era."
01:11:39,240;01:11:42,080;"Damn, all right."
01:11:42,080;01:11:44,640;"Gardner Minshu got a 42."
01:11:44,640;01:11:45,640;"Really?"
01:11:45,640;01:11:46,480;"Yeah."
01:11:46,480;01:11:47,200;"Yeah, I know."
01:11:47,200;01:11:48,600;"He's not as dumb as he looks."
01:11:48,600;01:11:49,240;"Exactly."
01:11:49,240;01:11:50,000;"That's what I'm saying."
01:11:50,000;01:11:51,600;"He's got-- he knows what he's doing."
01:11:51,600;01:11:53,600;"He's like, he's got a huge dick."
01:11:53,600;01:11:54,480;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:11:54,480;01:11:56,600;"The fucking swag and my stash."
01:11:56,600;01:11:59,320;"And he's like, well, that guy is awesome."
01:11:59,320;01:12:00,080;"The flint."
01:12:00,080;01:12:00,840;"Clearly not."
01:12:00,840;01:12:01,080;"Yep."
01:12:01,080;01:12:02,920;"Nope."
01:12:02,920;01:12:10,020;"Calvin Johnson of 41 mega-chon. Yeah, I thought that was pretty surprising. There's not many receivers on here"
01:12:10,020;01:12:15,380;"Eli Manning 39 Tony Romo 37"
01:12:15,380;01:12:19,180;"His brother took a form"
01:12:19,180;01:12:21,660;"Josh Allen 37"
01:12:21,660;01:12:23,380;"Wow"
01:12:23,380;01:12:27,760;"Wait hang on is there any questions about not throwing interceptions on this?"
01:12:27,760;01:12:32,580;"I'm gonna guess no"
01:12:32,580;01:12:34,700;"Where did Josh Allen go?"
01:12:34,700;01:12:37,420;"Like Montana, Wyoming?"
01:12:37,420;01:12:37,940;"Yeah."
01:12:37,940;01:12:39,220;"Big open space."
01:12:39,220;01:12:40,140;"Yeah."
01:12:40,140;01:12:43,020;"So let's look at the bottom half of the list here."
01:12:43,020;01:12:44,060;"Yeah, thank you."
01:12:44,060;01:12:45,460;"Good stuff."
01:12:45,460;01:12:47,620;"Mary's Hernandez, Edgar."
01:12:47,620;01:12:49,460;"Who's already scored higher?"
01:12:49,460;01:12:52,860;"There's a lot of great names down here."
01:12:52,860;01:12:59,940;"Donovan McNabb got a 14 or 15."
01:12:59,940;01:13:03,820;"Four. Jim Kelly got a 15."
01:13:03,820;01:13:06,900;"Wow. Lamar Jackson, 13."
01:13:06,900;01:13:10,220;"Ray Lewis, 13."
01:13:10,220;01:13:11,380;"God damn."
01:13:11,380;01:13:14,260;"Dorelle Rivas, a 10."
01:13:14,260;01:13:17,700;"Sebastian Janikowski got a nine."
01:13:17,700;01:13:21,220;"That is perfect. That's perfect."
01:13:21,220;01:13:23,460;"Yeah. Talk about a big dick dummy."
01:13:23,460;01:13:29,060;"Big dick dummy. Vince Tiaq."
01:13:29,060;01:13:32,780;"So here's an interesting one, Vince Young got a six"
01:13:32,780;01:13:36,180;"and then he was re-administered the test the following day"
01:13:36,180;01:13:37,380;"and got a 16."
01:13:37,380;01:13:39,780;"- Wow."
01:13:39,780;01:13:41,540;"- So that's why I'm saying like a lot of this probably"
01:13:41,540;01:13:44,340;"has to do with like, did you study?"
01:13:44,340;01:13:45,160;"- Yeah, but I don't think it's a test."
01:13:45,160;01:13:47,460;"- Did anyone explain how to do this too?"
01:13:47,460;01:13:49,260;"- There's so much of like draft prep"
01:13:49,260;01:13:51,500;"that they should be like, you can just go on the internet"
01:13:51,500;01:13:53,780;"and go wonder like test like, you know,"
01:13:53,780;01:13:54,860;"before you go to the combine,"
01:13:54,860;01:13:56,460;"take a bunch of wonder like tests so you know how to--"
01:13:56,460;01:13:57,300;"- Yeah."
01:13:57,300;01:13:58,140;"- Take two, yeah."
01:13:58,140;01:14:00,340;"And you know what I think probably has to do with it?"
01:14:00,340;01:14:03,780;"Like standardized testing is a lot of like,"
01:14:03,780;01:14:05,020;"it's your mental approach."
01:14:05,020;01:14:07,700;"So people that like, if it's not your skill,"
01:14:07,700;01:14:09,680;"I think it's a lot easier to like,"
01:14:09,680;01:14:11,780;"shut down and be like, I'm not even gonna try."
01:14:11,780;01:14:12,620;"Yeah."
01:14:12,620;01:14:15,340;"It's almost like with me, weightlifting with me, right?"
01:14:15,340;01:14:16,220;"I can't do it."
01:14:16,220;01:14:18,220;"So I was always just like, I don't wanna do it"
01:14:18,220;01:14:20,100;"because I suck at it, you know?"
01:14:20,100;01:14:23,220;"But yeah, if they actually put the time in a little effort,"
01:14:23,220;01:14:25,660;"I bet they could score like reasonable scores."
01:14:25,660;01:14:27,700;"This is to me, or all people that are like,"
01:14:27,700;01:14:29,460;"I don't see any value in this."
01:14:29,460;01:14:30,700;"So I'm just kind of bullshitting it."
01:14:30,700;01:14:32,980;"- When I was in college, I would like take a test"
01:14:32,980;01:14:36,060;"and get down to just a couple of 50-50 answers."
01:14:36,060;01:14:37,620;"I'm like a multiple choice test."
01:14:37,620;01:14:40,260;"I bring a coin to me and I just flip the coin"
01:14:40,260;01:14:43,420;"and then mark down head and so dills."
01:14:43,420;01:14:44,360;"But I do it pretty quick."
01:14:44,360;01:14:45,360;"So I went there and that"
01:14:45,360;01:14:49,140;"and you could just flip the coins and write down my answers."
01:14:49,140;01:14:50,780;"- Yeah, that sounds about right, Steve."
01:14:50,780;01:14:52,100;"- If the coin came up heads,"
01:14:52,100;01:14:53,220;"I really wanted to be tails."
01:14:53,220;01:14:54,820;"I put the tails and you'd know."
01:14:54,820;01:14:56,580;"- Yeah, that's a good point."
01:14:56,580;01:14:58,180;"And that's some of the other thing is like,"
01:14:58,180;01:15:00,460;"I don't think there's anything you can point off"
01:15:00,460;01:15:01,380;"for a wrong answer."
01:15:01,380;01:15:04,820;"So these people that got like a seven,"
01:15:04,820;01:15:08,300;"you can literally, they're all like four choice questions."
01:15:08,300;01:15:11,100;"You could guess every time you get better."
01:15:11,100;01:15:12,140;"- You just take an A for all of them"
01:15:12,140;01:15:13,140;"and get higher than a seven."
01:15:13,140;01:15:14,180;"- Right, yeah."
01:15:14,180;01:15:16,060;"- Just by law."
01:15:16,060;01:15:18,060;"- Frank Gore got a six."
01:15:18,060;01:15:21,020;"Like it's clearly not indicative of like"
01:15:21,020;01:15:22,380;"how good of a career you're gonna have."
01:15:22,380;01:15:23,220;"- That's what I'm gonna say."
01:15:23,220;01:15:25,740;"Yeah, maybe it's actually probably more indicative"
01:15:25,740;01:15:28,420;"the lower you get, the more focus you are on football."
01:15:28,420;01:15:31,700;"You obviously weren't studying how to take tests."
01:15:31,700;01:15:35,820;"- Yeah, and then the two lowest are that guy, Darren Davis,"
01:15:35,820;01:15:40,460;"and then Morris Clayborn, that cornerback from Dallas."
01:15:40,460;01:15:41,780;"You got a four."
01:15:41,780;01:15:42,780;"- Wow."
01:15:42,780;01:15:45,580;"- You almost have to try."
01:15:45,580;01:15:46,420;"- Yeah."
01:15:46,420;01:15:47,260;"- You don't play for writing your name,"
01:15:47,260;01:15:48,820;"like, like, I just like that too."
01:15:48,820;01:15:49,660;"- I think you said two."
01:15:49,660;01:15:51,500;"- Yeah, I'll be cool."
01:15:51,500;01:15:52,340;"- You got it."
01:15:53,460;01:15:57,780;"For like, I think I would specifically have to try to get a four."
01:15:57,780;01:15:58,500;"Right."
01:15:58,500;01:15:58,820;"Yeah."
01:15:58,820;01:16:00,540;"It would be harder for me to get a four then to get like a."
01:16:00,540;01:16:02,700;"Yeah, we haven't been hitting the head a whole shitload."
01:16:02,700;01:16:07,300;"Haven't hit the hell out."
01:16:07,300;01:16:09,900;"What's your name?"
01:16:09,900;01:16:14,460;"Ooh, the tough ones first spent, spent six minutes on his name."
01:16:14,460;01:16:17,500;"What is your favorite color?"
01:16:17,500;01:16:19,380;"Blue."
01:16:19,380;01:16:20,700;"Oh, no, no, no."
01:16:20,700;01:16:22,960;"(laughing)"
01:16:22,960;01:16:27,380;"All right, so speaking of failures,"
01:16:27,380;01:16:29,180;"let's talk about these bills."
01:16:29,180;01:16:31,180;"Would you guys give this as a watchability score?"
01:16:31,180;01:16:32,320;"Greg, you go first."
01:16:32,320;01:16:36,460;"- I would say watch the first half."
01:16:36,460;01:16:38,880;"- Yeah, that's fair."
01:16:38,880;01:16:42,340;"- Yeah, so I mean, it's kind of, I would say,"
01:16:42,340;01:16:47,340;"let's say four, three and a half."
01:16:47,340;01:16:50,220;"Let's go three and a half because the good thing is,"
01:16:50,220;01:16:52,080;"It's one of those games where you don't have to watch the whole thing."
01:16:52,080;01:16:54,640;"You watch the first half and then you can just turn it off."
01:16:54,640;01:16:58,920;"And you don't really even watch like the first quarter and the fourth quarter."
01:16:58,920;01:16:59,920;"All right."
01:16:59,920;01:17:04,280;"Because the first quarter of the Patriots score three times on all three drives with"
01:17:04,280;01:17:07,840;"a blood-soyed interception like mixed in there."
01:17:07,840;01:17:09,840;"Just sprinkled in."
01:17:09,840;01:17:11,600;"And then a classic blood-soyed interception."
01:17:11,600;01:17:12,600;"Yeah."
01:17:12,600;01:17:18,880;"And then he, yeah, it was a bad, a ball, got batted straight up and see more picked it."
01:17:18,880;01:17:22,080;"which sandwiched two Tom Brady Touchdown passes,"
01:17:22,080;01:17:24,520;"one to Pat and then one to a back shoulder"
01:17:24,520;01:17:26,480;"to Donald Hayes of all people."
01:17:26,480;01:17:29,080;"- I was watching that and I was like,"
01:17:29,080;01:17:31,000;"where has Hayes been all year?"
01:17:31,000;01:17:33,000;"And I think I figured it out"
01:17:33,000;01:17:35,400;"because there's a one on the field goal,"
01:17:35,400;01:17:38,800;"the first drive where Branch got hurt."
01:17:38,800;01:17:40,440;"- Yes."
01:17:40,440;01:17:42,560;"- And because he's out, Hayes is in."
01:17:42,560;01:17:43,400;"- Right, yeah."
01:17:43,400;01:17:44,240;"- So Hayes got kind of like,"
01:17:44,240;01:17:45,800;"he was a big signing in the off season"
01:17:45,800;01:17:46,800;"and I thought he's like,"
01:17:46,800;01:17:49,100;"He's been pretty decent when he's in there."
01:17:49,100;01:17:49,940;"- Yeah, but he's wrong."
01:17:49,940;01:17:51,700;"- But he's like, ranch came in as a rookie"
01:17:51,700;01:17:52,620;"and just took his job."
01:17:52,620;01:17:53,620;"- He did, yeah."
01:17:53,620;01:17:56,380;"Yeah, I think that's exactly what happened."
01:17:56,380;01:17:59,780;"- Donald Rutherford B. Hayes."
01:17:59,780;01:18:02,460;"- Oh, not bad, that's me."
01:18:02,460;01:18:07,420;"I like it when you guys like my nicknames."
01:18:07,420;01:18:12,700;"- Let me try what drew Long Bled, so?"
01:18:12,700;01:18:13,740;"- Okay, okay."
01:18:13,740;01:18:15,220;"- 'Cause what do you mean?"
01:18:15,220;01:18:20,180;"his his lung blood. Oh, long glad I tasted long long bled."
01:18:20,180;01:18:22,380;"So"
01:18:22,380;01:18:23,780;"yeah. Yeah."
01:18:23,780;01:18:31,340;"Apparently, so what I was reading again, and oh, it was the new book that came out."
01:18:31,340;01:18:34,380;"The new page is book dynasty or something like that."
01:18:34,380;01:18:40,060;"And and like the first chapters about blood so being in the hospital and apparently"
01:18:41,220;01:18:44,920;"the hitch, like broke his, um,"
01:18:44,920;01:18:52,180;"rib, right? Like a bunch of ribs. Yeah. And one of them, like, poked through an artery in his lungs."
01:18:52,180;01:18:57,180;"And so it filled up the space around his lungs with blood, which collapsed the lung."
01:18:57,180;01:19:05,620;"So what they did is they put a tooth because they, they could have like, they were supposed to go in and like, cut them open to drain it."
01:19:05,620;01:19:09,820;"But if they did that, they would have had to cut all the muscles that he used to throw the football with."
01:19:10,220;01:19:19,460;"So they basically stuck a tube in there and suck the blood out and then had another tube where like in his arm that would like put the blood back in where it was supposed to go."
01:19:19,460;01:19:22,420;"And they're like, so we're going to do this for a couple hours."
01:19:22,420;01:19:27,380;"And if it works, we won't have to cut you open and you'll maybe be able to play football again."
01:19:27,380;01:19:30,780;"And if it doesn't, this could be the end of your career right now."
01:19:30,780;01:19:32,180;"Damn."
01:19:32,180;01:19:33,700;"Super fucking sketchy."
01:19:33,700;01:19:37,020;"Yeah, I don't think I was ever aware of how serious of an injury that was."
01:19:37,020;01:19:38,100;"Yeah, me neither."
01:19:38,340;01:19:41,140;"You know, I knew it, but like, I didn't know that detail."
01:19:41,140;01:19:41,700;"That's crazy."
01:19:41,700;01:19:42,140;"Yeah."
01:19:42,140;01:19:45,180;"Yeah, it's nuts that that's only now coming out."
01:19:45,180;01:19:46,900;"It feels like we're going to hook you up to a sump pump."
01:19:46,900;01:19:49,260;"So you're going to open this works."
01:19:49,260;01:19:53,220;"We're just going to circulate your blood like you're a fucking dialysis patient."
01:19:53,220;01:19:56,220;"Well, I was going to say like a fucking hose."
01:19:56,220;01:20:00,340;"I'm not a pool to like a fucking vampire fish tank."
01:20:00,340;01:20:04,220;"Pump the water in, pump the water out, pump the water in, pump the water out."
01:20:04,220;01:20:05,220;"Now it's clean."
01:20:05,220;01:20:06,740;"And it's where it's supposed to be."
01:20:06,740;01:20:08,740;"I think dialysis is the better."
01:20:08,740;01:20:11,740;"Yeah, that's not nearly a funny visual."
01:20:11,740;01:20:14,740;"Bloods of hooks up to a fucking fish tank."
01:20:14,740;01:20:17,740;"It's a Chinese fire drill, right, Steve?"
01:20:17,740;01:20:21,740;"It's not."
01:20:21,740;01:20:25,740;"For the red blood cell Chinese fire drill."
01:20:25,740;01:20:28,740;"Blood cell."
01:20:28,740;01:20:33,740;"So, yeah, so that was kind of that was the first quarter."
01:20:33,740;01:20:41,060;"the last quarter was blood so throw more in exceptions and peerless price"
01:20:41,060;01:20:45,200;"fumbling which made me feel real good because he was talking about your trash"
01:20:45,200;01:20:50,360;"being down three touchdowns the entire game. I mean it was worse than you think"
01:20:50,360;01:20:55,520;"though I mean we went out 17 nothing immediately yeah and we only won by 10"
01:20:55,520;01:21:01,040;"well it was 10 but there was a point here like the bills were getting a little"
01:21:01,040;01:21:06,080;"momentum. It was good. It was but those are CD after the first CD and the third quarter, but"
01:21:06,080;01:21:10,320;"then blood they turned the ball over three times in a row in the fourth quarter."
01:21:10,320;01:21:16,640;"So the classic blood so game. I think we said this last time we picked the bills, but his"
01:21:16,640;01:21:21,840;"his stats are even more blood. So this game. Yeah, give me a stat like because it's it's"
01:21:21,840;01:21:30,080;"super typical blood. So 32 of 51 for 328 yards to touchdowns in four"
01:21:30,080;01:21:36,080;"interceptions. Yeah. And most of those 300 yards came in garbage time because he's"
01:21:36,080;01:21:39,840;"hucking the ball before Cory literally every play. Yeah. But I think then he"
01:21:39,840;01:21:46,040;"like some record for 300 yard games by Buffalo Bill in the season. Really? Yeah."
01:21:46,040;01:21:52,640;"Yeah. I think I wrote it down. Oh yeah. No, he crossed 305 completions, which was a"
01:21:52,640;01:21:57,600;"Bill's record in week 14, which is impressive. But he also threw four"
01:21:57,600;01:22:02,840;"in a separate day, which is the most he's ever thrown since 1999."
01:22:02,840;01:22:04,920;"That is the most shocking stat of the night."
01:22:04,920;01:22:08,720;"Yeah, but he went that many years without throwing four in a separate game."
01:22:08,720;01:22:09,720;"Three."
01:22:09,720;01:22:10,720;"Yeah."
01:22:10,720;01:22:11,720;"Three?"
01:22:11,720;01:22:12,720;"Three years."
01:22:12,720;01:22:13,720;"Wow."
01:22:13,720;01:22:14,720;"Well, I mean, that's a long time for me."
01:22:14,720;01:22:16,040;"I mean, he said it all to you doesn't want."
01:22:16,040;01:22:17,040;"So that makes sense."
01:22:17,040;01:22:18,040;"Yeah."
01:22:18,040;01:22:21,200;"So I got to say, I wrote this down because there's a lot of shots of jublabs in this"
01:22:21,200;01:22:23,440;"game as you would expect."
01:22:23,440;01:22:27,560;"And in terms of like the pages have had really handsome quarterbacks over the years, I have"
01:22:27,560;01:22:30,040;"I think Drew Bloods was underrated in that."
01:22:30,040;01:22:30,880;"- Of course."
01:22:30,880;01:22:32,320;"- I think he's a handsome dude."
01:22:32,320;01:22:34,120;"- I think he got a very chiseled face."
01:22:34,120;01:22:35,920;"Very just like, well he's underrated"
01:22:35,920;01:22:37,840;"because think about the other handsome people"
01:22:37,840;01:22:38,680;"coming through there."
01:22:38,680;01:22:39,520;"- Yeah."
01:22:39,520;01:22:40,880;"- I mean, early Drew Bloods always in that handsome"
01:22:40,880;01:22:44,000;"with the bowl cut and the chin butt."
01:22:44,000;01:22:45,640;"- Brady wasn't with the chin butt."
01:22:45,640;01:22:46,680;"- Yeah, he didn't look great with chin butt."
01:22:46,680;01:22:48,880;"- Yeah, what did happen to Bryce chin butt?"
01:22:48,880;01:22:50,880;"- Nobody asked that."
01:22:50,880;01:22:52,960;"- Man, he had some work done for things."
01:22:52,960;01:22:54,720;"- That's suspicious."
01:22:54,720;01:22:56,520;"- If you live with who he lives with,"
01:22:56,520;01:22:57,720;"you would have worked on too."
01:22:57,720;01:22:59,920;"- Wow, how beautiful you think you were."
01:22:59,920;01:23:03,760;"- If I got my chin butt erased and then I could, you know,"
01:23:03,760;01:23:06,080;"marry someone with as much money and procedures"
01:23:06,080;01:23:07,400;"just as I'll apply to that too."
01:23:07,400;01:23:08,240;"- Yeah."
01:23:08,240;01:23:10,420;"- So where is he on your hunk-ominor then?"
01:23:10,420;01:23:13,440;"- Good question."
01:23:13,440;01:23:15,720;"So I mean, let's, how many dildos out of six?"
01:23:15,720;01:23:17,640;"(both laughing)"
01:23:17,640;01:23:19,400;"- How many Buffalo Bills dildos?"
01:23:23,240;01:23:28,240;"I mean, old Tom, like, not old Tom Brady,"
01:23:28,240;01:23:30,800;"but like, wait, we're talking about Drew."
01:23:30,800;01:23:33,960;"I know, but I'm putting my list like,"
01:23:33,960;01:23:37,080;"like post chin butt Tom Brady's probably my number one."
01:23:37,080;01:23:42,000;"I personally would put Drew Bloodso over Jimmy G."
01:23:42,000;01:23:43,560;"- Oh, no. - Could Kingsbury?"
01:23:43,560;01:23:44,800;"He used to gotta be on that list."
01:23:44,800;01:23:45,640;"He's an attractive dude."
01:23:45,640;01:23:48,320;"- No way, I'm gonna put Jimmy G at the top."
01:23:48,320;01:23:49,680;"He's a super model."
01:23:49,680;01:23:51,720;"- Yeah. - Oh, Jimmy GQ."
01:23:51,720;01:23:52,560;"What a nickname."
01:23:52,560;01:23:54,000;"Yeah."
01:23:54,000;01:23:55,340;"I don't know."
01:23:55,340;01:23:56,760;"Yeah."
01:23:56,760;01:23:58,120;"He doesn't quite do it for me."
01:23:58,120;01:24:00,040;"Something's not quite right."
01:24:00,040;01:24:02,200;"Yeah, he's got the rugged, good looks"
01:24:02,200;01:24:06,720;"and the boyish hints on this that you guys talk about, Greg."
01:24:06,720;01:24:07,560;"I don't know."
01:24:07,560;01:24:08,640;"There's something off."
01:24:08,640;01:24:09,640;"Yeah."
01:24:09,640;01:24:10,320;"Yeah."
01:24:10,320;01:24:12,640;"Do you guys think Danny Eman-Dole is ugly?"
01:24:12,640;01:24:13,160;"No."
01:24:13,160;01:24:16,200;"I think he and Jimmy G look similar."
01:24:16,200;01:24:16,640;"No."
01:24:16,640;01:24:19,480;"I think Julian's the best looking one."
01:24:19,480;01:24:20,120;"Yeah."
01:24:20,120;01:24:21,000;"All right."
01:24:21,000;01:24:22,920;"You just think that because Julian has a crazy beard."
01:24:22,920;01:24:23,560;"It's a quality."
01:24:23,560;01:24:24,560;"You respect that."
01:24:24,560;01:24:28,360;"You could look good, but now you look like a dump,"
01:24:28,360;01:24:29,880;"but now you look like a real dump."
01:24:29,880;01:24:33,720;"So when Julian chases beard, he just looks like that."
01:24:33,720;01:24:37,920;"That's actually a valid point, Steve."
01:24:37,920;01:24:44,160;"So I just came to a realization of this Drew"
01:24:44,160;01:24:46,000;"Bled so poster I used to have."
01:24:46,000;01:24:47,680;"Do you remember?"
01:24:47,680;01:24:48,180;"Yeah."
01:24:48,180;01:24:51,280;"Oaster that said 10 reasons drew blood."
01:24:51,280;01:24:52,720;"So we'll kick your butt."
01:24:52,720;01:24:53,160;"Yeah."
01:24:53,160;01:24:54,160;"Yes."
01:24:54,160;01:24:55,000;"I remember that."
01:24:55,000;01:24:57,920;"For someone who would be an absolutely ridiculous to get"
01:24:57,920;01:25:02,600;"it like a school fair to like a book fair is the book fair book"
01:25:02,600;01:25:03,080;"fair."
01:25:03,080;01:25:05,680;"I also got the law firm one with lawyer."
01:25:05,680;01:25:08,880;"That was my go to."
01:25:08,880;01:25:10,080;"I got to."
01:25:10,080;01:25:11,680;"I found this poster though."
01:25:11,680;01:25:14,280;"You guys got a computer in front of you to look it up."
01:25:14,280;01:25:14,680;"Yeah."
01:25:14,680;01:25:15,280;"Yeah."
01:25:15,280;01:25:17,880;"If you want to talk about the the hunkometer"
01:25:17,880;01:25:20,440;"drew blood. So shit, man."
01:25:20,440;01:25:21,880;"What do I Google to find a"
01:25:21,880;01:25:23,640;"dream? 10 reasons true blood."
01:25:23,640;01:25:24,560;"So we'll kick your butt."
01:25:24,560;01:25:27,320;"Imagine this way. Oh my god."
01:25:27,320;01:25:29,320;"I remember there's a ton of like"
01:25:29,320;01:25:31,600;"nice, you know, studio quality"
01:25:31,600;01:25:34,200;"Photoshop here bigger with nice"
01:25:34,200;01:25:36,360;"light. If I'd call a night, I"
01:25:36,360;01:25:38,160;"probably still have this poster."
01:25:38,160;01:25:40,120;"Really? Because it's in the shrine."
01:25:40,120;01:25:41,840;"So it's probably in the basement"
01:25:41,840;01:25:42,840;"right now."
01:25:43,840;01:25:45,520;"- We're gonna dig that out, we're here."
01:25:45,520;01:25:46,360;"- Yeah."
01:25:46,360;01:25:51,360;"- So how about if we find it, can we give it away as a prize?"
01:25:51,360;01:25:53,480;"- Oh dude."
01:25:53,480;01:25:55,080;"- Would you be alright with that?"
01:25:55,080;01:25:58,680;"- Oh, handy, that's a tall ask."
01:25:58,680;01:25:59,520;"- It is."
01:25:59,520;01:26:00,440;"- The tall ask is finding it"
01:26:00,440;01:26:02,560;"'cause you have so much shit in that basement bag."
01:26:02,560;01:26:05,360;"There's like 15 boxes of your crap."
01:26:05,360;01:26:07,120;"- Dude, it's all from the shrine."
01:26:07,120;01:26:09,120;"- I had one box with my name on it."
01:26:09,120;01:26:11,360;"I went through it while I was home."
01:26:11,360;01:26:13,080;"Half of the shit in there is yours."
01:26:13,080;01:26:14,680;"(laughing)"
01:26:14,680;01:26:16,960;"All my stupid outfits are in there too."
01:26:16,960;01:26:20,120;"That chicken wing hat is gonna end up in a box"
01:26:20,120;01:26:22,600;"in our parents basement at some point."
01:26:22,600;01:26:24,800;"- No, chicken wing hats get given away too."
01:26:24,800;01:26:25,640;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:26:25,640;01:26:29,280;"- We're gonna give away all of Greg's childhood possessions."
01:26:29,280;01:26:32,080;"- As long as you don't throw away my fur coat, I'll be."
01:26:32,080;01:26:37,080;"- All right, let's read the reasons Greg hit him with us."
01:26:37,080;01:26:39,080;"- Well, there's no real reason."
01:26:39,080;01:26:41,520;"So it's just 10 photos."
01:26:41,520;01:26:44,560;"Yeah, but five of them are these like,"
01:26:44,560;01:26:47,720;"they're not quite black and white, but they're like,"
01:26:47,720;01:26:49,720;"- CPA or sepia, however you pronounce that,"
01:26:49,720;01:26:51,600;"or it's like a yellowish black and white."
01:26:51,600;01:26:54,760;"- Studio type, like I'm in a dark room."
01:26:54,760;01:26:57,680;"And he's like lifting weights in three of them."
01:26:57,680;01:26:59,440;"One, he's doing like a bicep curl"
01:26:59,440;01:27:02,840;"with a sleeveless shirt on."
01:27:02,840;01:27:06,320;"- What are you holding a football, pensively?"
01:27:06,320;01:27:07,160;"- Yeah."
01:27:07,160;01:27:08,360;"(laughs)"
01:27:08,360;01:27:10,720;"It's just, it's so sticky."
01:27:10,720;01:27:15,120;"I actually remember having those conversations with myself as a kid."
01:27:15,120;01:27:16,840;"We're like, what are the 10 reasons?"
01:27:16,840;01:27:21,480;"And like looking at each phone, like, oh, he's got good footwork."
01:27:21,480;01:27:22,800;"There's one where he's handing it off."
01:27:22,800;01:27:25,400;"He's like, oh, he's a great, he's a great play action."
01:27:25,400;01:27:27,200;"Good, good decision maker."
01:27:27,200;01:27:27,680;"Yeah."
01:27:27,680;01:27:28,920;"Whoops."
01:27:28,920;01:27:30,280;"Got great biceps."
01:27:30,280;01:27:31,760;"Not putting a pick on this play."
01:27:31,760;01:27:34,960;"Got good mental toughness."
01:27:34,960;01:27:36,840;"That's the one with him looking pensive."
01:27:36,840;01:27:37,760;"That's right."
01:27:37,760;01:27:38,520;"Yeah."
01:27:39,920;01:27:41,920;"That's a that's a quality. Yeah, if we find that"

01:27:56,640;01:28:00,680;"He's memorized that he didn't have to read that off of anything. Yeah, that's the way to go"
01:28:00,680;01:28:03,360;"You know, I can't read it'll be in the show notes. That's true"
01:28:03,360;01:28:07,680;"So yeah, if you want to rate us for a chance to win if we can find Greg's"

01:28:39,480;01:28:40,520;"Andy, do I need to leave the room?"
01:28:40,520;01:28:41,520;"Hang on, let's see."

01:28:51,840;01:28:52,840;"here."

01:28:54,760;01:29:00,000;"Buds so with Bill Parcells in those old school starter"
01:29:00,000;01:29:03,400;"jackets that make you look super puffy and fat."
01:29:03,400;01:29:03,900;"It is--"
01:29:03,900;01:29:04,900;"He's fat."
01:29:04,900;01:29:08,060;"No one of the top results is Tom Brady's combine picture."
01:29:08,060;01:29:08,140;"Yeah."
01:29:08,140;01:29:09,300;"I'm the fan of it."
01:29:09,300;01:29:10,660;"Yeah, so that's getting to you."
01:29:10,660;01:29:14,580;"Are you going to go to the Super Bowl gay guy guide?"
01:29:14,580;01:29:17,380;"The gay guy guy to the big game Super Bowl."

01:29:19,820;01:29:22,020;"Yeah, how was your blood so part of the Super Bowl?"
01:29:22,020;01:29:26,020;"I mean, eating vagina, a giant turtle, gay rights supporters."
01:29:26,020;01:29:27,260;"Oh, this is the 49ers Ravens."
01:29:27,260;01:29:29,460;"Well, why is your blood so in there?"
01:29:29,460;01:29:30,300;"That's not true blood."
01:29:30,300;01:29:33,020;"So that's Kaepernick holding a--"
01:29:33,020;01:29:34,220;"That turtle Sammy."
01:29:34,220;01:29:37,060;"I don't know why that's."
01:29:37,060;01:29:40,860;"So yeah, not a lot of your buds are shirtless photos."
01:29:40,860;01:29:42,580;"Oh, Andy, very upset."
01:29:42,580;01:29:44,100;"Yeah."
01:29:44,100;01:29:47,380;"So I guess I can't I can't say for sure that your blood was my number two."
01:29:47,380;01:29:48,860;"Because yeah, that's a shame."
01:29:48,860;01:29:51,020;"You were just googling drew buds are shirtless."
01:29:51,020;01:29:51,900;"Yeah."
01:29:51,900;01:29:53,140;"No, good."
01:29:53,140;01:29:54,980;"God doesn't cut nothing up."
01:29:54,980;01:29:58,940;"Welcome to the park guys, Greg."
01:29:58,940;01:30:02,380;"Where you just let's just cut to the chase and Google bloods are naked."
01:30:02,420;01:30:04,420;"All right."
01:30:04,420;01:30:06,420;"Blood so porn."
01:30:06,420;01:30:10,420;"Porn hackers look like Drew Blenso."
01:30:10,420;01:30:12,420;"Deep fake baby."
01:30:12,420;01:30:16,420;"Stop reading Drew Blenso Wonderly score."
01:30:16,420;01:30:17,420;"Ooh."
01:30:17,420;01:30:19,420;"Ooh, let's figure that one out."
01:30:19,420;01:30:20,420;"What do you guys think it is?"
01:30:20,420;01:30:22,420;"Do you have to guess?"
01:30:22,420;01:30:24,420;"It's like a 20,"
01:30:24,420;01:30:26,420;"25 right in the middle."
01:30:26,420;01:30:29,420;"Oh, you got a guess?"
01:30:29,420;01:30:31,420;"I already looked it up."
01:30:31,420;01:30:39,420;"So dude 36. Oh, this has 37. Oh, even better."
01:30:39,420;01:30:42,100;"Yeah. I was smart. Tom Brady."
01:30:42,100;01:30:44,140;"Dude, our boy is wicked smart."
01:30:44,140;01:30:47,020;"Blaine Gabbard scored a 42. Yeah."
01:30:47,020;01:30:51,540;"I saw that one. I didn't bring it up because it didn't fit my narrative."
01:30:51,540;01:30:54,180;"Brandon weeded."
01:30:54,180;01:30:56,660;"Remember the old Cleveland guy? Yeah."
01:30:56,660;01:31:00,740;"I bet they're like, well, he's older, but he's got a really high wonderlick score."
01:31:00,740;01:31:09,700;"27. No, no mind. Josh McClellan, 30. And adult in 29 in case you were wondering. I wasn't."
01:31:09,700;01:31:17,540;"Gronkows, he got a 32. Is that better than you, Greg? Quick. How is he not? He had somebody"
01:31:17,540;01:31:21,860;"take that foot of our name. Oh, that's a good one, Steve."
01:31:21,860;01:31:29,660;"I guess. I think his is probably pretty bad. I'm saying I'm saying he's like super smart"
01:31:29,660;01:31:36,400;"Psychopath not less than 20 beat Gronk. He's a mom. I don't see anything for it. He definitely went to the combine"
01:31:36,400;01:31:40,580;"Is one oh 17 who"
01:31:40,580;01:31:43,780;"Maybe I nailed it"
01:31:43,780;01:31:46,740;"All right, I'm on the topic. What about like Tyree kill"
01:31:46,740;01:31:50,260;"This we're just gonna do this, huh?"
01:31:52,300;01:32:00,800;"Tyre kill wonder like 27 not bad not bad who just like comes off as wicked dumb I"
01:32:00,800;01:32:05,700;"Mean take your pick. What about cam Newton you think I"
01:32:05,700;01:32:08,500;"Were lower than Brady"
01:32:08,500;01:32:12,540;"Slightly lower I'm saying hi 20 or Brady"
01:32:12,540;01:32:14,580;"32"
01:32:14,580;01:32:16,580;"Give me 33 plus one"
01:32:18,100;01:32:20,100;"21"
01:32:20,100;01:32:25,680;"Which is below the NFL quarterback average of 26 who's who's a fucking idiot?"
01:32:25,680;01:32:28,620;"What about Torel Owens that'll be an interesting one"
01:32:28,620;01:32:32,260;"No"
01:32:32,260;01:32:35,040;"What this is these yeah, give us a guess"
01:32:35,040;01:32:42,840;"See this could go either way right I see they're really high really though. I'm going really low like at 12"
01:32:44,740;01:32:48,820;"lower lower by half six"
01:32:48,820;01:32:59,380;"We're going Jerry rice see cuz he strikes me as someone that would be like this thing is stupid"
01:32:59,380;01:33:01,380;"I'm not doing it, you know"
01:33:01,380;01:33:04,060;"Jerry rice 15"
01:33:04,060;01:33:11,740;"Dude we could do this all day. We really go down the list of the what's your list Gregory all the guys with a bunch of babies. Oh"
01:33:12,900;01:33:16,300;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a Hall of Fame call the breeder Hall of Fame"
01:33:16,300;01:33:20,820;"Yeah, I don't think I I don't think I had a"
01:33:20,820;01:33:29,260;"We should put the the one who looks next to those and do like a power ranking where it's the kids times Wonderly score"
01:33:29,260;01:33:36,980;"Power rank because clearly one of its size if you dick right correlation. Oh, yeah, we should do a scientific"
01:33:36,980;01:33:39,860;"mathematical deep dive into"
01:33:40,620;01:33:46,160;"Andy's way of trying to go measure Drew Brun says dick. Hello Drew. Yeah, it's for science project. I'm doing"
01:33:46,160;01:33:52,900;"Oh"
01:33:52,900;01:33:58,780;"It is fascinating though. It was poor Vince Young. Yeah, yeah, he had a rough go of it"
01:33:58,780;01:34:04,580;"I just feel bad for him. Yeah, all right. Should we talk you want to do best and worse on this game?"
01:34:04,580;01:34:07,660;"I mean, there's not much happen outside of those quarters"
01:34:08,260;01:34:14,540;"Sure you want to give them a quick recap of the game though from start to finish something we said the final score"
01:34:14,540;01:34:19,260;"File score 27 17 your New England Patriots"
01:34:19,260;01:34:23,540;"Thanks to a garbage time bills touchdown, which I thought mirrored"
01:34:23,540;01:34:26,660;"the last bills drive in the"
01:34:26,660;01:34:32,500;"Time when we played in Buffalo where they drove up they drove from like they go from their own 12"
01:34:32,500;01:34:36,940;"drove all the way down the field and started like chuck it in the end zone and it looked like they weren't gonna get a"
01:34:36,940;01:34:38,480;"the touchdown out of it anyway."
01:34:38,480;01:34:41,380;"- But this time they did even though it didn't matter."
01:34:41,380;01:34:43,380;"- And they were like Drew Butts already had four pecs."
01:34:43,380;01:34:45,380;"The commentators like, ""Oh, I don't know about this."""
01:34:45,380;01:34:47,180;"They should just not sling it."
01:34:47,180;01:34:49,340;"But come on, it's Drew fucking bloodsaw."
01:34:49,340;01:34:50,820;"You know you're the bloodsaw."
01:34:50,820;01:34:51,980;"- Yeah, you know it's common."
01:34:51,980;01:34:52,820;"- Oh yeah."
01:34:52,820;01:34:55,780;"- So and molds made this like circus one-handed"
01:34:55,780;01:34:58,100;"ridiculous spinning catch too."
01:34:58,100;01:35:00,460;"- Their other touchdown was a clear OPI."
01:35:00,460;01:35:02,180;"- Yeah."
01:35:02,180;01:35:04,060;"- The commentators were like, ""We're 100 yards away"
01:35:04,060;01:35:05,980;"and we can even see the fans are right."""
01:35:05,980;01:35:06,820;"- Yeah, it was."
01:35:06,820;01:35:11,340;"- But yeah, we'd go up 17, nothing like immediately."
01:35:11,340;01:35:12,660;"- Yeah."
01:35:12,660;01:35:14,220;"- The bills get that one touched down"
01:35:14,220;01:35:15,060;"and kind of turns around."
01:35:15,060;01:35:18,660;"So that's what, 17-7 at one point I believe, or 20."
01:35:18,660;01:35:21,700;"- No, they didn't score until the second half."
01:35:21,700;01:35:23,220;"- Yeah, but it was like 20 to seven."
01:35:23,220;01:35:24,820;"The bills had some good momentum."
01:35:24,820;01:35:25,660;"- Yeah."
01:35:25,660;01:35:26,900;"- You know, the field goal of 2010."
01:35:26,900;01:35:28,100;"At that point, you're like, okay."
01:35:28,100;01:35:29,540;"- Yeah, and then the Patriots."
01:35:29,540;01:35:30,540;"- It's gonna get to go either way."
01:35:30,540;01:35:32,860;"- tried to like do the backbreaker thing"
01:35:32,860;01:35:34,580;"where they tried to end around."
01:35:34,580;01:35:37,740;"- It was to Daniel Graham, I think,"
01:35:37,740;01:35:40,720;"was the guy running the end around and he fumbled it."
01:35:40,720;01:35:42,180;"So they ended up going three and out on that"
01:35:42,180;01:35:43,480;"and so you're like, ""Oh, fuck this."""
01:35:43,480;01:35:45,120;"You can feel the shift happening."
01:35:45,120;01:35:49,600;"But then Peele's price fumbles,"
01:35:49,600;01:35:51,760;"like first play of the drive,"
01:35:51,760;01:35:55,560;"and then the Patriots score a touchdown, Antoine Smith."
01:35:55,560;01:35:57,440;"And then from there,"
01:35:57,440;01:35:59,280;"Bloods are just starting to have exceptions."
01:35:59,280;01:36:00,440;"- What was that?"
01:36:02,160;01:36:04,600;"whatever it's called, the Philly Special"
01:36:04,600;01:36:05,720;"and either calling it now."
01:36:05,720;01:36:07,120;"- Oh yes."
01:36:07,120;01:36:09,240;"So that was gonna be--"
01:36:09,240;01:36:11,480;"- That was right at the end of this second quarter."
01:36:11,480;01:36:13,560;"- And we'll put this in the show notes."
01:36:13,560;01:36:15,960;"- Did you see this Greg, this play?"
01:36:15,960;01:36:17,760;"- I don't think so."
01:36:17,760;01:36:20,600;"- So they had two touchdowns, by the end of the first half,"
01:36:20,600;01:36:23,440;"they'd had two touchdowns call back on penalty."
01:36:23,440;01:36:25,560;"So it could have been inside of 17."
01:36:25,560;01:36:27,440;"- Both from Ben."
01:36:27,440;01:36:30,200;"- Both of them were called back on Kevin Falk."
01:36:30,200;01:36:32,400;"You scored two touchdowns in this game."
01:36:32,400;01:36:34,480;"And while it was running Touchdown,"
01:36:34,480;01:36:36,400;"where you just like ran it untouched from now,"
01:36:36,400;01:36:38,400;"what was the Dion branch when we got hurt?"
01:36:38,400;01:36:41,000;"Well, then they had three touchdowns called back"
01:36:41,000;01:36:43,440;"'cause I remember towards the end of the game,"
01:36:43,440;01:36:45,120;"yeah, Falk had a TV call back."
01:36:45,120;01:36:46,360;"It was like a long touchdown run"
01:36:46,360;01:36:48,240;"where you got on Touchdown was called back for holding"
01:36:48,240;01:36:50,360;"and it was like a bullshit call."
01:36:50,360;01:36:51,680;"But this one, Greg,"
01:36:51,680;01:36:56,000;"was called back."
01:36:56,000;01:36:59,400;"And I mean, you remember this play working?"
01:36:59,400;01:37:01,400;"because they've tried it in other."
01:37:01,400;01:37:03,680;"- Oh yes, I did see this."
01:37:03,680;01:37:07,160;"- So it's basically, if you guys remember from"
01:37:07,160;01:37:10,040;"the dolphins, I don't know if it's happened yet."
01:37:10,040;01:37:11,960;"How's it, have we talked about it?"
01:37:11,960;01:37:15,160;"- Where Kevin Falk takes a direct snap,"
01:37:15,160;01:37:18,480;"Brady out of the shotgun and runs to his right"
01:37:18,480;01:37:20,360;"and then does a throwback to Brady."
01:37:20,360;01:37:21,600;"In this case, scores a touchdown."
01:37:21,600;01:37:23,000;"And this is,"
01:37:23,000;01:37:26,200;"- What's would have been Brady's first and only ever"
01:37:26,200;01:37:27,440;"received a touchdown, yeah."
01:37:27,440;01:37:28,440;"- You never caught one."
01:37:28,440;01:37:32,280;"And, uh, they, it was such a bullshit call."
01:37:32,280;01:37:34,040;"It said Brady was moving at the snap."
01:37:34,040;01:37:38,340;"No, he said, Falk was moving at the snap, which I mean, it's fine."
01:37:38,340;01:37:39,880;"He was moving sideways though."
01:37:39,880;01:37:43,560;"So it should technically have been illegal."
01:37:43,560;01:37:45,480;"Either way, shift, but yeah."
01:37:45,480;01:37:50,440;"So yeah, it was, it was a bullshit callback, but it was the exact same"
01:37:50,440;01:37:53,040;"play that they were in against Miami where it worked, which I think we've"
01:37:53,040;01:37:53,500;"already seen."
01:37:53,500;01:37:58,320;"Yeah, because Brady talked about turning a touchdown into a 40."
01:37:58,320;01:38:00,760;"Yeah, 30-hour game or something like that."
01:38:00,760;01:38:03,360;"But this is the exact same play, and it worked perfectly."
01:38:03,360;01:38:05,440;"But they got called back, which was bullshit."
01:38:05,440;01:38:07,320;"So that's my best and worst."
01:38:07,320;01:38:09,160;"My worst is pretty not dancing to the end,"
01:38:09,160;01:38:10,160;"but a little bit more."
01:38:10,160;01:38:11,680;"He was clear."
01:38:11,680;01:38:12,680;"I think he saw this guy."
01:38:12,680;01:38:14,480;"It should have gotten a cool high step."
01:38:14,480;01:38:15,480;"Yeah, he should have."
01:38:15,480;01:38:17,400;"Yeah, and you feel like young Brady would do that back"
01:38:17,400;01:38:18,040;"in those days."
01:38:18,040;01:38:19,440;"He was more fired up than he is."
01:38:19,440;01:38:23,000;"No celebrating in Tampa, Perseverions, little hard ass."
01:38:23,000;01:38:25,680;"Brady loves getting yelled at by him."
01:38:25,680;01:38:26,320;"We'll find out."
01:38:26,320;01:38:30,040;"Yeah, so that was brutal."
01:38:30,040;01:38:32,920;"And the other two touchdowns that were called back also brutal."
01:38:32,920;01:38:34,880;"But it was like, but at the end of the day, the page is still one."
01:38:34,880;01:38:37,880;"There was a bunch of missed opportunities, but it was 20 to 10 at one point."
01:38:37,880;01:38:40,200;"And the bill stuff we had momentum."
01:38:40,200;01:38:41,200;"Yeah."
01:38:41,200;01:38:45,360;"And then they just kind of, but it's all started throwing picks and we'll start dropping the"
01:38:45,360;01:38:47,480;"ball and they just kind of shot themselves in the foot."
01:38:47,480;01:38:48,480;"Yeah."
01:38:48,480;01:38:49,480;"Yeah."
01:38:49,480;01:38:50,480;"We're going to end up running touchdown to close it out."
01:38:50,480;01:38:51,480;"Yeah."
01:38:51,480;01:38:55,760;"There's a classic blood cell interception in there too, where he's like in the grasp."
01:38:55,760;01:38:59,660;"He just like chucks it into traffic and it's like, oh boy."
01:38:59,660;01:39:05,260;"And then middle of the field never going to work, but desperation play."
01:39:05,260;01:39:05,960;"Yeah."
01:39:05,960;01:39:09,760;"So I was looking at the like a block score."
01:39:09,760;01:39:15,260;"And that last drive that started on their own 12."
01:39:15,260;01:39:15,660;"Yeah."
01:39:15,660;01:39:18,460;"That ended in the touchdown to molds."
01:39:18,460;01:39:23,260;"Me, Bledso attempted 15 passes and that one drive."
01:39:25,260;01:39:28,380;"- In a row, one, two, three, four, five."
01:39:28,380;01:39:31,620;"- There's a couple like quarterback runs though."
01:39:31,620;01:39:35,420;"- No."
01:39:35,420;01:39:37,460;"- Oh yeah, those one, yeah."
01:39:37,460;01:39:39,380;"Your Bud's a middle for 10 yards."
01:39:39,380;01:39:40,660;"- Yeah."
01:39:40,660;01:39:42,260;"Left guard for one yard."
01:39:42,260;01:39:44,380;"- It's amazing."
01:39:44,380;01:39:45,220;"- Yeah."
01:39:45,220;01:39:47,220;"- You're just putting the team on his back, baby."
01:39:47,220;01:39:48,060;"- I mean, that's what he,"
01:39:48,060;01:39:50,740;"but apparently the week before he had done something similar."
01:39:50,740;01:39:51,580;"- But that's what I'm saying."
01:39:51,580;01:39:54,900;"He's like, he sees the new family's house"
01:39:54,900;01:39:57,500;"looks really nice. And then he goes back to the house and"
01:39:57,500;01:40:01,220;"portrait Park was like, man, it's just like my old house."
01:40:01,220;01:40:04,500;"The whole team on my back 50 times a game."
01:40:04,500;01:40:09,780;"It's true. Yeah. But I mean, last week, who was they who"
01:40:09,780;01:40:12,820;"they played? They played the dolphins and they beat the"
01:40:12,820;01:40:18,660;"dolphins, right? And it was in in Buffalo in the snow. And he"
01:40:18,660;01:40:25,660;"through 177 of his 360 yards on his last three completions."
01:40:25,660;01:40:31,340;"They're all just like huge plays that like went for touchdowns and that's what won the"
01:40:31,340;01:40:32,340;"game."
01:40:32,340;01:40:33,340;"Fuck ridiculous."
01:40:33,340;01:40:34,340;"The dude can throw a football."
01:40:34,340;01:40:35,340;"I'll still give him that."
01:40:35,340;01:40:40,660;"I'm not always to his own team, but it's all that matters."
01:40:40,660;01:40:41,660;"Yeah."
01:40:41,660;01:40:45,220;"Also, something interesting that they showed a stat on the field."
01:40:45,220;01:40:47,100;"All right, on the field, Jesus."
01:40:47,100;01:40:50,700;"On the screen was after 12 games in 2001,"
01:40:50,700;01:40:53,660;"the Patriots are almost exactly the same spot"
01:40:53,660;01:40:55,820;"as they were this year."
01:40:55,820;01:40:59,460;"And yet somehow they didn't win the Super Bowl."
01:40:59,460;01:41:03,220;"- All right, wanna wrap this baby up?"
01:41:03,220;01:41:04,340;"Let's wrap this up."
01:41:04,340;01:41:06,420;"All right, I'll give you a best and worst, Greg."
01:41:06,420;01:41:08,300;"- My best and worst, sure."
01:41:08,300;01:41:14,700;"My best is..."
01:41:14,700;01:41:17,500;"- So, sit here, you're gonna aim once."
01:41:17,500;01:41:19,980;"- Always got notes and written and everything."
01:41:19,980;01:41:21,940;"- I think I already used them all."
01:41:21,940;01:41:22,760;"(laughs)"
01:41:22,760;01:41:25,120;"I mean, Drew Bledsoe's performance"
01:41:25,120;01:41:27,260;"could probably be both best and worst."
01:41:27,260;01:41:28,100;"- I agree."
01:41:28,100;01:41:31,380;"- You know, 50 pass attempts, 300 yards,"
01:41:31,380;01:41:34,580;"four picks, two touchdowns, two sacks thrown in there too."
01:41:34,580;01:41:38,860;"It's just the most Bledsoe stat line you could ever imagine."
01:41:38,860;01:41:41,340;"- And even the interceptions were very Bledsoe-esque."
01:41:41,340;01:41:42,180;"- Mm."
01:41:42,180;01:41:43,020;"- Yeah."
01:41:43,020;01:41:43,860;"- Beautiful."
01:41:43,860;01:41:50,420;"very fitting return. It was exactly what you want. Steve. All right. My I don't know if this is"
01:41:50,420;01:41:57,540;"the best or worst, but the Patriots punted from the bills 30. They did like in the game."
01:41:57,540;01:42:08,020;"Fucking Belichick dude. He's he sucks. That was after the fall touchdown I got called back. Yeah."
01:42:08,020;01:42:11,140;"Yeah. And so there's instead of like even because they've been a Terry missed a field go over"
01:42:11,140;01:42:13,660;"from about the same spot. The last drive. So it's like fucking"
01:42:13,660;01:42:14,100;"fun thing."
01:42:14,100;01:42:18,580;"But from the 30. Yeah, you get roasted today. So shimmy, the"
01:42:18,580;01:42:21,820;"world 47 yard field goal into the winds wasn't happening."
01:42:21,820;01:42:24,260;"And then not a stats guy."
01:42:24,260;01:42:26,820;"I don't know. This is the best or the worst. But the"
01:42:26,820;01:42:31,020;"commentators are talking about how Chucky, John Gruden used to"
01:42:31,020;01:42:35,260;"be a ball boy at Indiana. For what's the famous coach there?"
01:42:35,260;01:42:40,140;"The Colts? No, Bob Knight. Yeah, Bob Knight. Oh, really?"
01:42:40,660;01:42:47,780;"John Grudid as a little kid. Bob nice. Bob boy. God. Oh my God."
01:42:47,780;01:42:53,620;"Oh, that whole hundred percent. Dude, do you think there's a picture on the internet of that? Probably."
01:42:53,620;01:42:56,180;"I think you're going to find it as there is."
01:42:56,180;01:43:02,660;"If you re-taste the picture on the internet, it's like, is he like breaking down film to like,"
01:43:02,660;01:43:07,460;"oh my God, this guy's so good at the basketball. I don't think Chuckie breaks down. So,"
01:43:08,260;01:43:10,260;"It was driving me that kind of dude."
01:43:10,260;01:43:13,060;"You've never seen QB camp buddy."
01:43:13,060;01:43:16,180;"Everybody steps in there is the best ever."
01:43:16,180;01:43:17,620;"Why is he going in?"
01:43:17,620;01:43:18,820;"That's right."
01:43:18,820;01:43:21,620;"Spider left wide."
01:43:21,620;01:43:23,860;"I don't know."
01:43:23,860;01:43:27,300;"Now the whole person on the one."
01:43:27,300;01:43:31,380;"Name this play."
01:43:31,380;01:43:36,900;"Another best tie law had a pick in this game right?"
01:43:36,900;01:43:44,100;"Yeah, he did. Yeah, well, I'm gonna have to call out Tyler every time it makes an interception just so people realize how frequent it actually is."
01:43:44,100;01:43:48,780;"It does come up a lot. It's really like every other game, Tyler is getting a pick."
01:43:48,780;01:43:51,020;"We also call out Troy Brown's stat line for every game."
01:43:51,020;01:43:56,660;"I was just about to say that exactly if you're calling out Tyler, I'm calling Troy Brown because he was breaking ankles in this game."
01:43:56,660;01:43:58,900;"Those quick bubble screens to him."
01:43:58,900;01:44:01,100;"Oh, yeah, that's not a stat."
01:44:01,100;01:44:03,660;"And you can just feel the fear radiating on it."
01:44:03,660;01:44:05,620;"Yeah, six step arm on one of them."
01:44:05,620;01:44:07,580;"Yeah, well, he broke this guy's ankles all over."
01:44:07,580;01:44:10,860;"It looked like he was going to cut inside and he just like jumped outside the guy."
01:44:10,860;01:44:12,220;"He just literally fell over."
01:44:12,220;01:44:12,980;"It was amazing."
01:44:12,980;01:44:13,780;"Yeah."
01:44:13,780;01:44:16,300;"Is that one of his three catches for 27 yards?"
01:44:16,300;01:44:16,820;"Sick."
01:44:16,820;01:44:19,540;"Are you really?"
01:44:19,540;01:44:21,220;"Are you sitting on Twitter?"
01:44:21,220;01:44:25,500;"No, I'm just saying like we don't got a we don't got to wash his balls every game, you know?"
01:44:25,500;01:44:26,740;"Yes, we do."
01:44:26,740;01:44:28,860;"What podcast do you think this is?"
01:44:28,860;01:44:30,660;"I mean, I love the Troy Brown."
01:44:30,660;01:44:34,540;"No, you also forgot to mention his one carry for 21 yards."
01:44:34,540;01:44:35,220;"Thank you very much."
01:44:35,220;01:44:37,700;"Yes. I'm so open. You wouldn't look that up."
01:44:37,700;01:44:41,220;"It doesn't fit. It doesn't fit my narrative."
01:44:41,220;01:44:48,260;"Fearless price. Fearless actual retail price at a good day."

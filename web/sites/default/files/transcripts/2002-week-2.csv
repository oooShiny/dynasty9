00:06,780;00:08,220;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,220;00:12,580;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,580;00:13,940;"they're just being stupid."
00:13,940;00:15,540;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,540;00:16,540;"Go right ahead."
00:16,540;00:17,540;"I am not your mother."
00:17,540;00:23,540;"[Music]"
00:23,540;00:26,540;"Back to the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
00:26,540;00:28,540;"Episode 2, season 2."
00:28,540;00:36,540;"Heading to Giant Stadium to take on the hated Jets and see Brown's favorite player, Curtis Martin."
00:36,540;00:39,540;"Here's my favorite Martin. Steve, is he your favorite Martin?"
00:39,540;00:42,540;"I should think of another like something to put in there instead."
00:42,540;00:43,540;"I mean, all along."
00:43,540;00:44,540;"His favorite Martin."
00:44,540;00:45,540;"Yeah."

00:51,300;00:58,220;"Well, you can't see me, but thank you Andy. It's good to be back. So boys trust everybody is better that way"
00:58,220;01:06,300;"I think we decided the only person who had a phase for radio was Mike"
01:06,300;01:09,300;"And Kelly apparently"
01:11,300;01:18,740;"Oh boys, Kelly just dropped and he, he, he, I'm gonna stay right on my desk."
01:18,740;01:26,740;"This is a rousing start."
01:26,740;01:29,940;"I can't wait to listen to you eat it while we're recording this."
01:29,940;01:34,020;"What?"
01:34,020;01:36,100;"Want me to give you, want to give you a live review?"
01:36,100;01:37,140;"Yeah."
01:37,140;01:37,140;"Yeah."
01:37,140;01:38,180;"All right, let's do it."
01:38,180;01:41,140;"We got some net for corn on top."
01:41,140;01:43,380;"Okay. How well done is it?"
01:43,380;01:46,940;"Oh, perfectly seared."
01:46,940;01:49,700;"Nice and juicy in the middle."
01:49,700;01:50,460;"We got a little."
01:50,460;01:55,700;"We got a melon avocado tomato, you know,"
01:55,700;01:58,140;"potpourri salad to go with it."
01:58,140;01:59,020;"Oh boy."
01:59,020;02:04,620;"I like the right, but I will go with it."
02:04,620;02:08,380;"Oh, very refreshing to go with this year."
02:08,380;02:15,660;"gonna oh four stars four out of how many yeah cool out of five out of twenty three"
02:15,660;02:25,420;"hmm all right now I'll get the scale down good job Kelly you know it all right"
02:25,420;02:29,260;"after a rousing start almost is rousing as the jet started in this game"
02:29,260;02:37,180;"if you gonna let me do this yeah scouting report well let's yeah let's"
02:37,180;02:41,740;"It's a preface this by saying that we've decided that we ramble a lot on these episodes."
02:41,740;02:43,500;"We're going to try something a little bit different today."
02:43,500;02:47,500;"We're going to try a little bit of a format, so we'll see how this goes."
02:47,500;02:53,460;"So yeah, you wanted to do a scouting report, preferably not on what you're eating or any"
02:53,460;02:56,020;"other seafood, but the jets."
02:56,020;02:57,820;"Anything on the jets?"
02:57,820;02:58,820;"Yeah, I got you."
02:58,820;02:59,820;"I got notes."
02:59,820;03:01,820;"Well, let's hear."
03:01,820;03:06,340;"I'm going to set the scene a little bit here because it's not just about the jets at this"
03:06,340;03:15,780;"point, right? This is in the midst of New York versus Boston sports culture. You know what I'm"
03:15,780;03:22,820;"saying? So there's a lot of stuff going around, like hanging around both these cities at this"
03:22,820;03:29,140;"point. So it's not just the Patriots, it's the Red Sox too. The Red Sox, you're looking at"
03:29,140;03:34,460;"1999 was the Alcs when the angst beat the socks for games to one"
03:34,460;03:38,660;"You're a little bit away from what's his name in too far too long"
03:38,660;03:45,580;"Maybe in Pedro in no not quite that's that's that's a year from now. That's 2003"
03:45,580;03:52,580;"The Aaron fucking boom, which is also the same year as Don Zimmer getting thrown to the ground if you remember"
03:54,660;03:55,660;"or action."
03:55,660;03:56,660;"- Uh-huh."
03:56,660;03:59,940;"- Roger Clemens signed with the Yankees in 1999,"
03:59,940;04:01,260;"so two years ago."
04:01,260;04:06,900;"Pedro, I think, remember when he was talking about"
04:06,900;04:10,660;"wake up Babe Ruth and I'll drill him in the ass?"
04:10,660;04:12,660;"(laughing)"
04:12,660;04:14,980;"- That's right around this timeframe."
04:14,980;04:16,340;"And then the whole like,"
04:16,340;04:19,220;"the Yankees are my daddy thing, but we'll forget that."
04:19,220;04:22,100;"- Oh yeah, well that was 2004, wasn't it?"
04:22,100;04:22,940;"- Yeah, sure."
04:22,940;04:23,780;"- Yeah."
04:23,780;04:27,060;"I mean, the Boston--"
04:27,060;04:32,060;"- The Don D'Amour thing was in 2003, Gregy."
04:32,060;04:33,020;"- Yeah."
04:33,020;04:33,860;"- Yeah."
04:33,860;04:35,940;"- Same year as Harry fucking Boone."
04:35,940;04:37,260;"- Yeah."
04:37,260;04:40,700;"- So then even the Jets and the Patriots"
04:40,700;04:42,100;"have all sorts of controversy,"
04:42,100;04:42,940;"swoon around, right?"
04:42,940;04:47,040;"So the Bill Parse sells, leaving the Pats,"
04:47,040;04:49,740;"going to the Jets, there was all stink about that,"
04:49,740;04:52,340;"some draft picks got traded."
04:52,340;04:55,340;"And then Bill Belichick obviously."
04:55,340;04:58,780;"- Rosado, courtesy of NYJ."
04:58,780;05:01,860;"- Goes from the, exactly."
05:01,860;05:05,820;"And then who replaces Para Sells as well as Pete Carroll"
05:05,820;05:08,300;"who used to be a head coach of the Jets."
05:08,300;05:09,980;"- Well, it's pretty good, okay."
05:09,980;05:10,980;"- 1994."
05:10,980;05:12,660;"- Big Carols and Jets head coach."
05:12,660;05:15,140;"- Did not know that there."
05:15,140;05:15,980;"- I had no idea."
05:15,980;05:19,300;"- I don't even think any of those Jets, you would see."
05:19,300;05:20,140;"- I have no idea."
05:21,580;05:23,640;"- Could've been that great, right?"
05:23,640;05:24,960;"- Yeah."
05:24,960;05:27,620;"- So then Molo, it's obviously last year."
05:27,620;05:30,180;"Victor Green leads the Jets comes to the paths"
05:30,180;05:33,100;"after eight years in the Jets this offseason."
05:33,100;05:36,560;"And somehow the Jets come into this game"
05:36,560;05:38,420;"as one point favorites."
05:38,420;05:39,740;"- They did."
05:39,740;05:40,580;"I noticed."
05:40,580;05:41,900;"- Like what the fuck?"
05:41,900;05:42,900;"- He shoots one in the Super Bowl"
05:42,900;05:45,940;"and then back to back underdogs."
05:45,940;05:47,660;"- Yep, yeah."
05:47,660;05:49,500;"Yeah, so they're underdogs last week"
05:49,500;05:51,220;"and blew out the Steelers."
05:51,220;05:55,060;"and the Jets squeaked by the bills, I think it was,"
05:55,060;05:59,540;"even though they are outgained and out everything."
05:59,540;06:02,280;"But it was only because they beat the bills last week"
06:02,280;06:06,440;"because Chad Morton returned to kickoff for touchdowns."
06:06,440;06:08,740;"And they went in overtime."
06:08,740;06:13,020;"- I just looked up Pete Carroll's time at the Jets."
06:13,020;06:14,120;"- Not great."
06:14,120;06:16,280;"- The 94 elevated at coach."
06:16,280;06:19,780;"Carroll painted a basketball court in the parking lot"
06:19,780;06:24,180;"the team's practice facility where he's his coaches played three on three during their spare time."
06:24,180;06:30,340;"They go six and five and we 12 he got fake spiked by a demo right now."
06:30,340;06:33,060;"Oh, that was fake the clock and threw a touchdown."
06:33,060;06:38,980;"And then they lost all of their remaining games to go six and then and he got fired."
06:38,980;06:43,940;"Oh, we got fired and then hired by the Pats the next year."
06:43,940;06:47,500;"Now you went to the Niners for two years."
06:47,500;06:49,740;"Oh, oh, it's not a head coach."
06:49,740;06:49,940;"Yeah."
06:49,940;06:50,300;"OK."
06:50,300;06:52,300;"Yeah."
06:52,300;06:57,400;"And the Jets actually got ravaged by the Texans expansion"
06:57,400;06:58,380;"draft, too."
06:58,380;06:59,260;"They did."
06:59,260;07:00,060;"I noticed that."
07:00,060;07:00,540;"Oh, yeah."
07:00,540;07:02,820;"There were some kind of big names that left."
07:02,820;07:05,460;"Yeah, the two biggest like salary cap hits"
07:05,460;07:09,340;"from that expansion draft for both Jets, cornerbacks,"
07:09,340;07:11,540;"Aaron Glenn and Marcus Coleman."
07:11,540;07:12,540;"Yeah, that's a problem."
07:12,540;07:15,740;"like there's possible Hall of Famer at Erringlund, right? That one?"
07:15,740;07:17,260;"Yes."
07:17,260;07:23,460;"Is he? No, no, like they're defensive."
07:23,460;07:24,460;"I'm a backer."
07:24,460;07:29,300;"They're nasty. But their secondary like year over year had no no names."
07:29,300;07:34,140;"Yeah, they had three out of the four guys were new. There's only one who was"
07:34,140;07:38,140;"the front there from last year. So I remember it was they also lost Tom"
07:38,140;07:39,700;"to the box, right? That's awesome."
07:39,700;07:44,260;"That was a big loss, I think, because you didn't get here about"
07:44,260;07:47,100;"about him being a quarterback as well."
07:47,100;07:48,460;"So we'll see you at Greg."
07:48,460;07:51,100;"Yes. So that's the same."
07:51,100;07:53,100;"That's all I got. All right."
07:53,100;07:55,980;"Oh, Vinny tests very still a quarterback, which is ridiculous."
07:55,980;07:58,180;"Yeah. But didn't they?"
07:58,180;08:01,580;"Well, they didn't draft him this year, but the backup was Chad"
08:01,580;08:02,700;"Pennington, right?"
08:02,700;08:04,180;"Ooh, I think I played it."
08:04,180;08:06,420;"Here's the season before."
08:06,420;08:09,260;"But a couple games of season before, but nothing really."
08:09,260;08:11,100;"I love Chad Pennington."
08:11,100;08:14,460;"He's the winningest ASE quarter back behind Brady, right?"
08:14,460;08:15,860;"I believe he is."
08:15,860;08:16,500;"Yeah."
08:16,500;08:17,540;"I think so."
08:17,540;08:19,580;"Yeah, I believe in what maybe it's"
08:19,580;08:22,140;"well, since Brady's been playing."
08:22,140;08:24,580;"Yeah, since 2001, probably."
08:24,580;08:26,460;"All right."
08:26,460;08:28,860;"Like Jim Kelly's got to be up there."
08:28,860;08:29,660;"Oh, yeah."
08:29,660;08:30,660;"No."
08:30,660;08:31,660;"Yeah, not ever."
08:32,980;08:38,260;"But in the last 20 years, the second most wins by a quarterback in the AFC East,"
08:38,260;08:39,260;"I think is Chad Pennington."
08:39,260;08:42,940;"I mean, who else who else has any wins?"
08:42,940;08:44,780;"If it's magic, you've had it is."
08:44,780;08:45,580;"That's this year, right?"
08:45,580;08:46,980;"You want six games?"
08:46,980;08:47,580;"Probably up there."
08:47,580;08:47,860;"Yeah."
08:47,860;08:48,580;"Yeah."
08:48,580;08:52,940;"He's one of few games here and there for every other AFC East team."
08:52,940;08:53,660;"All right."
08:53,660;08:56,100;"So then should we get into the game that we've set the scene here?"
08:56,100;08:56,700;"Yeah."
08:56,700;08:57,220;"Let's do it."
08:57,220;09:01,140;"All right, Steve, you want to, uh, well, I was out there and"
09:01,140;09:06,580;"the final score was like 44 to seven. Yeah. Shit stomping."
09:06,580;09:10,540;"I watched every second of it. I loved it. Yeah."
09:10,540;09:14,900;"That was an awesome order. Oh, it was amazing."
09:14,900;09:18,700;"Good. That's exciting. I was a for the obvious first ever snap."
09:18,700;09:24,340;"There were my favorite part on one, two, three, four, five quarterbacks"
09:24,340;09:27,180;"played in the fourth quarter. This can you name them? Five? Yeah."
09:27,180;09:29,900;"I can like. So I got Steve."
09:29,980;09:36,180;"I want to see if anybody else can can name any of them. So so how many can you name name what?"
09:36,180;09:40,360;"The the five quarter name what you playing the fourth quarter of this game"
09:40,360;09:43,300;"Oh"
09:43,300;09:48,180;"Five eighty the five what quarterbacks that play quarter back quarter this game. Oh"
09:48,180;09:55,180;"I've been on to a rock test of Verde call me Brandon test of her do yep"
09:55,180;09:57,820;"Chad Bennington Rowan"
09:57,780;10:04,020;"Panington Rohan David he did he was he was in life for all three kneel"
10:04,020;10:07,300;"To end the game. They were needles and David"
10:07,300;10:10,100;"Get in there. Yeah, yeah"
10:10,100;10:14,580;"And he let it drive entirely of handoffs that finish with a fork touchdown run"
10:14,580;10:18,740;"I did not know that was Damien. He heard I watched that game"
10:18,740;10:23,780;"He was in there doing a handoff for that entire drive. That's all he did"
10:24,580;10:31,600;"Yeah, like five or six handoffs in a row because they're just trying to run the clock out and the Jets couldn't say this was like they were clearly trying to make K."
10:31,600;10:33,100;"Falka like a thing here."
10:33,100;10:37,600;"Well, I think they had activated back in the back of a year redman."
10:37,600;10:43,180;"But yeah, he was he was like the number two everything."
10:43,180;10:48,780;"Even when you go back and you rewatch that Rams he were both game winning drive."
10:48,780;10:49,980;"Yeah, right."
10:49,980;10:55,880;"I thought that was Kevin Falk, you know, you just kind of assume Kevin Falk and the pages dynasty are like one and one"
10:55,880;11:00,680;"Which at some point they become but I mean 2001 he didn't do anything really"
11:00,680;11:04,200;"He didn't even dress and that Steelers week one"
11:04,200;11:07,960;"So he wasn't even on the act of roster for the first game"
11:07,960;11:16,200;"But in this game, but they're really kind of dressed and Kevin Falk did yeah, and he was kind of like you running back James why you"
11:18,160;11:23,220;"Yeah, same exact idea and white started out he couldn't do anything either like the first year"
11:23,220;11:26,640;"James why it was just everyone's calling a bust"
11:26,640;11:29,520;"That's right not anymore"
11:29,520;11:32,360;"Yeah, he was I think he"
11:32,360;11:35,240;"was the"
11:35,240;11:40,040;"The number two running back cuz Antoine Smith. Yeah Antoine Smith got dinged up"
11:40,040;11:42,440;"so he was the lead running back and"
11:43,040;11:48,600;"And he was eventually returning punts and I think he was returning kickoffs at 1.2 him and Dion branch"
11:48,600;11:51,360;"He was back there. I'll be actually returning but"
11:51,360;11:56,080;"So he was the the Troy Brown of the of this game. I think"
11:56,080;12:00,360;"Yeah, so Pat's absolutely crushed him the whole game"
12:00,360;12:06,240;"But they really could have beaten him better Troy Brown had that fumble on the one-yard line in the first quarter"
12:06,240;12:09,240;"Yep as he was going into score. I was brutal"
12:09,560;12:17,840;"That was a very rare mistake from Troy Brown. I think that being said Troy Brown in the first half ten catches 107 yards"
12:17,840;12:20,440;"Jets 48 yards"
12:20,440;12:27,160;"You like he doubled them up by himself. Yes, just catching the ball"
12:27,160;12:30,640;"So there's something else I want to mention actually before getting further"
12:30,640;12:35,760;"We've been talking about all these plays and if you actually want to watch and you can go to the website"
12:36,080;12:43,360;"So for this one is past dynasty.info/gains/68 and you'll be able to see all of Troy Brown's big plays"
12:43,360;12:47,440;"Especially including his wide receiver screen. What do you guys think right?"
12:47,440;12:51,360;"Does that mean next week does that mean next week is slash 69?"
12:51,360;12:54,080;"It might be nice. Oh"
12:54,080;12:58,080;"I've intrigued 200 next week. I"
12:58,080;13:00,800;"Can't wait"
13:00,800;13:02,800;"I'll dress up. Yeah"
13:03,200;13:06,640;"Get a bottle of wine. You know you're having for dinner then"
13:06,640;13:09,200;"Yeah, Jesus himself, who nani"
13:09,200;13:12,400;"You know what they say Steve? Winum Dynum"
13:12,400;13:15,440;"69 them"
13:15,440;13:19,360;"If we if we had more for thought we could have got to that grogg on this"
13:19,360;13:22,160;"Love something I got 69 joke"
13:22,160;13:24,480;"Andy make sure you get that um"
13:24,480;13:29,200;"Six feet. No, I'm sure she's got nothing better to do right now, right?"
13:30,240;13:36,560;"Let's see they're all on here. Don't you worry about it? Did you want to talk about that reverse that like he like fake"
13:36,560;13:39,200;"Servers and like one of the best ball fakes of ever seen from Brady"
13:39,200;13:43,360;"And he hits that dime and he's just"
13:43,360;13:46,080;"that"
13:46,080;13:49,280;"Steve you just took one of my key talking points"
13:49,280;13:56,160;"Um, that was a 39 yard path path to david patton. I I wrote down"
13:56,960;14:01,960;"that Brady's play action ability has always been elite."
14:01,960;14:07,480;"I mean, he sells the play action, the reverse,"
14:07,480;14:11,160;"better than any quarterback ever."
14:11,160;14:12,000;"- I agree."
14:12,000;14:14,440;"- He's one of the few that still,"
14:14,440;14:15,960;"that still turns to him."
14:15,960;14:17,560;"- He preached to him by like,"
14:17,560;14:18,400;"sorry, what you saying?"
14:18,400;14:19,800;"- Yeah, like tuck the ball and he's not--"
14:19,800;14:21,600;"- Charlie Weiss taught him up on that."
14:21,600;14:23,440;"- Yeah."
14:23,440;14:25,040;"- Yeah, but he wouldn't."
14:25,040;14:29,760;"run reverses a ton last like, I don't know, maybe even back in the day, like this time,"
14:29,760;14:32,760;"last year they're running a ton. That certainly helped."
14:32,760;14:35,440;"Charlie Weiss, Charlie Weiss, baby."
14:35,440;14:37,440;"It was awesome. Yeah."
14:37,440;14:44,320;"And he was not the direct snap to Kevin Falk, where Brady would pretend it went over his head."
14:44,320;14:47,680;"This got the announcement again on this game."
14:47,680;14:51,160;"Should we talk about them? Sure."
14:51,640;14:57,640;"Because it's the introduction of Dan fucking Deardorf and the worst."
14:57,640;14:59,840;"And thanks, Greg."
14:59,840;15:00,960;"I appreciate the support."
15:00,960;15:03,000;"Whether or not you believe it, I'm not sure."
15:03,000;15:05,520;"But yeah, I know, I know."
15:05,520;15:06,320;"I really do."
15:06,320;15:11,080;"I usually do shit about this, but Dan Deardorf blows."
15:11,080;15:18,080;"And so I used to think it was just him, but I paid special"
15:18,080;15:21,080;"tensions because I've been kind of hyping it for a while about how much I"
15:21,080;15:27,780;"I hate Dan Deodorf, but Dick Enberg, his partner, is probably as bad, if not worse."
15:27,780;15:29,840;"The two of them actually looked it up."
15:29,840;15:36,700;"There was a New York Times article written about how bad they are."
15:36,700;15:40,700;"Deodorf and Enberg repeatedly fumbled broadcasts of Rams Jets games."
15:40,700;15:42,160;"This isn't even like a Patriots game."
15:42,160;15:45,420;"This is just like they're just that bad."
15:45,420;15:47,100;"And yeah, we'll link that in the show."
15:47,100;15:48,100;"Did you read the article?"
15:48,100;15:49,100;"Oh, get high."
15:49,100;15:50,100;"What were they saying?"
15:50,100;15:52,100;"What were they saying?"
15:52,100;15:58,660;"Basically that they don't seem to understand what's going on in a football game"
15:58,660;16:02,580;"And they're talking about"
16:02,580;16:19,920;"Let's see here. We go here's a little bit d"
16:19,920;16:24,220;"In the context of Edward's history of bad clock management, the just lost a possibly crucial timeout."
16:24,220;16:28,980;"When the Rams scored two plays later, Deirdorf tried to justify his praise of Edward's decision"
16:28,980;16:32,260;"by saying that Edward's made the call because he sensed this coming."
16:32,260;16:33,360;"Huh?"
16:33,360;16:36,820;"And it just goes on and on."
16:36,820;16:42,960;"Well, in this game, I had to tell this partner, I love it when you talk geometry to me."
16:42,960;16:44,960;"Oh, we'll get to some quotes."
16:44,960;16:45,780;"That's funny."
16:45,780;16:47,880;"Yes, I got."
16:47,880;16:48,580;"I got here's."
16:49,220;16:51,460;"Here's the payoff."
16:51,460;16:53,420;"Then came a real head scratcher."
16:53,420;16:56,540;"Jeff Wilkins lined up for the 31-yard game-winning field goal"
16:56,540;16:59,580;"for St. Louis at a distance from which he rarely misses."
16:59,580;17:02,100;"Still, the disappointed deer-door said,"
17:02,100;17:03,820;"""I would have tried for the touchdown."
17:03,820;17:05,740;"Touchdowns are sure things with this offense."""
17:05,740;17:07,420;"This is an overtime, by the way."
17:07,420;17:09,380;"- It's over time."
17:09,380;17:10,460;"- Yeah."
17:10,460;17:11,300;"- That's a bad--"
17:11,300;17:13,780;"- Before you, everyone gets a possession, too."
17:13,780;17:14,620;"- Right, right."
17:14,620;17:16,460;"So it's first score wins."
17:16,460;17:17,300;"- That's bad."
17:18,700;17:24,860;"Yeah. But he, uh, he did love Charlie Weiss's, uh, the direct snap to fall."
17:24,860;17:29,580;"It was, uh, Charlie Weiss has gone crazy and Charlie Weiss is unleashed."
17:29,580;17:36,580;"Went on about that. Um, on a, this one was actually pretty good on a, I think it was"
17:36,580;17:40,380;"like a, they, they measured the first down and it wasn't."
17:40,380;17:43,740;"And he said he's about two Jimmy Dean short of my first down here."
17:43,740;17:45,900;"What does that mean?"
17:47,180;17:49,280;"I think Jimmy Deans are those sausages, right?"
17:49,280;17:50,080;"Yeah."
17:50,080;17:51,180;"Okay."
17:51,180;17:52,280;"They're all close."
17:52,280;17:56,180;"But then they showed Teddy Bruski going to locker room with"
17:56,180;18:01,280;"like wooziness and neck injuries and neck issues and he didn't return."
18:01,280;18:06,980;"And Deirdoff says, Oh, he might have gone in for a Bruski, which seems"
18:06,980;18:08,080;"Yeah."
18:08,080;18:11,080;"It's a professional guy who's getting his head looked at for a"
18:11,080;18:12,280;"possible concussion."
18:12,280;18:14,180;"Yeah."
18:14,180;18:16,780;"Well, it's not even a weird or a relax."
18:16,780;18:20,140;"not even a way. You know what, Andy? You could you could use a"
18:20,140;18:25,620;"Bruce key. All right. Chill out. Bruce key. No, this is my first"
18:25,620;18:30,580;"time I get to go into fucking Dan fucking Deardorf. Oh, Dick"
18:30,580;18:38,100;"Ember was worse. What did he do? What did he say? Well, I know"
18:38,100;18:42,580;"of his racist, but he seems to assume that all Patriots wide"
18:42,580;18:48,900;"receivers look the same. He was confusing David Patton and Donald Hayes multiple times."
18:48,900;18:53,700;"Yeah. That's understandable. Yeah, because they're, you know, one's five foot six,"
18:53,700;18:57,700;"another one's like six foot four. That makes a lot of sense. Yeah, but the numbers aren't even"
18:57,700;19:02,420;"anywhere close either. He also called those team, those wide receivers, they all look the same."
19:02,420;19:09,060;"I guess so. And he did that with all of, he got every single one wrong with a different wide"
19:09,060;19:16,060;"wide receiver. It's pretty impressive. He liked calling people David Patton. And then he"
19:16,060;19:20,500;"couldn't quite understand how much yardage was needed for a first down. He struggled"
19:20,500;19:25,740;"with this all day, but my favorite was at the beginning of the game where it's, I think,"
19:25,740;19:30,940;"the Patriots ran for 13 yards and on first down. He's like, ""Oh, it looks like he has"
19:30,940;19:35,580;"nearly enough for a first down."" And he does on a 13-yard game."
19:35,580;19:38,100;"Well, he's resaling up in the box."
19:38,100;19:40,860;"He's up in the box, Andy."
19:40,860;19:44,260;"No, if you ever watched a game that I am, I was even further away."
19:44,260;19:45,820;"I was watching from TV."
19:45,820;19:48,740;"So he's used to the metric system."
19:48,740;19:51,780;"So yards and all that can get confusing."
19:51,780;19:54,980;"What about when he called lawyer Maloya former jet?"
19:54,980;19:59,460;"That wasn't good."
19:59,460;20:00,780;"How do you fuck that up?"
20:00,780;20:01,740;"I don't know."
20:01,740;20:03,700;"He's probably taking a Victor Green, right?"
20:03,860;20:06,200;"No, it was right after Victor Green's pick six."
20:06,200;20:09,180;"He's like, and he comes back and gets a bunch of congratulations"
20:09,180;20:10,660;"from the former players."
20:10,660;20:11,700;"I've had a lot of them a while."
20:11,700;20:12,860;"I was not the former jet."
20:12,860;20:15,660;"Yeah, I was like, no way."
20:15,660;20:17,540;"I had to Google it while sitting there watching the game."
20:17,540;20:18,580;"I was like, yeah, thank God."
20:18,580;20:19,580;"Oof."
20:19,580;20:20,580;"Nope."
20:20,580;20:22,940;"Oh, he liked he liked to confuse Kevin Faulkner"
20:22,940;20:25,980;"and to one Smith to did that a bunch."
20:25,980;20:30,660;"Um, and then he also called the team the bellittaries,"
20:30,660;20:32,660;"Patriots"
20:32,660;20:34,660;"At the half"
20:34,660;20:42,220;"Wait, what that's uh, is that a pun? I don't think so. I don't know it was tough to tell ya"
20:42,220;20:45,540;"I don't I don't let Terry right"
20:45,540;20:51,340;"What why would you combine those two names? I think you just it's like bringela"
20:53,860;20:54,860;"military"
20:54,860;21:00,220;"Well, he's talking about Brady being a bachelor judging the miss USA pageant - oh, yeah"
21:00,220;21:02,220;"I thought that was a little risque"
21:02,220;21:06,740;"Yeah, well there was a lot of football not football in this yeah Fox and then house sort of thing"
21:06,740;21:10,140;"I think as you guys want to watch us a little slice of that"
21:10,140;21:14,020;"Yeah, yeah, all right, so"
21:14,020;21:21,540;"The this was I think it's all Dick Nberg. He's a he's a foxy man himself"
21:22,700;21:27,260;"But he was talking about our favorite wide receiver on this this program"
21:27,260;21:34,180;"He said well look at what has been the hallmark of Troy Brown's career going up stretching out exposing himself"
21:34,180;21:43,340;"Football not football well, it's Troy Brown. So it's definitely a man lives breathes eats sleeps football"
21:43,340;21:47,340;"Then how I don't say how it could be why is he talking about expo sounds like some"
21:48,300;21:53,900;"Sounds like some locker room talk to me. Oh, it could be locker room talk. You're right. Just boys being boys"
21:53,900;22:00,060;"Yeah, just grab them by the football. I got it. I guess that's part of football"
22:00,060;22:06,980;"All right, and then they were both going back and forth over something I don't even remember what but"
22:06,980;22:12,460;"You'd end it with I didn't think you'd get it in this quick. Oh, I was like give him a dig about Michigan"
22:13,220;22:18,460;"Losing oh, yeah, I think you're right. Yeah. Yeah, you think it's about the dig and not about something else"
22:18,460;22:24,220;"You don't know they were they were they were having they were having sex on on air"
22:24,220;22:32,320;"All right, good and then I think this one was actually our boy dear door"
22:32,320;22:38,660;"He was fascinated the entire game with ball handling"
22:40,220;22:45,340;"He especially boomer size. He said boomer size and was a magnificent ball handler and ball faker"
22:45,340;22:49,500;"Um"
22:49,500;22:54,700;"I don't I understand ball handling ball faking. I think might need some explanation"
22:54,700;23:01,180;"You have you ever heard someone call like another person's hands their cock feelers"
23:01,180;23:06,540;"No, I can't get your dirty cock feelers off me"
23:08,620;23:12,060;"I have now. That's a daniism."
23:12,060;23:16,560;"That sounds or like your mouth, your mouth is your cocktaster."
23:16,560;23:19,780;"Stop running your cocktaster."
23:19,780;23:23,980;"Just dandy. You know, it's got a dirty mind."
23:23,980;23:26,940;"It does. The ball, your ball handlers."
23:26,940;23:31,060;"But now Tom Brady has also become a very adept ball handler."
23:31,060;23:33,300;"I think that I mean, that part's true."
23:33,300;23:35,580;"We already talked about that. Yeah."
23:35,580;23:37,500;"I suppose that is football, isn't it? In that regard."
23:37,700;23:39,220;"Yeah. What about boomers though?"
23:39,220;23:42,740;"Was he a good ball handler in the same way or was a different kind of ball?"
23:42,740;23:43,580;"You hear those balls."
23:43,580;23:48,900;"That's all I had."
23:48,900;23:50,220;"I just wanted to bring that back in."
23:50,220;23:54,980;"In the morium of our, our mic."
23:54,980;23:59,740;"And then you'd have another 20 years of commentating games."
23:59,740;24:01,380;"Yeah."
24:01,380;24:04,500;"You still didn't you just get replaced or something like that too?"
24:04,500;24:05,300;"Yeah."
24:05,300;24:06,620;"I was damn felt."
24:06,620;24:07,620;"I don't know how he had."
24:07,620;24:10,980;"such a long career. Which one do I do you"
24:10,980;24:15,780;"door fount of our for all dandero he"
24:15,780;24:18,420;"was easily my least favorite and I"
24:18,420;24:21,060;"think I think it will get worse but"
24:21,060;24:24,540;"for now that's just the the intro the"
24:24,540;24:29,300;"dandero door for me motherfucker he"
24:29,300;24:30,820;"is in the Hall of Fame you sons of"
24:30,820;24:34,340;"bitches do you door yeah yeah remember"
24:34,340;24:36,900;"I told you that for yeah but I didn't"
24:36,900;24:41,140;"one look it up because I thought you might be kidding. No, he's a Hall of Famer son of a bitch."
24:41,140;24:48,260;"For what? So is Brent Jones. Oh, yeah, but that was if you do something, something else though."
24:48,260;24:51,220;"And that wasn't like the real Hall of Fame. Jewish players Hall of Fame."
24:51,220;24:56,420;"Yeah, something like that. I was like NCAA Hall of Fame or whatever his college was."
24:56,420;25:05,460;"Oh, you got me all riled up again. Thanks, Craig. All right, let's get back to the game."
25:05,460;25:08,280;"You can relax Andy bring me back Steve bring me back"
25:08,280;25:11,380;"Talking about the second half"
25:11,380;25:18,480;"More of the same first possession for the Jets blind side blitz from Tabaki scoop and score"
25:18,480;25:21,140;"With a tomahawk chop"
25:21,140;25:26,220;"Yeah, I'll say that I think so and like I don't they just kept beating them down"
25:26,220;25:32,940;"Their biggest play and I think they're leading Russia for the day for the Jets was their fucking punter"
25:32,940;25:35,340;"That was gonna be my best"
25:35,340;25:47,220;"Yeah, it was also their first it was their first first down of the game. It was in the"
25:47,220;25:55,940;"first quarter. Yeah, it was their first first down of the game. Yeah, he was. So, and their"
25:55,940;25:58,740;"favorites. Think about that. Yeah."
25:58,740;26:03,520;"They were favorites at home what talk about a shit stomping"
26:03,520;26:09,860;"So imagine buying tickets to that game. Oh, it was raining - oh, yeah"
26:09,860;26:13,160;"That's one thing that"
26:13,160;26:16,100;"That's one thing you don't have to worry about as a patch fan is like"
26:16,100;26:23,600;"Am I gonna pay a lot of money for tickets and show up and just be miserable the whole time? Yeah"
26:23,600;26:26,900;"I was thinking that close games, but"
26:27,460;26:31,540;"Yeah, like how often do the Patriots ever even get blown out at home"
26:31,540;26:39,940;"Well, yeah, especially at home. Hey legit can't think of one. Yeah losing by two scores at home. I don't know even"
26:39,940;26:46,340;"Even like just in general like how often I don't know how often does that even happen like that?"
26:46,340;26:49,460;"Yeah"
26:49,460;26:56,020;"Yeah, I think I can think of a I think what was the Ray Rice Ravens playoff game that was"
26:56,460;26:58,460;"Yeah, that's a good one."
26:58,460;26:59,460;"Good one."
26:59,460;27:03,860;"That was an opening night against the opening night against the Chiefs."
27:03,860;27:05,460;"Was that like 2000?"
27:05,460;27:06,460;"That was pretty bad."
27:06,460;27:07,460;"Oh, yep."
27:07,460;27:13,460;"18, or when what's his face went nuts on us?"
27:13,460;27:14,460;"Creme Hunt."
27:14,460;27:16,460;"Creme Hunt."
27:16,460;27:17,460;"Yeah."
27:17,460;27:25,460;"There was that was a 2009 playoff game where they lost to Sanchez and Rex Ryan."
27:25,460;27:27,860;"and Rex Ryan. Oh, yeah. Yeah."
27:27,860;27:32,260;"I went to that game. It was fucking miserable."
27:32,260;27:37,300;"Yeah, I watched that with her. Let's see."
27:37,300;27:41,580;"What's probably good launch into my other stat here."
27:41,580;27:43,740;"They said at the beginning,"
27:43,740;27:47,140;"if you notice the Jets were wearing their road whites."
27:47,140;27:51,980;"And I guess they must have changed your name to include New York Jets this year"
27:51,980;27:53,340;"as opposed to just Jets."
27:53,940;27:58,780;"Oh, because they were still under 500 at Giant Stadium."
27:58,780;28:01,140;"I think it was called back then what MetLife is now."
28:01,140;28:05,060;"It's just like a loser approach."
28:05,060;28:07,860;"Oh, we had a pretty good record last year."
28:07,860;28:13,740;"That's where I rode to our own home that we play is named after a different team."
28:13,740;28:18,740;"I bet there's still not about 500 in that stadium because they're the fucking jets and they suck."
28:18,740;28:22,420;"A place is a job to it's a job."
28:22,420;28:23,860;"It's no character there."
28:23,860;28:28,300;"Hey, have you been there Connor to MetLife?"
28:28,300;28:29,460;"To MetLife?"
28:29,460;28:31,180;"No, I haven't met old lance."
28:31,180;28:35,900;"Oh, it's probably driven by a driven path."
28:35,900;28:40,300;"Yeah, God, it's just gross looking over there."
28:40,300;28:42,700;"It's just like a swamp, huh?"
28:42,700;28:45,380;"It's middle and nowhere."
28:45,380;28:48,020;"It's just like there's no character."
28:48,020;28:49,020;"It's disgusting."
28:49,020;28:50,500;"There's nothing around it."
28:50,500;28:52,140;"Is it like an industrial park?"
28:52,140;28:58,780;"Yeah. And it's like, it's literally just surrounded. It's surrounded by"
28:58,780;29:04,820;"metal ants and it's just gross and barren. Yeah. And they can even 500"
29:04,820;29:06,260;"there because there's a bunch of pusties."
29:06,260;29:11,300;"I watch every second of this game. I loved it. Yeah."
29:11,300;29:12,300;"You know who else loved it?"
29:12,300;29:16,780;"Bill Belichick. Yes. The amount of times I show him on the signs and"
29:16,780;29:20,260;"he said that's smirk on his face. You know, the one that he had when he"
29:20,260;29:23,620;"He was running the clock down against the Jets this past year."
29:23,620;29:27,460;"Unlike that, the clock thing that."
29:27,460;29:28,100;"Yeah."
29:28,100;29:28,420;"Yeah."
29:28,420;29:30,220;"He's on the wrinkle in the rules."
29:30,220;29:30,620;"Yeah."
29:30,620;29:34,140;"And he had that just like shooting in grid on his face, like just just like a half"
29:34,140;29:35,140;"a smirk."
29:35,140;29:37,580;"He had that on this entire second half."
29:37,580;29:40,380;"His best one was right after the Kevin Falk touchdown."
29:40,380;29:41,180;"Yeah."
29:41,180;29:42,460;"Which was his first of his career."
29:42,460;29:45,260;"Really?"
29:45,260;29:48,500;"I got a nice because he saw a fall keeping the ball."
29:48,500;29:49,940;"I'm going to say that's his first touchdown."
29:49,940;29:54,020;"Oh, well, he was the starting running back in 2000."
29:54,020;29:56,660;"So I would have hoped he'd scored at least one rushing touchdown then."
29:56,660;29:58,340;"Huh."
29:58,340;30:00,220;"So maybe it's been a while."
30:00,220;30:04,020;"I think some, some of these just check his stats."
30:04,020;30:05,540;"All right."
30:05,540;30:06,260;"Stat checker."
30:06,260;30:07,700;"Check it."
30:07,700;30:10,300;"And while you're doing that, I want to talk."
30:10,300;30:11,100;"Yeah."
30:11,100;30:12,620;"You're this fucking stack guy."
30:12,620;30:14,340;"Dude, a mean to mistake."
30:14,340;30:16,340;"Oh, he's still eating it."
30:16,340;30:18,900;"Yeah, it's a big to mistake."
30:19,140;30:19,980;"I thought you could eat."
30:19,980;30:22,620;"It's a little bird."
30:22,620;30:24,580;"Don't talk to me about eating Andy."
30:24,580;30:26,660;"I'm just saying I can eat."
30:26,660;30:27,780;"I would have finished that by now."
30:27,780;30:29,140;"I'm looking it up."
30:29,140;30:31,620;"He's scored."
30:31,620;30:32,340;"Definitely not."
30:32,340;30:32,860;"I don't know."
30:32,860;30:33,340;"First touchdown."
30:33,340;30:34,340;"No."
30:34,340;30:35,820;"Whoops."
30:35,820;30:37,140;"It was his seventh touchdown."
30:37,140;30:37,620;"All right."
30:37,620;30:39,100;"First of this year, though."
30:39,100;30:40,780;"He definitely kept the ball."
30:40,780;30:41,460;"Yeah."
30:41,460;30:42,460;"Yeah."
30:42,460;30:44,140;"I wonder if he kept all of them."
30:44,140;30:45,940;"I mean, it's not like he was scoring a shit on a touch."
30:45,940;30:47,500;"I mean, it's all right."
30:48,300;30:49,900;"Maybe just because they beat the Jets, who knows?"
30:49,900;30:55,020;"But I want to go back to the the fake punt because I think that drive was"
30:55,020;30:57,380;"my turning point of this game."
30:57,380;31:00,540;"Because the Jets went three and out yet again."
31:00,540;31:04,260;"And then they did the fake punt, which converted their first, first down."
31:04,260;31:07,740;"And then I think it was a very next play."
31:07,740;31:10,940;"They hit a big play to Santana Moss, the drill."
31:10,940;31:11,780;"Yeah."
31:11,780;31:14,300;"To the Patriots 20 yard line, like, oh, shit, they might actually score some"
31:14,300;31:14,780;"points here."
31:14,780;31:16,500;"And it's like 20 to nothing."
31:16,500;31:19,580;"And so, you know, they scored touchdown, they're down two touchdowns and this is all of a sudden a game."
31:19,580;31:23,340;"The very next play was Victor Green's 90 yard pick six."
31:23,340;31:26,900;"And the same Victor Green who"
31:26,900;31:33,700;"was the leading tackler for the Jets the year before and they just like didn't want him back, I guess."
31:33,700;31:34,700;"Yeah, I don't know."
31:34,700;31:36,180;"He left on real bad terms."
31:36,180;31:38,180;"They were definitely talking about that."
31:38,180;31:39,860;"I didn't know that much about it."
31:39,860;31:40,980;"No, me neither."
31:40,980;31:44,780;"Did either you con or Greg, do you either of you guys know anything about that?"
31:44,780;31:45,620;"No."
31:45,620;31:49,760;"What did it again the victor greet Agree to green saga? Oh?"
31:49,760;31:53,620;"No, I"
31:53,620;31:58,660;"Probably back when it was going on but it had escaped me. Yeah"
31:58,660;32:05,460;"But he retired as a jet I guess so couldn't have been that bad and that was like two years after"
32:05,460;32:09,740;"New England one year in New Orleans, and then he is gone"
32:10,580;32:17,340;"Yeah, but he like sign signed like a one day contract with the Jets so he could retire as a jet so"
32:17,340;32:20,900;"but interestingly the wiki Wikipedia"
32:20,900;32:23,540;"didn't even have"
32:23,540;32:26,900;"Didn't have him as like, you know, they do like the"
32:26,900;32:34,260;"Editions and subtractions. He wasn't on there. No, it wasn't was he which I sounds like there's a conspiracy afoot"
32:36,060;32:43,100;"somebody's been washing the Wikipedia's maybe we should update the Wikipedia's"
32:43,100;32:48,100;"but also in the last game the one that forced and recover the fumble on"
32:48,100;32:51,580;"Jerome Bettis - so he's had himself a hell of a start this season he probably"
32:51,580;32:55,500;"drops off this is his last interception of his career yeah well he was kind of"
32:55,500;32:59,620;"like the third safety on this team because it was still lawyer Maloya and"
32:59,620;33:04,420;"Tabaki Jones were the starters but the pages were at certain points running"
33:04,420;33:09,340;"three safety sets out there, which I don't think you will ever see."
33:09,340;33:12,580;"Well, you might see again, just we just going to light out now."
33:12,580;33:13,900;"Yeah."
33:13,900;33:19,220;"I think maybe to counter the whole spread offense and the RPO, you'll"
33:19,220;33:22,500;"seem like a lighter, but still got as a console."
33:22,500;33:23,580;"That's drafted to safety."
33:23,580;33:24,780;"You're the second round pick."
33:24,780;33:26,860;"Yeah, that's true."
33:26,860;33:31,420;"And they drafted a bunch of like hybrid linebacker guys."
33:31,420;33:32,580;"See, like outside linebackers."
33:32,580;33:33,580;"Same idea."
33:33,900;33:38,240;"But yeah, the Patriots starting to safely back then."
33:38,240;33:39,200;"Absolutely nasty."
33:39,200;33:44,000;"I feel like they are the whole first half of this dynasty."
33:44,000;33:45,000;"Yeah."
33:45,000;33:48,600;"Could you go from lawyer and lawyer moving on directly to?"
33:48,600;33:49,920;"Well, maybe the whole dynasty."
33:49,920;33:55,520;"Could you go from lawyer and lawyer to Ronnie Harrison to Pat Chung, right?"
33:55,520;33:57,760;"Yeah, just going to throw Pat Chung in there."
33:57,760;34:00,080;"I mean, you move McCordy back."
34:00,080;34:02,320;"You don't think Pat Chung's like, make safety."
34:02,320;34:10,320;"you could say Rodney Harrison and Pat Chung which one of these doesn't belong. Yeah, I agree with"
34:10,320;34:20,580;"him. Yeah, fucking right. Yeah, he got to go. McCordy. McCordy's free safety. He would be the"
34:20,580;34:27,320;"Tabaki Jones in this situation. Love it. Tabaki's been a nice surprise though, watching these"
34:27,320;34:32,960;"games again. Yeah. He's a physical player. Yeah, he was he's a"
34:32,960;34:37,840;"lot bigger than I remembered him to big big big boy. Yep. Yeah,"
34:37,840;34:42,200;"that dude can lay the wood and has the best name on the team. He"
34:42,200;34:46,360;"does. I'm still sad our sister didn't name her first born"
34:46,360;34:51,720;"to Bucky. It's not been great. No, she's got chances. Oh, yeah,"
34:51,720;34:54,800;"she does. Yeah, she's got another one coming. So hopefully"
34:54,800;34:55,960;"that'll be to lucky."
34:55,960;34:59,800;"Or is we got an update on the tuna steak."
34:59,800;35:02,200;"Is it finished yet?"
35:02,200;35:03,680;"Kelly didn't finish hers."
35:03,680;35:04,560;"I got it."
35:04,560;35:06,320;"I got another half a steak baby."
35:06,320;35:08,720;"Let's go with going overtime."
35:08,720;35:10,520;"I'm just fucking through the steak."
35:10,520;35:14,360;"Yeah."
35:14,360;35:16,800;"You got to need a new stack guy."
35:16,800;35:19,440;"I think we already did."
35:19,440;35:20,760;"Yeah."
35:20,760;35:23,480;"Connor, you're the new stack guy."
35:24,680;35:28,240;"What? No, no, no, that's that's not a good idea."
35:28,240;35:32,320;"So what could I do?"
35:32,320;35:33,800;"Now, what are you bringing the table here, Connor?"
35:33,800;35:35,040;"You're good looks."
35:35,040;35:40,280;"Um, I told you, I'm color commentary."
35:40,280;35:48,480;"I provide keen insight into specific, you know, plays within the game, nuances."
35:48,480;35:54,600;"Um, Steve kind of stole my thunder, bringing up Brady's, uh, reverse play"
35:54,600;36:01,720;"action play I was gonna do a pretty big deep dive into that but he kind of ruined"
36:01,720;36:09,320;"it like he does a lot of things so yeah let's circle around let's circle back to"
36:09,320;36:17,200;"the play action then because I was I guess it wasn't I guess it wasn't like the"
36:17,200;36:21,760;"deepest of dives right I think it's something that's oh that's I think that's"
36:21,760;36:29,820;"That's something that he's always been a lead at and it's always played in his favor throughout"
36:29,820;36:30,820;"his career."
36:30,820;36:35,700;"He's just been an incredible sleight of hand."
36:35,700;36:36,900;"Not just to play actions."
36:36,900;36:44,340;"You're talking about the direct snaps to Kevin Falk."
36:44,340;36:49,100;"He's just always been good at the game within the game."
36:49,100;36:52,400;"Do we know if that's something he was good at in college too?"
36:52,400;36:54,760;"Or is this something he learned when he got to the NFL?"
36:54,760;36:56,920;"I don't actually know the answer to that."
36:56,920;36:57,760;"- I don't know."
36:57,760;37:00,600;"But there is something-- - Me either."
37:00,600;37:03,360;"- You know, like that feeling when you're watching a play though,"
37:03,360;37:06,120;"and he does like a hard play action,"
37:06,120;37:08,600;"and then he spins his head around"
37:08,600;37:11,040;"and like immediately goes off his back foot"
37:11,040;37:12,480;"and just whips one."
37:12,480;37:14,040;"- And moves you from the five-yard line."
37:14,040;37:16,240;"- Before the camera even pans, you're like,"
37:16,240;37:17,960;"that's a completion."
37:17,960;37:21,160;"to touch. There's like, there's no better feeling than watching him do that."
37:21,160;37:23,660;"Like spin around and not waste any time. Just whoop."
37:23,660;37:27,940;"So I've gone through and I've been documenting all of his touchdowns as a"
37:27,940;37:32,400;"patriot, a lot of touchdown throws. And the amount of times he does that from the"
37:32,400;37:37,140;"five yard line, we're just, yeah, he does. He turns his back and bends over like"
37:37,140;37:41,080;"in half as he's pretending to hand the ball off. And then just turns around and"
37:41,080;37:45,120;"whips it basically at the goal post and just hopes that his receiver is there."
37:46,040;37:47,800;"It's textbook at this point."
37:47,800;37:49,880;"There's probably like 40 or 50 of them."
37:49,880;37:56,440;"Granted, I've had his 600 touchdowns, but still like it's that is, I think the"
37:56,440;37:58,760;"textbook Patriots offensive play."
37:58,760;38:01,880;"Like they ran it for years and it was unstoppable."
38:01,880;38:09,160;"And like watching on TV, I feel like with Brady, you can tell before you can see"
38:09,160;38:12,760;"the receivers, whether it's going to be complete or not by his like body language"
38:12,760;38:15,760;"as he throws it, you know, if he's sitting there patting it."
38:15,760;38:19,600;"Happy feet you can like oh, he's throwing this away. Yeah, you know"
38:19,600;38:24,920;"But there's certain ones where he's like zip you like there's no way. That's not good"
38:24,920;38:28,760;"It's really as he's planting the back foot. It's coming out. Oh, yeah, he's yeah"
38:28,760;38:34,160;"Definitely doesn't doesn't have the guys covered. You know it's gonna be completion and that speaks to his like"
38:34,160;38:40,920;"Preparation too of like he's a clinical player of if it's not there. I don't I don't force it"
38:41,360;38:47,680;"But if it is there I'm making that play, you know, oh absolutely and you just wonder how many times he's practical that"
38:47,680;38:51,840;"That whole like not not even just the play action"
38:51,840;38:55,840;"But even like the the jump twist that he did on the direct snap"
38:55,840;38:59,920;"Can he literally could just stand there and there wasn't there one play that he"
38:59,920;39:02,840;"Pretended to catch the ball and drop back for a pass"
39:02,840;39:08,800;"When they ran that and it was like they ran that as a like a draw play right up the middle instead of like a sweep and"
39:09,520;39:14,140;"And the entire like defensive line bit on it too because I thought he was actually dropping back for a pass"
39:14,140;39:20,600;"You don't see that and any other quarterbacks. I don't think I've never seen anybody else do that where I thought oh"
39:20,600;39:22,700;"Delps just tape tape Manning"
39:22,700;39:28,460;"Peyton Manning used to get blown a lot for his play action if I remember correctly"
39:28,460;39:35,680;"Well, they only ever ran that one stretch play and then he would play action off of it. Yeah, but he was good at it, right?"
39:35,680;39:38,800;"Yeah, that's true correct comment for everybody listening"
39:38,800;39:41,580;"He didn't like Peyton Minh didn't blow it."
39:41,580;39:42,980;"He got blown."
39:42,980;39:46,080;"- Yeah, by like media and fans."
39:46,080;39:46,920;"Right, yeah."
39:46,920;39:51,840;"Brady, which is to say that I'm not positive"
39:51,840;39:53,680;"that he is that much better."
39:53,680;39:57,420;"'Cause it might be a manufactured, you know."
39:57,420;39:58,580;"- Fair enough."
39:58,580;39:59,920;"Yeah."
39:59,920;40:00,760;"- I think it was pretty good though."
40:00,760;40:02,320;"- I think he would also do the,"
40:02,320;40:04,960;"he would also like walk away as if he was calling"
40:04,960;40:08,080;"an audible as the direct snap happened."
40:08,080;40:09,560;"Which I think you do a couple of times."
40:09,560;40:12,680;"Dude, I sneaky love Peyton now that he's retired."
40:12,680;40:13,520;"Me too."
40:13,520;40:17,600;"I don't know if I'd say love him, but I definitely have much more respect for him now."
40:17,600;40:18,640;"I don't know before."
40:18,640;40:20,800;"I, I, he's adorable."
40:20,800;40:23,480;"Did you, did you hear about what they're doing?"
40:23,480;40:24,400;"Like golf tournament?"
40:24,400;40:26,440;"No. Oh, yeah. Yeah."
40:26,440;40:30,960;"Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning versus Brady and Mickelson."
40:30,960;40:34,600;"That's fucking awesome."
40:34,600;40:35,600;"Yeah."
40:36,160;40:40,760;"Yeah, they had like a they had a video chat today."
40:40,760;40:42,960;"Yeah, Peyton went on."
40:42,960;40:47,960;"Peyton went on today as in for the folks listening, May 7th 2020."
40:47,960;40:52,760;"Peyton went on a tangent today."
40:52,760;40:56,260;"I guess it's getting played in like Tampa or Florida somewhere."
40:56,260;40:56,860;"Yes."
40:56,860;41:01,760;"And Peyton was like, I wish they I wish we were playing somewhere where they hate"
41:01,760;41:03,160;"you, Tom, like Boston."
41:03,160;41:05,660;"It was so funny."
41:05,660;41:07,660;"Did we say that?"
41:07,660;41:13,700;"We're doing it because Brady was on house arrest so they couldn't do it anywhere else because of all the shit"
41:13,700;41:16,300;"They were yeah, he was like breaking it entering"
41:16,300;41:18,820;"Peyton was like yeah"
41:18,820;41:22,340;"He's like yeah, we got to do it in Florida now since Tom's B&E"
41:22,340;41:26,140;"House arrest he's got the"
41:26,140;41:30,180;"I'm telling you I love him. Hey, hey"
41:30,780;41:32,780;"Yeah, Peyton does it for me now."
41:32,780;41:34,780;"Yeah, his is like commentary."
41:34,780;41:38,780;"He was doing some like, like film review thing."
41:38,780;41:40,780;"I think it was on YouTube or something."
41:40,780;41:41,780;"And it was actually really."

41:43,780;41:44,780;"Yeah."
41:44,780;41:50,780;"And he did it on Tom Brady's overtime drive against the Kansas City Chiefs the other year."
41:50,780;41:56,780;"Oh, are you talking about the details like Kobe does a detail and he'll talk about different."
41:56,780;41:59,780;"It's like an ESPN thing called detail."
41:59,780;42:05,940;"Yeah, my patented one on Tom, but yeah, yeah, it's called detail"
42:05,940;42:09,660;"It was amazing. Call we've done one on like yeah"

44:43,280;44:47,680;"Seven"
44:47,680;44:53,320;"That's the worst part. Oh no, that's the bet. I don't want to play games for a fucking challenge"
44:53,320;44:57,760;"I want to play video games so I can be a goddamn superhero. I got the last time I'll be rest of my life"
44:57,760;45:00,480;"Another one I"

45:34,960;45:40,620;"Oh, yeah, yeah co-op is great again. You're gonna do so what is going on?"
45:40,620;45:45,240;"I'm not a video game guy, but that's weird now"

45:48,360;45:51,360;"It's weird. Thank you, Connor"
45:51,360;45:58,400;"Like I want you just play against each other. We may have to put a place then someone has to play as the Jets right exactly yeah"
45:58,400;46:04,080;"Fuck that and if you both plays a Patriots then the Patriots are gonna lose you don't want that"
46:04,080;46:04,920;"- Yeah."

46:13,360;46:18,360;"like fucking playing the Patriots versus the Jets"
46:18,360;46:22,920;"with your t-shirts over your head."
46:22,920;46:24,760;"Like it just doesn't make any sense."
46:24,760;46:27,280;"- No, I think I'm very similar."
46:27,280;46:29,600;"- Yeah, that's surprisingly accurate actually."
46:29,600;46:32,040;"- Say go home, tell your wife,"
46:32,040;46:35,120;"like babe, babe, I'd be in 73 to nothing."
46:35,120;46:38,780;"Oh, no, she knows to leave the room when I'm doing this."
46:38,780;46:40,100;"You should have seen me."
46:40,100;46:42,200;"Like, oh, now the pants are coming off again."
46:42,200;46:44,560;"Time to go going out."
46:44,560;46:46,380;"I mean, it is revenge porn."
46:46,380;46:46,840;"Yeah."
46:46,840;46:47,640;"That's what I'm saying."
46:47,640;46:51,440;"Andy, are you reading other New York Times article on Dan"
46:51,440;46:51,940;"Dior?"
46:51,940;46:54,980;"My parents were off on back."
46:54,980;46:56,980;"Come on."
46:56,980;46:59,900;"You guys still go to like Jets blogs and just read about how terrible"
46:59,900;47:00,500;"their team is."
47:00,500;47:05,500;"I love the AFC sub-redits on Reddit."
47:05,500;47:07,500;"Oh, I love doing that."
47:07,500;47:10,000;"I mean, the Jets has been a huge thing stuff."
47:10,000;47:12,620;"I like doing it after New York."
47:12,620;47:13,460;"- New York games too."
47:13,460;47:18,220;"- After the Patriots, they're just so salty and beautiful."
47:18,220;47:20,520;"- This team has no direction."
47:20,520;47:21,940;"Everyone sucks."
47:21,940;47:23,780;"The whole front office is bullshit."
47:23,780;47:26,460;"Stamped Arnold's pretty good though."
47:26,460;47:29,540;"- To be fair, that's what the Patriots sub-red is like now."
47:29,540;47:32,700;"Yeah. It is interesting to see."
47:32,700;47:37,980;"It is interesting to see who the fans revolt on with like bad teams and like"
47:37,980;47:41,780;"which players are allowed to be like in their graces."
47:41,780;47:45,020;"And there's always one that they're like, well, you know, you know, who doesn't"
47:45,020;47:46,540;"suck the backup running back."
47:46,540;47:47,460;"Yeah, exactly."
47:47,460;47:47,740;"Yeah."
47:47,740;47:49,220;"It's more playing time."
47:49,220;47:52,420;"Yeah, especially for the bills for some reason, they love their backup running"
47:52,420;47:53,060;"back wherever it is."
47:53,060;47:53,900;"Yeah."
47:53,900;47:58,140;"And then they trade their backup running back or cut their backup running back"
47:58,180;48:02,740;"Danny Woodhead and he goes to the Patriots and turns into a stud."
48:02,740;48:03,940;"Yeah."
48:03,940;48:04,900;"Oh, beautiful."
48:04,900;48:05,660;"God damn."
48:05,660;48:07,540;"That's our segue back into this game."
48:07,540;48:08,860;"I love it."
48:08,860;48:09,460;"All right."
48:09,460;48:09,900;"We just."
48:09,900;48:12,060;"So just give up."
48:12,060;48:14,220;"Here's a no, here's a here's a segue."
48:14,220;48:15,180;"It's speaking of studs."
48:15,180;48:17,620;"Really, McGinnis is finally healthy."
48:17,620;48:23,860;"This is a part of the boss and globe article stuff that I'm reading."
48:23,860;48:26,420;"And it fucking shows."
48:26,740;48:30,220;"He was ever we had three batted balls."
48:30,220;48:33,180;"One of them was on fourth down."
48:33,180;48:35,580;"So blew a fourth down version."
48:35,580;48:39,940;"They also had an offensive pass and a fairance called"
48:39,940;48:41,940;"like for him, like on him,"
48:41,940;48:43,860;"because he dropped back in coverage."
48:43,860;48:44,940;"And I think it was like Wayne Curbetta,"
48:44,940;48:46,580;"or something like that."
48:46,580;48:48,900;"Tried to light him up as the pass was in the air"
48:48,900;48:50,500;"and got called for an offensive pass and fairs,"
48:50,500;48:51,340;"which is great."
48:51,340;48:56,020;"And then they were trying to block him on a screenplay"
48:56,020;48:59,200;"And he got up so quickly that as Curtis Martin caught the ball,"
48:59,200;49:01,800;"William and me Guinness was already tackling him."
49:01,800;49:04,840;"He was like, might be the worst screen I've ever seen."
49:04,840;49:08,360;"It was bad, but any also had a sack in this game."
49:08,360;49:12,080;"I think he was the one that sacked Chad Pennington."
49:12,080;49:15,580;"I think Pennington was in, at this point, I play so."
49:15,580;49:20,040;"There was a few sacks, but he was, I mean, we talked about it a little bit"
49:20,040;49:24,460;"last week too, where he was just kind of like, it was like watching Gronk play"
49:24,460;49:28,300;"offense was watching really make it into play defense. He's just like waiting through people."
49:28,300;49:33,820;"Like he's playing with with like kindergarteners and you're just like walking through them kind"
49:33,820;49:38,460;"of pushing them out of the way just so he can get to the bulk air. He just he was unstoppable."
49:38,460;49:43,420;"He gets my game. Who? He gets like lost in the shop. Let's say against Steve."
49:43,420;49:49,980;"Willie. We got your high tower. That's a tough one. Willie for me."
49:49,980;49:53,740;"Willie came to mind at first but you think about that playing in the Super Bowl."
49:54,300;49:54,800;"Yeah."
49:54,800;49:56,000;"It's true."
49:56,000;50:00,000;"We had that big stop against the Colts in the playoffs."
50:00,000;50:01,700;"Yeah."
50:01,700;50:02,660;"No, it wasn't the playoffs."
50:02,660;50:03,160;"Yeah."
50:03,160;50:03,820;"That's a good one."
50:03,820;50:06,260;"Put down stop against the Colts."
50:06,260;50:07,140;"In Indianapolis?"
50:07,140;50:08,300;"Yeah, that's a big one too."
50:08,300;50:08,800;"Yeah."
50:08,800;50:09,940;"Connor, who you got?"
50:09,940;50:11,420;"McGinnister high tower."
50:11,420;50:13,140;"Oh, it's so tough."
50:13,140;50:15,300;"I was just about to-- didn't Willie--"
50:15,300;50:16,860;"I forget what Super Bowl was."
50:16,860;50:19,980;"He had a game-- or maybe it was against Peyton"
50:19,980;50:23,060;"in an AFC Championship game."
50:23,060;50:27,820;"High towers just got a couple of those big,"
50:27,820;50:30,420;"like huge plays in the Super Bowls."
50:30,420;50:35,420;"The stuff on Marshon that led to the Malcolm Butler"
50:35,420;50:37,140;"interception."
50:37,140;50:42,140;"And then the strip of Matt Ryan"
50:42,140;50:46,620;"that got recovered, that a part of that comeback"
50:46,620;50:48,940;"against the Falcons."
50:48,940;51:01,540;"He's just got some huge plays, but I think Willie was probably I think Willie's got a chance to go to the man, maybe not the regular Hall of Fame, but"
51:01,540;51:09,300;"Fuck God, that's already in the Patriots. I'm going Willie. I'm going Willie. I'm going Willie."
51:10,380;51:15,380;"Willing me get his hat set the record for those player playoff sacks to really?"
51:15,380;51:17,820;"Yeah, he's got 16 sacks in the playoffs."
51:17,820;51:21,380;"He also has most second game with four and a half."
51:21,380;51:24,140;"Four and a half sacks in a playoff game."
51:24,140;51:27,300;"I think it was against the, uh, the Jaguars."
51:27,300;51:29,380;"Go ahead."
51:29,380;51:30,380;"You set the records both."
51:30,380;51:31,980;"Dude, he's standing quite a."
51:31,980;51:36,180;"1994 to 2008, man."
51:36,180;51:37,380;"He had a great career."
51:37,380;51:38,820;"He did."
51:39,820;51:46,500;"I thought he was like done after that third Super Bowl. Yeah. Yeah, but no, he he's still"
51:46,500;51:52,580;"had a he's just a cool son of a bitch too. You know, like, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know,"
51:52,580;51:58,620;"that's some some personal have that like cool factor. Yeah, Tyler has it. He's got that"
51:58,620;52:05,580;"swagger. Yeah. So Willie McGinnis had the injured McGinnis makes crucial play. Yeah,"
52:05,580;52:09,460;"2000 in the 2003 AFC playoffs against 18"
52:09,460;52:12,580;"Stop"
52:12,580;52:20,120;"Stop Edger and James on the one-yard line. I remember that play. That wasn't a playoff. Was it I thought that was just"
52:20,120;52:22,900;"Was it? Oh"
52:22,900;52:29,220;"It carries a significant AFC play AFC playoff seedings"
52:29,220;52:32,180;"Yeah, it was like first place in the AC"
52:32,180;52:39,640;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it was it was in Indianapolis too. Yeah. That was yeah, we'll get him on what we should start tweeting"
52:39,640;52:41,640;"So much recency by"
52:41,640;52:50,200;"So much recency bias obviously with high tower. I mean, he's made some huge plays. Yeah, I think Willie was just better"
52:50,200;52:58,420;"In his prime was more dominant. Well, he issue with high tower is like I don't know. I feel like he's always sort of injured or he was there for a while"
52:59,220;53:04,180;"That's true. Yeah, I mean Ironman, you know, like that's not dude like"
53:04,180;53:11,460;"It's actually I'm looking at stats. It's from like this season on he's just a absolute rock"
53:11,460;53:18,380;"16 16 16 16 14 13 14 games to close out his career"
53:18,380;53:19,860;"That"
53:19,860;53:24,300;"Yeah, hi tower could never he's had so many injuries the chest"
53:25,220;53:29,300;"He's only a one year of all 16 games"
53:29,300;53:34,180;"But he's got high-powering good years"
53:34,180;53:44,860;"I mean high-towers only played seven years to Willie's 12 in New England, so you know, it's a slow time. Yeah, yeah, I think at this point I"
53:44,860;53:50,380;"Think it's real close. Thank you, right, but I think it's just like the cost does even Terry, right?"
53:50,580;53:55,580;"What do you want big plays or consistency? I think it's more no like we talked about with"
53:55,580;53:58,300;"Dion branch or David Patton"
53:58,300;54:05,460;"Yeah, like Patton like branch has the numbers, but Patton has a more memorable place that we decided I"
54:05,460;54:13,180;"fully agree with that, but I was on Dion. Yeah, I was also I'm probably on Willie right now as well, but I love hi"
54:13,180;54:18,620;"Thanks underrated and under appreciate same as Willie in this team here, you know, yeah"
54:18,620;54:23,620;"I don't know if Willy was ever under appreciated, but I hear what you're saying."
54:23,620;54:28,620;"I think you had some injury knocks to him kind of around this time."
54:28,620;54:29,620;"Yeah, he did."
54:29,620;54:31,620;"I think 2000 2001, he didn't play a lot."
54:31,620;54:33,620;"He was going through a bunch of injuries."
54:33,620;54:36,620;"It's what people like because he was a high traffic, wasn't he?"
54:36,620;54:39,620;"He was like their first round traffic that year."
54:39,620;54:40,620;"Yeah."
54:40,620;54:41,620;"He was trapped same year as blood."
54:41,620;54:42,620;"So and they were both first."
54:42,620;54:44,620;"They were the top two because blood."
54:44,620;54:45,620;"So it was first overall."
54:45,620;54:49,220;"I think they had another first round draft pick and they picked McGinnis as well"
54:49,220;54:53,620;"And of course the two of them were you know, we know what they turned out to be"
54:53,620;55:00,900;"What were they both like what 94 or something? Yeah, 19 that yeah, yeah"
55:00,900;55:08,380;"Yeah, he was oh he was drafted fourth overall in the first round. Are you kidding the Patriots had?"
55:08,380;55:13,180;"Okay, all right, so no, they weren't drafted the same year as blood so he was drafted"
55:13,180;55:15,180;"fourth"
55:15,180;55:17,180;"one was playing in the"
55:17,180;55:19,420;"ninety three year I okay yes"
55:19,420;55:22,260;"also draft ninety three first overall"
55:22,260;55:24,660;"and then in the four"
55:24,660;55:26,500;"beginners was fourth overall"
55:26,500;55:27,540;"because I show you how great the"
55:27,540;55:29,860;"patrons were back then"
55:29,860;55:31,420;"yeah and the Bengals picked Dan"
55:31,420;55:32,740;"Wilkinson"
55:32,740;55:34,380;"is true"
55:34,380;55:35,900;"well to be fair the Redskins"
55:35,900;55:37,420;"pick he's Schuler one pick before"
55:37,420;55:40,260;"William again is"
55:40,260;55:45,960;"Oops. I'm back. Oh, good. No, you were gone. You liar."
55:45,960;55:52,220;"We're talking about William again as baby. Yeah. Oh, yeah."
55:52,220;55:57,260;"Did you know that Tom Brady and the Boxer playing Saints week one?"
55:57,260;56:03,540;"Yes. Oh, in New Orleans, that would be fucking sick."
56:05,740;56:14,220;"We did these tickets. We weren't in a, I mean, if New Orleans and Bourbon Street was like regular"
56:14,220;56:21,420;"Bourbon Street, I would borderline maybe book a slight down there right now. Yeah."
56:21,420;56:31,900;"Week one. But if it's like, you know, only 15 to 20,000 fans out in the stadium and Bourbon"
56:31,900;56:35,480;"street shut down I don't know he might be fun if you were a buckspan"
56:35,480;56:42,960;"I am kind of an honorary"
56:42,960;56:53,140;"He conners on my side in this argument of we're now bucks fans"
56:53,140;56:57,760;"Now I'm not about that way after everything Tom after after everything Tom Brady"
56:58,180;57:01,100;"has not only given to the Patriots,"
57:01,100;57:05,620;"but transforming New England into a city of champions"
57:05,620;57:08,980;"and instilling that championship,"
57:08,980;57:12,140;"do everything it takes to win attitude across"
57:12,140;57:14,300;"all of the Boston sports teams."
57:14,300;57:17,820;"I will follow Tom Brady into the fucking sunset"
57:17,820;57:21,060;"on the last two years of his career, okay?"
57:21,060;57:25,540;"And I don't care what anyone fucking thinks about me."
57:25,540;57:27,100;"We're gonna look back on this and be like,"
57:27,100;57:33,980;"Hey, you remember how crazy it was that Tom Brady finished out the last two years of his career in Tampa Bay and won two Super Bowls?"
57:33,980;57:34,580;"That was crazy."
57:34,580;57:35,620;"Yeah, and said all those."
57:35,620;57:36,420;"I plan."
57:36,420;57:40,460;"Yeah, that's how I plan on looking back on it."
57:40,460;57:41,260;"So me too."
57:41,260;57:45,700;"Tom Brady is bigger than sports."
57:45,700;57:48,660;"I didn't say Brady."
57:48,660;57:49,420;"I'm a Brady fan."
57:49,420;57:50,860;"Bucks guy."
57:50,860;57:56,940;"He's bigger than like regional alliances, you know, or regional fandoms."
57:56,940;58:00,100;"He's he's a deity, you know, I'm with"
58:00,100;58:05,580;"I agree. I'd be fine if Brady threw for six thousand yards. I"
58:05,580;58:10,300;"Yeah, I'd be fired if Brady threw for six thousand yards on the bucks when it"
58:10,300;58:13,580;"And he threw for like 70 touch out"
58:13,580;58:18,980;"The bucks are like the least problematic and it's like"
58:18,980;58:21,780;"you really you you"
58:22,740;58:27,280;"Are against the scene the bucks to do well at Tom Brady under center give me a fucking break"
58:27,280;58:30,880;"Yeah, they win they win a Super Bowl. That's gonna you're gonna be disappointed"
58:30,880;58:38,880;"Why because the paths didn't win yeah, let them have one dude. Why you weren't saying that no seven when the Giants won?"
58:38,880;58:45,080;"Yeah, now it's going against everything Connor just said about instilling a winning culture in New England"
58:45,080;58:48,440;"Good point"
58:48,440;58:55,000;"Well, hey, if it could guess what if it's Patriots box in the Super Bowl on cheering for the fucking Patriots"
58:55,000;59:02,520;"You know damn well that isn't happening. Okay, Patriots schedule just came out. We have the hardest schedule in"
59:02,520;59:07,720;"Bill Belichick's career as a patriot the Patriots had coached"
59:07,720;59:15,440;"No, it is the it is we have the toughest strength of schedule in the NFL this year for the first time season"
59:17,520;59:22,280;"That means nothing Connor and you know that all right. Well, you can't"
59:22,280;59:30,200;"Guess I'll fuck myself then"
59:30,200;59:37,880;"Don't we"
59:37,880;59:40,520;"NFC"
59:40,520;59:45,960;"West this year. Yes, dude at Kansas City in October"
59:45,960;59:46,460;"Yeah."
59:46,460;59:48,660;"Yeah."
59:48,660;59:49,700;"One's tempting."
59:49,700;59:50,240;"Maybe."
59:50,240;59:52,400;"Depends on how the paths would do it, I think."
59:52,400;59:55,500;"Back to back games in LA."
59:55,500;59:56,580;"Also tempting."
59:56,580;59:58,320;"Yeah."
59:58,320;01:00:03,100;"That'd be, that'd be sweet to go to both those games and just spend a week"
01:00:03,100;01:00:04,420;"in California."
01:00:04,420;01:00:09,660;"It's not like we're using our PTL and anything else right now, right?"
01:00:09,660;01:00:10,420;"Oh, dude."
01:00:10,420;01:00:12,420;"So one of them's a Thursday."
01:00:12,420;01:00:13,900;"Oh, there you go."
01:00:13,900;01:00:15,220;"Short week."
01:00:15,220;01:00:15,780;"Perfect."
01:00:15,780;01:00:18,220;"Yeah, you can."
01:00:18,220;01:00:19,220;"Clap the bones."
01:00:19,220;01:00:22,860;"I mean, I'm still telling you, Patreons are going to squeak into the play."
01:00:22,860;01:00:23,860;"Oh, you know what I'm going to have?"
01:00:23,860;01:00:28,060;"Patreons are going to squeak in as the seventh seed in the playoffs this year, because they've"
01:00:28,060;01:00:29,060;"expanded it."
01:00:29,060;01:00:31,060;"And then they're going to go into in the Super Bowl."
01:00:31,060;01:00:32,060;"Swishful thinking."
01:00:32,060;01:00:33,060;"Calling it now."
01:00:33,060;01:00:35,060;"They're going to get hot at the right time."
01:00:35,060;01:00:37,380;"They were all hinges on our boy stut them."
01:00:37,380;01:00:40,700;"Just like the '08 Patriots did when Brady went down."
01:00:40,700;01:00:44,540;"They got hot right at the end, but if there was a seventh seed, they would have got in"
01:00:44,540;01:00:46,180;"and they would have rolled."
01:00:46,180;01:00:48,060;"'Cause I was the other, they beat the shit out of the card"
01:00:48,060;01:00:49,020;"and it was went to Super Bowl."
01:00:49,020;01:00:50,060;"Calling it out."
01:00:50,060;01:00:51,440;"- I disagree."
01:00:51,440;01:00:52,280;"- Okay."
01:00:52,280;01:00:54,780;"- I would like to see them do well, but."
01:00:54,780;01:00:55,980;"- Doesn't sound like it."
01:00:55,980;01:00:57,380;"- I would have mind a tank."
01:00:57,380;01:01:00,040;"A tanking season would be all right for me."
01:01:00,040;01:01:02,300;"The, I don't like--"
01:01:02,300;01:01:04,020;"- We're gonna do the strategic tank."
01:01:04,020;01:01:06,420;"I've been talking about this."
01:01:06,420;01:01:07,860;"We're building an elite defense"
01:01:07,860;01:01:11,220;"and we're gonna average four points a game on offense."
01:01:11,220;01:01:12,260;"- Yep."
01:01:12,260;01:01:13,620;"- And then get Trevor Lawrence."
01:01:13,620;01:01:16,440;"yeah i don't even know about that i just think"
01:01:16,440;01:01:20,220;"i i mean i hope so i think i mean i've kind of drank the kool-aid and travel"
01:01:20,220;01:01:23,580;"on to think he's gonna be really good"
01:01:23,580;01:01:27,180;"yet i mean the writings on the wall right we haven't added one premiere"
01:01:27,180;01:01:29,540;"offensive weapon"
01:01:29,540;01:01:31,840;"but the outside of the a_b_"
01:01:31,840;01:01:36,660;"experience uh... experiment lasher we haven't had one premier offensive weapon"
01:01:36,660;01:01:39,460;"and basically two years now"
01:01:39,460;01:01:43,020;"they've got to know you know that the first one of the group"
01:01:43,020;01:01:46,380;"the last two drafts. Yeah, but you can't look at the roster."
01:01:46,380;01:01:53,260;"Tony was Sony be in like week three. Tony, Sony, Sony Michelle is not an offensive weapon."
01:01:53,260;01:01:58,780;"I'm talking about a premier offensive weapon. That's what I'm drafting one. Steve's going"
01:01:58,780;01:02:07,420;"to be upset with that. I know Steve. As a crot. What Sony was so Sony Michelle fucking Lawrence"
01:02:07,420;01:02:14,940;"Maroni dancing the whole three two dot oh no way dude. He is no burst last year was I"
01:02:14,940;01:02:19,380;"mean it was glaring how little burst he has."
01:02:19,380;01:02:26,020;"You know what I'm looking forward to. Eleven one o'clock or four o'clock games."
01:02:26,020;01:02:32,660;"Oh nice. I am as well. I always like you really so you guys aren't big. See I'm in so"
01:02:32,660;01:02:36,660;"So many fantasy leagues, I always appreciated that,"
01:02:36,660;01:02:41,020;"that they were, well not like an absurd amount,"
01:02:41,020;01:02:42,980;"but I always appreciated that they were the later games."
01:02:42,980;01:02:45,780;"So I could watch Red Zone for all the one o'clock games."
01:02:45,780;01:02:46,620;"- That's a good point."
01:02:46,620;01:02:49,420;"- And then when they came in on, you know,"
01:02:49,420;01:02:50,820;"like the four o'clock game, it's like,"
01:02:50,820;01:02:54,060;"hey, I got to watch, I call my players on Red Zone."
01:02:54,060;01:02:56,660;"Now I get to settle in for the Patriots."
01:02:56,660;01:02:59,100;"- Well, with three of those 11, R four o'clocks."
01:03:01,340;01:03:04,300;"Yeah, and the other four o'clock are my favorite."
01:03:04,300;01:03:05,540;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:05,540;01:03:10,540;"Yeah, me too, because you can watch the one o'clock and then you watch the pads."
01:03:10,540;01:03:14,340;"And then you just like fall asleep in front of the night game."
01:03:14,340;01:03:15,540;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:03:15,540;01:03:17,700;"Yep."
01:03:17,700;01:03:21,060;"Now we're sitting staying up on a fucking Monday."
01:03:21,060;01:03:24,740;"Dude, a Sunday night game at Seattle."
01:03:24,740;01:03:29,060;"I like that one."
01:03:29,060;01:03:30,900;"I like that one."
01:03:30,900;01:03:31,900;"Oh God."
01:03:31,900;01:03:34,580;"I heard Seattle's a nice city to visit."
01:03:34,580;01:03:36,380;"It's all right."
01:03:36,380;01:03:37,900;"Why you say that, Andy?"
01:03:37,900;01:03:41,340;"The city's fine, but I'd go outside the city for a go there."
01:03:41,340;01:03:43,540;"I guess. Oh, yeah."
01:03:43,540;01:03:45,140;"No, it's nice outside."
01:03:45,140;01:03:46,340;"They got a bunch of hiking and shit."
01:03:46,340;01:03:50,140;"Yeah, I mean, that that's all false within visiting."
01:03:50,140;01:03:51,300;"All right. All right."
01:03:51,300;01:03:52,460;"Let's stop talking about the goddamn."
01:03:52,460;01:03:57,220;"You know what I've heard is really nice is Ben Cooper."
01:04:00,140;01:04:01,140;"That's all right."
01:04:01,140;01:04:02,140;"But for real, I've heard this."
01:04:02,140;01:04:04,700;"Should we give game balls to the best of worst thing and?"
01:04:04,700;01:04:06,340;"No, let's go see some best of worst here."
01:04:06,340;01:04:06,840;"All right."
01:04:06,840;01:04:10,660;"And then once we're not live, let's talk about this schedule some more."
01:04:10,660;01:04:12,660;"[LAUGH]"
01:04:12,660;01:04:13,660;"Okay."
01:04:13,660;01:04:17,740;"All right, Steve, give me your best of worst here."
01:04:17,740;01:04:21,500;"Besides the things we haven't talked about, and again, I'm really happy I"
01:04:21,500;01:04:24,820;"watched this game all the way to the end just like that Steelers game."
01:04:24,820;01:04:27,420;"The last kick returned from the Jets."
01:04:27,420;01:04:30,180;"The dude, the returner comes like, he does a pretty good return."
01:04:30,180;01:04:35,260;"He comes flying through and he runs into Pepper Johnson who just lays him out, like"
01:04:35,260;01:04:37,980;"instinct only just puts him on his ass."
01:04:37,980;01:04:40,740;"Former Jeff linebacker."
01:04:40,740;01:04:41,580;"No less pepper."
01:04:41,580;01:04:41,820;"John."
01:04:41,820;01:04:42,300;"Yeah."
01:04:42,300;01:04:45,740;"And like a 20 years younger than we know now Pepper Johnson."
01:04:45,740;01:04:47,540;"So they just sat him down."
01:04:47,540;01:04:48,140;"It was awesome."
01:04:48,140;01:04:49,260;"Yeah, that was a great."
01:04:49,260;01:04:53,660;"And then that play also got hit that great kick return."
01:04:53,660;01:04:54,700;"Also got call back for holding."
01:04:55,700;01:04:59,980;"He did have a little like smirk on his face when he did it too."
01:04:59,980;01:05:00,540;"Oh, God."
01:05:00,540;01:05:00,780;"Yeah."
01:05:00,780;01:05:01,460;"Exactly."
01:05:01,460;01:05:03,780;"He's like strutting down the sideline."
01:05:03,780;01:05:06,180;"He's a man."
01:05:06,180;01:05:10,540;"The worst was the like replays in the first half."
01:05:10,540;01:05:12,820;"I don't forget where I."
01:05:12,820;01:05:16,940;"It's better than even the first game where they had to go replay counter."
01:05:16,940;01:05:18,940;"Like how long I was taking them to do it."
01:05:18,940;01:05:20,940;"Oh, yeah, they did at a timer."
01:05:20,940;01:05:21,740;"But I won."
01:05:21,740;01:05:24,380;"I was like, I was hitting the 10 second fast forward."
01:05:24,380;01:05:25,860;"I clicked it six times."
01:05:25,860;01:05:28,340;"I got to the point where I was like, I need to fast forward this."
01:05:28,340;01:05:31,460;"And I clicked it six times and they still had in common with the decision."
01:05:31,460;01:05:34,260;"And then I looked because lit by half."
01:05:34,260;01:05:36,780;"The second half was 15 minutes shorter."
01:05:36,780;01:05:38,580;"Yeah, because of that one."
01:05:38,580;01:05:43,420;"And that was just like whether or not it was the first down to."
01:05:43,420;01:05:44,460;"Yeah."
01:05:44,460;01:05:46,660;"And it was it was blatantly not a first down."
01:05:46,660;01:05:48,140;"He was you're short, but I'll wait."
01:05:48,140;01:05:52,700;"Oh, that's that's why I can't watch these games."
01:05:52,700;01:05:54,020;"I rewatch the whole thing."
01:05:54,020;01:05:57,020;"Even like two and a half hours."
01:05:57,020;01:05:58,020;"Yeah."
01:05:58,020;01:06:00,020;"And then like you're sitting through shit like that."
01:06:00,020;01:06:04,020;"And it's like, those compack games are awesome that they do now."
01:06:04,020;01:06:05,020;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:05,020;01:06:06,020;"We're like, cut."
01:06:06,020;01:06:07,020;"45 minutes."
01:06:07,020;01:06:08,020;"Yeah."
01:06:08,020;01:06:09,020;"Yeah."
01:06:09,020;01:06:10,020;"That's a good plan for play after play."
01:06:10,020;01:06:11,020;"That's great."
01:06:11,020;01:06:13,020;"We'll get there in 2009, I think currently."
01:06:13,020;01:06:15,020;"So far back they go."
01:06:15,020;01:06:17,020;"Oh, also just a fun fact."
01:06:17,020;01:06:20,020;"I saw the first fantasy football ad."
01:06:20,020;01:06:21,020;"Oh, really?"
01:06:21,020;01:06:22,020;"Interesting."
01:06:22,020;01:06:24,620;"Yeah, for AOL fantasy football."
01:06:24,620;01:06:29,740;"I've been like waiting for this to come up and I can't believe it is this early."
01:06:29,740;01:06:30,740;"You know what?"
01:06:30,740;01:06:32,220;"I have a spot."
01:06:32,220;01:06:35,800;"I wasn't going to play fantasy football this year, but if there's AOL"
01:06:35,800;01:06:37,740;"fantasy football still going, we're all doing a team."
01:06:37,740;01:06:38,220;"We're all doing a team."
01:06:38,220;01:06:40,540;"Why weren't you going to do it, Andy?"
01:06:40,540;01:06:41,900;"I don't know."
01:06:41,900;01:06:43,660;"I'm still done with fantasy football."
01:06:43,660;01:06:48,300;"I feel like why Greg's clearly invested here."
01:06:48,300;01:06:48,900;"Yeah."
01:06:48,900;01:06:51,620;"I just you've always been a big fantasy guy."
01:06:51,620;01:06:53,760;"I'm wondering what changed."
01:06:53,760;01:06:54,920;"- Couple things."
01:06:54,920;01:06:56,740;"I've been playing it for probably,"
01:06:56,740;01:06:59,400;"I guess it's called 20 years and I've never won once."
01:06:59,400;01:07:02,940;"So I realized I'm never good at it."
01:07:02,940;01:07:05,540;"(laughing)"
01:07:05,540;01:07:08,540;"This includes leagues where I was living in me"
01:07:08,540;01:07:11,680;"and Mike Mellow together and I never won."
01:07:11,680;01:07:13,580;"- I appreciate the honesty."
01:07:13,580;01:07:15,540;"- There's other leagues where I've actually cheated"
01:07:15,540;01:07:17,020;"and I still lost in the finals."
01:07:18,460;01:07:21,360;"Well league add that I saw was 18 years ago"
01:07:21,360;01:07:27,420;"All right, so yeah, it was about that. You were early adopter of fantasy. I remember that"
01:07:27,420;01:07:32,500;"And also I just feel like it's made me"
01:07:32,500;01:07:38,340;"Watch football games differently. I'm not watching it for the joy. I'm watching it for my fantasy football team"
01:07:38,340;01:07:43,060;"Hmm. I get that my player doesn't score a touchdown. I get all pissy. Yeah"
01:07:43,060;01:07:48,060;"I'm all done with that. So the worst is watching games with people that are like that"
01:07:48,060;01:07:52,860;"Yeah, yeah, what I thought to him throw it to my guy. It's yeah"
01:07:52,860;01:07:57,800;"It's right. Yeah, especially if you're invested in the game like it's a yeah or something"
01:07:57,800;01:08:06,780;"Or even when it's a part game and you have like somebody on the other team and you're kind of like having that sort of"
01:08:06,780;01:08:14,220;"Interbattle of yeah cool that the page is losing but my guy just scored so I'm winning my fucking face. We'll be like it matters"
01:08:14,700;01:08:19,160;"Yeah, I'm gonna put someone on blast right now, and you could probably guess who it is"
01:08:19,160;01:08:24,220;"It's mark fratarelli"
01:08:24,220;01:08:30,440;"I thought it was me too"
01:08:30,440;01:08:40,180;"Yeah, I can see mark being like that. Oh, yeah car. Are you a big fancy guy? Yeah, I love it. I love it. I"
01:08:40,180;01:08:43,340;"Try not to"
01:08:43,340;01:08:48,700;"You know, I don't let it sway me when I'm watching the paths. I'm not like I"
01:08:48,700;01:08:53,980;"Don't care who scores for the Patriots even if I have certain Patriots on my team"
01:08:53,980;01:08:58,100;"But like I really loved the one o'clock red zone"
01:08:58,100;01:09:07,180;"That's why I when the paths are just like, you know, always one of the top teams are always in in prime time"
01:09:07,180;01:09:13,260;"I really enjoy that and I yeah, I love fantasy. I think the only reason I actually did fancy"
01:09:13,260;01:09:19,340;"for so long was because I would run my own league and it just gave me an excuse to abuse"
01:09:19,340;01:09:20,340;"all my friends."
01:09:20,340;01:09:23,180;"Yeah, I have this."
01:09:23,180;01:09:32,060;"It was like, it was, it was, it was the worst leagues ever, but also like very entertaining."
01:09:32,060;01:09:37,300;"Yeah, the banter was great, but like the structure of the league, you would never use"
01:09:37,300;01:09:38,300;"like, ESPN.com."
01:09:38,300;01:09:41,740;"You'd like have some like fucking website you develop yourself."
01:09:41,740;01:09:43,480;"Oh, I did that one time."
01:09:43,480;01:09:45,140;"Kicker Turner thing."
01:09:45,140;01:09:47,540;"You'd be like, oh, we got three quarterbacks."
01:09:47,540;01:09:49,900;"It's like dude, Andy."
01:09:49,900;01:09:51,660;"Keep it simple."
01:09:51,660;01:09:52,900;"No way."
01:09:52,900;01:09:53,400;"No way."
01:09:53,400;01:09:55,920;"The news letters, the commissioner news letters"
01:09:55,920;01:09:56,820;"are always funny."
01:09:56,820;01:09:57,820;"Yeah, they were."
01:09:57,820;01:09:59,140;"Yeah."
01:09:59,140;01:10:00,140;"Those were a good time."
01:10:00,140;01:10:02,220;"Yeah, I was literally the only reason I did it was to shit"
01:10:02,220;01:10:04,540;"on all my friends on a weekly basis."
01:10:04,540;01:10:06,140;"And now we have this."
01:10:06,140;01:10:06,860;"And now we have this."
01:10:06,860;01:10:08,420;"So yeah, I can just do it to you in real time."
01:10:08,420;01:10:09,580;"It's been even better."
01:10:09,580;01:10:11,540;"So I don't need fancy football anymore."
01:10:11,540;01:10:15,540;"I'm in a team names anyways, but yeah, that's true"
01:10:15,540;01:10:23,940;"All right, Greg give us your best and worst all right"
01:10:23,940;01:10:27,260;"so best I"
01:10:27,260;01:10:30,420;"think is"
01:10:30,420;01:10:32,620;"week two"
01:10:32,620;01:10:37,140;"Sunday night game at Seattle and then worst"
01:10:37,140;01:10:50,820;"first. We 12 at Houston. What a shitty city. No, I still go there. Yes. Yes. I am fully"
01:10:50,820;01:10:56,300;"involved in the schedule. No, that's been released. Yeah, it sounds like it. I can't. What about you?"
01:10:56,300;01:11:04,940;"Hello, are we talking about the best and the worst from this game? And the rest of us are. Yes. Yeah. Yeah."
01:11:04,940;01:11:14,860;"Okay, so again, I was the best."
01:11:14,860;01:11:17,640;"I was just going to say the Patriots defense as a whole."
01:11:17,640;01:11:23,540;"I don't know if it was completely them or just like Bill Belichick's game."
01:11:23,540;01:11:28,380;"Because I was just like, no one stood out in terms of like, ""Holy shit, this guy had"
01:11:28,380;01:11:30,180;"10 tackles."""
01:11:30,180;01:11:35,180;"like everyone, you know, it was just like, it was a scheme."
01:11:35,180;01:11:40,420;"It was a game plan and our defense just suffocated the jets."
01:11:40,420;01:11:44,660;"We got up big early on offense."
01:11:44,660;01:11:49,540;"And I don't know, we just knew exactly what they were gonna do."
01:11:49,540;01:11:51,700;"They were playing from behind our defense."
01:11:51,700;01:11:53,420;"- They did never let out beat us."
01:11:53,420;01:11:54,580;"- Yeah, they did."
01:11:54,580;01:11:58,420;"- Special team, special teams was great too, obviously."
01:11:58,420;01:12:03,420;"And then the worst, it's tough to say."
01:12:03,420;01:12:06,300;"I think I mentioned it earlier,"
01:12:06,300;01:12:09,140;"but I guess it goes hand in hand."
01:12:09,140;01:12:13,980;"How a team can go until deep into the third quarter"
01:12:13,980;01:12:15,380;"without having a first down"
01:12:15,380;01:12:18,360;"when they're projected to be the favorites"
01:12:18,360;01:12:21,380;"is just a aesthetic."
01:12:21,380;01:12:22,700;"- That's bad."
01:12:22,700;01:12:23,540;"- It really is."
01:12:23,540;01:12:28,380;"Also, I wanted to, I don't know if you guys heard"
01:12:28,380;01:12:32,380;"Tom Brady's interview at the end of this game."
01:12:32,380;01:12:34,220;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
01:12:34,220;01:12:36,860;"Let me know if you can hear me."
01:12:36,860;01:12:38,740;"Can you hear this?"
01:12:38,740;01:12:43,100;"No, I think you have to share the screen with audio."
01:12:43,100;01:12:44,060;"I give to share."
01:12:44,060;01:12:44,700;"Hold on."
01:12:44,700;01:12:47,460;"A share computer sound checkbox."
01:12:47,460;01:12:48,220;"OK."
01:12:48,220;01:12:49,060;"Ooh."
01:12:49,060;01:12:49,860;"Ooh."
01:12:49,860;01:12:50,660;"Ooh."
01:12:50,660;01:12:51,160;"Ooh."
01:12:51,160;01:12:51,660;"There we go."
01:12:51,660;01:12:52,160;"Ooh."
01:12:52,160;01:12:52,660;"There we go."
01:12:52,660;01:12:53,160;"Ooh."
01:12:53,160;01:12:53,660;"There we go."
01:12:53,660;01:12:54,160;"Ooh."
01:12:54,160;01:12:54,660;"There we go."
01:12:54,660;01:12:55,660;"Ooh."
01:12:55,660;01:12:56,660;"[INTERPOSING VOICES]"
01:12:56,660;01:12:58,980;"[INTERPOSING VOICES]"
01:12:58,980;01:13:02,160;"[INAUDIBLE]"
01:13:02,160;01:13:03,160;"What was that?"
01:13:03,160;01:13:04,740;"That was awesome."
01:13:04,740;01:13:07,360;"That was a feedback loop created by the speakers,"
01:13:07,360;01:13:08,860;"getting picked up by the microphone."
01:13:08,860;01:13:10,700;"That was awesome."
01:13:10,700;01:13:11,980;"It's a techno."
01:13:11,980;01:13:15,900;"OK, we're not gonna do that, because that was a nightmare."
01:13:15,900;01:13:19,440;"I was like, I don't know what the hell that was."
01:13:19,440;01:13:20,260;"But--"
01:13:20,260;01:13:21,900;"That was awesome, my god."
01:13:21,900;01:13:23,180;"That was like a--"
01:13:23,180;01:13:23,940;"It's no way it was--"
01:13:23,940;01:13:25,220;"Catchy tune."
01:13:25,220;01:13:28,660;"They'll just say repeat what he's saying on it. I picked up on that too"
01:13:28,660;01:13:34,960;"He was just talking about how he's like you know a little bit of disrespect and they've got a chip on their shoulder now"
01:13:34,960;01:13:36,960;"And I fucking loved it"
01:13:36,960;01:13:42,100;"They're just like they it puts a chip on their shoulder. You could just see little glimpses into"
01:13:42,100;01:13:49,060;"You know the fire that Tom Brady has God. He's so goofy looking. I don't know who said it last week"
01:13:49,060;01:13:52,420;"he's you know these early-day Tom Brady's are"
01:13:53,300;01:14:01,280;"He is goofy looking how you know swab he is now and how much more chiseled his jaws, but yeah the butch in Brady"
01:14:01,280;01:14:09,240;"The hair flick remember that like the hair the ramp the front of your head. Yeah"
01:14:09,240;01:14:13,320;"Yeah"
01:14:13,320;01:14:15,320;"so he"
01:14:15,320;01:14:19,360;"I just kind of liked I just kind of liked what he said afterwards. He was he wasn't"
01:14:20,280;01:14:23,880;"Braggadocious he was just kind of humble, but he was like yep, we're"
01:14:23,880;01:14:29,840;"We see everything you guys are saying and it pisses off pisses us off and"
01:14:29,840;01:14:36,400;"Yeah, we use it as motivation. I don't know. I love me some Tom. You know that"
01:14:36,400;01:14:38,400;"I"
01:14:38,400;01:14:40,400;"It seems like it is and that's"
01:14:40,400;01:14:46,640;"There's always a little chip on our shoulder, you know, I think every time we go out, you know, we realize we're through it"
01:14:46,640;01:14:48,640;"But you know you're always good as your last"
01:14:48,640;01:14:57,520;"And we didn't then I guess people are just too eager to"
01:14:57,520;01:15:07,240;"You guys hear that? Yeah, oh yeah, it is kind of it's pretty forceful words to ignorant to stupid realize it"
01:15:07,240;01:15:13,960;"I was like, okay. Yeah, all right Tommy. Yeah, but he looks like a 12 girl when he says it"
01:15:13,960;01:15:20,280;"Yeah, we're you've got the tie on. Yep, I"
01:15:20,280;01:15:24,120;"I enjoyed that"
01:15:24,120;01:15:30,280;"Early doors like that same same type of stuff he says now he's like, yo, we're gonna"
01:15:30,280;01:15:35,080;"We're winning world championships. I care about as like a second year player"
01:15:35,720;01:15:38,500;"Digged up. He's just foreshadowing. All right"
01:15:38,500;01:15:41,240;"Yep"
01:15:41,240;01:15:46,540;"That's all I got it was basically I mean pretty straightforward patch defense was the best"
01:15:46,540;01:15:55,740;"That's defense Tom Brady's interview and then the Jets offense my god first one first down"
01:15:55,740;01:15:58,780;"Late in the third quarter"
01:15:58,780;01:16:00,280;"That's a"
01:16:00,280;01:16:04,680;"Paul any test of early I told you he sucks. He sucks any test of very"
01:16:04,680;01:16:08,680;"play for 20 years and suck every single one of them."
01:16:08,680;01:16:12,680;"Oh, greenhead."
01:16:12,680;01:16:18,680;"Remember that Steve? Oh, he did the live Spanish to English translation."
01:16:18,680;01:16:24,680;"All right, Andy, you're on mute, bud."
01:16:24,680;01:16:28,680;"Oh, that was a lot."
01:16:28,680;01:16:32,680;"Yeah, I have been on mute this whole time talking to you guys."
01:16:32,680;01:16:35,640;"time talking to you guys. All right, great. Yeah, it was nice."
01:16:35,640;01:16:38,680;"I did all the time on conference calls. Yeah."
01:16:38,680;01:16:42,880;"Like, why don't these motherfuckers listen to me? Yeah."
01:16:42,880;01:16:46,920;"Yeah. Yeah. All right. I'm my worst going to play off of"
01:16:46,920;01:16:51,600;"Conners. There's the just offense. They had 18 plays in the first"
01:16:51,600;01:16:55,800;"half. The Patriots had a drive to end the first half that went"
01:16:55,800;01:16:58,640;"19 plays. So that's not good."
01:17:00,520;01:17:04,600;"And we kind of touched on this before where Matt Turk the punter was a leading Russia."
01:17:04,600;01:17:09,880;"But it actually gets worse than that. He led the team in rushing with 14 yards in one run."
01:17:09,880;01:17:16,360;"Their second leading Russia was backup quarterback Chad Pennington who had one run for nine yards."
01:17:16,360;01:17:25,000;"The jets looking for at home. No, the jets running back as a committee had four or five,"
01:17:25,000;01:17:28,180;"six rushes for nine yards."
01:17:28,180;01:17:31,080;"Hey, Andy, it's not about stats."
01:17:31,080;01:17:31,620;"All right."
01:17:31,620;01:17:33,960;"You play to win the game."
01:17:33,960;01:17:36,480;"That's why the war there."
01:17:36,480;01:17:37,240;"White jerseys."
01:17:37,240;01:17:38,960;"That's this year."
01:17:38,960;01:17:42,000;"Oh, that's the year."
01:17:42,000;01:17:43,080;"Herman Edwards."
01:17:43,080;01:17:43,360;"Yeah."
01:17:43,360;01:17:43,840;"Nice."
01:17:43,840;01:17:46,720;"Because last year, actually, I don't even think we touched on it, but, um,"
01:17:46,720;01:17:52,560;"the playoffs that quote last year, that was a cold last year because"
01:17:52,560;01:17:54,280;"they couldn't stop the organization's."
01:17:54,280;01:17:56,920;"I'll be surprised for one another game."
01:17:56,920;01:17:57,960;"Yeah."
01:17:57,960;01:18:00,960;"So this is, this is, yeah, we'll probably touch on it."
01:18:00,960;01:18:05,120;"Yeah, they go two and five to start this year."
01:18:05,120;01:18:07,560;"And that's when old Hermit boy loses it."
01:18:07,560;01:18:09,160;"Thanks."
01:18:09,160;01:18:10,440;"I can see that."
01:18:10,440;01:18:11,680;"Um,"
01:18:11,680;01:18:16,760;"my best was that this was one of the biggest beatings that the"
01:18:16,760;01:18:18,600;"pages are ever given to the Jets up to this point."
01:18:18,600;01:18:20,600;"Ooh, you want to second?"
01:18:20,600;01:18:21,080;"I got it."
01:18:21,080;01:18:22,040;"Yeah."
01:18:22,640;01:18:24,560;"The first biggest one, 1979."
01:18:24,560;01:18:26,680;"It was."
01:18:26,680;01:18:27,560;"Yeah."
01:18:27,560;01:18:28,080;"How?"
01:18:28,080;01:18:29,240;"What was the score?"
01:18:29,240;01:18:31,760;"I was going to say, but fucking rain, man."
01:18:31,760;01:18:33,160;"What was the score?"
01:18:33,160;01:18:35,560;"56, nothing."
01:18:35,560;01:18:37,280;"56 to three."
01:18:37,280;01:18:40,440;"Ah, how did you know that?"
01:18:40,440;01:18:43,520;"Did you read it to fucking rain, man, Andy?"
01:18:43,520;01:18:46,680;"Well, we know that's not true, but we all"
01:18:46,680;01:18:48,160;"because I clipped out the same."
01:18:48,160;01:18:49,000;"Yeah, exactly."
01:18:49,000;01:18:52,120;"I clipped it out of the newspaper when I was 12 years old."
01:18:52,120;01:18:56,680;"And I put it in a scrapbook and then I read it today in my scrapbook."
01:18:56,680;01:19:04,000;"So I clipped it out from my internet scrapbook today at the ripe old age of 37 years old."
01:19:04,000;01:19:06,520;"That's the difference."
01:19:06,520;01:19:07,800;"That's the difference."
01:19:07,800;01:19:10,360;"I was I was scrapbooking at 12."
01:19:10,360;01:19:11,640;"You're doing it at 35."
01:19:11,640;01:19:13,120;"Same maturity."
01:19:13,120;01:19:16,360;"Oh, yeah, I just still haven't grown up yet."
01:19:16,360;01:19:21,760;"Maybe when I'm like the bat funnel game for me, though."
01:19:21,760;01:19:24,760;"I was watching it and I was like man, I can't believe I forgot this game"
01:19:24,760;01:19:28,840;"Based on how much I hate the Jets and how much I enjoyed that but fumble game"
01:19:28,840;01:19:34,260;"These are like right on the star for me. Yeah, and this is kind of it's because it's"
01:19:34,260;01:19:37,320;"Go ahead. Go ahead"
01:19:37,320;01:19:39,320;"I was just gonna contend that"
01:19:39,320;01:19:47,720;"Yeah, I've never liked the Jets, but I think the real Jets hatred came during the Rex Ryan era"
01:19:48,480;01:19:52,040;"So I think the butt fumble game was much more enjoyable like"
01:19:52,040;01:19:56,100;"Obviously they're New York. You're like fuck New York, but"
01:19:56,100;01:20:02,720;"Really the disdain for the Jets came during the Rex Ryan era in my opinion"
01:20:02,720;01:20:09,260;"You think so I think that at least during the early dynasty. Yeah during the early years of the dynasty. Yeah"
01:20:09,260;01:20:12,960;"See I thought it was this era was what really got defined"
01:20:14,640;01:20:18,180;"Yeah, especially because of the Yankee stuff that was going on the same time. You kind of like"
01:20:18,180;01:20:24,380;"Yeah, had the Jets and Yankees as like one entity. Yeah, I guess it came to a"
01:20:24,380;01:20:30,480;"Crescendo is that the word? Yeah, yeah in apex when"
01:20:30,480;01:20:35,660;"Yeah, when all peaking turn the wreck the wreck Sarah"
01:20:35,660;01:20:39,700;"Well, man, you got the man genie"
01:20:39,700;01:20:42,460;"- to spy"
01:20:43,620;01:20:45,620;"Touche yeah"
01:20:45,620;01:20:51,300;"Yeah, I think they were like peaks as well. I think there were peaks all across that yeah cuz right now"
01:20:51,300;01:20:57,020;"I don't know it was a peak. I don't get any like I don't get my rocks off in the patch beat the Jets these days"
01:20:57,020;01:21:03,720;"You know no same with like the herm Edwards era - like I didn't really care. Oh, I feel the exact opposite"
01:21:03,720;01:21:06,460;"I love watching the pages beat the fuck out of the Jets"
01:21:06,460;01:21:11,900;"That's my valley"
01:21:11,900;01:21:19,780;"These are my legs Steve Brown was touching himself to you these ball handling to the shots of Curtis Martin saying on the sidelines looking for Lauren"
01:21:19,780;01:21:22,620;"Yes"
01:21:22,620;01:21:26,200;"Staring into the abyss. Yeah, like this is my life now"
01:21:26,200;01:21:30,060;"We only got the objects be just just one of the fucking Super Bowl fight to date there"
01:21:30,060;01:21:34,180;"I could be a Super Bowl champion right now. That's a good point Steve. That's a good point. It is"
01:21:34,180;01:21:37,540;"The one thing I did want to"
01:21:38,700;01:21:43,580;"Throw out there for you boys is when the Patriots blow out the Jets"
01:21:43,580;01:21:50,300;"They lose either they don't make the playoffs or they lose in the playoffs in heart-breaking fashion"
01:21:50,300;01:21:52,820;"I"
01:21:52,820;01:21:59,300;"Like 1979 and 76 and 78 79 they didn't make the playoffs"
01:21:59,300;01:22:02,260;"88 they didn't make the playoffs"
01:22:02,260;01:22:04,700;"2002 this year what happens?"
01:22:04,700;01:22:07,860;"They win"
01:22:08,140;01:22:18,300;"spoiler alert and then also don't forget um 2010 patreon speed the jets 45 to 3 if you remember that game"
01:22:18,300;01:22:26,300;"yeah when rek farin almost cried and how that season ends yeah as the game i was there"
01:22:26,300;01:22:35,980;"right and the worst part worst part about that game is i sat in traffic and like took me like three"
01:22:35,980;01:22:40,620;"hours, four hours to get back to Salem, New Hampshire, and I drop Mark off at his house,"
01:22:40,620;01:22:48,380;"and then I backed into his garage door. Oh, that was that. Oh my goodness. Yeah, it was"
01:22:48,380;01:22:59,780;"a tough day. That's rough. Oh boy. Well, yeah, I can top that. Well, you want to, you want"
01:22:59,780;01:23:07,060;"to stat here to wrap us up. Give me a stat to wrap this up. After this game, Tom Brady"
01:23:07,060;01:23:16,300;"in his career is 16 and three as a starter. This is true. Nice. Pretty pretty amazing."
01:23:16,300;01:23:22,100;"It is. Yeah, they won. It was that was their 11th straight straight win eighth straight"
01:23:22,100;01:23:28,780;"regular season game. Yeah. They had lost it a long time. They hadn't lost since November"
01:23:28,780;01:23:35,580;"18th of the year before an underdog wagon to like how do you look at that and be like yeah now jets by one it right and"
01:23:35,580;01:23:40,580;"Bob Ryan admitted to feet. Yeah boss and globe"
01:23:40,580;01:23:43,340;"Yeah, he likes the J E T"
01:23:43,340;01:23:56,340;"What do you think of Bob Ryan Andy? He's alright. Hey, he's no Jackie McMahlan, you know"
01:23:56,340;01:23:57,180;"- No."
01:23:57,180;01:23:58,940;"(laughing)"
01:23:58,940;01:24:00,640;"- Yeah, that's not many people are."
01:24:00,640;01:24:05,100;"- Jack Mack, but I will not stand for any Bob Ryan slanders."
01:24:05,100;01:24:10,100;"Flanders, Shank, all you want, do not slander Bob Ryan."
01:24:10,100;01:24:14,220;"He's a little old and decrepit."
01:24:14,220;01:24:17,660;"He's been a little old and decrepit"
01:24:17,660;01:24:19,740;"for the last 30 years, okay?"
01:24:19,740;01:24:22,620;"He is a very, very old man."
01:24:22,620;01:24:25,700;"He's one of the best writers I've ever seen."
01:24:25,700;01:24:27,460;"So yeah, I love Bob Ryan too."
01:24:27,460;01:24:29,220;"Yeah. Me too."
01:24:29,220;01:24:32,620;"We've been on the same side a lot today, Connor."
01:24:32,620;01:24:34,580;"I'm a little worried."
01:24:34,580;01:24:35,260;"Are you two? Okay."
01:24:35,260;01:24:37,500;"I know. It's not typical."
01:24:37,500;01:24:38,460;"No."
01:24:38,460;01:24:41,500;"That's putting it lightly."
01:24:41,500;01:24:44,100;"Yeah. In fact, I'm starting to question my own like."
01:24:44,100;01:24:48,060;"I don't know brain."
01:24:48,060;01:24:49,980;"Yeah. Brain function, you know, like,"
01:24:49,980;01:24:52,260;"are you having a stroke?"
01:24:52,260;01:24:54,980;"Yeah. That's what I'm considering."
01:24:54,980;01:25:02,500;"because I know that Connor, like Connor acts like a stroke victim. So."
01:25:02,500;01:25:14,300;"That's only at Herman Island after I've been like drinking for seven straight days. I can't sometimes put together full sentence. Give me a fucking break."
01:25:14,300;01:25:24,820;"Are you at Herman Island now? No, I feel like I've done okay. I feel like I've done okay tonight. Yes, I agree."
01:25:24,820;01:25:30,940;"I've got the smartest brown of the bunch agreeing with my every word so I think I'm doing okay."
01:25:30,940;01:25:32,980;"I have not agree with anything you've said."
01:25:32,980;01:25:35,140;"Yeah, even Greg doesn't agree with that."
01:25:35,140;01:25:40,940;"My grave is getting deeper."
01:25:40,940;01:25:45,820;"Greg, who's the smartest brown?"
01:25:45,820;01:25:48,420;"Well, seriously, I was."
01:25:48,420;01:25:52,420;"Prior to like the last two hours, I would have said me, but now I'm like,"
01:25:52,420;01:25:55,380;"Trick question."
01:25:55,380;01:25:56,300;"It's really everything."
01:25:56,300;01:25:57,980;"Yeah, that's true."
01:25:57,980;01:26:00,300;"Mick Brown trick question."
01:26:00,300;01:26:01,940;"Ellie for not being on this podcast."
01:26:01,940;01:26:06,220;"Yeah, Ellie, although she also lives in Brooklyn with three small children."
01:26:06,220;01:26:11,540;"So yeah, it's probably the honor, you know, if we put potential in there."
01:26:11,540;01:26:12,500;"It's probably Ziggy."
01:26:12,500;01:26:14,820;"Rest in peace."
01:26:17,260;01:26:18,820;"All right, sit on that note."
01:26:18,820;01:26:22,980;"As I can see, this is unraveling quickly."
01:26:22,980;01:26:28,820;"We will be back next week for a bond burner."
01:26:28,820;01:26:30,260;"Band man."
01:26:30,260;01:26:32,060;"Pat's and chiefs."
01:26:32,060;01:26:35,460;"The game for ages that I don't even remember."
01:26:35,460;01:26:36,900;"I'm looking forward to watching it."
01:26:36,900;01:26:38,220;"I think this should be a good one."
01:26:38,220;01:26:39,460;"So we will--"
01:26:39,460;01:26:43,100;"Who the hell remembers early 2000 chiefs?"
01:26:43,100;01:26:45,940;"I'm just excited to dig through the notes and the game."
01:26:45,940;01:26:47,380;"- Dick Vermeel."
01:26:47,380;01:26:48,380;"- Oh, Dick."
01:26:48,380;01:26:51,940;"- I know the coach."
01:26:51,940;01:26:53,940;"It's trending the clean."
01:26:53,940;01:26:55,100;"- Please tell him."
01:26:55,100;01:26:55,940;"- Save it for that."
01:26:55,940;01:26:56,940;"- Yeah."
01:26:56,940;01:26:58,300;"- That's good."
01:26:58,300;01:27:01,460;"- I'm just wet in the appetites of our listeners."
01:27:01,460;01:27:02,300;"- Yeah."
01:27:02,300;01:27:03,820;"I mean, how am I gonna fall asleep tonight?"
01:27:03,820;01:27:07,300;"No, and I got fucking Dick Vermeel and Trent Green coming up."
01:27:07,300;01:27:10,300;"- Well, you're not gonna fall asleep on your stomach, are ya?"
01:27:10,300;01:27:13,460;"- You're gonna fall asleep with Dick on the brain all the time."
01:27:13,460;01:27:14,300;"- Yeah."
01:27:14,300;01:27:16,300;"I cut a hole in my mattress."
01:27:16,300;01:27:17,940;"(laughing)"
01:27:17,940;01:27:19,440;"- It's a very small one though."
01:27:19,440;01:27:21,420;"(laughing)"
01:27:21,420;01:27:23,340;"- You didn't actually need to, we just did it."
01:27:23,340;01:27:27,420;"And on that note, we will see you next week"
01:27:27,420;01:27:30,020;"on the Patriots Donacy Podcast."
01:27:30,020;01:27:30,860;"See you later guys."
01:27:30,860;01:27:31,700;"- Have a good one boys."
01:27:31,700;01:27:32,780;"- See ya, Nora."

00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:17,680;"I am not your mother."
00:17,680;00:29,480;"Welcome back to the pages of Dinesie Podcast, week 16 of the 2003 season."
00:29,480;00:31,480;"I can't believe we've made it this far."
00:31,480;00:34,480;"Like that's a lot of games to watch."
00:34,480;00:37,480;"Yeah, I haven't watched all of them."
00:37,480;00:38,480;"I have."
00:38,480;00:40,480;"I think I have watched everything."
00:40,480;00:43,480;"I think I'm the only one who's watched every single one of these games."
00:43,480;00:44,480;"Yeah, I definitely did."
00:44,480;00:46,480;"Some of them I wouldn't do again."
00:46,480;00:50,480;"There have been some dolphins games that we probably should have skipped."
00:50,480;00:52,480;"But that's not what we do here."
00:52,480;00:54,480;"And some of you do here."
00:54,480;00:55,480;"I do that."
00:55,480;00:56,480;"I do that."
00:56,480;00:57,480;"And Greg also."
00:57,480;00:59,480;"Yeah, Greg does that all."
00:59,480;01:01,280;"He's actually the worst."
01:01,280;01:05,480;"He also skips full episodes that just doesn't even show up,"
01:05,480;01:06,580;"which is what it's having tonight."
01:06,580;01:10,380;"But we actually have a special guest tonight."
01:10,380;01:14,580;"And it is somebody who we've talked about before"
01:14,580;01:18,780;"because they sent a text to the Dynasty Hotline."
01:18,780;01:21,580;"Steve, what's the number?"
01:21,580;01:23,480;"So three because we're from New Hampshire."
01:23,480;01:24,480;"Correct."
01:24,480;01:25,880;"Five oh five."
01:25,880;01:30,160;"Okay. And then obviously last part's easy to Troy Brown for three."

01:41,960;01:44,840;"Uh, I've listened to every episode, believe it or not."
01:44,840;01:45,680;"God damn it."
01:45,680;01:46,640;"Yeah, I don't believe that."
01:46,640;01:48,120;"No, it's true."
01:48,120;01:52,400;"I have a half hour commute so like I can get through basically an episode and a half"
01:52,400;01:54,320;"on two drives to and from work."
01:54,320;01:55,120;"So."
01:55,120;01:56,280;"- Oh yeah."
01:56,280;01:57,840;"- And I also love the Patriots that I love,"
01:57,840;01:59,960;"like I was talking Andy earlier that,"
01:59,960;02:01,800;"like I love looking at, you know,"
02:01,800;02:05,000;"players from, players stats from like the 80s, 90s and stuff."
02:05,000;02:07,640;"I'm kind of a stat head myself, like,"
02:07,640;02:08,640;"just love it all really."
02:08,640;02:10,000;"So."
02:10,000;02:12,080;"- All right, I have so many questions."
02:12,080;02:12,920;"- Yeah."
02:12,920;02:13,760;"- I really do."
02:13,760;02:14,600;"- Okay."
02:14,600;02:16,760;"- 'Cause I legit thought Andy was lying."
02:16,760;02:17,600;"(laughing)"
02:17,600;02:19,760;"Until like just when we nuts on your face."
02:19,760;02:21,880;"And honestly, you could be just some duty hired."
02:21,880;02:22,720;"I don't know."
02:22,720;02:23,560;"(laughing)"
02:23,560;02:24,400;"I wouldn't put that above Andy,"
02:24,400;02:28,320;"We'll see if I got my money's worth. Yeah. How did you find out?"
02:28,320;02:33,960;"Mostly because like I said half hour commute to work nowadays"
02:33,960;02:37,320;"Started a new job in July"
02:37,320;02:41,760;"I was originally living I grew up in Maine and I just moved to Massachusetts in July"
02:41,760;02:44,280;"I was looking for a podcast"
02:44,280;02:47,840;"Plus to you on those like longer ish commutes"
02:47,840;02:51,040;"and I"
02:51,160;02:55,800;"I found just stumbled upon it and I was just like this is awesome going all the way from like 2001"
02:55,800;03:02,040;"Probably dating myself, but like I was 10 years old when the 2001 season started so"
03:02,040;03:09,560;"um that was like the pinnacle like me starting to become a fan of of knowing the sports and especially the Patriots"
03:09,560;03:11,240;"so"
03:11,240;03:13,240;"I was cooked. Yeah"
03:13,240;03:18,200;"Have had all the super bowl highlight DVDs from like 2001 3 and 4 and even to now"
03:18,600;03:22,360;"three games to glory. Exactly. And I read them over and over."
03:22,360;03:27,480;"Christmas baby. Yeah, we did. We used to get those for Christmas. One of us we"
03:27,480;03:31,400;"got from Santa Claus. It was a gift to all of us. It was. Absolutely."
03:31,400;03:39,880;"Yeah, those are great. All right. So did you listen to the first episode first or did you"
03:39,880;03:44,280;"know? And you can listen to that one. He said, you know what? I should listen to more of these."
03:46,120;03:47,640;"He's the one. He's the only one."
03:47,640;03:50,600;"Him and Ma."
03:50,600;03:54,440;"I was like, I was just sort of intrigued at first at the first,"
03:54,440;03:58,840;"with the first episode. I was like, okay, they're going to just like kind of like touch on this"
03:58,840;04:02,680;"and then like kind of move on, but like the dossier hole. And I was like, no, it's the whole game."
04:02,680;04:06,040;"So, but I ended up enjoying that still."
04:06,040;04:11,640;"And you guys got to go in depth sometime with some of the things I kind of forgot from those games."
04:11,640;04:14,680;"Yeah, that's kind of the reason I started this was because"
04:14,680;04:21,120;"Because for the website, I was going back and pulling highlight clips from all the games."
04:21,120;04:22,120;"Yeah."
04:22,120;04:24,200;"And I'd be pulling, you know, like Tom Brady touchdown pass."
04:24,200;04:28,240;"I have to go through like every game and just pull those couple of plays."
04:28,240;04:31,480;"And as I'm doing that, I'm watching some of like the plays in these games."
04:31,480;04:33,560;"I'm thinking, this game is great."
04:33,560;04:34,560;"Why don't I remember it?"
04:34,560;04:35,560;"Right."
04:35,560;04:39,560;"Like random Thursday night jets games where the game ends in a brawl and shit like that."
04:39,560;04:40,560;"I'm like, I don't remember."
04:40,560;04:42,120;"This is fantastic."
04:42,120;04:47,400;"So it took me forever to convince the brothers that it was an idea as I thought."
04:47,400;04:49,200;"Yes, Andy, I took you two fucking minutes."
04:49,200;04:50,200;"You want it?"
04:50,200;04:51,200;"Greg doesn't know."
04:51,200;04:52,200;"I was like, all right, sure."
04:52,200;04:55,400;"You already have the microphone off of your shit."
04:55,400;04:56,400;"All right."
04:56,400;04:57,880;"That's a state though."
04:57,880;04:59,680;"God, I should have thought that through."
04:59,680;05:00,680;"Yeah, you should have."
05:00,680;05:01,680;"There we are."
05:01,680;05:02,680;"Yeah."
05:02,680;05:07,120;"I have a lot of notes about this game, including a request for you on your website."
05:07,120;05:08,120;"Oh."
05:08,120;05:09,120;"Yeah."
05:09,120;05:10,120;"And I don't think you'll be able to solve it."
05:10,120;05:14,160;"that maybe your friend from Reddit can challenge accepted."
05:14,160;05:15,160;"Okay."
05:15,160;05:21,800;"So yes, we should get into this game because this was one of those games where I'd forgotten"
05:21,800;05:26,160;"about and it's one of those games that I think you can also name as well."
05:26,160;05:27,160;"Yes."
05:27,160;05:28,640;"This is the two and two together."
05:28,640;05:29,640;"Me neither."
05:29,640;05:33,280;"I didn't realize this was a Patre's game, but this is the kissing Susie Colbo game."
05:33,280;05:34,280;"Right."
05:34,280;05:36,320;"Which I knew about that happening."
05:36,320;05:37,920;"I didn't realize it was this game until."
05:37,920;05:42,540;"It was the all time greatest sideline interview ever."
05:42,540;05:44,260;"And ever it will be hands down."
05:44,260;05:47,600;"Well, maybe not ever will be people are crazy, but definitely ever."
05:47,600;05:53,920;"In any, I mean, it's, I mean, name a, a more memorable sideline moment."
05:53,920;05:56,160;"The only one I can think of is that guy."
05:56,160;06:00,480;"He was like a Monday night game and he was, um,"
06:00,480;06:03,800;"it's in the Broncos."
06:04,840;06:09,440;"Bronco's a playing and the guy was supposed to interview the head coach"
06:09,440;06:10,600;"wherever it was at the time."
06:10,600;06:12,740;"See, the fact that it's taking you so long,"
06:12,740;06:17,360;"gave him say this, remember it means no, because you can just say, I want to kiss"
06:17,360;06:20,400;"you and everyone knows exactly what we're talking about."
06:20,400;06:21,080;"It's true."
06:21,080;06:21,560;"It's true."
06:21,560;06:26,760;"But he was like, he's having the time of his life and the right to because it"
06:26,760;06:29,800;"was ESPN's 200th broadcast."
06:29,800;06:34,440;"So they have this was a cool actual like highlights from all the different"
06:34,480;06:35,880;"Primetime games they've done."
06:35,880;06:38,400;"Yeah, I really didn't think they had to do."
06:38,400;06:43,240;"They had to do some fucking there was some huge games that happened."
06:43,240;06:45,800;"Well, it was just the great."
06:45,800;06:53,040;"It was the ESPN's 200th NFL game that they broadcast and they put up a poll."
06:53,040;06:58,200;"What was the greatest feat in an ESPN NFL game, which, you know, it's like, okay, cool."
06:58,800;07:05,520;"But it was the options where Sean Alexander scoring five touchdowns and a half."
07:05,520;07:14,960;"Fucking bananas. Flipper Anderson setting the all time receiving yards in a game record with like"
07:14,960;07:22,560;"306. Is that still Stan? Yeah. That's really. I'm pretty sure he still has it because that's"
07:22,560;07:27,760;"one of those like trivia questions that nobody gets right because the fuck is Flipper Anderson."
07:28,560;07:41,240;"I thought Calvin Johnson might have gotten close. Maybe he just got close. I think he's probably second. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I keep going. That's right. It is. Calvin Johnson's 329. 336. He wasn't even that close. Yeah."
07:41,240;07:46,920;"And then Derek Thomas had a six sack game, which wasn't his best."
07:46,920;07:53,760;"Peyton Manning threw six touchdowns in 2000 in this season, earlier in the season against the Saints."
07:54,480;07:59,520;"And then something to do with Jerry Rice, which Sean Alexander won the fan vote."
07:59,520;08:07,680;"All right, but let's get, let's give the people what they want. They want the, I want to kiss you."
08:07,680;08:12,480;"Let's not even tease it out. Let's go right for it. All right, so we're gonna, we're just"
08:12,480;08:16,640;"going to listen to tease it. So here you go. Because I have thoughts."
08:16,640;08:19,520;"What does it mean to you now on the team to struggle like?"
08:20,560;08:22,320;"It's all going to kiss you."
08:22,320;08:25,720;"I couldn't care less about the team struggling."
08:25,720;08:30,080;"What we know is we can improve."
08:30,080;08:33,240;"Chad, Miss Chad Pennington, our quarterback,"
08:33,240;08:36,200;"missed the first part of the season."
08:36,200;08:39,360;"And we struggled."
08:39,360;08:41,040;"We're looking to next season."
08:41,040;08:45,080;"We're looking to make a noise now."
08:45,080;08:47,280;"And I want to kiss you."
08:47,280;08:48,040;"Thanks, Joe."
08:48,040;08:50,040;"Yeah, huge compliment."
08:50,040;08:52,520;"Joe name it part of the fourth decade."
08:52,520;08:56,920;"Struggling, struggling, struggling."
08:56,920;08:57,600;"You."
08:57,600;08:58,360;"Thanks, Joe."
08:58,360;08:59,120;"Yeah."
08:59,120;09:00,440;"Huge compliment."
09:00,440;09:02,080;"Joe."
09:02,080;09:02,840;"I wish--"
09:02,840;09:05,560;"does anyone work out what he said as she's talking over him"
09:05,560;09:08,000;"because there's probably gold in there too."
09:08,000;09:09,240;"I tried-- I tried."
09:09,240;09:11,080;"I listened to it a bunch of different times, as you can see."
09:11,080;09:13,280;"I have it queued up, and I can go back."
09:13,280;09:15,800;"But I couldn't quite catch it."
09:15,800;09:17,080;"It's just too much other noise."
09:17,080;09:21,080;"much going on. I know, but someone somewhere to get that out, which find that because I"
09:21,080;09:27,280;"love to go around. Yeah. But in like the first one, somewhat debatable. You're like, ah,"
09:27,280;09:32,840;"shucks. That's not like, he can say it's not him at all. He comes back to it though. Yeah."
09:32,840;09:37,560;"And then my favorite part is going in for a kiss though. He definitely leaned in like,"
09:37,560;09:42,240;"yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It could just, it could be loud there. Maybe he's just couldn't hear"
09:42,240;09:46,680;"the question. I don't think so. Yeah. Well, what do you double"
09:46,680;09:50,640;"down then? Oh, yeah, nevermind. He's just being weird. He's"
09:50,640;09:54,420;"drunk as shit. And then the announces what it was like Joe"
09:54,420;10:02,840;"is a it's just a happy guy. Oh boy, is he happy? It was so"
10:02,840;10:05,680;"awkward when they went back to the booth. Yeah, gotta say you"
10:05,680;10:08,280;"got a hand to Suzie though. She was a consummate professional"
10:08,280;10:11,520;"there. Like she handled that no problem. She's a pro's pro. Oh"
10:11,520;10:12,520;"Oh God, yeah."
10:12,520;10:16,560;"Unfortunately for her, I'm sure it's not the first time some drunk through on the sidelines"
10:16,560;10:17,560;"hit on her."
10:17,560;10:18,560;"Oh, yeah."
10:18,560;10:20,560;"It's just not usually a drunk Joe Nameth."
10:20,560;10:22,200;"Yeah, it's just not a good idea."
10:22,200;10:25,240;"You're interviewing for the ESPN's 200th thing."
10:25,240;10:28,920;"I couldn't care less about the team's struggling."
10:28,920;10:34,280;"Also, on that poll, they really fucked up because they should have put that because that's"
10:34,280;10:37,240;"probably the most important thing ESPN's ever broadcast, right?"
10:37,240;10:38,240;"It is now."
10:38,240;10:40,960;"the highlight of an ESPN prime time broadcast."
10:40,960;10:42,520;"It's, I want to kiss you, Susie."
10:42,520;10:43,160;"It's that."
10:43,160;10:43,680;"Yeah."
10:43,680;10:47,320;"Well, that was my best from this game."
10:47,320;10:47,680;"So."
10:47,680;10:51,000;"I think it's all of our best."
10:51,000;10:51,200;"It's."
10:51,200;10:53,120;"Oh, man."
10:53,120;10:53,680;"Yes."
10:53,680;10:57,800;"All right, you want to give it a watchability score outside?"
10:57,800;10:58,320;"Oh, yeah."
10:58,320;10:59,440;"Joe."
10:59,440;11:02,240;"Oh, I was out of jail."
11:02,240;11:02,960;"Um."
11:02,960;11:07,840;"Out of six lumbodies, I will give this."
11:07,840;11:17,440;"like a two. The game itself wasn't. I will go three actually only because Chad Pennington"
11:17,440;11:24,600;"threw five interceptions. And that was fun to watch. The same Chad Pennington who came"
11:24,600;11:28,840;"into the league with the best touchdown interception ratio."
11:28,840;11:34,320;"I am going to give it four. For the bow therefore."
11:34,320;11:35,920;"Okay, explain yourself."
11:35,920;11:39,200;"- I had, fuck the Jets."
11:39,200;11:40,040;"- Fair?"
11:40,040;11:43,920;"- Five Pennington I&T's, even though I sneaky like Pennington."
11:43,920;11:45,280;"- Yep, I agreed."
11:45,280;11:47,800;"- A fucking classic moment that you get to rewatch"
11:47,800;11:50,520;"in its entirety of like just the cringe."
11:50,520;11:53,480;"The cringe is just when you're watching it real time too,"
11:53,480;11:54,680;"there's been so much build to it."
11:54,680;11:56,320;"Oh, it's incredible."
11:56,320;11:57,880;"- Yeah, that's true."
11:57,880;12:00,440;"- And then my boy David Givens ball down too."
12:00,440;12:02,520;"- Mm, two teams out."
12:02,520;12:05,800;"Yeah, and a sweet special teams tackle. Yeah"
12:05,800;12:10,920;"I was also gonna give it a three mostly because"
12:10,920;12:17,560;"All the big names that you think of when you think of the early Patriot dynasty defensive players all showed out in this game"
12:17,560;12:23,120;"That's true. Yeah, Ray Bull had a couple of sacks. Willy McGinnis played amazing"
12:23,120;12:24,960;"Tyler"
12:24,960;12:26,960;"INT"
12:28,320;12:30,320;"textbook yeah"
12:30,320;12:36,340;"Yeah, basically everybody that you think of made it like at least one or two outstanding plays in that game"
12:36,340;12:38,760;"That's true. Yeah, not they Samuel. I think how to"
12:38,760;12:42,280;"Yeah, so"
12:42,280;12:45,120;"Yeah, that was a that's a great call. Yeah, I think"
12:45,120;12:47,760;"Is there no one who didn't really?"
12:47,760;12:54,980;"Maybe Richard he but he's something. I don't know he was a little sacks and stuff. Yeah, and you almost had that pick as well"
12:54,980;12:57,800;"Yeah, there was there was definitely a game plan"
12:57,800;13:03,440;"And for this where you could tell the pages of practice"
13:03,440;13:06,960;"jumping slant routes, like, and like linebackers,"
13:06,960;13:09,160;"and just like jumping up and trying to knock them down."
13:09,160;13:11,360;"And they intercepted almost every single one."
13:11,360;13:14,480;"But every single interception was, well, almost every,"
13:14,480;13:17,720;"was by a linebacker batting the ball straight up in the air"
13:17,720;13:21,400;"and catching it himself, which Bruce"
13:21,400;13:23,440;"he did on the first pass of the game."
13:23,440;13:23,940;"Yes."
13:23,940;13:27,740;"And then McGinnis did the exact same thing for a pick six."
13:27,740;13:30,300;"And then Richard Seymour did and almost had his own pick"
13:30,300;13:32,940;"from like the nose tackle position."
13:32,940;13:34,540;"It's like ridiculous."
13:34,540;13:36,940;"But he was just badded up to himself sort of thing though."
13:36,940;13:40,540;"That was an incredible play by now."
13:40,540;13:40,940;"Yeah."
13:40,940;13:41,940;"Oh, yeah."
13:41,940;13:43,740;"This is peak willingness right now."
13:43,740;13:44,700;"Oh, it really is."
13:44,700;13:48,940;"And he almost had the exact same play last week"
13:48,940;13:51,140;"where he dropped in coverage and almost made the exact same snag"
13:51,140;13:51,980;"but he couldn't hang on to it."
13:51,980;13:55,060;"but he caught this one and rumbled for a touchdown."
13:55,060;13:57,780;"Do you see his little head fake at the goal line though?"
13:57,780;13:58,620;"- He does good, doesn't he?"
13:58,620;13:59,920;"- On Chad Pennington?"
13:59,920;14:00,760;"- That's the best."
14:00,760;14:01,600;"- That's the best."
14:01,600;14:03,380;"- He's going to the goal line, Pennington's coming from."
14:03,380;14:05,180;"Hey, Pennington can't tackle him."
14:05,180;14:08,220;"So, whatever, he doesn't have a head fake"
14:08,220;14:10,860;"to just juke him out of his shoes and say."
14:10,860;14:12,580;"- And Pennington's like, yeah, okay, okay, okay."
14:12,580;14:14,100;"Just, you got this."
14:14,100;14:17,540;"- It was a fucking head fake, pick six."
14:17,540;14:18,460;"Awesome."
14:18,460;14:20,940;"- It was so good, but he tipped himself."
14:20,940;14:28,140;"Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to say I, I sneakily enjoyed Chad Pennington."
14:28,140;14:31,820;"Yeah, I like Pennington too. Having said that the fact that"
14:31,820;14:35,600;"fall they had no answer for the Patriots Blitz and they just blitz blitz blitz"
14:35,600;14:40,020;"blitz. I like this game. They were like coming after the quarterback,"
14:40,020;14:43,260;"which you kind of see nowadays, but you definitely didn't see a lot of back then."
14:43,260;14:48,180;"Uh, I think you did with this defense and like oh, three oh four,"
14:48,180;14:49,340;"they could do whatever the fuck they want."
14:49,340;14:53,780;"Well, this is when they start doing that when they have that three four and they have extra linebackers and they can like play"
14:53,780;14:58,480;"Willie defensive end. Yeah, slash linebacker and it makes it really hard to tell who's coming and where"
14:58,480;15:01,480;"Andy Harrison do that same thing was"
15:01,480;15:06,760;"Hybrid safety linebacker good. His timing is so good. He would just be sprinting right at the"
15:06,760;15:12,380;"Oh my god. Yeah, it was awesome. Yeah, so I don't know. I didn't think kind of got the short end of the stick here"
15:12,380;15:17,020;"That's true. He had like no time and like people in the space constantly"
15:17,220;15:22,060;"We've actually played decent. I felt like for having five inner interceptions, obviously. Yeah"
15:22,060;15:27,660;"I mean he ran for two touchdowns and this is his they mentioned in the game. I don't know if you notice they"
15:27,660;15:30,980;"mentioned his wrist injury"
15:30,980;15:36,300;"Yes, and this is the only been back for a couple of games and that he'd been had half a season or so at this point"
15:36,300;15:44,780;"And it's because they played even the fourth preseason game and he broke his hand wasn't it on like a handoff or something"
15:44,780;15:46,480;"- I think that hey, now some freak accident,"
15:46,480;15:49,700;"like a grope freaking his arm on a field goal block."
15:49,700;15:53,300;"- Yeah, it was that sort of freak ridiculous thing."
15:53,300;15:54,140;"Yeah."
15:54,140;15:58,660;"The one thing I was not a huge fan of was the way"
15:58,660;16:00,020;"that they compared."
16:00,020;16:06,060;"They said that Chad Pennington was the best play action"
16:06,060;16:09,260;"quarterback and had the best play fake"
16:09,260;16:11,500;"outside of anybody except for Peyton Manning."
16:11,500;16:16,060;"those two are like good gods gift of the play play action."
16:16,060;16:19,740;"When Greg found out his name is Chadwick, that's what he found out."
16:19,740;16:20,580;"Was like his thing."
16:20,580;16:21,980;"He was an awesome play figure."
16:21,980;16:25,020;"And then when he broke his wrist on the handoff, he couldn't do it as well anymore."
16:25,020;16:27,060;"But he was like, that was his whole game."
16:27,060;16:28,420;"He was doing it in this game though."
16:28,420;16:28,620;"Yeah."
16:28,620;16:30,700;"He had that he was ballsy with it too."
16:30,700;16:31,380;"He would like hand it."
16:31,380;16:35,700;"He would do what you see Brady doing now, he'd hand it off and just like stand"
16:35,700;16:40,460;"with his back to the defense as if like the plays over and then he would turn"
16:40,460;16:43,380;"And then he would have a paper defender right in his face."
16:43,380;16:45,620;"Well, also they have Curtis, my favorite Martin."
16:45,620;16:46,500;"That's true."
16:46,500;16:46,780;"Yeah."
16:46,780;16:50,420;"Who hit his ninth straight thousand yard season in this game."
16:50,420;16:52,340;"Yeah."
16:52,340;16:54,260;"He was only back since Barry Sanders."
16:54,260;16:54,620;"Yes."
16:54,620;16:57,220;"To start his career with nine 1000 yard seasons."
16:57,220;16:58,340;"Barry Sanders only had 10."
16:58,340;17:00,580;"That's incredibly fucking ridiculous."
17:00,580;17:03,580;"I think Martin gets hurt maybe next year or soon."
17:03,580;17:06,460;"I think he also sort of people Curtis Martin."
17:06,460;17:08,100;"I think doesn't he leave the league?"
17:08,100;17:10,420;"I thought he let the league in rushing yards the following year."
17:10,420;17:14,420;"He gets like hurt and then he comes back. I did him when I forgave him"
17:14,420;17:20,160;"Yeah, I did I remember learning a lot and then immediately forgetting it obviously"
17:20,160;17:24,720;"Yeah, I have to say watching him now that after you forgiven him is"
17:24,720;17:27,220;"harder than"
17:27,220;17:29,740;"Watching him before when I just like yeah fucking it's the Jets"
17:29,740;17:34,540;"I hate the Jets I hate Curtis Martin not but now I'll be like I hate the Jets but Curtis Martin's cool"
17:34,540;17:39,160;"But I still want to know when overcome my hatred for the Jets when I see him I'm rooting for Curtis Martin"
17:39,900;17:49,300;"Yeah, I understand what you say, but like the emotions are much more complex now than they used to be. It's just it's no longer a straight fuck the Jets. It's fuck the Jets."
17:49,300;17:56,140;"Jack Penning things. All right. And Chris Martin's cool. I guess, but still fuck the Jets. Like it's hard to do all at once."
17:56,140;18:02,980;"I think honestly, them two and Dural Rivas are the only players will ever be like, yeah, okay. Never like that."
18:03,140;18:06,140;"Like there's three because Revis came here and won Super Bowl."
18:06,140;18:08,140;"And I know that that really made me--"
18:08,140;18:10,140;"And that took a shit ton of money to go back."
18:10,140;18:12,140;"And I know that was Jetstand so deep, deep down inside."
18:12,140;18:14,140;"So when he's doing well at the jet, you know,"
18:14,140;18:18,140;"I know that it's going to lead to him really, really kicking him right"
18:18,140;18:20,140;"in the fucking deck."
18:20,140;18:22,140;"Just like he went to the pages for one year"
18:22,140;18:24,140;"and won a Super Bowl, then we gave him a big ass contract"
18:24,140;18:25,140;"and he didn't live up to it."
18:25,140;18:26,140;"Like what the fuck?"
18:26,140;18:28,140;"Sounds like that worked out great for the past."
18:28,140;18:29,140;"Oh yeah."
18:29,140;18:31,140;"Yeah, really did."
18:31,140;18:32,220;"It really did. Yeah."
18:32,220;18:38,760;"Um, I still also have a soft spot from Eloise. Um, even though I still, I still love Drew"
18:38,760;18:41,460;"blood self, but it wasn't Graham."
18:41,460;18:44,180;"I don't know. Never been a mo guy. Yeah."
18:44,180;18:47,700;"I see what you're saying though. What about Brian Cox Steve? He was a jet for a while."
18:47,700;18:53,220;"Uh, yeah. I mean, I guess I like him, but like, you know, he wasn't as big a name as"
18:53,220;18:55,300;"one of those other guys that have sort of hit us."
18:55,300;18:57,980;"True. It was like her medwards. You are her medwards guy."
18:58,500;19:00,460;"I have no real feelings words for me boots."
19:00,460;19:01,460;"I just, I don't know."
19:01,460;19:02,460;"He's just kind of existing."
19:02,460;19:04,220;"He's a little hilarious on his press conferences."
19:04,220;19:05,140;"He's not like a great coach."
19:05,140;19:07,940;"So like, yeah, he's one of those like,"
19:07,940;19:10,780;"Ned Flanders kind of coaches, you know?"
19:10,780;19:12,340;"He's always upbeat and like,"
19:12,340;19:14,220;"they showed a little thing at the beginning of this."
19:14,220;19:18,220;"He's like, it was like pregame and he's talking to"
19:18,220;19:22,900;"whoever was miked up, it was the center, Kevin Moai."
19:22,900;19:26,940;"And he's like, he's like literally giddy before the game."
19:26,940;19:31,100;"like, I can't wait to beat these guys. Like, bro, you're you're six and eight."
19:31,100;19:35,340;"You're already out of the playoffs and you haven't beaten the Patriots in a while."
19:35,340;19:37,780;"Like basically since Brady showed up."
19:37,780;19:42,180;"So fucking take it down a notch. Right."
19:42,180;19:45,180;"I don't know. I'm just not a fan of that type of coach."
19:45,180;19:47,020;"I'm a Bellagie."
19:47,020;19:49,740;"I was going to get there. There are maybe you just find it."
19:49,740;19:52,660;"Other people might stop shit. No."
19:52,660;19:54,660;"My pocket."
19:54,660;19:55,500;"You want to fuck? I want."
19:55,500;20:00,860;"Who's my her and Edwards podcast? Is it speaking of shit?"
20:00,860;20:04,940;"Mom, people, did you see that cow ripkin cameo in this?"
20:04,940;20:07,740;"No. Yeah. That was awesome."
20:07,740;20:12,260;"Dude, they were pushing the whole 200th game like real hard."
20:12,260;20:17,300;"And like, I guess one commentator had been there all 200 games and I didn't"
20:17,300;20:18,940;"know who who he was."
20:18,940;20:20,220;"Yeah."
20:20,220;20:21,260;"Are you still there?"
20:21,260;20:22,220;"Yeah."
20:22,220;20:23,220;"Who the heck is that?"
20:23,220;20:25,620;"And no, he was the original."
20:25,620;20:27,460;"I don't think he was."
20:27,460;20:31,420;"It was him and did they give one of the commentators like cows like, hey, you've done"
20:31,420;20:32,060;"two other games."
20:32,060;20:34,580;"I did fucking 3000 suck it."
20:34,580;20:36,860;"And he did a map on the whiteboard and they gave it to them."
20:36,860;20:37,260;"Yeah."
20:37,260;20:38,100;"That's all."
20:38,100;20:38,540;"I don't know."
20:38,540;20:40,580;"Who do the what was the commentators name that they gave?"
20:40,580;20:42,660;"Like, hey, congrats on 200 straight games."
20:42,660;20:43,500;"That's Paul McGuire."
20:43,500;20:44,140;"Yeah."
20:44,140;20:45,340;"And like, no, so forget."
20:45,340;20:46,460;"Yeah, I guess."
20:46,460;20:49,940;"I mean, he's like the voice of ESPN football, but OK."
20:49,940;20:51,700;"He's no, he's forgettable."
20:52,620;20:54,260;"Well, he's supposed to be the play by play guy."
20:54,260;20:56,980;"God is not bad."
20:56,980;21:00,380;"But yeah, they had that the other guy on who, I guess, was the original color"
21:00,380;21:02,460;"commentator guy and he was brutal."
21:02,460;21:03,380;"Yeah."
21:03,380;21:06,540;"It was felt like a company guy on to just like a lot of it was forced down."
21:06,540;21:10,220;"And actually, this is a good point, a good place to get to my request."
21:10,220;21:14,860;"Because there was a David Givens touchdown in this game where he runs the"
21:14,860;21:20,340;"end and out apparently and you can't see it on the broadcast."
21:20,940;21:27,140;"And I was like, oh, maybe they'll show a replay because, you know, obviously a Tom Brady touchdown pass, of course, you show a replay of a touchdown pass."
21:27,140;21:27,500;"Yeah."
21:27,500;21:32,140;"And they're trying so hard to fit so much fucking 200 content, then they immediately cut the commercial."
21:32,140;21:32,940;"It's so true."
21:32,940;21:35,340;"And I was like, come on, where's my replay?"
21:35,340;21:36,000;"Nope."
21:36,000;21:37,380;"Is it out there?"
21:37,380;21:38,240;"Does it exist?"
21:38,240;21:38,700;"Nope."
21:38,700;21:40,940;"Was all 22 tape back then?"
21:40,940;21:44,380;"Uh, no, I think that starts in 2009."
21:44,380;21:48,540;"Oh, it's available to the public on NFL game pass."
21:48,540;21:49,900;"So."
21:50,740;21:52,300;"So we'll never see that touchdown pass."
21:52,300;21:57,400;"Uh, not unless the pages themselves released their own all 22, which they"
21:57,400;21:59,200;"probably have, because they probably have it."
21:59,200;22:01,380;"Uh, is it on the website?"
22:01,380;22:03,740;"The touchdown?"
22:03,740;22:04,260;"Yeah."
22:04,260;22:05,000;"The touchdown will be."
22:05,000;22:08,500;"And when this airs, the rest of the highlights will be too."
22:08,500;22:10,600;"Oh, it's like weird."
22:10,600;22:12,580;"Not showing the site."
22:12,580;22:14,660;"Okay."
22:14,660;22:15,760;"Cool."
22:15,760;22:18,400;"We'll just throw the site on the bus right now."
22:18,400;22:19,000;"I'm watching it right now."
22:19,000;22:19,440;"Thanks, Steve."
22:19,440;22:25,220;"You can't see you can't see the thumbnail of the video. You can't see the pattern by David Givens"
22:25,220;22:29,560;"And this second touchdown Givens is balling out in this game"
22:29,560;22:33,800;"He did a fantastic game. He did he did he"
22:33,800;22:39,140;"It helped that they didn't really cover him much the Jets defense"
22:39,140;22:42,320;"This just it okay"
22:42,760;22:45,400;"Pat's hit some like jugular plays like the"
22:45,400;22:50,920;"Immediate interception on the first play of the game the next play was a 35 yard bomb to give in yeah"
22:50,920;22:56,780;"Anybody where he was it's uncovered like as soon as the turnover washed the shot to the jugular"
22:56,780;23:00,680;"Yeah, especially for in there there have the field. Yeah, that was very familiar"
23:00,680;23:05,820;"They'll point where you like when you were watching games last few seasons you could call it when it happened like all right"
23:05,820;23:09,280;"Yeah, turn over and you're in their territory first plays a deep shot"
23:10,060;23:17,100;"Every time every time I still worked half the time and then his also special teams tackle was the we score touchdown"
23:17,100;23:20,040;"And they had a big return out to the 40. He was about to break it"
23:20,040;23:25,920;"He got up. He got the edge on them and he was about to turn up field and just like it would be him versus a kicker"
23:25,920;23:28,540;"And giving cotton from behind. I didn't realize I was given"
23:28,540;23:31,380;"Yep, now. Yeah, I'm like you've been speaking special team"
23:31,380;23:37,320;"You must have come all the across the field and we caught him on the gunner side. You know who did make a special teams tackle in this"
23:38,460;23:43,860;"The first time I've heard his name Tully Bantique. Oh, yeah, there was a DBC side. Yep, right early"
23:43,860;24:00,600;"Yeah, Greg and Kelly met him at like a house party and that was when Kelly did the credit card to him"
24:00,600;24:04,220;"Sliding her hands through his butt"
24:04,220;24:05,220;"Yeah, dance floor."
24:05,220;24:09,420;"Do you recall that from one of the episodes?"
24:09,420;24:13,100;"So yeah, I think we know people who know him."
24:13,100;24:16,060;"So now that he's officially on the team, we'll see if we can."
24:16,060;24:17,580;"Yeah, he's shown us earlier."
24:17,580;24:22,060;"He played earlier this season against the Dolphins, I'm pretty sure."
24:22,060;24:23,900;"This is not our first TBC sighting."
24:23,900;24:26,060;"Well, I'm assuming it's not."
24:26,060;24:29,900;"Otherwise the fact that we talked about him wouldn't have happened."
24:29,900;24:30,900;"Yes, you're right."
24:30,900;24:34,180;"But now that he's like officially at this point on the team, we'll see."
24:34,180;24:37,940;"We'll see if we can get ahold of them and get them on the pond and see what he thinks"
24:37,940;24:40,100;"of like credit card."
24:40,100;24:43,500;"You know, ask those hard questions."
24:43,500;24:44,900;"Oh man."
24:44,900;24:46,540;"All right."
24:46,540;24:47,540;"Yeah."
24:47,540;24:48,540;"Let's see."
24:48,540;24:52,260;"Any other highlights from this game?"
24:52,260;24:56,700;"The law interception was a particular highlight for me."
24:56,700;24:58,340;"Tyler in general in this game was a highlight."
24:58,340;24:59,340;"Yeah."
24:59,340;25:02,940;"I know Greg should watch this game because this is an excellent dialogue game because"
25:02,940;25:05,440;"He's clearly fucked up."
25:05,440;25:07,740;"Dude, everywhere he's walking, he's limping."
25:07,740;25:10,140;"And then when the play is going, he's sprinting."
25:10,140;25:12,060;"And then when the play is done, he's limping."
25:12,060;25:13,500;"He's been doing that the entire season."
25:13,500;25:14,620;"He's going on for weeks,"
25:14,620;25:16,540;"and it's especially pronounced in this game."
25:16,540;25:18,840;"And I actually saw this coming"
25:18,840;25:21,180;"because they ran like a sweep to tie-law side,"
25:21,180;25:22,860;"and he makes a tackle on Curtis Martin."
25:22,860;25:23,700;"Yes."
25:23,700;25:25,180;"And then they immediately run the fake"
25:25,180;25:27,180;"'cause I know the third down blitz is coming."
25:27,180;25:29,300;"So they go one-on-one tie-law throw the deep shot"
25:29,300;25:30,980;"into the end zone."
25:30,980;25:36,240;"ties coverage is absolutely perfect runs the route for the receiver kind of"
25:36,240;25:37,600;"both of bounds a little bit."
25:37,600;25:39,540;"It makes the interception in the corner of the end zone."
25:39,540;25:40,500;"Turn over."
25:40,500;25:43,240;"I was like, and this is the second time they've tried to do that to him."
25:43,240;25:46,040;"And the first time he did the exact same thing, but didn't catch the ball."
25:46,040;25:46,820;"Yeah."
25:46,820;25:49,280;"He's been, he was awesome in this game."
25:49,280;25:49,700;"Yeah."
25:49,700;25:54,920;"But he had, he's been limping this entire season, including the, like even all"
25:54,920;26:00,600;"the way back in the Titans game where he had the game ceiling pick six where he"
26:00,600;26:06,920;"caught it and then sprinted like 60 yards and then the last 10 yards he limped into the end zone"
26:06,920;26:10,760;"when he knew he wasn't going to get caught. Like he's just one of those guys he's uh"
26:10,760;26:15,560;"I feel like it's kind of similar the way that Belichick would talk about Lauren's Taylor"
26:15,560;26:20,680;"where he knew when to turn it on. So he wasn't always going 100% all the time but he knew what"
26:20,680;26:23,800;"he needed to turn on the jets to make it actually happen."
26:25,800;26:34,440;"I'm speaking of players showing up when hurt. Did you guys see the Lawrence Taylor, like when"
26:34,440;26:40,120;"they were doing the whole ESPN 200 with like the horn labor room? Oh my god. Yeah."
26:40,120;26:46,200;"The match pack and he had three sacks like fucking ridiculous. Like I wouldn't even be"
26:46,200;26:53,320;"I'd be done. I'd be laying down watching the game. Oh my god. I I'd be telling my wife to shoot me."
26:53,320;26:55,680;"Like just just fucking end my life right now."
26:55,680;26:56,680;"I will never recover."
26:56,680;26:58,040;"You can still any random person."
26:58,040;26:59,240;"We're all game."
26:59,240;27:01,080;"It was fucking."
27:01,080;27:05,320;"But she's closest."
27:05,320;27:05,960;"Yeah."
27:05,960;27:09,360;"She has the most reason."
27:09,360;27:10,520;"This is why I carry a gun on me."
27:10,520;27:11,400;"That's whoever's closest."
27:11,400;27:17,320;"Hey, just if I ever if I ever tear my pack off my fucking bone, you can just use this."
27:17,320;27:21,400;"But yeah, no, yeah, he finished the game with fucking three sacks."
27:21,400;27:23,120;"Oh my God."
27:23,120;27:26,280;"the pick six they showed him on the highlight of the 200."
27:26,280;27:29,600;"It's very similar to the Willie and the Teddy pick sixes."
27:29,600;27:30,160;"It did."
27:30,160;27:32,960;"And some Patriots was the first ever ESPN game."
27:32,960;27:34,360;"Yeah, the fix six."
27:34,360;27:39,600;"I was just going to say, no, the well, the first ever game was just a regular"
27:39,600;27:43,000;"interception by him, but it was I wrote it down somewhere."
27:43,000;27:49,360;"So definitely seals the game with the intersection because he runs right out"
27:49,360;27:52,160;"of bounds and is just like flipping out like he just won the game."
27:52,160;27:52,760;"Yeah."
27:52,760;27:59,080;"Yeah, the first game was 1987, Pass vs Giants."
27:59,080;28:03,000;"And it was the highlight they showed with Steve Grogan getting picked off by Lawrence"
28:03,000;28:04,800;"Taylor."
28:04,800;28:07,520;"And guess who was the defensive coordinator for those giants?"
28:07,520;28:08,520;"Yeah, it's got to be B.B."
28:08,520;28:10,920;"Yeah, it's got to be really Bill Belichick too."
28:10,920;28:11,920;"Yeah, yeah."
28:11,920;28:16,640;"This was like one of his first years as a defensive coordinator."
28:16,640;28:23,640;"So he was coaching the first ever and the 200th ESPN NFL game."
28:23,640;28:26,440;"Wow, that's a good stat, Andy."
28:26,440;28:27,440;"Right."
28:27,440;28:28,880;"Surprise, I didn't show that."
28:28,880;28:32,080;"And he's probably coached like the 300th and the 400th as well."
28:32,080;28:33,080;"Probably true."
28:33,080;28:35,320;"So in 2003 here, buddy."
28:35,320;28:36,320;"Still fucking going."
28:36,320;28:37,320;"Right."
28:37,320;28:38,320;"Oh my goodness."
28:38,320;28:41,120;"I did actually really enjoy all those clips."
28:41,120;28:44,960;"There was a lot of great ones, like Steve Largent laying out."
28:44,960;28:47,360;"Yes. That's Steve Largent."
28:47,360;28:48,660;"It's incredible."
28:48,660;28:49,660;"Yeah."
28:49,660;28:52,860;"And then forcing the fumble and then recovering it himself on the intersection."
28:52,860;28:53,860;"Yeah."
28:53,860;28:55,360;"That's part of the perfectly."
28:55,360;28:56,360;"The guy was our runner."
28:56,360;28:57,360;"Just didn't see him."
28:57,360;28:59,920;"And it was kind of like a blind side block, but he didn't hit him with his head, got"
28:59,920;29:03,360;"him shoulder right in the gut, put the ball out and then played."
29:03,360;29:07,560;"And I think they mentioned that like that guy had laid Steve Largent out earlier in the"
29:07,560;29:08,560;"game too."
29:08,560;29:11,260;"Oh, that was retribution, which is even better."
29:11,260;29:16,660;"other tidbits was Sean Alexander had his high school number retired while he's still in high school"
29:16,660;29:23,160;"Sanders 200 yard game in a half"
29:23,160;29:26,880;"Ran for 200 yards in the second half against the bucks"
29:26,880;29:37,180;"This game was very watchable though because it wasn't just Patriots Jets in week 17"
29:37,180;29:42,300;"It was like a bunch of shit in it and there was like a ton of like blasts from the past highlights"
29:42,300;29:45,860;"So you are gonna watch one game. This one's actually a pretty good one to watch. Yeah, that's true"
29:45,860;29:47,260;"Yeah"
29:47,260;29:52,220;"The one thing I thought they missed on was they miked up Kevin. Why the center?"
29:52,220;29:55,660;"because"
29:55,660;29:57,660;"before the game"
29:57,660;30:04,020;"Ted Washington who remember broke his leg the last time these two teams played"
30:04,540;30:06,780;"Apparently called out Moai to say that"
30:06,780;30:12,700;"like Moai did it on purpose and it was a dirty hit and he broke his leg on purpose"
30:12,700;30:17,260;"and so they're like oh and I'm like up Moai and like see if there's any beef and so"
30:17,260;30:21,340;"And then like right at the beginning Moai goes over to him like before they gave him stars"
30:21,340;30:23,500;"Or like the first drive or something. It's like yeah"
30:23,500;30:26,460;"I know what people were saying. I just want you to know that like I didn't do it on purpose"
30:26,460;30:29,500;"and then they like dab hands and that was it."
30:29,500;30:32,860;"And I was anticlimactic"
30:34,300;30:36,860;"You know, there goes that angle for the game."
30:36,860;30:39,500;"Yeah, but then they showed like one other."
30:39,500;30:46,700;"They went back to one other time just to show like how much Moai talks during"
30:46,700;30:48,700;"like while he's lining up the plane, everything."
30:48,700;30:51,820;"And he's literally talking the entire time to the point where I don't know how he"
30:51,820;30:52,820;"can even hear the snap."
30:52,820;30:55,180;"Like he's just yelling the entire time."
30:55,180;30:58,060;"Like that's going to be super distracting."
30:58,060;31:02,500;"Plus if like Haddington is also making adjustments or audibles, like, how are they"
31:02,500;31:03,740;"not like talking over each other?"
31:03,740;31:07,300;"Yeah, I don't get it. He's just yelling the entire time. Okay, Andy."
31:07,300;31:12,780;"Quick question. Was the best mic that moment of all time also in ESPN?"
31:12,780;31:17,640;"All right, you tell me. You know what I'm talking about, right? Also a Patriots"
31:17,640;31:22,820;"chess game. Oh, I think that was, I'm assuming you're talking about the seeing"
31:22,820;31:28,580;"ghost moment. Yes. Yes. And I have to say, I have to say that was the SP and"
31:28,940;31:33,900;"Sweet. We're delivering also. We're delivering. I want to kiss you, Susie. We're delivering"
31:33,900;31:40,380;"seeing goes we're fucking must watch ESPN TV. Yeah. If patrons and jets are playing on ESPN,"
31:40,380;31:45,420;"use your broad tune in. Oh, they didn't do the but fun movie and that would have been legit."
31:45,420;31:51,820;"Okay. That's so many embarrassing time time. You're right. Yeah."
31:51,820;31:57,100;"So prime time. Not just because they lost, but also their franchise icon is out there just"
31:57,900;32:00,700;"being real. Getting real."
32:00,700;32:05,580;"Hey, dude, what are you? Oh, you're wearing a Jeff Drizzy too."
32:05,580;32:11,980;"Yeah, that's the best part. Literally saying I couldn't care less about the team struggling."
32:11,980;32:18,620;"I showed that clip to my girlfriend and she was like more upset that he's like,"
32:18,620;32:22,780;"he played for them. And why would he say he doesn't care about them struggling?"
32:22,780;32:26,140;"Right, because he's drunk and he wants Susie Colver."
32:26,700;32:29,580;"I didn't give a shit about anything in life at that point."
32:29,580;32:31,100;"Just shooting a shot."
32:31,100;32:31,700;"Yeah."
32:31,700;32:33,700;"I mean, everybody, you got to do it, I guess."
32:33,700;32:34,060;"All right."
32:34,060;32:37,180;"I have a fun Tom Brady fact."
32:37,180;32:37,780;"All right."
32:37,780;32:39,820;"That I learned in this game."
32:39,820;32:41,180;"I don't know if you picked up on it."
32:41,180;32:41,700;"I may have."
32:41,700;32:43,020;"The commentators, actually."
32:43,020;32:44,780;"And then Andy, we can go into your grievance"
32:44,780;32:46,060;"as I actually have a bunch as well."
32:46,060;32:49,020;"[LAUGHS]"
32:49,020;32:50,100;"OK."
32:50,100;32:52,740;"Tom Brady doesn't make the Pro Bowl this year."
32:52,740;32:53,500;"That is correct."
32:53,500;32:54,420;"He doesn't."
32:54,420;33:00,500;"They showed the the guys who did where the thing it took it was so pro"
33:00,500;33:02,860;"bowl quarterbacks the AFC selections."
33:02,860;33:06,120;"Peyton Manning, Steve McNair, Trent Green."
33:06,120;33:08,780;"Wasn't one of you giving me shit about Trent Green not being good?"
33:08,780;33:09,340;"Yeah, we were."
33:09,340;33:10,700;"We were telling your telling us bad."
33:10,700;33:11,300;"He's not good."
33:11,300;33:13,980;"So pro ball quarterback Trent Green."
33:13,980;33:14,460;"Yeah."
33:14,460;33:16,380;"Clearly this pro bowl is a mistake."
33:16,380;33:19,460;"How are you going to put Trent Green over Tom Brady who wins the Super Bowl?"
33:19,460;33:19,780;"All right."
33:19,780;33:21,380;"Let me let me give you quarterback."
33:21,380;33:22,060;"Get quarterback."
33:22,060;33:22,740;"Be a number."
33:22,740;33:24,360;"give a shit. Let's keep moving."
33:24,360;33:27,160;"I don't care for your stats."
33:27,160;33:28,640;"Twenty three touch down."
33:28,640;33:29,080;"Seven."
33:29,080;33:30,080;"Deceptions."
33:30,080;33:32,600;"You can do numbers."
33:32,600;33:34,280;"I'm going by gut buddy."
33:34,280;33:35,460;"Frank Green through."
33:35,460;33:37,280;"No, you are in win streak."
33:37,280;33:37,720;"Tom Brage."
33:37,720;33:38,680;"More touchdowns."
33:38,680;33:40,800;"Win three less interceptions."
33:40,800;33:44,040;"Trent Green was undefeated"
33:44,040;33:45,040;"up until we can."
33:45,040;33:47,880;"In the NFC dummy."
33:47,880;33:48,880;"And then he loses a bunch."
33:48,880;33:50,700;"Yeah."
33:50,700;33:51,600;"Yeah. So well, yeah."
33:51,600;33:54,660;"The, uh, the Chiefs were undefeated up until a few weeks ago."
33:54,660;33:57,300;"And now they've lost like, yeah, two or three in a row."
33:57,300;34:01,360;"So that's why the Patriots are alone in first place in the AOC right now."
34:01,360;34:05,600;"Because the Chiefs just, they'd already lost this week when we were playing this game."
34:05,600;34:06,600;"So they had, yeah."
34:06,600;34:08,400;"Even if we had lost, we still would have been in first place."
34:08,400;34:08,940;"Yeah."
34:08,940;34:09,640;"Exactly."
34:09,640;34:14,700;"But as we know, because this is a history podcast, okay, if it's"
34:14,700;34:18,260;"don't do a whole lot of losing in this, this timeframe, it is an awesome"
34:18,260;34:20,580;"turning everything in the game on and knowing you're going to win."
34:20,580;34:21,280;"Yeah."
34:21,280;34:23,760;"Yeah, it's made this podcast a whole lot easier"
34:23,760;34:30,560;"The one thing that I found interesting though about this win streak that they talked about in this game too was that"
34:30,560;34:38,160;"The Patriots are the first team in the NFL history to in 10 straight games by 14 or fewer points"
34:38,160;34:44,400;"And that would be 11 after this because they won this which we should have said the beginning 21 to 16"
34:44,400;34:50,160;"So another squeaker of a game, but they haven't blown anybody out"
34:50,160;34:52,160;"We fix that next week."
34:52,160;34:53,320;"- Well, okay, that's true."
34:53,320;34:54,320;"(laughs)"
34:54,320;34:58,280;"- Also, sorry, may you have a sip on your toast, Steve?"
34:58,280;34:59,520;"I'll let you go. - No, I can't get."
34:59,520;35:04,200;"This was the franchise record win total."
35:04,200;35:06,680;"And everyone will be because the Jaguars"
35:06,680;35:10,760;"was the new franchise record in wins."
35:10,760;35:13,160;"- Really?"
35:13,160;35:14,000;"- Which is crazy people."
35:14,000;35:16,640;"That JAGS win was the most, they'd ever won"
35:16,640;35:18,800;"in a season in the history of the franchise."
35:18,800;35:23,440;"So they'd never been better than 11 and 5."
35:23,440;35:24,440;"- Correct."
35:24,440;35:25,280;"- Wow."
35:25,280;35:27,360;"- And they beat the Jaguars."
35:27,360;35:28,400;"- Now is their 12th one, yeah."
35:28,400;35:29,240;"- Isn't that crazy?"
35:29,240;35:31,920;"And like, we're gonna, I mean, there's still more to come."
35:31,920;35:32,760;"(laughing)"
35:32,760;35:35,080;"- That's the thing about a shit."
35:35,080;35:37,280;"Like 11, that's what people like, I guess,"
35:37,280;35:39,240;"you know, you look at this era."
35:39,240;35:42,080;"And before that, they even won 11 games in a year."
35:42,080;35:42,920;"- Right."
35:42,920;35:43,760;"- And everyone's freaking out."
35:43,760;35:46,280;"Like, oh my God, we didn't make the playoffs."
35:46,280;35:48,040;"Cam knew we can't do a touchdown."
35:48,040;35:50,760;"Yeah, like welcome to the first 40 years of franchise buddy"
35:50,760;35:57,320;"Oh, sorry Andy you can go ahead no go ahead"
35:57,320;36:05,780;"Um, I was just gonna say to you another interesting step from this game was that they did not have a 100 yard rush"
36:05,780;36:09,640;"Yeah, yeah, there's season until this game"
36:09,640;36:16,120;"So play and that's surprising when you watch them all but it is yeah, it's cool. It's just like Jesus week"
36:16,120;36:30,120;"It was a 16 out. Yeah. Yeah. He announces a douchebags about it, too. There's their hundred yard Russia like fuck you, buddy. It's like actually doing good. We should all be like celebrating this. What happened?"
36:30,120;36:46,100;"I wrote down. I answered my list running like it's 2001 again. What was this down? Because he had an 8.6 yard per carry at some point. Yeah, he was through the first half of the thing. You 10 carries three or six yards and you finished with 18 carries for 121, which is six and a half."
36:46,100;36:50,180;"off yards per carry. That's awesome. It's great. He was playing pretty well. He was like,"
36:50,180;36:53,300;"well, I think they figured out that he's in with the very beginning of house and he's"
36:53,300;37:01,300;"pretty good. Also back half the house. He's too tired. He's a socks also, uh, having him"
37:01,300;37:09,620;"run against the 31st ranked run defense. Yeah. Also helps for sure. Yeah. Yeah. Um,"
37:09,620;37:17,140;"factor. Yeah, so but hey, he looked good. He looked like the Antoine Smith of old, which was hard to do."
37:17,140;37:25,180;"Does he like keep it going throughout the maybe, you know, sort of spoiling? But they keep it, keep it going"
37:25,180;37:27,700;"throughout the rest of the season into the postseason?"
37:27,700;37:33,620;"I don't know. I can't remember. But I would think not. There's nothing to say that he does. There's"
37:33,620;37:34,820;"absolutely no evidence."
37:34,820;37:36,580;"Yeah, I have no"
37:36,580;37:38,260;"any good memories of the"
37:38,260;37:40,340;"2003 season of Antoine Smith."
37:40,340;37:41,620;"At all."
37:41,620;37:42,980;"Well, I can go to a bad."
37:42,980;37:44,100;"I just can't think of any"
37:44,100;37:45,620;"Antoine Smith players."
37:45,620;37:46,460;"I was off my head and he's"
37:46,460;37:47,060;"he's playoff."
37:47,060;37:50,220;"So my guess is probably not."
37:50,220;37:51,580;"Yeah."
37:51,580;37:53,220;"They were shooting on the Patriots"
37:53,220;37:54,540;"in the red zone because we do have"
37:54,540;37:56,180;"a bad red zone offense saying the"
37:56,180;37:56,580;"home."
37:56,580;37:58,020;"They can't run the ball because"
37:58,020;37:59,740;"they were as Antoine's on his way"
37:59,740;38:00,420;"to under a game."
38:00,420;38:01,420;"They can't run the ball."
38:01,820;38:09,220;"And the only other worse offense in the league is the Panthers by a fraction of a point."
38:09,220;38:11,620;"And I love what the fucking teams make the playoffs."
38:11,620;38:15,980;"Yeah, they said they said the the Patriots were 30th in red zone touchdowns."
38:15,980;38:22,420;"And I think the Giants were worse than them, but the worst in the league were the Carolina Panthers."
38:22,420;38:27,940;"And of those three teams, two of them will make the playoffs and one of them will be the Giants."
38:27,940;38:29,900;"You know the Panthers play us this year?"
38:29,900;38:31,740;"Yeah, so they'll make the Super Bowl."
38:31,740;38:32,740;"Not the playoffs."
38:32,740;38:34,140;"There you go."
38:34,140;38:36,740;"Fucking stepped on that one, didn't I?"
38:36,740;38:37,740;"Oh, well."
38:37,740;38:42,740;"That's going to be a statistical anomaly where two of the worst red zone because it generally"
38:42,740;38:46,380;"correlates where the better you are in the red zone, the better record you are."
38:46,380;38:47,380;"It's true."
38:47,380;38:52,740;"And this is like the bottom half of the bottom bottom of the league in the Super Bowl."
38:52,740;38:56,180;"Yeah, I wonder if that Super Bowl was like a high score."
38:56,180;38:58,580;"I got a fair like 30s in the second half."
38:58,580;39:02,320;"I wonder if Red Zone defense plays a part in that too though, because the page that"
39:02,320;39:04,200;"one of the best red zone defenses in the league."
39:04,200;39:08,760;"I think the Panthers also had one of the best red zone defenses to that year."
39:08,760;39:09,800;"Yeah."
39:09,800;39:11,880;"They had a great defensive line if I recall."
39:11,880;39:13,780;"I will find that soon, but right."
39:13,780;39:18,120;"Uh, I will say it was great to see Troy Brown back."
39:18,120;39:20,120;"I've been missing him this season."
39:20,120;39:24,520;"They didn't do a lot, but you know, every time Brady drops back to pass and it's"
39:24,520;39:27,960;"third down, like you know, where this ball's going and it works every time."
39:28,120;39:29,440;"Troy Brown first down done."
39:29,440;39:34,440;"Classic where he just gets every single fucking yard possible."
39:34,440;39:35,600;"Even if there's nothing there."
39:35,600;39:36,040;"Yeah."
39:36,040;39:36,920;"All of those."
39:36,920;39:37,600;"Yeah."
39:37,600;39:38,040;"Yeah."
39:38,040;39:40,440;"Those pun returns to take 20 minutes for him to gain three yards."
39:40,440;39:41,120;"Love it."
39:41,120;39:43,240;"They're my favorite."
39:43,240;39:46,320;"Oh, um, Bethel Johnson."
39:46,320;39:47,920;"Another great name."
39:47,920;39:48,920;"He's out of the dog house."
39:48,920;39:53,000;"Apparently he didn't play last week, not due to injury, but because he"
39:53,000;39:54,680;"didn't prep for the game well enough."
39:54,680;39:55,520;"So he said, not fuck it."
39:55,520;39:57,640;"You're sitting, which I didn't realize."
39:57,640;39:58,480;"Yeah."
39:58,480;40:00,560;"But as soon as they put them back in,"
40:00,560;40:02,480;"I think they started almost every drive"
40:02,480;40:03,880;"at their own 40-yard line."
40:03,880;40:05,840;"- Well, they sort of bush kicking to him."
40:05,840;40:08,680;"- Yeah, yeah, they stopped kicking to him at all."
40:08,680;40:10,120;"Which is a wise decision."
40:10,120;40:12,720;"And the commentary's even brought up the fact,"
40:12,720;40:15,120;"'cause there was one second left and a half"
40:15,120;40:17,320;"and the Jets had just kicked the field goal."
40:17,320;40:19,920;"The six seconds left and the Jets had just kicked"
40:19,920;40:21,400;"the field goal."
40:21,400;40:24,400;"And they're like, well, the Colts know what to do here."
40:24,400;40:26,160;"No, well, what not to do here,"
40:26,160;40:31,520;"because fucking they kicked it off to, to, to Bethel Johnson, who then just promptly"
40:31,520;40:33,560;"returned it for a touchdown."
40:33,560;40:37,640;"Beating Mike Vanderjak to the noted athlete and not just a kicker."
40:37,640;40:38,640;"Yeah."
40:38,640;40:41,120;"Fucking manager."
40:41,120;40:43,200;"Oh, man."
40:43,200;40:49,280;"And there was also one other story that they didn't really touch on."
40:49,280;40:55,160;"I thought they would because this plays a part down the road."
40:55,160;41:02,200;"And I found it in this book that I actually got for free."
41:02,200;41:05,600;"But this is, Steve knows about this book."
41:05,600;41:14,680;"It's a book by Bob Hildberg and it's called ""Relive Patriots History."""
41:14,680;41:21,880;"And I'm pretty sure it's self-published, but this book is the nerdiest thing I've ever"
41:21,880;41:24,420;"owned."
41:24,420;41:27,680;"And this is coming from the guy who puts together the website."
41:27,680;41:33,840;"But this is literally just like, I'm showing you guys on the screen right now of just like"
41:33,840;41:34,840;"Patriots trivia."
41:34,840;41:37,440;"Someone took a bunch of stats and put them in a book."
41:37,440;41:40,680;"It's basically, but they're just like, they're all organized and different things."
41:40,680;41:44,840;"So it's like every Patriots running back who is thrown a half back option touchdown pass"
41:44,840;41:47,160;"in a game and then list them."
41:47,160;41:48,160;"So it's just a."
41:48,160;41:52,360;"Dave Megan through a 35 yard touchdown pass to Troy Brown in their 27 24 win over the"
41:52,360;41:56,360;"the dolphins on 11 23 97. And this whole book, they had"
41:56,360;41:59,000;"highlights that they could rip by guests, they just fucking meet"
41:59,000;42:02,400;"Yeah, like this, this is this is the book version of what I've"
42:02,400;42:05,280;"done for the website. It is. And it's stupid. So I just want to"
42:05,280;42:09,880;"shout out Bob Hildberg and this book if you you can find on"
42:09,880;42:12,880;"Amazon, it's all it's out there. I might have to buy it. It's"
42:12,880;42:15,160;"a bit right. I'm right. I'm out. It's amazing. It's like a"
42:15,160;42:20,360;"textbook size book. Yeah. But when's it last updated is a real"
42:20,360;42:22,760;"question. It gets updated regularly."
42:22,760;42:25,400;"Okay. So he's consistently putting new"
42:25,400;42:27,720;"season stats in here. Yeah. It's 20-20."
42:27,720;42:32,560;"All right. Well, that's in there is wide receivers"
42:32,560;42:34,560;"that have thrown touchdown passes for the Patriots."
42:34,560;42:36,440;"I'm sure. Yeah. I'm sure there is."
42:36,440;42:38,760;"And in this game is a somewhat famous play."
42:38,760;42:41,600;"Did you pick this up?"
42:41,600;42:43,920;"infamous maybe? Yeah, infamous sure."
42:43,920;42:47,920;"I mean, it comes up many, many years later as infamous."
42:47,920;42:49,880;"Talk to me."
42:49,880;42:51,880;"Yeah, Terry, tell it."
42:51,880;42:59,880;"Well, everybody remembers from like the Baltimore Ravens playoff game, you know, the Edelman Pass to Amundola."
42:59,880;43:04,880;"And if you watch the three games to glory, like I'm sure you guys all have as well."
43:04,880;43:11,880;"They talked about how for years they wouldn't have anybody but Tom Brady throw a pass."
43:11,880;43:17,560;"pass. And the play that they bring back and the reason for that is this very play that"
43:17,560;43:22,800;"we're talking about where. I don't remember who was it David Givens who throws it was"
43:22,800;43:27,800;"yeah. He was having a great game. I get the call. It was a good throw. It's all over"
43:27,800;43:35,000;"it. So end around to David Givens who spots what he thinks is a wide open Deon branch"
43:35,000;43:40,120;"streaking down the the right side of the field. And he launches a pass which turned out to"
43:40,120;43:41,480;"be actually in double coverage."
43:41,480;43:46,880;"I guess easily picked off under throws a buy about five yards."
43:46,880;43:49,920;"I am biased, but yeah, not great."
43:49,920;43:52,400;"Not a great decision."
43:52,400;43:52,960;"Yeah."
43:52,960;43:55,160;"And they were on their side of the field too, right?"
43:55,160;43:57,440;"Like there was just after a turnover."
43:57,440;43:57,920;"Yeah."
43:57,920;44:00,960;"Was there same like the deep shot they hit the givens?"
44:00,960;44:02,800;"They're like, OK, let's get another given touchdown."
44:02,800;44:05,480;"Let's go for the jugular again with the fucking fake pass."
44:05,480;44:09,280;"I'm not going to get the logic, but Belichick clearly was like, why the fuck"
44:09,280;44:10,920;"because anybody like Tom Brady throw it."
44:10,920;44:12,440;"(laughing)"
44:12,440;44:14,400;"- Yeah, it was right after Rodney Harrison"
44:14,400;44:15,720;"picked off Chad Pennington."
44:15,720;44:18,200;"- Yeah, one of his five IITs."
44:18,200;44:19,680;"- We had turnovers to throw away,"
44:19,680;44:21,200;"so who cares, you know, might as well try."
44:21,200;44:23,760;"- And there's one, but I mean,"
44:23,760;44:25,200;"this was in the fourth quarter,"
44:25,200;44:29,320;"just after Pennington had his second touchdown"
44:29,320;44:30,560;"run to start the quarter."
44:30,560;44:32,920;"So it's 21-16 at this point."
44:32,920;44:35,240;"So it's a close game."
44:35,240;44:37,280;"- For five interceptions from Pennington,"
44:37,280;44:38,560;"the score is actually pretty close."
44:38,560;44:40,160;"And it was like close for off the game."
44:40,160;44:41,600;"That's why I think I was also watchable."
44:41,600;44:43,840;"It wasn't like an absolute blowout either."
44:43,840;44:45,120;"- Yeah, that's true."
44:45,120;44:47,520;"- And the Jets do Jets things like call a timeout"
44:47,520;44:49,880;"after an incomplete pass with less than a minute left."
44:49,880;44:51,240;"- Their last timeout, yeah."
44:51,240;44:52,080;"- Yes."
44:52,080;44:53,760;"- I'm there for the timeout left 50 seconds."
44:53,760;44:55,600;"In a complete pass, okay, okay."
44:55,600;44:57,720;"- Oh shit, we're,"
44:57,720;44:58,920;"we don't want to do that."
44:58,920;44:59,920;"- That's like, we're late, what?"
44:59,920;45:00,840;"- This is going too well."
45:00,840;45:02,480;"We need to stop and talk about it."
45:02,480;45:04,960;"- Yeah, for the last timeout, that'll fix it."
45:04,960;45:06,240;"- That was absolutely brutal."
45:06,240;45:07,440;"Any chance for them to play."
45:07,440;45:11,060;"Basically got there within a touchdown if they score there they would yeah"
45:11,060;45:23,180;"Last one I don't even remember it. I believe it was Eugene Wilson. Yes"
45:23,180;45:26,120;"Who's been bowing out this year another?"
45:26,120;45:33,520;"Greg favorite right oh, yes. Yeah, rookie Eugene Wilson and he's been teasing a game that I don't know about"
45:33,520;45:37,920;"about. I don't remember what game he's talking about. But like, there's one game"
45:37,920;45:42,560;"that's like the Eugene Wilson game. And we've got to see it. And I hope he's"
45:42,560;45:49,080;"actually on for it. Yeah, he's not going to remember. Oh, wait, that was the Eugene"
45:49,080;45:51,120;"Wilson game. We should go back and do it again."
45:51,120;45:56,800;"We are back to back to my book here. The reason I bring this up."
45:56,800;46:00,560;"We're going back to the book. Yeah, well, I brought up a lot of your show"
46:00,560;46:02,860;"I know how to read you fucking."
46:02,860;46:04,260;"- I assume you're just be like,"
46:04,260;46:05,940;"hey guys, this is a great book."
46:05,940;46:06,860;"I love snaps."
46:06,860;46:08,620;"(laughing)"
46:08,620;46:09,460;"I go on though."
46:09,460;46:10,460;"- Well yes, but also--"
46:10,460;46:12,260;"- But the snap is you get out of the book Andy,"
46:12,260;46:13,140;"come on, lay it on us."
46:13,140;46:14,900;"- So there's a story here about a guy--"
46:14,900;46:16,660;"- There's a story in this book I don't know."
46:16,660;46:21,660;"- Name Brian Kinchin, a long snapper who started"
46:21,660;46:24,500;"in this game because of the injuries"
46:24,500;46:28,500;"to the Patriots starting and backup long snappers."
46:28,500;46:29,600;"So they didn't have any."
46:29,600;46:39,000;"And so I'm a river in the book here in the 7 of 2003 Brian Kinchen was teaching a Bible class for seventh grade students at Parkview Baptist School in Baton Rouge."
46:39,000;46:43,600;"When he received a phone call from the New England Patriots, the long snapper Sean McDermott."
46:43,600;46:46,400;"What's the Sean McDermott?"
46:46,400;46:53,800;"Stat check that Steve and Lonnie Paxton were both injured and they needed someone to be their long snapper for the last two games of the season the playoffs."
46:53,800;46:59,160;"Even though Brian was 38 years old, he had 13 years experience as a long snap in the NFL"
46:59,160;47:03,720;"and spent five years with the Cleveland Browns when Bill Belichick was their head coach."
47:03,720;47:05,720;"Fucking crazy."
47:05,720;47:07,480;"That's on the book."
47:07,480;47:10,800;"He had also worked with a Patriots holder Ken Walter in Carolina."
47:10,800;47:13,800;"It had been three years since Brian had played in the NFL, but he was encouraged when one"
47:13,800;47:17,560;"of his students exclaimed, ""The Patriots 12 and 2, the best team in football, and they're"
47:17,560;47:19,440;"going to win the Super Bowl."""
47:19,440;47:23,400;"Brian made the team in practice like crazy, snapping footballs while in full uniform,"
47:23,400;47:26,000;"hundreds of times into a pillow in his hotel room."
47:26,000;47:28,160;"As much as he practiced, he still made a few bad snaps"
47:28,160;47:32,000;"in some of the Patriot playoff games, which will come across later."
47:32,000;47:35,200;"To make matters even more tense, and this is where it gets ridiculous."
47:35,200;47:38,520;"He cut his thumb with a steak knife, requiring three stitches"
47:38,520;47:43,080;"at the Patriots pre-game dinner the night before the Super Bowl."
47:43,080;47:45,720;"Yeah, let's say let's save this, Andy."
47:45,720;47:47,320;"Let's say this for the Super Bowl."
47:47,320;47:48,960;"Because this is what I've been talking about."
47:48,960;47:49,440;"That's funny."
47:49,440;47:51,280;"We saw Lonnie Paxson get hurt."
47:51,280;47:51,600;"Yeah."
47:51,600;47:54,680;"And I am looking at the Shawm of Dern."
47:54,680;47:56,240;"I don't think it's the same."
47:56,240;47:57,080;"- Okay."
47:57,080;47:59,400;"- It's just a coincidence on the--"
47:59,400;48:01,000;"- It's the same name sort of thing."
48:01,000;48:07,400;"- Tampa, Houston, New England, that's it in like 2003."
48:07,400;48:09,160;"They're from a different place."
48:09,160;48:10,320;"I don't think it's the same one."
48:10,320;48:11,160;"- All right."
48:11,160;48:14,480;"I can look it up in this book if you want."
48:14,480;48:15,760;"(laughs)"
48:15,760;48:17,960;"- Yeah, it has every single player"
48:17,960;48:19,760;"that ever played for the Patriots."
48:20,720;48:25,340;"Every single player by name. Yeah, you buy this book every year. I think you could"
48:25,340;48:30,520;"Do you this is my first one and I got it because I you've had it"
48:30,520;48:37,340;"Right for like like a month. I got around Christmas time a couple months. Yeah"
48:37,340;48:45,920;"No, this is this is new I want it from him on a Twitter thing. I answered some question correctly trivia"
48:45,920;48:49,960;"You had trivia"
48:49,960;48:53,160;"for this episode was Greg."
48:53,160;48:53,400;"No,"
48:53,400;48:54,040;"I'm McDermott."
48:54,040;48:57,560;"Only the only game he played was the last game for the Patriots."
48:57,560;48:58,200;"That was it."
48:58,200;48:59,880;"I got that ring though."
48:59,880;49:02,920;"So yeah, he did take the phone to do it was right."
49:02,920;49:03,640;"I'll take it."
49:03,640;49:03,880;"Yeah."
49:03,880;49:06,440;"I wonder if the the barnyard dogs got a ring."
49:06,440;49:09,080;"Oh, yeah, the the punter."
49:09,080;49:10,040;"Whatever his name was."
49:10,040;49:12,040;"You should have a ring the barnyard dog."
49:12,040;49:12,440;"Oh, yeah."
49:12,440;49:13,480;"Barnard Barnard dog."
49:13,480;49:15,000;"But I don't know if you I think you got cut."
49:15,000;49:16,200;"So he wasn't on the team anymore."
49:16,200;49:19,240;"Yeah, but he didn't give rings to anybody who played on the team."
49:19,240;49:22,500;"- Terry Glenn would disagree, but maybe."
49:22,500;49:26,940;"- My friends, girlfriend works with the caps, she got a ring."
49:26,940;49:29,380;"It works on like-- - Yeah, but the caps,"
49:29,380;49:32,260;"they only get one ring every 400 years."
49:32,260;49:34,580;"- It's kind of sweet, they flew everybody to Vegas"
49:34,580;49:36,660;"when they were playing in Vegas in the Stanley Cup."
49:36,660;49:38,020;"- Yeah, that's pretty cool. - For the entire company,"
49:38,020;49:39,820;"they did half each day."
49:39,820;49:42,020;"- That's amazing. - Yeah, that is amazing."
49:42,020;49:44,220;"- They had an awesome time in the day."
49:44,220;49:45,920;"They had a Stanley Cup finals and then they won,"
49:45,920;49:47,020;"and they got a fucking ring."
49:47,020;49:47,860;"Everyone got a ring."
49:47,860;49:49,900;"- It's not an awesome."
49:49,900;49:51,980;"(laughs)"
49:51,980;49:55,660;"- What we talking about?"
49:55,660;49:56,500;"- That's the best."
49:56,500;49:57,340;"- That's the most."
49:57,340;50:00,180;"- Yeah, I think that's probably a good idea."
50:00,180;50:01,540;"Follow-up party."
50:01,540;50:04,900;"All right, Steve, you wanna go first?"
50:04,900;50:08,940;"- Let me do, I'm gonna do something a little different."
50:08,940;50:12,660;"Let me do my worst first and then my best last."
50:12,660;50:13,740;"- As in like--"
50:13,740;50:14,960;"- You guys all do your best worst"
50:14,960;50:16,260;"and then I'll go first. - Okay."
50:16,260;50:17,100;"- All right, all right."
50:17,100;50:20,100;"- I'll put the words, and I'll bring us home with the best."
50:20,100;50:20,940;"- Give me a word."
50:20,940;50:23,460;"- First of the commentators, it was for how watchful this game was,"
50:23,460;50:25,740;"the fact that these fucking idiots were on there is the worst."
50:25,740;50:27,220;"(laughing)"
50:27,220;50:28,620;"- I didn't mind them."
50:28,620;50:30,540;"It was just a throw of wrench."
50:30,540;50:33,020;"- That's actually a game, they're like, ""Ooh, tie law is hurt."""
50:33,020;50:35,460;"(laughing)"
50:35,460;50:36,540;"- He's been hurt for weeks."
50:36,540;50:37,540;"(laughing)"
50:37,540;50:39,220;"- It's been hurt all season, but okay."
50:39,220;50:40,060;"Thanks for noticing."
50:40,060;50:42,060;"- We're grouping everywhere."
50:42,060;50:44,860;"They called Tom Brady the Iceman."
50:44,860;50:46,500;"Thank God that didn't fucking stick."
50:46,500;50:47,500;"That's not a good one."
50:47,500;50:49,500;"Tom, the Iceman Brady."
50:49,500;50:51,500;"You don't like that?"
50:51,500;50:54,260;"Brady is getting dragged down in the pocket."
50:54,260;50:57,500;"Just clear, intentional grounding."
50:57,500;50:58,500;"Oh, yeah."
50:58,500;50:59,500;"Communication."
50:59,500;51:00,500;"They're sleeping."
51:00,500;51:01,500;"It's going to be a DP."
51:01,500;51:03,500;"Short, through a deep."
51:03,500;51:04,500;"Definitely a clear."
51:04,500;51:06,500;"What a smart player."
51:06,500;51:07,500;"What?"
51:07,500;51:09,500;"Is everything this or what?"
51:09,500;51:12,500;"It's like they called it."
51:12,500;51:15,500;"They threw a flag."
51:15,500;51:20,420;"Yeah, they thought these quarterbacks were the best quarterbacks to ever play the position of the game"
51:20,420;51:26,120;"But they're like that these guys are always like that though, and then my biggest fucking beef. There we go"
51:26,120;51:28,480;"They call pepper Johnson fat"
51:28,480;51:31,960;"No, I couldn't do push-up. They didn't see me"
51:31,960;51:36,420;"It couldn't do push-ups because they had the willing to get his I and T where he tips it to himself"
51:36,420;51:41,460;"Yeah, yeah, and said like wow what great ball skills are like oh here's a drill he does he whips the ball at them"
51:41,460;51:42,500;"That's a great story"
51:42,500;51:45,220;"He has to do pushups and he can't do many pushups"
51:45,220;51:53,500;"He is yeah, I don't I don't think they understood the story because one guy told you know"
51:53,500;51:57,420;"It's like yeah, I obviously doesn't do many very many pushups. No, I think he doesn't want"
51:57,420;52:00,260;"Johnson because they yeah"
52:00,260;52:04,100;"For days he's jacked out of these hot eyes. Yeah"
52:04,100;52:06,620;"That was pretty good"
52:06,620;52:07,900;"Counterpoint though"
52:07,900;52:12,960;"At the beginning of the game they said Ted Washington weighs at least a pound for every day of the year"
52:12,960;52:19,500;"I thought was a great way of putting it Ted Johnson 365 like what about the leap year?"
52:19,500;52:21,740;"He was like I bet you'll get a pound"
52:21,740;52:30,540;"That is nice beautiful. That's it. They sucked. They did also say we're gonna see Michael Vick for a long long time"
52:30,540;52:35,380;"In one of his highlights, so that didn't age well"
52:36,380;52:38,380;"You can't fault them on that though."
52:38,380;52:43,960;"I mean no, but I'm going to because I'm from the future"
52:43,960;52:47,800;"All right, Terrick what you got"
52:47,800;52:53,440;"Well, I guess I'll go with one of my best"
52:53,440;52:57,540;"I know you were just kind of and you got a lot of fair point Steve about you know"
52:57,540;53:01,640;"You're great with with the announcers, but I did love that Joe Thizeman"
53:01,640;53:06,040;"I was talking about the impact of having home field in New England and like"
53:06,040;53:10,440;"I would be for the Patriots and then we'll see in the next two games."
53:10,440;53:11,440;"Yep."
53:11,440;53:13,040;"That actually ends up happening."
53:13,040;53:16,240;"So I thought that was my meet."
53:16,240;53:20,240;"Obviously having the retrospect to my advantage there."
53:20,240;53:21,240;"But yeah."
53:21,240;53:24,000;"So that was probably one of my best."
53:24,000;53:29,080;"And then my worst was watching these two punters ever."
53:29,080;53:30,080;"Like these guys suck."
53:30,080;53:36,320;"like there's oh yeah the worst punters in the league both of them."
53:36,320;53:40,480;"Like the only punter worse than Ken Walter was whoever the fuck the Jets had"
53:40,480;53:42,640;"and he outpanted Ken Walter in this game."
53:42,640;53:43,380;"Right."
53:43,380;53:46,560;"It was."
53:46,560;53:46,960;"I don't know."
53:46,960;53:49,120;"The Ken Walter actually didn't play that bad."
53:49,120;53:51,480;"Ken Walter had lucky bounces."
53:51,480;53:53,000;"He dropped it up inside the 20."
53:53,000;53:57,440;"I was actually pleasantly surprised by how well he bumped it."
53:57,440;53:59,320;"And I was like, OK, well, it's not."
53:59,320;54:02,920;"Well, you've gone from the 50 and you go 30 yards every time you're going to end up with some good."
54:02,920;54:06,480;"Yes, the pages from their own 35 yard line."
54:06,480;54:09,420;"No, from the Jets, 35."
54:09,420;54:11,800;"They did, but he didn't put it in the end zone."
54:11,800;54:12,820;"Yeah."
54:12,820;54:13,820;"That's right."
54:13,820;54:16,420;"I was fully expecting that to go out the back of the end zone."
54:16,420;54:17,520;"I think I think."
54:17,520;54:17,920;"Yeah."
54:17,920;54:18,620;"Wow."
54:18,620;54:29,020;"I think Ken Walter at this point of the season has mastered the squib punt, which I may have just made up, but every single punt that comedy is like, oh, it's a, it's a low line drive."
54:29,020;54:36,580;"And oh, the the the the returner. Oh, he's gonna let it bounce and it dribbles its way for like another 15 20 yards and"
54:36,580;54:39,660;"Somehow managed to get inside the 20 yard line every fucking time"
54:39,660;54:43,520;"And he's at this point. He's like, you know what? I'm not kicking for distance"
54:43,520;54:47,700;"but there's not gonna return it. I'm just gonna fucking dribble it down the field and"
54:47,700;54:55,100;"Hopefully it takes a my bounce and not because it if it takes a Jets bounce"
54:55,100;54:58,920;"They get the ball in the 50, but if it takes a Patriots balance. It's inside the 20"
54:58,920;55:02,500;"It's just he's just bad"
55:02,500;55:08,620;"I can't he's definitely my least favorite patriot from this dynasty era. Oh, yeah"
55:08,620;55:11,780;"100% no Larry centers"
55:11,780;55:16,780;"That is my least favorite ever saw him for that dirty yet"
55:16,780;55:21,180;"Not on him. I don't remember the dirty here, but I would yeah dirty like"
55:21,180;55:23,620;"30 and then they cut him the next week"
55:23,940;55:29,720;"And now he's back dropping dropping passes. Yeah, he's not mad. He's not fucking"
55:29,720;55:40,300;"All right, let's see what do I have left I"
55:40,300;55:51,980;"Would say this they talked about Tom Brady as a starter at this point in his career"
55:52,180;55:58,460;"I'm assuming not including this game is 32 and 12 as a starter a third of those wins were comebacks"
55:58,460;56:02,380;"Which that early on in his career seems like a lot"
56:02,380;56:08,300;"Yeah, I was surprised. It was that many well, he's showing what he's about. Yeah, yeah"
56:08,300;56:12,060;"Let's see"
56:12,060;56:14,900;"Talk about that the Patriots"
56:14,900;56:20,780;"They showed a season recap for them like you said they're"
56:21,820;56:23,660;"This is a particular ridiculous numbers."
56:23,660;56:26,940;"Their 12 wins was a franchise record, like you said."
56:26,940;56:29,780;"There's seven or no, so far this season"
56:29,780;56:32,020;"against teams with a winning record,"
56:32,020;56:36,100;"which ties the NFL record set by the 1969 Vikings."
56:36,100;56:38,700;"I'm assuming the bills next week are not"
56:38,700;56:41,020;"a winning, a team with a winning record."
56:41,020;56:43,060;"- Hmm, not a big seven throw."
56:43,060;56:46,980;"- And their 42 starters is the most"
56:46,980;56:50,340;"by any division champion since 1970."
56:51,220;56:53,260;"just fucking ridiculous."
56:53,260;56:54,100;"- Yeah."
56:54,100;56:57,500;"I mean, the injuries that they were able"
56:57,500;56:59,060;"just overcome this year,"
56:59,060;57:01,460;"I don't think I've ever seen anything like that."
57:01,460;57:02,300;"- No."
57:02,300;57:03,780;"- At least in my time of watching sports."
57:03,780;57:05,820;"- Yeah, it's not supposed to happen."
57:05,820;57:08,300;"I remember they showed a stat earlier on in the season"
57:08,300;57:13,300;"where like the teams that led the league in starters,"
57:13,300;57:14,820;"like different starters,"
57:14,820;57:16,520;"and it was usually in the 40s,"
57:16,520;57:20,180;"I think the best record was like the 2000,"
57:20,180;57:25,180;"Well, the 1990 something Patriots at six and eight"
57:25,180;57:27,660;"and every other team was like three or four wins"
57:27,660;57:30,900;"on the season and the Patriots haven't lost"
57:30,900;57:31,900;"in 11 weeks now."
57:31,900;57:37,840;"It's just, this team shouldn't be able to do this."
57:37,840;57:40,060;"Like all the numbers say like this shouldn't be happening"
57:40,060;57:44,180;"and yet they're winning every game close"
57:44,180;57:46,380;"with whoever the fuck they have available that week."
57:46,380;57:47,220;"- Right."
57:48,300;57:51,100;"So if Greg were here, I'd tell him to eat a dick"
57:51,100;57:54,460;"because that's Belichick, that's coaching, baby."
57:54,460;57:56,320;"That's genius is what that is."
57:56,320;58:00,420;"- Great GM and great coaching."
58:00,420;58:01,420;"- That's right, yeah."
58:01,420;58:02,260;"- That's right."
58:02,260;58:04,800;"- And you find that you a man who can do both."
58:04,800;58:09,020;"- Am I worst?"
58:09,020;58:12,260;"It's just the Jets in general."
58:14,980;58:19,420;"As a defense, they have nine interceptions on the season."
58:19,420;58:20,380;"Yeah."
58:20,380;58:21,460;"As an entire team."
58:21,460;58:23,180;"Not great."
58:23,180;58:24,940;"I think Tyrone Pool."
58:24,940;58:27,220;"The D line was a pretty good."
58:27,220;58:30,860;"I think I think Tyrone Pool might have about that many on the season because he's"
58:30,860;58:31,780;"the team leader."
58:31,780;58:32,780;"I think he has about nine."
58:32,780;58:37,060;"Tyrone is one shy of the Patriots record after his interception tonight."
58:37,060;58:37,860;"Yes."
58:37,860;58:38,420;"He is."
58:38,420;58:38,740;"Yeah."
58:38,740;58:39,820;"Behind."
58:39,820;58:41,340;"Michael Haines."
58:41,340;58:43,740;"I think it was Haines."
58:44,380;58:47,620;"Yes. It is. And he only ties it."
58:47,620;58:50,180;"Damn. Yeah."
58:50,180;58:52,140;"He only gets one more pick his entire"
58:52,140;58:54,060;"picture's career. That's surprising."
58:54,060;58:57,220;"And you stop throwing to him, I guess."
58:57,220;58:58,660;"Yes. Yeah. Wow."
58:58,660;59:01,500;"Fuck would you be like ran a fucking stretch"
59:01,500;59:03,220;"play at him and then threw him deep."
59:03,220;59:04,220;"And he's an old man."
59:04,220;59:05,940;"And that tackle on Curtis Martin, too,"
59:05,940;59:07,740;"where they threw it to him in the flat"
59:07,740;59:09,940;"and he just like cleaned them out as the first"
59:09,940;59:11,460;"half of lining down."
59:11,460;59:12,900;"They're like inside the 10."
59:12,900;59:15,460;"and get a, let's say they want Curtis Martin on Taiwan."
59:15,460;59:16,460;"Who's her?"
59:16,460;59:18,620;"Carter should be able to break that and go all the way."
59:18,620;59:19,460;"Taiwan is starting."
59:19,460;59:20,860;"- Did not happen."
59:20,860;59:21,860;"Yeah. - Perfect."
59:21,860;59:24,100;"- Yeah, and the Jets last week,"
59:24,100;59:27,220;"their big win was beating the Steelers six nothing"
59:27,220;59:28,300;"the week before this."
59:28,300;59:29,740;"- Mm-hmm, sure."
59:29,740;59:33,500;"- Like this, I mean, I like a good defensive battle"
59:33,500;59:35,380;"as much as the next guy,"
59:35,380;59:39,500;"but there have been a lot of low scoring shutouts"
59:39,500;59:41,460;"in this 2003 season."
59:41,460;59:53,380;"Like that's, I can understand why football has opened up more now because I think the casual fans can enjoy a 30, 35 game more than a six nothing game."
59:53,380;59:56,100;"Yeah, that's true."
59:56,100;01:00:01,100;"They, or they say offense sells tickets."
01:00:01,100;01:00:02,380;"Exactly."
01:00:02,380;01:00:04,300;"Asses in seats, whatever."
01:00:04,300;01:00:08,580;"So Steve, what's your best?"
01:00:09,260;01:00:10,560;"I still have so many left."
01:00:10,560;01:00:11,400;"That was my whole thing."
01:00:11,400;01:00:12,960;"I was like, I have so many best."
01:00:12,960;01:00:14,960;"Again, I really enjoyed watching this game."
01:00:14,960;01:00:16,240;"- All right."
01:00:16,240;01:00:18,080;"- There's a quote from Rodney Harrison"
01:00:18,080;01:00:20,200;"about coming to the Patriots this first year."
01:00:20,200;01:00:22,760;"You don't hope to win, you expect to win here."
01:00:22,760;01:00:23,600;"Love that."
01:00:23,600;01:00:25,680;"- It's a Rodney thing."
01:00:25,680;01:00:28,640;"- There was the Troy Brown play where they threw the ball"
01:00:28,640;01:00:29,560;"to Dion Branch."
01:00:29,560;01:00:31,280;"John Bary is trying to put it behind Dion"
01:00:31,280;01:00:32,440;"and Troy thought it was to him."
01:00:32,440;01:00:33,280;"- Yeah."
01:00:33,280;01:00:34,160;"- And not an absolutely,"
01:00:34,160;01:00:35,720;"but it was the best catch of his career."
01:00:35,720;01:00:37,680;"- Fuck it, snag that though, yeah."
01:00:38,800;01:00:42,080;"I learned that Damien Woody made Probo as a center."
01:00:42,080;01:00:43,800;"I always thought of him as a guard."
01:00:43,800;01:00:48,800;"- He, in the first couple of years."
01:00:48,800;01:00:50,360;"- Is he only ever Probo?"
01:00:50,360;01:00:53,680;"No, no, he makes it as a guard when he plays as a Jetson 05."
01:00:53,680;01:00:57,360;"- Yeah, no, he would play center,"
01:00:57,360;01:01:00,120;"but remember Mike Compton with the visor?"
01:01:00,120;01:01:04,480;"If Brady was in shotgun, they would switch."
01:01:04,480;01:01:08,040;"So Mike Compton would, because Damien Woody as a center"
01:01:08,040;01:01:11,560;"couldn't do shotgun snaps, which seems limiting."
01:01:11,560;01:01:14,040;"I think that's why they got rid of eventually."
01:01:14,040;01:01:16,600;"I think that was his only they switched from the guard next year."
01:01:16,600;01:01:19,320;"And then after that, he leaves and plays guard for rest his career."
01:01:19,320;01:01:20,240;"Yeah."
01:01:20,240;01:01:24,760;"But I always thought of him as a guy like Dan Copan is the rookie this year."
01:01:24,760;01:01:30,440;"And you always just, I mean, I just sort of assumed Dan Copan has always been there, you know,"
01:01:30,440;01:01:31,400;"right now, right?"
01:01:31,400;01:01:33,680;"I mean, that's like, who was the center in the 2001 season?"
01:01:33,680;01:01:37,960;"Everyone's like, you know, I'm a guy, the visor, but it was like a big"
01:01:37,960;01:01:39,160;"- The Tune Center."
01:01:39,160;01:01:41,560;"(laughing)"
01:01:41,560;01:01:43,880;"- Yeah, when have you ever heard of a team"
01:01:43,880;01:01:45,640;"doing a platooning center?"
01:01:45,640;01:01:46,480;"- Yeah."
01:01:46,480;01:01:49,560;"- Or just swapping centers during a drive?"
01:01:49,560;01:01:51,680;"- That might be the only one I've ever heard."
01:01:51,680;01:01:52,680;"- Yeah."
01:01:52,680;01:01:53,520;"- I don't, yeah."
01:01:53,520;01:01:55,920;"- But we know it's shotgun because it's a different center."
01:01:55,920;01:01:56,840;"- Right, exactly."
01:01:56,840;01:01:58,360;"(laughing)"
01:01:58,360;01:01:59,560;"- Guess they're passing."
01:01:59,560;01:02:01,820;"(laughing)"
01:02:01,820;01:02:06,400;"- The best though was the video quality"
01:02:06,400;01:02:08,600;"was much improved for this game."
01:02:08,600;01:02:10,940;"- Okay. - Derek, I don't know"
01:02:10,940;01:02:13,760;"if you've watched any of the other games end to end."
01:02:13,760;01:02:15,640;"- I haven't, no."
01:02:15,640;01:02:19,760;"- Well, the quality in this one was a significantly better."
01:02:19,760;01:02:20,600;"- It was better."
01:02:20,600;01:02:22,320;"- Even like the last couple,"
01:02:22,320;01:02:23,320;"'cause they've been in the snow,"
01:02:23,320;01:02:25,400;"they've been poor, like unwatchable."
01:02:25,400;01:02:26,480;"You can't see what's going on."
01:02:26,480;01:02:28,360;"- And they're like, we're on VCR too,"
01:02:28,360;01:02:31,360;"so they're digital and you lose a ton of,"
01:02:31,360;01:02:33,760;"it's just so hard to see,"
01:02:33,760;01:02:35,400;"but like the quality was improved,"
01:02:35,400;01:02:39,480;"They had the Sky Jam, you know, they had a bunch of sweet things like that."
01:02:39,480;01:02:43,440;"The red, this is where they debuted the red line of scrimmage on third down."
01:02:43,440;01:02:44,440;"Yes."
01:02:44,440;01:02:45,680;"Which I like the shading."
01:02:45,680;01:02:47,920;"The shading is actually really good."
01:02:47,920;01:02:48,920;"Yeah."
01:02:48,920;01:02:51,760;"Oh, I love the shading on the current now, you know."
01:02:51,760;01:02:52,760;"It's too much."
01:02:52,760;01:02:53,760;"No, it's not."
01:02:53,760;01:02:55,720;"The red line of scrimmage was too much."
01:02:55,720;01:02:58,000;"And then they put it out on second down."
01:02:58,000;01:03:01,880;"After they announced it was announced on second down, they're like, whoa, people were putting"
01:03:01,880;01:03:05,600;"the line of scrimmage is red on third down, why are you saying that on second down?"
01:03:05,600;01:03:07,680;"Then why are you putting the line on on second down?"
01:03:07,680;01:03:09,920;"Now you're just confusing people because everyone's like, what down is it?"
01:03:09,920;01:03:10,840;"Third down or second down?"
01:03:10,840;01:03:16,160;"I always think of the red line as like the goal to get like for children to range, right?"
01:03:16,160;01:03:16,160;"Yeah."
01:03:16,160;01:03:16,440;"Yeah."
01:03:16,440;01:03:16,440;"Yeah."
01:03:16,440;01:03:16,960;"Yeah."
01:03:16,960;01:03:19,120;"Well, they got rid of it pretty quick."
01:03:19,120;01:03:26,240;"But at some point, like also some, I don't like some broadcast would do like the yellow line was the first"
01:03:26,240;01:03:29,440;"down line unless it was fourth down and then the first down line would be red."
01:03:30,480;01:03:33,320;"Yeah, it's yeah, super confusing"
01:03:33,320;01:03:40,400;"Fucking standardized it. But yeah, I mean so Steve were you a fan of the if you if you like the third down shading"
01:03:40,400;01:03:46,000;"You a big fan of the the Nickelodeon broadcast that they did - I haven't seen it. Oh, well"
01:03:46,000;01:03:49,040;"Maybe you should watch that because they fucking covered everything"
01:03:49,040;01:03:51,680;"SpongeBob was was the goal post"
01:03:51,680;01:03:56,560;"That I like should I think that's hilarious I like that"
01:03:57,280;01:04:02,100;"That actually it actually wasn't good. You'll go and get set up a field goes to SpongeBob. He had SpongeBob in the face"
01:04:02,100;01:04:03,240;"He get"
01:04:03,240;01:04:05,240;"Yeah, you get you get three points"
01:04:05,240;01:04:10,340;"Pow right in the kiss of that. Yeah, I didn't see any of those Nickelodeon games"
01:04:10,340;01:04:12,900;"Did they have like ooze or were they ever yep?"
01:04:12,900;01:04:15,660;"Yeah, there was there was just one it was a"
01:04:15,660;01:04:22,700;"The Saints Bears playoff game this year. It was simulcast on Nickelodeon. Yeah"
01:04:23,340;01:04:29,100;"to be more of those. I'm in on that for sure. It was kind of cool. There was some cheese in it,"
01:04:29,100;01:04:33,980;"but like the commentators were aimed towards kids too. So they're like, explain the rules of"
01:04:33,980;01:04:42,620;"football and stuff, which is great. I mean, not stuff that anybody does listen to."
01:04:42,620;01:04:49,260;"So I mean, I will I will rant about this again, because my when I spent time in England, they"
01:04:49,260;01:04:52,380;"they have Sky Sports and they have multiple channels per game."
01:04:52,380;01:04:56,140;"And what you can, you can select different versions of the game you watch."
01:04:56,140;01:04:59,260;"So one you can watch with like just the normal commentators and everything."
01:04:59,260;01:05:03,020;"And one you can watch with no commentation."
01:05:03,020;01:05:07,820;"So it's just the sounds of the game, which I think for football would be amazing."
01:05:07,820;01:05:10,300;"I would do that 100% right."
01:05:10,300;01:05:12,780;"I don't know. I like Tony Romo."
01:05:12,780;01:05:17,260;"And then the one that they didn't do it for every game, but it's usually for like,"
01:05:17,260;01:05:23,920;"like rivalry games, they would get a fan from each team to"
01:05:23,920;01:05:27,460;"commentate in the same booth together. And the booth was,"
01:05:27,460;01:05:30,900;"you know, the size of like, like the entire booth was a size"
01:05:30,900;01:05:33,940;"like a queen size bed. Well, they had two guys sitting"
01:05:33,940;01:05:38,560;"literally like next to each other, like touching. Each guy"
01:05:38,560;01:05:41,740;"got a microphone. And they would commentate the game"
01:05:41,740;01:05:44,940;"together as fans. And every time one team would score the"
01:05:44,940;01:05:47,120;"other guy would just stand up, just scream and the other"
01:05:47,120;01:05:52,320;"guys face. It was a man and they're just like rip on each other the entire time. It's perfect."
01:05:52,320;01:05:55,480;"I think it might work better for maybe baseball over here, but"
01:05:55,480;01:05:58,480;"Andy, Andy, if we do that, we got people, you know,"
01:05:58,480;01:06:03,640;"getting shot. Hey, do you brought a gun to the goddamn"
01:06:03,640;01:06:05,880;"competition? She's got a guy in the name."
01:06:05,880;01:06:08,080;"Neither. You've lost in your hand."
01:06:08,080;01:06:12,240;"Well, you just put up some fucking metal detectors before you let him in the room,"
01:06:12,240;01:06:12,880;"problem solves."
01:06:12,880;01:06:15,000;"No one's going to agree to that."
01:06:15,040;01:06:17,320;"I can go in if I can let's like bring my guns."
01:06:17,320;01:06:22,120;"Spong like a true southerner."
01:06:22,120;01:06:23,720;"Fucking Steve."
01:06:23,720;01:06:32,640;"So yeah, I, well, I think they should at least offer options so you can listen to it with or without the commentators."
01:06:32,640;01:06:37,000;"And then you would have missed the fucking I just want to kiss you as soon as you come on."
01:06:37,000;01:06:39,960;"You see, competition really brings a lot."
01:06:39,960;01:06:43,080;"Imagine watching this game with just the sounds of the game."
01:06:43,080;01:06:45,200;"You've been like, no, that was pretty game against."
01:06:45,200;01:06:48,000;"You missed the whole fucking cultural thing."
01:06:48,000;01:06:48,800;"I'm sorry."
01:06:48,800;01:06:51,220;"You're talking to a guy that has a book full of fucking stats."
01:06:51,220;01:06:52,600;"Which game do you think I want to watch?"
01:06:52,600;01:06:57,400;"Yeah, but is there a stat in there about how many times he said, I want to kiss you, Susie?"
01:06:57,400;01:06:57,980;"Nope."
01:06:57,980;01:07:00,000;"Can we hear that again?"
01:07:00,000;01:07:02,080;"Can we just like, you want that one more time?"
01:07:02,080;01:07:02,320;"All right."
01:07:02,320;01:07:04,600;"I mean, that because this is, I don't know."
01:07:04,600;01:07:06,640;"It's, can we start the end?"
01:07:06,640;01:07:09,000;"Oh, you want the whole thing?"
01:07:09,000;01:07:09,880;"I want the whole thing."
01:07:09,880;01:07:10,800;"Okay."
01:07:10,800;01:07:11,280;"Hang on."
01:07:12,120;01:07:15,520;"What is it being do you now on the team struggling?"
01:07:15,520;01:07:17,640;"It's all going to kiss you."
01:07:17,640;01:07:21,040;"I couldn't care less about the team struggling."
01:07:21,040;01:07:25,400;"What we know is we can improve."
01:07:25,400;01:07:28,560;"Chad, Miss Chad Pennington, our quarterback,"
01:07:28,560;01:07:31,520;"missed the first part of the season."
01:07:31,520;01:07:34,680;"And we struggled."
01:07:34,680;01:07:36,360;"We're looking to next season."
01:07:36,360;01:07:40,400;"We're looking to make a noise now."
01:07:40,400;01:07:42,600;"And I want to kiss you."
01:07:42,600;01:07:43,400;"Thanks, Joe."
01:07:43,400;01:07:44,100;"Yeah."
01:07:44,100;01:07:45,400;"Huge compliment."
01:07:45,400;01:07:46,400;"Joe."
01:07:46,400;01:07:47,400;"Thanks, Joe."
01:07:47,400;01:07:48,400;"Yeah."
01:07:48,400;01:07:49,400;"Yeah."
01:07:49,400;01:07:50,600;"Joe, name it part of--"
01:07:50,600;01:07:55,200;"Struggling, struggling, struggling, struggling,"
01:07:55,200;01:07:56,000;"you."
01:07:56,000;01:07:56,800;"Thanks, Joe."
01:07:56,800;01:07:57,800;"Yeah."
01:07:57,800;01:07:59,200;"Huge compliment."
01:07:59,200;01:08:00,200;"Yeah."
01:08:00,200;01:08:01,200;"Yeah."
01:08:01,200;01:08:02,200;"Yeah."
01:08:02,200;01:08:06,200;"It's such a drunk, yeah."
01:08:06,200;01:08:06,700;"Yeah."
01:08:06,700;01:08:08,200;"Like, we've all done that."
01:08:08,200;01:08:09,000;"Yeah, yeah."
01:08:09,000;01:08:11,880;"but also like true."
01:08:11,880;01:08:14,680;"And like I was thinking about this earlier"
01:08:14,680;01:08:16,080;"and I meant to bring it up before,"
01:08:16,080;01:08:20,760;"but like we've all woken up after night of drinking"
01:08:20,760;01:08:23,080;"and been like, oh man, I do."
01:08:23,080;01:08:27,480;"Imagine being Joe Nameth and waking up the next morning"
01:08:27,480;01:08:31,360;"and being like, I hope I didn't,"
01:08:31,360;01:08:33,000;"I hope I didn't embarrass myself last night."
01:08:33,000;01:08:34,200;"I was pretty fucking drunk."
01:08:34,200;01:08:37,120;"I think I'm on TV and then he turns on ESPN"
01:08:37,120;01:08:42,120;"sports and it's just like that on a loop. That's a bad day."
01:08:42,120;01:08:46,920;"At least that happened in like 2003, not today, where he'd be a"
01:08:46,920;01:08:50,960;"meme like throughout the ages, like throughout basically every"
01:08:50,960;01:08:54,200;"social media platform out there. I mean, you say that, but we're"
01:08:54,200;01:08:56,280;"still talking about it on the fucking."
01:08:56,280;01:08:58,900;"17 years."
01:08:58,900;01:09:04,400;"Says you're gonna interview saying that some fucking regret it"
01:09:04,400;01:09:06,000;"made him stop drinking probably."
01:09:06,000;01:09:13,200;"that you wake up and go god I got to be a I was not drinking after that. That would do it for me."
01:09:13,200;01:09:20,800;"Oh my god. I think I was trying to listen to it again and see what he was saying like in that like"
01:09:20,800;01:09:24,880;"little bit where you can't make it out and it sounds like just jumbling over his words saying like"
01:09:24,880;01:09:33,120;"Ms. Chad Pennington. I mean. Yeah he's he's all over that place. I just love the way he says"
01:09:33,120;01:09:35,120;"struggling struggling"
01:09:35,120;01:09:42,880;"I kind of want that as like my my ringtone for when I get a text from my brothers struggling"
01:09:42,880;01:09:49,200;"Alright, what do we have to look forward to next week Steve? Oh"
01:09:49,200;01:09:52,920;"With a bills game"
01:09:52,920;01:09:58,280;"Yes, this is the other member people only remember two games in the season the first and last"
01:09:59,560;01:10:12,560;"Middle is like totally forgotten. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I mean, they're, I mean, talk about a book end to a season though. Yeah. Oh, yeah, of course, it is a storybook. It is. Yeah, like you, unless you're a bill span, it's some sort of like nightmare book. I don't know."
01:10:12,560;01:10:28,560;"Hey, it's yeah. Still a dream, right? Yeah. I mean, if you were to like write a sitcom or something, if you were writing Friday nightlights and you started off where the Patriots, or the Friday nightlights team lost their first game 31 nothing and had to play that same team at the end of the season."
01:10:28,560;01:10:32,000;"end of the season and they won 31 nothing but like, oh, that's kind of fucking"
01:10:32,000;01:10:36,480;"gosh, like, I can't believe you like couldn't come up with something a bit more."
01:10:36,480;01:10:40,680;"A bit more creative, but like it's so like."
01:10:40,680;01:10:44,880;"Kind of bullshit Hollywood."
01:10:44,880;01:10:47,520;"And that's kind of how this page is dying."
01:10:47,520;01:10:50,440;"So you just goes normally, you know, like it, there's just so much."
01:10:50,440;01:10:54,320;"Storybook stuff like that over and over again."
01:10:56,160;01:10:58,600;"bit. I can understand why people hate us."
01:10:58,600;01:11:03,440;"This is what I'm trying to say. Like it just feels too perfect."
01:11:03,440;01:11:06,780;"The way things turn out for the Patriots."
01:11:06,780;01:11:10,280;"Oh, yeah, I've never had a question about why people hate me."
01:11:10,280;01:11:13,080;"I have a fucking my background at work."
01:11:13,080;01:11:16,440;"My desktop is Tom Brady's assault base freaking Super Bowl rings."
01:11:16,440;01:11:18,680;"And he keeps saying, oh, it's out of babes missing too."
01:11:18,680;01:11:24,720;"The other one is that hit a I have to and they rotate."
01:11:24,720;01:11:27,240;"The other one is him as like that painting of Jesus"
01:11:27,240;01:11:28,560;"or he's holding the goat."
01:11:28,560;01:11:29,400;"- Oh yes."
01:11:29,400;01:11:30,640;"- Like Photoshop was facing there."
01:11:30,640;01:11:31,480;"- Oh yeah."
01:11:31,480;01:11:32,960;"- On the third Brady, the long hair Brady"
01:11:32,960;01:11:34,200;"is my favorite Brady."
01:11:34,200;01:11:35,040;"- Yeah."
01:11:35,040;01:11:35,920;"- First of all and like,"
01:11:35,920;01:11:39,040;"Tim is Jesus holding a goat, huh?"
01:11:39,040;01:11:39,880;"No."
01:11:39,880;01:11:44,040;"- Nice, well you did that whole GQ thing holding the goat."
01:11:44,040;01:11:45,040;"Was he foreshadowing?"
01:11:45,040;01:11:47,040;"Did he know before everybody?"
01:11:47,040;01:11:48,800;"- First season, it was 2001, right?"
01:11:48,800;01:11:50,120;"- I don't remember when it was."
01:11:50,120;01:11:50,960;"- Three sure was."
01:11:50,960;01:11:51,800;"- It was early."
01:11:51,800;01:11:52,640;"You got a lot of shit for that"
01:11:52,640;01:11:53,880;"from this teammates I believe."
01:11:53,880;01:11:54,880;"God damn."
01:11:54,880;01:11:55,880;"Now it's the norm."
01:11:55,880;01:11:59,840;"All the wider, excuse me, all the quarterbacks do GQ covers now."
01:11:59,840;01:12:00,840;"That's true."
01:12:00,840;01:12:01,840;"Yeah."
01:12:01,840;01:12:02,840;"You did."
01:12:02,840;01:12:03,840;"You did."
01:12:03,840;01:12:04,840;"You did."
01:12:04,840;01:12:05,840;"You did."
01:12:05,840;01:12:06,840;"You did."
01:12:06,840;01:12:07,840;"You did."
01:12:07,840;01:12:08,840;"You did."
01:12:08,840;01:12:09,840;"You did."
01:12:09,840;01:12:10,840;"You did."
01:12:10,840;01:12:11,840;"Oh, one Brady."
01:12:11,840;01:12:12,840;"Yeah."
01:12:12,840;01:12:13,840;"He was such a goomer back then too."
01:12:13,840;01:12:14,840;"I loved it."
01:12:14,840;01:12:15,840;"I got his butt chin fixed."
01:12:15,840;01:12:16,840;"Yeah."
01:12:16,840;01:12:17,840;"Yeah."
01:12:17,840;01:12:18,840;"We're still looking at what if we ever have a model."
01:12:18,840;01:12:19,840;"Ask those hard questions too."
01:12:19,840;01:12:20,840;"Like what happened to your butt chin."
01:12:20,840;01:12:21,840;"They're hard hitting interview."
01:12:21,840;01:12:22,680;"- So."
01:12:22,680;01:12:25,320;"- All right."
01:12:25,320;01:12:26,620;"All right."
01:12:26,620;01:12:29,400;"Tarek, did you have any questions for us?"
01:12:29,400;01:12:30,720;"- We've been asking you questions all night."
01:12:30,720;01:12:31,560;"- Question, yeah."
01:12:31,560;01:12:34,240;"- Yeah."
01:12:34,240;01:12:39,320;"Do you guys, have you guys ever gotten a chance"
01:12:39,320;01:12:40,880;"to contact Troy Brown?"
01:12:40,880;01:12:42,480;"'Cause I know that you guys have said like,"
01:12:42,480;01:12:44,300;"if Troy Brown knows about your podcast,"
01:12:44,300;01:12:48,560;"then like this whole ordeal would have been worth it."
01:12:48,560;01:12:51,560;"So I'm just curious if you've ever been able to"
01:12:51,560;01:12:54,560;"contact with the one and only TB."
01:12:54,560;01:12:56,360;"That's a great question."
01:12:56,360;01:13:05,240;"And no, not yet, but I don't know if I send this to the boys in our chat, but the New"
01:13:05,240;01:13:09,280;"England Patriots Twitter account just created a new Twitter account."
01:13:09,280;01:13:11,960;"Let me see if I can find it."
01:13:11,960;01:13:14,160;"Hey, you said they're encroaching on our turf."
01:13:14,160;01:13:16,680;"They are encroaching on our turf because they just launched."
01:13:16,680;01:13:17,680;"I didn't understand."
01:13:17,680;01:13:18,680;"I don't know how Twitter works."
01:13:18,680;01:13:20,840;"He said to me, I looked at it and I said, I don't know what this means."
01:13:20,840;01:13:31,600;"So they created a Twitter account that is called Patriots Time Machine."
01:13:31,600;01:13:36,840;"So it's @pattstimemachine where they are tweeting like it's 2001."
01:13:36,840;01:13:44,240;"So they're tweeting each day as if it was that day in 2001, as if they're reliving the"
01:13:44,240;01:13:47,160;"Dynasty in real time."
01:13:47,160;01:13:48,920;"Which sounds familiar."
01:13:48,920;01:13:55,240;"And I think the guy who we had on is either one who started that."
01:13:55,240;01:13:57,080;"I think he's involved with it."
01:13:57,080;01:13:59,160;"That's a smart idea."
01:13:59,160;01:14:00,160;"Yeah."
01:14:00,160;01:14:02,000;"So it may still not from us."
01:14:02,000;01:14:03,000;"I don't know."
01:14:03,000;01:14:05,660;"Can you also come out with an episode where he interviews Troy Brown?"
01:14:05,660;01:14:08,480;"So yeah, so he does the pass on the past."
01:14:08,480;01:14:11,640;"Wait, and we told him to tell Troy Brown."
01:14:11,640;01:14:12,640;"Yeah."
01:14:12,640;01:14:17,880;"So Troy Brown probably not if he follows through Troy Brown notes because he did that if we"
01:14:17,880;01:14:21,240;"told her about it. He does the pass from the pass of Troy. Right."
01:14:21,240;01:14:22,560;"Should have told Troy about it."
01:14:22,560;01:14:27,600;"I think we're as close as we are then."
01:14:27,600;01:14:30,600;"See, Brown's like conspiracy theories like baby."
01:14:30,600;01:14:34,680;"He's got all the string connecting everything."
01:14:34,680;01:14:38,200;"Like I'm connected to Dot Troy Brown knows who I am."
01:14:38,200;01:14:41,560;"We're going to find out for sure if that's the case."
01:14:41,560;01:14:44,880;"We need that we need to hit him up and say a great podcast."
01:14:44,880;01:14:46,520;"I'm on the Troy from the past."
01:14:46,520;01:14:50,000;"Did you tell him like we asked you so many times?"
01:14:50,000;01:14:50,440;"Yeah."
01:14:50,440;01:14:56,000;"So I'm going to listen to the episode tomorrow and I'm going to find out if we hear about"
01:14:56,000;01:15:02,040;"it then, if not, I'm going to reach out to Brian himself and be like, yo, I didn't hear"
01:15:02,040;01:15:03,720;"you mention us on your podcast."
01:15:03,720;01:15:06,000;"I was just wondering if it came up like afterwards."
01:15:06,000;01:15:10,920;"And if not, can we get his cell phone numbers so we can have him on our fucking podcast?"
01:15:10,920;01:15:13,360;"Troy Brown is the Troy Brown hog."
01:15:13,360;01:15:14,560;"Yeah."
01:15:16,120;01:15:20,760;"pinnacle. So if you if you could hear anybody on the podcast,"
01:15:20,760;01:15:25,720;"us interview like a player or a coach or someone, who would it be for you? Try"
01:15:25,720;01:15:31,400;"around. Oh man, that's a that's a tough one. I think most people. Yeah, I know most people"
01:15:31,400;01:15:39,480;"probably say Brady, but right. For me, I would say Groc. I just would really love to hear like"
01:15:39,480;01:15:44,040;"Groc on this podcast for whatever reason. I don't know. I think you'd be funny. I think you'd be"

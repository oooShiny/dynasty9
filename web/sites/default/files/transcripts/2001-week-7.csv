00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,920;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,920;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"

01:13,480;01:14,120;"I know."
01:14,120;01:15,120;"I feel nice, too."
01:15,120;01:18,720;"Are you wearing the same thing that Andy is wearing?"
01:19,240;01:25,400;"Well, I wear the same thing every day, which is nice, tight sweat pants."
01:25,400;01:26,280;"Okay."
01:26,280;01:28,000;"A Brady jersey."
01:28,000;01:29,520;"All right."
01:29,520;01:30,880;"And no wonder where."
01:30,880;01:34,000;"Oh, how could you with the tight slip pants?"
01:34,000;01:34,800;"Exactly."
01:34,800;01:35,440;"Yeah."
01:35,440;01:36,280;"That's fair."
01:36,280;01:39,280;"Yeah, a bone effect with you."
01:39,280;01:40,400;"Who?"
01:40,400;01:41,920;"You, me?"
01:41,920;01:42,880;"Yeah."
01:42,880;01:45,040;"How can we even respond to my birthday wish?"
01:45,040;01:46,560;"Oh, dude."
01:46,560;01:48,800;"I didn't respond to anybody's."
01:48,920;01:50,000;"That's really messed up."
01:50,000;01:52,820;"Yeah, I was like, I don't know."
01:52,820;01:56,240;"I was somewhere where I was like really hung over or something."
01:56,240;01:59,400;"And I like, it gave me anxiety."
01:59,400;02:03,600;"I had so many, you know, not a brag or anything, but I got, I got you."
02:03,600;02:04,200;"I got you."
02:04,200;02:04,960;"I understand."
02:04,960;02:06,640;"My phone was on like 2%."
02:06,640;02:08,680;"And I was like, dude, I just can't do this."
02:08,680;02:10,400;"That's fair."
02:10,400;02:11,480;"I accept that."
02:11,480;02:12,280;"I'm sorry."
02:12,280;02:12,760;"That's OK."
02:12,760;02:14,280;"I think that we didn't talk for so long."
02:14,280;02:17,960;"I was like, oh, that's a bummer, you know, I feel better."
02:17,960;02:23,840;"I'm glad we're off to it. Yeah, we're off to a good start. I think this is gonna be a good one"
02:23,840;02:32,800;"Yeah, so speaking of good starts, how about this football game? Well wait, can we can we talk about?"
02:32,800;02:35,680;"Spigate - oh"
02:35,680;02:39,040;"We're gonna go into that right now. Yeah. Well, let's just touch on it briefly"
02:39,040;02:45,840;"Okay, I mean because this is a current Patriots podcast, but sure well, I mean, it's a hot topic right now"
02:46,600;02:47,440;"This is true."
02:47,440;02:50,280;"And by the time everyone listens to this,"
02:50,280;02:53,120;"we'll get the resolution so people can let us know"
02:53,120;02:53,960;"how that turns out."
02:53,960;02:54,800;"I don't know."
02:54,800;02:55,880;"We're not releasing this to laugh at the season,"
02:55,880;02:57,720;"so I don't think we'll have heard by then."
02:57,720;02:59,680;"Oh, shots fired."
02:59,680;03:02,320;"What's your thoughts, Andy?"
03:02,320;03:09,320;"I think it's even more bullshit than the first Spygate."
03:09,320;03:10,920;"Oh, surprise, surprise."
03:10,920;03:13,440;"Yeah, all right, give me your take then, hot stuff."
03:13,440;03:14,520;"No comment."
03:14,520;03:15,360;"Yeah."
03:15,360;03:17,620;"(laughing)"
03:17,620;03:21,660;"- Dude, I love you all that for that."
03:21,660;03:22,500;"- Oh man."
03:22,500;03:23,420;"- That's all I'd say at work,"
03:23,420;03:25,960;"'cause I get asked about it by like everybody."
03:25,960;03:27,080;"- Oh yeah."
03:27,080;03:28,960;"- Dude, you know what, you wanna hear something funny?"
03:28,960;03:30,960;"It was our Christmas party today,"
03:30,960;03:34,100;"and I was wearing like a Patriots Santa hat,"
03:34,100;03:36,020;"and I won the raffle thing."
03:36,020;03:39,780;"So like, there's like 200 people booing me"
03:39,780;03:40,940;"'cause of my hat."
03:40,940;03:41,780;"(laughing)"
03:41,780;03:42,620;"You can't even know."
03:42,620;03:44,040;"- It's booing me."
03:44,040;03:46,860;"And it's not like you're in a like a hot bed of"
03:46,860;03:50,320;"Patriot hatred either, like in North Carolina, everywhere."
03:50,320;03:51,920;"I guess so."
03:51,920;03:53,000;"Yeah, it was pretty funny."
03:53,000;03:53,920;"Yeah."
03:53,920;03:54,640;"Well, you know what?"
03:54,640;03:55,160;"Fuck them."
03:55,160;03:57,320;"I think I think they're guilty."
03:57,320;03:59,080;"But hey, I don't care."
03:59,080;04:03,360;"That's awesome."
04:03,360;04:05,160;"So I think we've covered the spectrum."
04:05,160;04:05,800;"They haven't we?"
04:05,800;04:09,520;"We've gone from absolutely fucking nothing wrong to no"
04:09,520;04:09,960;"comments."
04:09,960;04:10,840;"So they're definitely guilty."
04:10,840;04:12,040;"But who the hell cares?"
04:12,040;04:16,760;"Did you see that Ryan Clark's comments though?"
04:16,760;04:18,840;"I thought they were pretty funny."
04:18,840;04:24,040;"Is this the same Ryan Clark that got lit up after guaranteeing a win against the"
04:24,040;04:24,640;"07?"
04:24,640;04:26,120;"Pretty sure that yeah, yeah."
04:26,120;04:28,920;"He's somehow made a career out of talking about it."
04:28,920;04:30,120;"Oh, so, okay."
04:30,120;04:31,960;"I'm sure this is unbiased."
04:31,960;04:36,040;"But it's funny because even though we're good here, I think everyone's experiencing"
04:36,040;04:41,640;"a cheating burnout because Ryan Clark, he's like, he even said, he's like,"
04:41,840;04:46,760;"I think the Patriots is of the biggest cheaters. They do it all the time. You know, they're great at it, you know"
04:46,760;04:50,260;"But then he said that he respected Belichick because Belichick came out and said hey"
04:50,260;04:54,920;"We pushed the boundaries and we cheat but we didn't do it this time and so he's like, you know"
04:54,920;04:56,600;"He's like yeah, I gotta give it to Belichick"
04:56,600;04:59,200;"I don't think he cheated on this one. It's too obvious"
04:59,200;05:03,200;"They wouldn't have gotten caught and he was fighting Max Kellerman on that"
05:03,200;05:09,800;"So I think we're now experiencing a cheating burnout and you know fuck it. It is what it is. I'll take it"
05:10,000;05:13,860;"Me too. I mean it's 20 years is it a real"
05:13,860;05:22,000;"Media events unless Mark Bernal cries on TV though. I don't know has he done it yet. Is he I don't think so"
05:22,000;05:27,240;"We oh wait, did he even involved with that sex scandal or something and I felt network"
05:27,240;05:36,480;"I mean probably you know if that's incorrect retract my statement. I don't want to start anything"
05:36,480;05:39,080;"You don't want to get us all sued"
05:39,080;05:42,540;"No, for no has nasty lawyers, believe me."
05:42,540;05:44,380;"Who does?"
05:44,380;05:45,880;"Mark."
05:45,880;05:47,220;"Oh, you think so?"
05:47,220;05:48,020;"Oh, yeah."
05:48,020;05:50,280;"I know so, but we'll talk about that out there."
05:50,280;05:56,280;"Oh, I know that he holds the record for most consecutive"
05:56,280;05:57,920;"completions in a single game at 22."
05:57,920;05:59,720;"Oh, that is true."
05:59,720;06:04,720;"I thought you were saying you're going to make some random joke about, um, he holds"
06:04,720;06:08,260;"the record for consecutive tears on a broadcast."
06:08,580;06:09,820;"No, apparently. Yeah."
06:09,820;06:11,180;"With the Anton with him."
06:11,180;06:13,220;"He's filed for bankruptcy."
06:13,220;06:15,380;"OK, according to what are we doing here?"
06:15,380;06:16,680;"What are we doing here?"
06:16,680;06:17,580;"We've tracked that one."
06:17,580;06:19,820;"What is this? T me Z? Yeah."
06:19,820;06:23,540;"Yeah. He holds the world record as well."
06:23,540;06:29,140;"Brinnell also currently holds the world record for longest throwing catch of a hot dog sausage into a bun."
06:29,140;06:30,260;"You're full of shit."
06:30,260;06:32,180;"You're on Wikipedia."
06:32,180;06:36,980;"Ian Dot Wikipedia dot org slash mark underscore Brinnell."
06:36,980;06:37,980;"We could feed you."
06:37,980;06:43,980;"This is of the throw and catch was 20.96 meters, which is 68 feet, nine inches for those Americans"
06:43,980;06:44,980;"out there."
06:44,980;06:48,860;"For the record setting throw, the hot dog was caught by former Green Bay Packer teammate"
06:48,860;06:49,860;"Gilbert Brown."
06:49,860;06:51,420;"I don't like any of this."
06:51,420;06:53,420;"Wasn't Gilbert Brown like a defensive lineman?"
06:53,420;06:55,620;"No, you're thinking of Gilbert Grape."
06:55,620;06:57,300;"No, he's a nose tackle."
06:57,300;06:58,300;"Yeah."
06:58,300;06:59,300;"That's eating."
06:59,300;07:03,060;"You know what's eating Gilbert Grape is Gilbert Brown."
07:03,060;07:04,860;"It's huge."
07:04,860;07:07,580;"I didn't like any of this."
07:07,580;07:07,980;"All right."
07:07,980;07:10,580;"We're going to have 340."
07:10,580;07:11,540;"Hey, you started it."
07:11,540;07:12,220;"I'm sorry."
07:12,220;07:14,020;"I know."
07:14,020;07:14,300;"All right."
07:14,300;07:18,420;"So yeah, so the week leading into week seven,"
07:18,420;07:19,860;"let's just touch on that a bit because I"
07:19,860;07:23,420;"thought there was some pretty good quotes out there."
07:23,420;07:27,780;"On the Boston Globe Sunday edition,"
07:27,780;07:29,900;"the day of the game, there was an article about,"
07:29,900;07:32,500;"should the Pats play trade blood so?"
07:32,500;07:37,940;"So this was kind of the first signs of an actual quarterback controversy."
07:37,940;07:39,580;"Okay."
07:39,580;07:41,900;"I had a question though for you."
07:41,900;07:42,580;"Yeah."
07:42,580;07:48,100;"The, uh, so in that article, like they're talking about like how he signed an extension"
07:48,100;07:53,180;"Bledso did and this for like four years, but I thought that he was under a 10 year"
07:53,180;07:53,840;"contract."
07:53,840;07:54,580;"Am I wrong here?"
07:54,580;07:58,900;"Yeah, I thought it was like 10 years, a hundred million dollars, right?"
07:58,900;07:59,540;"Yeah."
07:59,540;08:00,380;"That's what I thought."
08:00,380;08:02,980;"But in the article, it said like four years like something."
08:02,980;08:04,300;"I don't know who wrote that article, but."
08:04,300;08:07,100;"- Yeah, one of his like some made up sort of numbers,"
08:07,100;08:08,260;"you know, where it's like, oh yeah, no,"
08:08,260;08:09,940;"it's 10 years, 100 million,"
08:09,940;08:11,900;"but only the first four guaranteed sort of thing."
08:11,900;08:12,740;"- All right, right."
08:12,740;08:13,580;"- That was or something."
08:13,580;08:15,820;"- Yeah, that's my guess."
08:15,820;08:17,380;"- Okay."
08:17,380;08:19,900;"- But there was a couple of quotes that I enjoyed from this."
08:19,900;08:20,980;"The first one was,"
08:20,980;08:23,980;"the pages could trade blood so"
08:23,980;08:25,420;"and not get killed financially."
08:25,420;08:26,260;"Will they?"
08:26,260;08:27,220;"Highly unlikely."
08:27,220;08:28,940;"To start with, when he is healthy,"
08:28,940;08:30,500;"He's still one of the best quarterbacks in the league."
08:30,500;08:33,160;"And beyond that, he's a great team player and person."
08:33,160;08:35,960;"True."
08:35,960;08:37,860;"I mean, I agree with all of that."
08:37,860;08:41,740;"Except for the, uh, still one of the best quarterbacks in the league,"
08:41,740;08:47,020;"because we know he got traded to Buffalo and wasn't the best quarterback in the"
08:47,020;08:47,780;"league from the league."
08:47,780;08:49,020;"Well, but he was at the time though."
08:49,020;08:52,940;"I suppose an argument could be a medius."
08:52,940;08:55,340;"Um, well, I thought we already discussed it."
08:55,340;08:58,540;"It might have been the last episode, but we were talking about whether"
08:58,580;09:04,860;"Bledso could could have been the goat given the opportunity with Bella check and I for one believe"
09:04,860;09:10,300;"Oh, that's right. Right. Yeah. I think that was just you and me talking about that. Okay. What do you think what do you think"
09:10,300;09:14,700;"Was was blood so like an elite quarterback?"
09:14,700;09:21,660;"Well, if if Bledso didn't get hurt would he have had the success that Brady ended up having goat steps away? Yes, sir"
09:21,660;09:23,220;"No way"
09:23,220;09:24,420;"You're nuts"
09:24,420;09:26,780;"Dude, we talked about a week one"
09:27,420;09:30,680;"But this is about we talked about this before week one"
09:30,680;09:35,120;"Dude blood so didn't have the effector, you know"
09:35,120;09:42,060;"He wasn't the gamer like Brady is that's the reason Brady's better than everybody else. It's not like physical stuff. He's like"
09:42,060;09:44,540;"It's fourth quarter down four points"
09:44,540;09:47,020;"We'll talk about it later in this game, but"
09:47,020;09:49,660;"What if you gave him what if you gave him?"
09:49,660;09:55,800;"Three years of like great defenses, and then you just took out half of his interceptions"
09:55,800;10:05,160;"with that. I think you feel better. So now we're now we're handicapping this like it's golf."
10:05,160;10:12,760;"Hey, we're making the rules as we go. I love it. I mean, if you have his interceptions, I think"
10:12,760;10:16,440;"most of those probably came towards the end of games where he was driving for game-winning"
10:16,440;10:20,680;"touchdowns. So you may be actually on to something. I know and check out these numbers."
10:20,680;10:24,040;"Speaking of interceptions, I thought that was pretty fun. Again, I'm all four blood so"
10:24,040;10:32,760;"potentially being the goat. We also argued that with the rules that Brady has enjoyed in the NFL,"
10:32,760;10:38,280;"now you never know what could have happened with Lutso but career numbers here. Lutso's career,"
10:38,280;10:45,640;"251 touchdowns, 206 interceptions. Not the greatest but you know."
10:45,640;10:48,200;"But more touchdowns than interceptions."
10:48,200;10:54,320;"Correct. And then Brady, though, 536 touchdowns, 178 and disappear."
10:54,320;10:56,000;"So we still like 40 off."
10:56,000;10:59,600;"I don't know if he'll hit that."
10:59,600;11:06,040;"Yeah, wasn't there some stat recently where Brady had the same amount of"
11:06,040;11:10,920;"interceptions as like Steve Grogan and somebody else, but had like, oh,"
11:10,920;11:12,920;"I don't know, some stat like that or."
11:12,920;11:17,920;"Yeah, because I was like, you had 151 interceptions."
11:17,920;11:19,080;"And they both they both did."
11:19,080;11:25,200;"And then Brady finally broke that that tie, except he had 500 touchdowns on top of it."
11:25,200;11:30,280;"Well, he's definitely adding to that number quicker than usual lately."
11:30,280;11:31,320;"So that's true."
11:31,320;11:33,360;"We can talk about that."
11:33,360;11:34,120;"Yeah."
11:34,120;11:39,440;"Well, speaking of interceptions, the other quote from this article that I want to get to was"
11:39,440;11:46,680;"they were quoting Bill Parcels and talking about, you know, if if Parcels thought"
11:47,200;11:50,960;"Brady would be like an actual quality quarterback in the league."
11:50,960;11:53,480;"He said, it happens all quarterbacks set"
11:53,480;11:55,040;"ourselves on his national radio show."
11:55,040;11:57,520;"They have a bad game somewhere along the line."
11:57,520;12:00,000;"Brady will throw an interception and you'll throw more than one."
12:00,000;12:03,400;"Someday he's going to be in a game where he and his team take a beating,"
12:03,400;12:06,040;"like 31 to 10 or something and he throws four interceptions."
12:06,040;12:09,040;"And then it goes on to say, you know, how does he bounce back from that,"
12:09,040;12:10,320;"that sort of thing."
12:10,320;12:16,440;"But the fact that this was in the article on the day of this game,"
12:17,040;12:18,480;"I thought was almost prophetic."
12:18,480;12:22,140;"Well, you know, it's crazy because I saw that note that you got it down."
12:22,140;12:24,360;"So I did some research on Bill Parcells, man."
12:24,360;12:26,400;"This guy might be a prophet."
12:26,400;12:28,740;"I mean, I came across some interesting things."
12:28,740;12:30,780;"First of all, his name is Dwayne Charles, by the way."
12:30,780;12:31,780;"It's not even Bill."
12:31,780;12:33,740;"Um, I remember that."
12:33,740;12:34,400;"Yeah."
12:34,400;12:37,180;"It was something like he was mistaken for another guy in high school called"
12:37,180;12:39,140;"Bill so much that he just adopted the name."
12:39,140;12:40,180;"So that was a cool point."
12:40,180;12:40,480;"But."
12:40,480;12:46,260;"So you're saying that the two bills, uh, thing that they did between Parcells"
12:46,260;12:48,180;"And Bell check is just a complete lie."
12:48,180;12:48,980;"It's a sham."
12:48,980;12:55,320;"And it's yet another Patriots lie that's just being propagated"
12:55,320;12:55,980;"by the media."
12:55,980;12:56,740;"Don't get me started."
12:56,740;12:57,740;"And another asterisk."
12:57,740;12:58,940;"Right."
12:58,940;13:02,940;"But we'll call it Bill Gates."
13:02,940;13:03,780;"Bill Gates."
13:03,780;13:04,780;"Yeah."
13:04,780;13:05,140;"Right."
13:05,140;13:05,620;"OK."
13:05,620;13:08,100;"I like it."
13:08,100;13:09,420;"But yeah, check this out, man."
13:09,420;13:11,620;"Throughout his career-- so Bill Parcell's,"
13:11,620;13:12,980;"I was like, he must be a prophet."
13:12,980;13:15,140;"He predicted Tom Brady's foreign exception"
13:15,140;13:19,360;"And a 31 10 score was strangely pretty close as well."
13:19,360;13:21,360;"He wasn't not by much."
13:21,360;13:26,120;"He predicted that Terry Glenn was who Terry Glenn was."
13:26,120;13:29,480;"Maybe Bob Kraft didn't, but he knew."
13:29,480;13:33,040;"He knew Bella Check would be a great coach,"
13:33,040;13:35,960;"as evidenced by giving him a job."
13:35,960;13:38,880;"And now multiple times."
13:38,880;13:40,480;"He didn't quite know that he was going to bail on him,"
13:40,480;13:42,960;"but hey, we're not perfect."
13:42,960;13:45,660;"But here's like the crazy thing."
13:45,660;13:48,860;"Apparently he also predicted the assassination of JFK,"
13:48,860;13:50,060;"which is crazy."
13:50,060;13:53,060;"No, dude, this is insane."
13:53,060;13:58,500;"I mean, he predicted the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
13:58,500;14:01,140;"And this is like where it gets like really weird,"
14:01,140;14:03,740;"because I had to fact check like how old he was."
14:03,740;14:05,860;"He predicted the 40s."
14:05,860;14:07,660;"No, but this next one, he predicted"
14:07,660;14:10,580;"the French Revolution era."
14:10,580;14:12,580;"Swear to God dude"
14:12,580;14:17,380;"So he missed out on the moon landing though, cuz I feel like that would be a big one to add to it"
14:17,380;14:22,300;"Yeah, I don't think he he talked about that one at least I didn't find it. I mean, this is a five minutes of research"
14:22,300;14:26,740;"Sounds like five minutes"
14:26,740;14:30,500;"I don't really swear to God. I don't know who's listening out there"
14:30,500;14:39,020;"It's not on Wikipedia, I don't know it should be because it was fantastic, but anyways if anybody out there who's still listening"
14:39,020;14:43,380;"wants to find out more really looking for this."
14:43,380;14:47,780;"Go to jolgi.com."
14:47,780;14:50,580;"Really fascinating stuff."
14:50,580;14:53,180;"All right."
14:53,180;14:54,540;"I don't know how to recover from that."
14:54,540;15:02,260;"I had a couple other quotes, or at least one,"
15:02,260;15:03,900;"from the Sunday paper."
15:03,900;15:07,860;"There was a lot of talk about the Brady-greasy connection"
15:07,860;15:12,580;"because Brady backed up Greasy in Michigan"
15:12,580;15:14,940;"when they were both at in college."
15:14,940;15:21,060;"And there was actually a few articles"
15:21,060;15:23,860;"and the commentators beat this horse to death."
15:23,860;15:27,300;"But the one thing that stood out to me was the quote,"
15:27,300;15:28,700;"""While football fans in New England"
15:28,700;15:30,180;"are falling in love with Tom Brady,"
15:30,180;15:31,940;"Broncos fans out here are close to filing"
15:31,940;15:33,860;"for divorce from Brian Greasy."""
15:33,860;15:35,940;"Ooh."
15:35,940;15:36,820;"Right."
15:36,820;15:37,820;"That's a man. That's hard."
15:37,820;15:39,520;"I don't know."
15:39,520;15:42,340;"Like you think that Brady given all his success and everything."
15:42,340;15:46,120;"You think he still hates greasy for like winning a championship when he didn't"
15:46,120;15:47,080;"at Michigan?"
15:47,080;15:48,620;"I don't think so."
15:48,620;15:57,160;"I think from what I've read and and and seen Brady has come to realize that he"
15:57,160;15:58,840;"wasn't the best quarterback that year."
15:58,840;16:01,520;"I think he probably holds a grudge against your hands and still."
16:01,520;16:02,120;"Yeah."
16:02,120;16:02,280;"Okay."
16:02,280;16:03,720;"That was a one time."
16:03,720;16:04,380;"Yeah."
16:05,580;16:09,180;"But I think Brian Grease was actually at the time the better quarterback when they won that thing."
16:09,180;16:16,740;"You know, what's interesting is I was like looking into that dynamic as well."
16:16,740;16:23,460;"And I went on like the Michigan football, you know, like comment section boards or whatever."
16:23,460;16:24,500;"Oh, boy. Yeah."
16:24,500;16:31,980;"And one of the guys asked the question, like who, who would you rather have like Brian Greasey"
16:32,060;16:38,540;"from winning a national championship or Tom Brady being like a six-time Super Bowl winner."
16:38,540;16:46,780;"And he basically got laughed off the board for even asking because Brian Gris is the obvious answer."
16:46,780;16:51,020;"-Really? -Yeah. Dude, college football is a different brand."
16:51,020;16:55,900;"-They are hardcore men. -Yeah, they don't give a shit about what you do in the pros."
16:55,900;16:59,660;"It's about like the school and that's it. -Yeah, I guess so."
16:59,660;17:00,980;"Which I found pretty interesting."
17:00,980;17:02,020;"Yeah, it is."
17:02,020;17:06,060;"I mean, I mean, you probably have to go with that."
17:06,060;17:10,220;"I think it makes sense because I mean, if that's the, if that's the team that you were"
17:10,220;17:18,820;"following and especially like undefeated, um, but yeah, pro career, you know, no contest there,"
17:18,820;17:20,380;"but they, they're rabid, man."
17:20,380;17:21,820;"They do not care."
17:21,820;17:26,580;"Lucky for me, I never went to a college that had a football team."
17:26,580;17:28,180;"So I have no allegiance."
17:28,700;17:33,020;"Oh, well, that actually segues perfectly into the last article I wanted to talk about."
17:33,020;17:38,540;"Um, it was just a small one in the ball, but it was a Joe Paterno sets the win mark."
17:38,540;17:40,180;"For college coaches."
17:40,180;17:45,740;"And I don't bring this up for reasons that you're thinking of, but just the fact that I was actually at that game."
17:45,740;17:47,100;"Okay."
17:47,100;17:52,020;"This was, and I'm now realizing why I don't remember any of these games we watched so far."
17:52,020;17:58,500;"It's because I was at, um, Penn State for my first and only semester there."
17:58,500;18:02,580;"What happened? There's so much on the rap right here."
18:02,580;18:04,380;"But oh, yeah, no, we'll get into that."
18:04,380;18:06,820;"But we'll talk about the game quickly."
18:06,820;18:08,940;"Wait, wait, wait, hold up one second."
18:08,940;18:10,700;"What why did you think that?"
18:10,700;18:13,620;"What was that comment that you made about me?"
18:13,620;18:15,980;"That I made about you."
18:15,980;18:18,140;"Yeah, I felt like it was a personal attacker."
18:18,140;18:20,180;"You said that I was you."
18:20,180;18:22,540;"I thought that you were bringing it up for a different reason."
18:22,540;18:24,340;"What was that reason?"
18:24,340;18:25,260;"Oh, I'm not talking about you."
18:25,260;18:26,900;"I was talking about the listeners."
18:26,900;18:29,820;"Well, share with the listening that you're talking about."
18:29,820;18:37,540;"Oh, just the infamy of Paterno's later years and his cause of death and such."
18:37,540;18:40,340;"Yeah, what happened in those years?"
18:40,340;18:43,860;"Oh, yeah, there's some conspiracy theory out there about."
18:43,860;18:52,260;"I don't remember something to do with the the bowling guy that you dressed up for for Halloween from."
18:52,260;18:53,260;"OK."
18:54,020;18:57,220;"Yeah, so I think he was protecting him or something like that."
18:57,220;18:59,180;"Oh, are you talking about?"
18:59,180;19:00,580;"You know,"
19:00,580;19:05,020;"Yes."
19:05,020;19:05,520;"Yes."
19:05,520;19:06,420;"The reason I."
19:06,420;19:08,620;"All right, let's just say what it is."
19:08,620;19:12,180;"He's protecting a child molester."
19:12,180;19:12,860;"Correct."
19:12,860;19:15,940;"Who is, I think he's going to be in jail for life."
19:15,940;19:17,180;"What is it?"
19:17,180;19:18,460;"30, 40 years, something like that."
19:18,460;19:23,940;"Um, so I'm sure you didn't know a paternal on that."
19:23,940;19:28,020;"level where you would, you know, you could verify if he was protecting anybody or not."
19:28,020;19:29,140;"I don't know if you're correct."
19:29,140;19:32,300;"No, but I will say in terms of bad optics."
19:32,300;19:33,900;"Yeah, this game."
19:33,900;19:40,420;"Um, and for those that don't know me, I think at the time I was six to 150 pounds, I'd"
19:40,420;19:41,540;"say, that's not about right."
19:41,540;19:45,900;"Um, and I went to the game in, what was this?"
19:45,900;19:49,020;"Probably just late November, October."
19:49,020;19:53,920;"Um, in, you know, 50 years to agree with no shirt on and a sign that said,"
19:53,920;19:58,640;"And I'm not eating until Joe Pogg gets his whatever number win."
19:58,640;19:59,640;"Okay."
19:59,640;20:02,960;"So that was a tough look."
20:02,960;20:05,960;"And there were a few people taking pictures of me as I was walking into the game."
20:05,960;20:10,320;"Oh man, was that plastered all over articles when they were like outed him?"
20:10,320;20:11,320;"Probably."
20:11,320;20:12,320;"I hope not."
20:12,320;20:13,320;"Yes."
20:13,320;20:16,800;"But that picture is floating around somewhere."
20:16,800;20:20,560;"I mean, if it ever gets famous, I'm fucked."
20:20,560;20:24,560;"It is interesting though that you were there for that era."
20:24,560;20:32,800;"And how does it feel knowing that you supported this guy after being accused of what he supposedly"
20:32,800;20:33,800;"did?"
20:33,800;20:34,800;"I feel lied to."
20:34,800;20:36,160;"I feel personally attacked."
20:36,160;20:41,920;"Do you feel like you enabled his behavior?"
20:41,920;20:47,560;"I don't think I was there long enough to enable it because that one semester I went,"
20:47,560;20:49,560;"I went there for mechanical engineering."
20:49,560;20:51,560;"Oh, everything."
20:51,560;20:52,560;"Yeah."
20:52,560;21:03,080;"And I know that my GPA was either 0.53 or 0.55 and I think the reason I don't remember"
21:03,080;21:08,760;"exactly is because I don't want to sell you the numbers 53 and 55 for me to translate"
21:08,760;21:09,860;"or willy-meganess."
21:09,860;21:14,640;"So I don't remember who's it is because I don't want to associate that negativity with"
21:14,640;21:15,800;"their number."
21:15,800;21:16,800;"What happened, man?"
21:16,800;21:20,800;"Dude, it's worth $200."
21:20,800;21:22,920;"A 0-0 at least says I gave up."
21:22,920;21:28,360;"A 0.55 means I put in some effort and I was just that bad."
21:28,360;21:30,960;"No, you know what a 0.55 says?"
21:30,960;21:35,000;"No, a 0.55 says I showed up to nothing but the tests."
21:35,000;21:38,640;"It was completely blindsided by all of them."
21:38,640;21:40,440;"[LAUGHTER]"
21:40,440;21:45,880;"The wake up call was--"
21:45,880;21:46,880;"Oh my God."
21:46,880;21:48,280;"In the wake of all one."
21:48,280;21:49,880;"So the wake of the week."
21:49,880;21:50,880;"We're getting."
21:50,880;21:57,880;"Almost actually it was taking my chemistry midterm and getting a 20."
21:57,880;22:00,880;"Oh, something's wrong."
22:00,880;22:01,880;"Something been horribly awry."
22:01,880;22:03,880;"It beats me the last test of this show."
22:03,880;22:04,880;"Yeah."
22:04,880;22:09,080;"So, but this, this 100% explains why I don't remember any of these pages games because"
22:09,080;22:12,680;"they didn't get them down in state college, Pennsylvania."
22:12,680;22:15,680;"They weren't, they weren't showing pass games on some days."
22:15,680;22:23,360;"That's fair. So I will remember a lot of these games after winter break, December-ish."
22:23,360;22:28,560;"I'll start remembering them much more vividly because that's when I came home and then didn't"
22:28,560;22:34,160;"go back to Penn State second semester. I mean, is there a story there? Do you want me to deep dive"
22:34,160;22:39,920;"into that? I think it's pretty straightforward. I didn't go back because I was invited not to."
22:41,200;22:46,880;"Well, if we ever talk to your mom on here, I will have to ask her about, you know,"
22:46,880;22:49,200;"which is experiencing during this time."
22:49,200;22:55,520;"Oh, profound disappointment, but I don't think that was a an uncommon feeling."
22:55,520;23:01,200;"I bet the Patriots 2001 season sort of like softened the blow a little bit."
23:01,200;23:03,440;"It got me through it, man. It got me through it."
23:03,440;23:04,800;"I don't know about her, but it got me through it."
23:04,800;23:08,560;"Well, that's pretty interesting. Thank you for sharing."
23:08,560;23:12,960;"Yeah, oh absolutely. So on that note, I think we, you know, if we're going to talk about failure,"
23:12,960;23:15,600;"this is the perfect segue into this football game, don't you think?"
23:15,600;23:24,640;"Let's do it. I think it is. All right, so, this was an October game in Denver."
23:24,640;23:30,480;"The year before, Drew Bledsoe had actually come into Denver, and one of the five wins that the"
23:30,480;23:38,240;"the Patriots had was against this Broncos team, who like we said, were led by quarterback"
23:38,240;23:41,760;"Brian Greasy, who at the time of this was leading the league in touchdown."
23:41,760;23:49,000;"So I don't know if you guys caught that with 11, but he never kind of put it all together."
23:49,000;23:56,580;"It almost felt a bit like a Chad Pennington story where he was good, but they said the"
23:56,580;24:01,060;"the last two off seasons he had had to have shoulder surgery and just wasn't quite the"
24:01,060;24:02,060;"same."
24:02,060;24:04,060;"Yeah, I remember that."
24:04,060;24:05,060;"Yeah."
24:05,060;24:10,460;"So, uh, the Broncos even despite this game would finish eight and eight."
24:10,460;24:15,220;"They finished third in the AFC West and they actually this season never won or lost more"
24:15,220;24:16,220;"than two games in a row."
24:16,220;24:19,380;"They basically just alternated back and forth wins and losses."
24:19,380;24:25,900;"So they were almost the exact epitome of an eight and 18."
24:25,900;24:30,980;"coach was the infamous Mike Shanahan. This was right in the middle of his 20 year coaching"
24:30,980;24:37,140;"career. He coached from 88 to 2013, which I don't realize he was stuck around for that"
24:37,140;24:41,140;"long. He did two at the rate at the beginning and then his like the ballroom with the the"
24:41,140;24:46,500;"Broncos did 14 years with them and then finished four years with the Redskins. The fact that"
24:46,500;24:52,100;"he lasted four years with the Redskins in the early or the mid 2010s. I don't know how"
24:52,100;24:56,620;"you say that is probably until the RG three. Yeah."
24:56,620;25:00,060;"Exactly. A testament to his, his coach, a prowess."
25:00,060;25:05,580;"He did win back to back Super Bowls in 97, 98 with the John L."
25:05,580;25:08,080;"Way, Terrell Davis duo."
25:08,080;25:12,780;"Terrell Davis is actually on this team, but I think he was injury because he didn't play."
25:12,780;25:15,580;"Yeah, it was crazy. They said the injured for like three years."
25:15,580;25:19,940;"Yeah. And they were all like super mysterious injuries."
25:19,940;25:25,820;"it almost seemed like they were talking about, I wrote it down somewhere about his injury."
25:25,820;25:29,960;"And they just described it as, oh yeah, they were recovering from a leg injury."
25:29,960;25:32,520;"And their quote was that it was a pain in the leg."
25:32,520;25:35,280;"And they weren't sure why."
25:35,280;25:37,220;"Which I thought was weird too."
25:37,220;25:40,160;"They were definitely suspicious of it, but then he ended up like playing out the rest"
25:40,160;25:41,920;"of the season, I think."
25:41,920;25:42,920;"Yeah."
25:42,920;25:43,920;"I mean, he let's see."
25:43,920;25:47,640;"Yeah, he finished the season with 700 rushing yards, but no touchdowns."
25:47,640;25:51,880;"I think he was actually the leading Russia."
25:51,880;25:54,240;"No."
25:54,240;25:55,440;"Yeah, I think so."
25:55,440;25:57,280;"Anderson."
25:57,280;25:59,840;"Yeah, I think Mike Anderson had like 70 or something."
25:59,840;26:01,120;"And four touchdowns."
26:01,120;26:02,560;"Oh, you have thousand."
26:02,560;26:02,840;"Mike."
26:02,840;26:04,240;"No, you're insane."
26:04,240;26:05,160;"Yeah, dude."
26:05,160;26:08,240;"I actually have numbers on this because I went down the whole."
26:08,240;26:09,800;"Oh, yeah."
26:09,800;26:11,120;"Whose numbers are right?"
26:11,120;26:13,080;"Mike Anderson."
26:13,080;26:14,640;"We're in fact, I guess we're Steve."
26:14,640;26:15,040;"I am."
26:15,040;26:16,240;"I have two thousand."
26:16,240;26:16,920;"Yeah."
26:16,920;26:20,080;"So I actually did the fact checking on this."
26:20,080;26:24,200;"Trell Davis was leading rush with seven yards, but it was Mike Anderson, who had"
26:24,200;26:25,760;"the touchdown. He had four on the season."
26:25,760;26:26,480;"All right."
26:26,480;26:31,440;"So we were all a little right, but he had four of the seven rushing touch"
26:31,440;26:32,600;"rounds this team had all year."
26:32,600;26:34,960;"Seven rushing touch rounds."
26:34,960;26:42,320;"So that was the only year they didn't have a thousand yard rush shirt from 95"
26:42,320;26:50,000;"to 2006. So 12 seasons at 1000 yard Russia. Yeah. And I"
26:50,000;26:54,140;"think Jan Han for you. Yeah. And Terrell Davis had run for like two"
26:54,140;26:58,140;"years ago, he had run for like 2000 yards, or almost 2000"
26:58,140;27:00,620;"yards, something this and then the year before he had run for like"
27:00,620;27:01,860;"1200 or 1400."
27:01,860;27:05,460;"So that's the something crazy like that. That's a classic Adrian"
27:05,460;27:11,500;"Peterson effect. Mm. Sure. He also had like some other extracurricular"
27:11,500;27:18,140;"activities in there. Did he? Yeah, like spanking his kid raw and being suspended for a year."
27:18,140;27:20,740;"Agent Peterson or Terrell Davis? We're both."
27:20,740;27:24,460;"It's for impeters. I can't speak on Terrell Davis."
27:24,460;27:27,500;"Sergeant, he wasn't around back then. I thought you were breaking some news here."
27:27,500;27:29,900;"Geez. Give me time. You know what?"
27:29,900;27:34,380;"Terrell Davis, he was up to he was up to some shenanigans."
27:34,380;27:35,900;"He got to know good at here first."
27:36,860;27:43,100;"There was news on him today. Yeah, what's he's like putting poor today? Yes, and we're she called well and we're sure"
27:43,100;27:47,340;"He was yep, did you hear"
27:47,340;27:56,740;"No, they were buying cryogenic freezing tanks for $25,000 and not actually buying them"
27:56,740;28:04,940;"Who's ever gonna know right they racked up four million dollars in bullshit bills and who would ever find out"
28:04,940;28:08,940;"- Apparently the feds."
28:08,940;28:12,940;"- I just like that like Clinton Portis and like Joe Horn might have"
28:12,940;28:14,940;"mastered mine this whole thing."
28:14,940;28:15,940;"- Yeah."
28:15,940;28:17,940;"- With like Mr. Mine might be the background."
28:17,940;28:18,940;"- Like Mr. Woodward."
28:18,940;28:19,940;"- Yeah, I don't know."
28:19,940;28:20,940;"- He's like the henchmen."
28:20,940;28:21,940;"- Yeah, exactly."
28:21,940;28:22,940;"The lookout."
28:22,940;28:24,940;"- Jesus."
28:24,940;28:27,940;"- The man can't even see when he's wide open."
28:27,940;28:29,940;"I don't think he's a good lookout."
28:29,940;28:31,940;"Maybe that's what I got caught though."
28:31,940;28:33,940;"- Yeah, that's exactly what happened."
28:33,940;28:36,020;"We're getting off track a little bit."
28:36,020;28:37,940;"We will definitely get the Riche call."
28:37,940;28:41,180;"Well, I have thoughts, and I know Greg does too."
28:41,180;28:44,940;"But back to Mike Shanahan quickly."
28:44,940;28:47,180;"This is-- he's actually one of the few coaches"
28:47,180;28:51,060;"with a winning record against the Patriots since 2000."
28:51,060;28:54,460;"He was 5 and 4, which is probably-- I think"
28:54,460;28:56,740;"is notable just because I don't think he's going to find that"
28:56,740;28:59,340;"very often, at least not with that many games."
28:59,340;29:02,840;"What is that?"
29:02,840;29:04,840;"You watching TV Greg?"
29:04,840;29:07,840;"Yeah, I'm watching the Thursday night game."
29:07,840;29:08,840;"Alright."
29:08,840;29:09,840;"Football is on right now."
29:09,840;29:10,840;"Oh, Kelly."
29:10,840;29:11,840;"Oh boy."
29:11,840;29:12,840;"Oh no."
29:12,840;29:15,840;"Hey, no swearing on the pod, Kelly."
29:15,840;29:16,840;"Right?"
29:16,840;29:17,840;"What the fuck, Kelly?"
29:17,840;29:18,840;"Hey."
29:18,840;29:19,840;"Jesus Christ."
29:19,840;29:27,840;"We got an update."
29:27,840;29:30,840;"Kelly wants to cactus for Christmas."
29:30,840;29:32,280;"That's adorable."
29:32,280;29:34,560;"Oh, Jesus."
29:34,560;29:35,480;"I'll get our cat."
29:35,480;29:36,520;"So Christmas she shuts up."
29:36,520;29:39,520;"Hey, that's an approach."
29:39,520;29:45,680;"Ah, all right."
29:45,680;29:47,680;"Other coaches of note, uh,"
29:47,680;29:48,880;"offense coordinator was Gary"
29:48,880;29:50,960;"Kubiak, the Texans coach for 10"
29:50,960;29:51,360;"years."
29:51,360;29:51,920;"Oops."
29:51,920;29:52,920;"Coobs."
29:52,920;29:53,280;"Yep."
29:53,280;29:55,360;"Um, we, we liked it when he coached"
29:55,360;29:55,960;"Texans."
29:55,960;29:58,940;"Uh, and the other notable coach was"
29:58,940;30:00,520;"Anthony Lynn was a special teams"
30:00,520;30:04,920;"assistant. I'd say he now coaches the Chargers, but that might be"
30:04,920;30:08,680;"putting it lightly for what he does over there."
30:08,680;30:11,080;"Andy, you're always hating on other coaches."
30:11,080;30:14,520;"Right. Well, yeah, I'm sick of it. Yeah."
30:14,520;30:18,480;"Hey, if you want to run this segment, you can be more positive, but this is my"
30:18,480;30:19,480;"fucking segment. So"
30:19,480;30:24,120;"Hey, what are you going to say when all the rumors have Brady going to the"
30:24,120;30:28,440;"Chargers for some reason at like 43 years old and being coached by this guy"
30:28,440;30:29,760;"and winning a championship?"
30:29,880;30:33,640;"-Yep. I bet you thought Tomlin was an idiot like last year, didn't you?"
30:33,640;30:38,200;"-I still think Tomlin's an idiot. -Yeah, right, dude. He's going to one coach of the year."
30:38,200;30:42,520;"-Yeah. And you know what else is funny? -You know what, Bill Belichick, coach of the year award?"
30:42,520;30:45,720;"-No. -Look at this. This is such a homer. -Yeah, exactly."
30:45,720;30:49,240;"-You know what's funny? -I'm sorry. Do you realize what podcast you're on?"
30:49,240;30:55,320;"-Listen, you're going to be laughing your ass off when Tomlin wins coach of the year next year"
30:55,320;30:59,640;"with Brady throwing passes for touchdowns. -Braid you'll be backing up"
30:59,640;31:02,600;"duck hodges. Quack, quack, quack."
31:02,600;31:06,880;"But I actually, I actually do think what's going to happen next year."
31:06,880;31:12,480;"Next year, this is just my opinion. I'm sorry. But I think that Brady's going"
31:12,480;31:15,920;"to start off with the charges, get them to like a pretty quick start,"
31:15,920;31:21,960;"get traded to Pittsburgh, bring them on like on the verge of like the playoffs."
31:21,960;31:27,080;"And then like retire, that's my hot take. And the next year, he'll go back to"
31:27,080;31:28,160;"the Patriots and win again."
31:28,520;31:36,640;"That's a that's a Dwayne Parcel special right there. Oh, yeah. Oh good reference there, man. Well, the Dwayne Charles. Was that right?"
31:36,640;31:37,720;"Dwayne Charles."
31:37,720;31:41,720;"Oh, fuck."
31:41,720;31:44,680;"Don't get me started on Antonio Brown moving on."
31:44,680;31:47,240;"Speaking of wide receivers."
31:47,240;31:49,560;"Rob like that."
31:49,560;31:52,000;"Well, the broad Smith."
31:52,000;31:53,680;"He was."
31:53,680;31:58,200;"He's the only offensive pro bowler, I believe."
31:58,200;32:07,100;"the and the and the and the and he was all they had and he was he was hot shit he was a an under active for agent did you know that"
32:07,100;32:15,740;"the only said that he had the caffrey on this team because I've never heard I think okay cuz those two in the city retired"
32:15,740;32:16,740;"Wait, you were tired?"
32:16,740;32:18,740;"I thought you were tired the year before."
32:18,740;32:19,900;"Oh, okay."
32:19,900;32:23,100;"Yeah, because they were talking about finding a replacement for him and Rod."
32:23,100;32:25,740;"Well, actually, there was they weren't saying rods."
32:25,740;32:29,860;"I think Desmond Clark and they were talking about him being the"
32:29,860;32:30,780;"replacement the whole time."
32:30,780;32:32,540;"Did you see his jersey?"
32:32,540;32:35,100;"Oh, yeah, I was."
32:35,100;32:37,020;"I have another name on the name plate."
32:37,020;32:37,900;"I was going to add."
32:37,900;32:38,740;"Is that the guys?"
32:38,740;32:41,900;"Is that the only person with the full name on there?"
32:41,900;32:45,020;"That's the first time I've seen it and it is awesome."
32:45,340;32:49,420;"There was another guy that was D Clark as well that had both names on there."
32:49,420;32:52,940;"Did he have on? Yeah, because I because I looked it up to find out if they were"
32:52,940;32:57,100;"to D Clark and where there's Darius Clark and Desmond Clark."
32:57,100;33:03,300;"The Darius Clark also have his full name because I didn't see a shot of him"
33:03,300;33:07,220;"anywhere, but Desmond Clark definitely like full fucking name."
33:07,220;33:10,900;"And I want to clarify this."
33:12,380;33:16,300;"Edmond and Camferi did get hurt and be a season opener in the 2001 season."
33:16,300;33:16,900;"Oh, we did."
33:16,900;33:17,180;"Okay."
33:17,180;33:18,420;"Did he ever play again?"
33:18,420;33:19,740;"I don't think so."
33:19,740;33:21,420;"Okay."
33:21,420;33:21,860;"All right."
33:21,860;33:26,540;"You got to do you got to fill fill the time with stuff while I look this up, man."
33:26,540;33:28,940;"I'm not on my computer."
33:28,940;33:30,020;"Only go so fast."
33:30,020;33:32,140;"And that doesn't even do that."
33:32,140;33:34,380;"Uh, yeah."
33:34,380;33:39,660;"So Rod Smith went pro because he had 113 catches, 1300 yards and 11 touchdowns."
33:39,660;33:42,780;"So he was kind of the offense."
33:42,780;33:49,080;"And then they also had, uh, actually, no, there was another offensive"
33:49,080;33:49,500;"pro baller."
33:49,500;33:55,260;"It was tight end to Wayne Carrswell, who had a fucking game in this game."
33:55,260;33:55,660;"I believe."
33:55,660;33:56,020;"Sorry."
33:56,020;33:57,940;"See, this is what happens when I like Google."
33:57,940;34:03,780;"Oh, every cafe I think played a couple of more years."
34:03,780;34:04,060;"I don't know."
34:04,060;34:05,300;"Happen to 2001 season."
34:05,300;34:09,020;"It doesn't matter because he has his own brand of mustard and a horse."
34:09,020;34:16,020;"What do you think pay for Christian McCaffrey Stanford?"
34:16,020;34:18,460;"The mustard."
34:18,460;34:19,780;"Oh, man."
34:19,780;34:21,460;"You're a little too much."
34:21,460;34:22,460;"That's great."
34:22,460;34:27,460;"You laugh, Greg, but now you know what you're getting for Christmas and McCaffrey must have."
34:27,460;34:30,060;"I like the co-host, right?"
34:30,060;34:33,300;"I like the whole gift set."
34:33,300;34:35,100;"Drop in hand."
34:35,100;34:37,100;"Oh, yeah."
34:37,100;34:48,100;"Oh, yeah, so I think Google's a good Wikipedia. What we do without it. All right. On defense,"
34:48,100;34:55,780;"they actually had a bunch of pro bowlers. Al Wilson, the middle linebacker had 85 tackles."
34:55,780;35:02,820;"That was why he went Delta O'Neill. Delta O'Neill had nine interceptions in the season"
35:02,820;35:05,580;"than 25, uh, pass breakups, which is"
35:05,580;35:07,700;"pretty big."
35:07,700;35:09,340;"Now you don't see those sorts of numbers anymore."
35:09,340;35:10,340;"Yeah, he was awesome."
35:10,340;35:13,700;"Cause when it, when they start getting that sort of reputation,"
35:13,700;35:14,620;"you just stopped throwing at him."
35:14,620;35:16,660;"Uh, apparently that didn't happen this year."
35:16,660;35:19,140;"Although I think he also had one game with like three or four"
35:19,140;35:20,060;"interceptions early in the year."
35:20,060;35:24,060;"And maybe one against the Patriots will find out."
35:24,060;35:25,780;"Way to ruin that."
35:25,780;35:27,540;"But hey, wow."
35:27,540;35:28,020;"All right."
35:28,020;35:31,700;"Uh, also, uh, Ian Gold, the linebacker."
35:31,700;35:37,860;"I don't know why he made the pro ball because he didn't really seem to do much. You 41 tackles three sacks and two filmer recoveries"
35:37,860;35:40,420;"and Trevor Price the defensive tackle"
35:40,420;35:43,380;"Was a monster just in general"
35:43,380;35:47,540;"Other big names on this defense"
35:47,540;35:50,020;"Leon let"
35:50,020;35:52,020;"Was still playing"
35:52,020;35:55,780;"Super Bowl, right? I think so he was the one that um"
35:55,780;35:58,660;"He played for the cowboys. Yeah. Yeah"
35:59,460;36:02,320;"Oh, yeah, almost. But then Don BB random down and knock the ball."
36:02,320;36:03,600;"Oh, Tom, maybe. Wow."
36:03,600;36:04,720;"Oh, yeah."
36:04,720;36:06,720;"Very disappointing from Leon."
36:06,720;36:11,160;"Yeah. Also, John Mobley actually led the team in 91 tackles."
36:11,160;36:12,360;"I remember him."
36:12,360;36:15,760;"And of course, you know, what?"
36:15,760;36:17,560;"Coutinho Mobley."
36:17,560;36:19,360;"They're cousins."
36:19,360;36:21,360;"All right. From the NBA."
36:21,360;36:24,760;"Yeah. I got Mowgli from the Jungle Book."
36:24,760;36:27,960;"But that's nothing to do with this."
36:27,960;36:31,040;"Not their third cousins, so it's not quite work."
36:31,040;36:31,960;"Oh, okay."
36:31,960;36:36,160;"Funny, funny factoid that was Kelly's ex-boyfriend's nickname."
36:36,160;36:37,880;"Kelly?"
36:37,880;36:38,880;"Mowgli?"
36:38,880;36:39,760;"Yeah."
36:39,760;36:41,000;"Kelly, you want to talk about that?"
36:41,000;36:42,440;"No."
36:42,440;36:48,000;"That's a tough nickname, I think."
36:48,000;36:49,080;"All right."
36:49,080;36:57,440;"Speaking of tough people to follow, Bill Romanowski was also on this team."
36:57,440;36:59,120;"Oh, yeah, I went down that rabbit hole."
36:59,120;37:00,000;"Oh, yeah."
37:00,000;37:02,160;"No, well, I mean, should we just get to them now?"
37:02,160;37:03,640;"Let's get to them now."
37:03,640;37:04,400;"All right."
37:04,400;37:09,720;"So Bill Romanowski, a couple of notes that I had just in this game in general."
37:09,720;37:14,160;"They, they showed some stat where he has never missed a game in his entire career"
37:14,160;37:17,880;"all the way back to pop Warner, which sounds like bullshit, but there's no real"
37:17,880;37:18,560;"way to prove that."
37:18,560;37:23,320;"Um, I also had a note that says, uh, it looks like he'd rather play without a face mask."
37:23,320;37:25,480;"Not quite anyone."
37:25,880;37:29,600;"I'm not quite sure. Well, I think he just he'd rather just hit somebody with his face."
37:29,600;37:32,840;"You know what I heard a rumor about like him, which I don't know if it's true or not,"
37:32,840;37:39,020;"but he thought about reconstructing his face to actually embed the face mask into his"
37:39,020;37:41,160;"head so he didn't have to wear a helmet."
37:41,160;37:44,200;"I don't know if that's real."
37:44,200;37:46,760;"You don't think so?"
37:46,760;37:48,320;"I have no idea."
37:48,320;37:52,660;"I can see him putting in like metal implants in his jaw, just so he has a metal"
37:52,660;37:53,000;"jar."
37:53,000;37:55,680;"Yeah, just a little bit of reinforcement."
37:55,680;37:57,680;"Might have helped his face as well"
37:57,680;38:04,740;"That would be sick a little intimidating fuck yeah, and then the last note"
38:04,740;38:08,140;"I had on him is that every headshot of him looks like a mugshot even if it's not"
38:08,140;38:14,400;"This is correct. He has that craze like Florida man looking his eyes all the time. We think oh, I don't know"
38:14,400;38:16,920;"He got arrested for on this one. See you do like brain look"
38:16,920;38:21,040;"Do you know anything else about like the woman I'll skip besides all that stuff like did you?"
38:21,600;38:25,040;"him up. Okay. No, these are just my notes while I was watching the game. Oh,"
38:25,040;38:29,800;"then yes, I did the D dive. It sounds like you boys did anybody. Oh, yeah."
38:29,800;38:35,880;"Greg, go for it. That's a BC, which I didn't know. Yeah, he did. He's a local boy."
38:35,880;38:43,280;"Yeah. And then there was a bunch of articles about how he was like super friendly and nice at BC and like"
38:43,280;38:50,440;"very professional and not aggressive at all. I wonder what could have changed that. Couple concussions."
38:50,440;38:57,200;"Well, I was gonna go with steroids. Yeah, I mean probably a bit of both. I think there's some bull semen in there as well"
38:57,200;39:01,280;"I'm pretty sure dear. I want your doctor Henry on this guy"
39:01,280;39:07,240;"I think in from her tonight exactly what he put into his body, but I'll tell you this man. Oh, well"
39:07,240;39:15,080;"There you go, but he had a he had a tackle box or whatever of like over a hundred pills that he would take daily"
39:15,080;39:18,680;"And I can definitely confirm that he's injected"
39:19,960;39:22,560;"Black sheep sells into his body"
39:22,560;39:27,520;"The bull semen I think that's a fact and then"
39:27,520;39:33,040;"Horse semen while very hard very hard to come across"
39:33,040;39:37,680;"That too, I don't know I feel you wouldn't be"
39:37,680;39:42,320;"Around I mean"
39:42,320;39:47,520;"Middily a ton about horse even but I'm pretty sure that was for his sexual performance. Oh not for"
39:49,280;39:55,360;"Can we interview this guy and see how that was turning out because I wonder you can I mean why don't we just try it?"
39:55,360;39:58,040;"Yeah, let's just see what happens. I mean"
39:58,040;40:05,520;"Football and then like his how his passionate nights were in the bedroom as well because I am curious how"
40:05,520;40:13,000;"The horse demon not that I am looking into it at all. Well, like I am curious how the horse even had an effect on his"
40:13,000;40:17,600;"performance, so I just Google horse semen and then my phone's ringing and"
40:18,000;40:20,000;"It says it's the FBI."
40:20,000;40:23,000;"Well, did you get a user in the top of that?"
40:23,000;40:24,000;"I'm not going to add to that."
40:24,000;40:25,000;"In-cock needle."
40:25,000;40:26,000;"Yeah."
40:26,000;40:29,000;"And I probably shouldn't be using my work laptop either, huh?"
40:29,000;40:30,000;"No."
40:30,000;40:32,000;"In-cock needle, though, guys."
40:32,000;40:33,000;"In-cock needle window."

40:34,000;40:36,000;"Don't accept cookies."
40:36,000;40:40,000;"And if you have to, just reinstall windows."
40:40,000;40:41,000;"And Tor."
40:41,000;40:43,000;"You always use the Tor network."
40:43,000;40:44,000;"What the hell is that?"
40:44,000;40:45,000;"Don't worry about it."
40:45,000;40:46,000;"Nurch it."
40:46,000;40:51,200;"Um, so yeah, I did some, some digging on his Wikipedia."
40:51,200;40:55,160;"And after his career, he was listed by ESPN as a fifth"
40:55,160;40:57,360;"dirtiest player in professional team sports history."
40:57,360;41:02,200;"Uh, I didn't, that's a good question."
41:02,200;41:03,160;"I didn't actually look that up."
41:03,160;41:08,800;"Um, but now that, now that I've said that out loud, it's, uh, it makes"
41:08,800;41:09,440;"you Google it."
41:09,440;41:10,800;"Yeah."
41:10,800;41:11,840;"Like stat check."
41:12,120;41:16,280;"It's actually perfect Albert Haynesworth, Rodney Harrison."
41:16,280;41:19,780;"And I wish I had another one off the top of my head because I would have"
41:19,780;41:21,780;"sounded really legitimate, but I think Google shit."
41:21,780;41:24,260;"Oh, that was really good."
41:24,260;41:24,860;"Actually, right."
41:24,860;41:30,100;"It was all of sports, but I really love what you did there."
41:30,100;41:31,260;"That's how it goes."

41:32,860;41:34,140;"They just what comes to mind?"
41:34,140;41:39,180;"Where did I find that?"
41:39,180;41:40,980;"We need a fifth guy in there, right?"

42:56,780;43:02,860;"Um, before he started, um, Apple, uh, he was actually like a pretty big football"
43:02,860;43:03,580;"player for a while."
43:03,580;43:03,820;"Yeah."
43:03,820;43:04,780;"The offensive lineman."
43:04,780;43:08,460;"So I mean, yeah, the quote is, whiz is probably the dirtiest offensive"
43:08,460;43:13,340;"player of all time set a teammate. One opponent offered this critique. He chops from behind,"
43:13,340;43:17,480;"he'll shoot knees. I'll take sides with any old lineman, but this motherfucker had me"
43:17,480;43:20,700;"cursing and swearing on TV. I couldn't believe the shots he took."
43:20,700;43:25,380;"No, it's true. And then like he was such a dirty player that he got booted from the"
43:25,380;43:28,620;"league or no one would sign him and then he started Apple."
43:28,620;43:33,060;"And then he was the monster, right, for monster zinc?"
43:33,060;43:37,300;"Well, he did do the voiceover originally, but then he got replaced by, I think it was"
43:37,300;43:38,300;"John Givin."
43:38,300;43:39,300;"Holy fuck."
43:39,300;43:51,060;"And the only other name on this list from football that you recognize is number 10,"
43:51,060;43:52,660;"Jack Tatum."
43:52,660;43:53,660;"We all know."

44:04,020;44:05,020;"Yeah, man."
44:05,020;44:06,020;"He's like going to town."
44:06,020;44:08,380;"He's having sex in public just to keep his heart rate."
44:08,380;44:09,500;"It's a great concept."
44:09,500;44:10,580;"Yeah, I'll do it."
44:10,580;44:13,540;"It was like speed, but in a human."
44:13,540;44:18,740;"That's a perfect summary for those that have not seen this movie."
44:18,740;44:20,180;"Oh, nailed it."
44:20,180;44:21,180;"I love it."
44:21,180;44:23,740;"All right."
44:23,740;44:26,300;"So we want to touch on why Rome"
44:26,300;44:27,300;"asked you this comeback."
44:27,300;44:29,740;"Yeah, there's more."
44:29,740;44:31,100;"I thought that was it."
44:31,100;44:32,500;"Oh, no, I mean, so."
44:32,500;44:35,700;"He actually has a laundry list."
44:35,700;44:40,820;"Let's see. He was involved with numerous altercations with both teammates and opponents in 95,"
44:40,820;44:45,780;"while with the Eagles, he was rejected from a game for kicking Arizona Cardinals full-back"
44:45,780;44:47,220;"Larry centers in the head."
44:47,220;44:49,340;"Do you have his helmet on?"
44:49,340;44:53,140;"It doesn't say. Two more incidents occurred to a 97 season."
44:53,140;44:54,700;"They played for the Broncos."
44:54,700;44:59,340;"And the first he was fined after helmet to helmet hit on then Carolina Panthers quarterback"
44:59,340;45:03,260;"Kerry Collins in pre-season game resulting Collins sustaining a broken jaw."
45:03,780;45:06,380;"I looked that up. It was ridiculous."
45:06,380;45:09,700;"It was brutal hit. I remember it like when it happened."
45:09,700;45:12,020;"A second launching yourself."
45:12,020;45:13,700;"You know, they say that. Oh, yeah."
45:13,700;45:17,260;"He like a missile with his head."
45:17,260;45:19,460;"Oh, yeah. What a crowd he's telling me into his chin."
45:19,460;45:22,660;"It was like, wouldn't Collins say to him to inspire that?"
45:22,660;45:24,620;"You don't know. Nothing. He had a broken jaw."
45:24,620;45:25,740;"Yeah, exactly."
45:25,740;45:27,460;"Maybe he was mouth shot next time."
45:27,460;45:31,700;"The second incident that season"
45:31,700;45:35,580;"That was him spitting in the face of JJ Stokes, remember?"
45:35,580;45:36,700;"I remember that one."
45:36,700;45:37,780;"Yeah, it was great."
45:37,780;45:38,780;"We were working on that one."
45:38,780;45:40,700;"Oh, yeah, they caught it clean."
45:40,700;45:41,260;"It was perfect."
45:41,260;45:42,100;"Yeah."
45:42,100;45:43,420;"And he was a huge luge."
45:43,420;45:44,180;"Yeah."
45:44,180;45:46,940;"And then two years later, while still with the Broncos, he was"
45:46,940;45:51,100;"find a total of $42,500 for three illegal hits plus a punch"
45:51,100;45:53,980;"thrown at Kansas City Chiefs tight on Tony Gonzalez."
45:53,980;45:57,020;"There's also find an undisclosed amount for throwing a football"
45:57,020;46:00,660;"at Brian Cox of the New York Jets, the ball hitting him in the crotch area."
46:00,660;46:06,040;"that's probably deserved though I mean talk to the cleanest player either I'll"
46:06,040;46:11,820;"know you know for the dad on that one alright but the big one in 2003 Roman"
46:11,820;46:15,060;"else he attacked an injured one of his teammates Marcus Williams during a"
46:15,060;46:19,420;"scrimmage Williams a backup tight end for the Oakland Raiders was forced to"
46:19,420;46:24,060;"retire after Romanowski confronted Williams after play ripped off his helmet"
46:24,060;46:27,780;"and crushed his eye socket with a punch"
46:27,780;46:34,780;"that one that one"
46:34,780;46:37,300;"yes so uh... william sued for damages of three point four million dollars"
46:37,300;46:41,140;"arguing that roman house given suffering from roid rage when he attacked him"
46:41,140;46:42,980;"williams was awarded"
46:42,980;46:46,540;"three hundred forty thousand dollars for lost wages and medical expense trees"
46:46,540;46:50,180;"that i think it's been says"
46:50,180;46:52,700;"who's i don't know"
46:52,700;46:57,300;"that's a sad story and the proof that"
46:57,300;46:58,900;"I'm sure this tape out there."
46:58,900;47:05,860;"I don't know. And then he has to live as the guy who sued Bill Romanowski and got paid out."
47:05,860;47:10,660;"Just like that, I'm sure you guys heard about woman that sued McDonald's for coffee and she was"
47:10,660;47:17,780;"infamous for getting a free ride or whatever. Well, little known fact, I watch a little documentary"
47:17,780;47:26,580;"on that lady. I don't know why. But she burned herself so badly that basically"
47:26,580;47:32,260;"really just like rip through her skin, cause there were like a lifetime medical problems"
47:32,260;47:38,740;"and then mental anguish from everybody referring to that lady as you know, getting whatever."
47:38,740;47:41,820;"I mean, everyone got the she got millions of dollars exactly."
47:41,820;47:45,140;"And they said that like she got millions of dollars at the end of the day, it was like"
47:45,140;47:46,500;"a hundred grand."
47:46,500;47:48,500;"So yeah, something like that."
47:48,500;47:53,860;"So I feel like that lady, this guy who got punched in the eye, really tough."
47:53,860;47:54,860;"Feel for them."
47:54,860;47:55,860;"Yeah."
47:55,860;47:58,260;"Good for you. Way to be passionate."
47:58,260;47:59,660;"I like the people."
47:59,660;48:01,660;"Dude, a lot of documentaries out there."
48:01,660;48:07,560;"All right, let's probably talk about this game."
48:07,560;48:08,060;"Yeah."
48:08,060;48:10,960;"We've circled around it for an hour."
48:10,960;48:11,960;"So,"
48:11,960;48:15,360;"these storylines in this game,"
48:15,360;48:18,160;"did you know Brady and Greasy went to same college?"
48:18,160;48:21,060;"I don't know if you knew that."
48:21,060;48:24,060;"They actually talked trash before the game on the phone,"
48:24,060;48:24,760;"apparently."
48:24,760;48:31,040;"Let's see, they both actually started off hot."
48:31,040;48:35,920;"They completed their first 12 passes combined in the first half."
48:35,920;48:40,680;"And then I actually had something that they didn't bring up, but I noticed."
48:40,680;48:45,720;"And I think I want to actually pose this to Greg, because I know this is probably something"
48:45,720;48:48,680;"of his alley."
48:48,680;48:54,720;"I want to posit that the number 24 for defensive backs is the same as the number 10 in soft."
48:54,720;49:04,280;"as in the best players have that number because you could go down the list of number 24s and they're all like a who's who you got"
49:04,280;49:11,640;"tie law Dao Revis Charles Woodson champ Bailey Delpha O'Neill Delpha Delpha"
49:11,640;49:20,680;"yeah man I and I probably had like 90% of their jerseys when I was a kid I think I've been Dao re you had a Charles Woodson"
49:20,680;49:26,740;"I had a really oh you did it. Oh, yeah, you never did you have a champ Bailey? I had a champ Bailey. I"
49:26,740;49:31,360;"Had a I didn't have an O'Neill. I would sin"
49:31,360;49:36,040;"Yeah, I had obviously like seven tie-law jerseys. Yeah. Oh, yeah"
49:36,040;49:38,440;"What was the guy from the Seahawks?"
49:38,440;49:42,360;"Guy from the Seahawks"
49:42,360;49:45,480;"He wasn't even that good and I had it"
49:48,440;49:52,580;"But yeah, you're absolutely correct that like every legit"
49:52,580;50:00,120;"24 or every legit cornerback is always number 24. That's what I felt like I also have an interesting one"
50:00,120;50:02,120;"I've been picking up on number"
50:02,120;50:07,660;"Name and a week wide receiver and today's NFL that it has a number in the 80s"
50:07,660;50:12,400;"Now they don't wear them anymore. They're all the teens now. Mm-hmm. I don't know why"
50:12,400;50:15,560;"Danny and the bowl"
50:16,600;50:18,600;"Gunnar all chef ski"
50:18,600;50:28,600;"He's number eighties, I mean number 80 I think number 80 is for wider SeaViz. What number 24 is for"
50:28,600;50:33,080;"Defense of backs"
50:33,080;50:38,960;"Yeah, it's a legendary number for sure. Yeah, I think so too"
50:38,960;50:46,120;"All right, so let's touch on the game a bit I suppose no Terry Glenn again"
50:46,120;50:53,240;"He was inactive. There was literally no mention of it though. I know that in"
50:53,240;50:58,400;"even in the bossing globe on Sunday, there was something tacked on to the end"
50:58,400;51:02,520;"of an unrelated story. Oh, it's the Brian Greasy story, the Brady Greasy"
51:02,520;51:06,280;"connection. And right on the end, like the last sentence was, ""Why did you see"
51:06,280;51:09,080;"Viteri Glenn did not make the trip so he will miss a second straight game with a"
51:09,080;51:14,760;"hamstring injury?"" And there was a week before there was all sorts of controversy"
51:14,760;51:18,760;"where he said he was healthy enough and he made the trip but he didn't dress for the"
51:18,760;51:22,640;"game because the Patriots didn't activate him or something."
51:22,640;51:27,720;"So I think this feels like the beginning of the end for Terry Glenn."
51:27,720;51:31,040;"Last the week before he did to Indianapolis he made the trip."
51:31,040;51:33,840;"He was on the sidelines but wasn't dressed."
51:33,840;51:36,800;"This week he didn't even make the trip."
51:36,800;51:40,240;"Is that a Belichick decision or is that a Terry Glenn decision?"
51:40,240;51:41,640;"Nobody knows."
51:41,640;51:43,640;"My guess is it's a ballot check decision."
51:43,640;51:51,120;"But somebody who was in uniform was our golden child,"
51:51,120;51:51,960;"Drew Bledsoe."
51:51,960;51:56,500;"In uniform, he was the emergency quarterback for this game."
51:56,500;51:59,520;"I don't think even in emergency,"
51:59,520;52:01,040;"they probably would have put him in"
52:01,040;52:03,840;"because if they would have, this was the game to do it."
52:03,840;52:09,040;"Let's see."
52:10,640;52:12,420;"I have for this the offense."
52:12,420;52:13,760;"It was zero run game again."
52:13,760;52:20,420;"Uh, I always pictured, it must have happened in the second half once I failed out of Penn State, but, um,"
52:20,420;52:26,560;"I always pictured this team kind of built around the running game of Antoine Smith."
52:26,560;52:31,000;"And I don't think he's rushed for 100 yards yet this season, has he?"
52:31,000;52:32,300;"Maybe one game."
52:32,300;52:36,080;"I think early on the first Colts game, maybe I think he did."
52:36,080;52:39,680;"But I think I can always remember that too."
52:39,680;52:45,080;"I think it's, I mean, even the defense was highly touted in the 2001 season."
52:45,080;52:50,400;"And as of now, we're seeing like little hints of everything, right?"
52:50,400;52:54,800;"Like nothing's like really like working cohesively yet."
52:54,800;52:55,640;"Yeah."
52:55,640;52:59,520;"Like in this game, the Patriots in the second half, they couldn't stop the run whatsoever."
52:59,520;53:02,280;"Given up like seven, eight yards a carry sort of thing."
53:02,280;53:08,840;"And also the last general note I had was that the Patriots still haven't figured"
53:08,840;53:11,760;"at how to block downfield on running back screens."
53:11,760;53:13,280;"I feel like they set it up perfectly,"
53:13,280;53:15,320;"and then Kevin Falk immediately runs"
53:15,320;53:18,480;"into the back of one of his blockers every time."
53:18,480;53:20,280;"- Yeah, it was in strong suit."
53:20,280;53:22,800;"- No, no, it wasn't."
53:22,800;53:24,640;"- You're talking about the run game,"
53:24,640;53:27,600;"and the passing game was sort of all over the place"
53:27,600;53:29,320;"'cause they were grooming Brady."
53:29,320;53:33,000;"But I thought they had put up this stat"
53:33,000;53:34,840;"where they were asking,"
53:34,840;53:36,400;"I guess maybe it was the first time that was uttered,"
53:36,400;53:37,440;"is this Brady's bunch?"
53:37,440;53:39,000;"So they were already bringing that up."
53:39,000;53:39,500;"Yeah."
53:39,500;53:42,440;"And it was like a Brady versus Bledsoe sort of comparison"
53:42,440;53:44,080;"up to that point in the season."
53:44,080;53:48,360;"And Brady record wide was a three and one."
53:48,360;53:50,000;"Bledsoe was 0 and 2."
53:50,000;53:55,360;"But what really stuck out for me was points per game."
53:55,360;53:57,840;"So under Bledsoe was like 10 points a game."
53:57,840;54:00,520;"Under Brady, it was 30.3."
54:00,520;54:05,680;"So I'm trying to figure out where that really comes from"
54:05,680;54:07,520;"because like nothing really like wowed me"
54:07,520;54:09,280;"in the beginning of the season so far,"
54:09,280;54:12,360;"but he's putting up the points somehow."
54:12,360;54:15,680;"- Yeah, I don't know if it was so much him putting up"
54:15,680;54:18,960;"the points 'cause I know if I go back to the first"
54:18,960;54:21,360;"Colts game in his first start,"
54:21,360;54:22,920;"it was mostly defense where they had a couple"
54:22,920;54:26,040;"of pick sixes in short fields."
54:26,040;54:29,400;"And then they didn't put up any real points"
54:29,400;54:30,840;"in the Dolphins game."
54:30,840;54:35,400;"And then the second Colts game was a bunch of trick plays"
54:35,400;54:43,400;"I think the only game that you could really give to Brady was the Chargers game where you brought him back from that deficit."
54:43,400;54:49,400;"Which actually I was getting angry at the commentators believe it or not."
54:49,400;54:52,400;"No, for their for their commentation."
54:52,400;54:59,400;"Yeah, it's usually it's a problem, but these guys were they were pretty decent, I thought, Andy."
54:59,400;55:01,400;"They were in for an."
55:01,400;55:02,400;"Inocuous, yeah."
55:02,400;55:03,400;"Okay."
55:03,400;55:08,600;"But they kept talking about how this was the first time Tom, they were asking Tom Brady"
55:08,600;55:10,920;"to go out and win the game by himself."
55:10,920;55:13,200;"Oh, yeah, that did irritate me."
55:13,200;55:15,280;"Look, bro, did you miss the charges game?"
55:15,280;55:17,680;"He put the team on his back for that one."
55:17,680;55:19,720;"Yeah, what have you done for me lately?"
55:19,720;55:21,280;"Yeah, I guess so."
55:21,280;55:24,280;"I mean, even though that was like what?"
55:24,280;55:26,280;"Two weeks before?"
55:26,280;55:27,280;"Yeah."
55:27,280;55:29,280;"Two weeks, three weeks."
55:29,280;55:30,280;"three weeks."
55:30,280;55:32,020;"They're just like the listeners of the moment, Andy."
55:32,020;55:33,420;"Oh, that's good."
55:33,420;55:34,420;"I agree."
55:34,420;55:35,420;"Yeah."
55:35,420;55:37,840;"Well, we're not because we historians, so we get to go back and judge them on this"
55:37,840;55:38,840;"ship."
55:38,840;55:39,840;"That's true."
55:39,840;55:40,840;"Yeah."
55:40,840;55:46,360;"Well, one, one pro for Brady was that at this point, five touchdowns, no picks."
55:46,360;55:49,880;"Plus it was two touchdowns, two picks."
55:49,880;55:52,280;"So at least he was managing these games properly."
55:52,280;55:55,080;"It's probably why I fella check stuck with them."
55:55,080;55:56,080;"Yeah."
55:56,080;55:57,080;"And it looked."
55:57,080;55:58,080;"It looked good early."
55:58,080;56:01,080;"Like I said Brady completed his first eight passes in a row"
56:01,080;56:05,680;"And the only reason that streak up broken was Rod Rutledge"
56:05,680;56:10,960;"The infamous rod Rutledge dropped an easy completion to break that streak like hit him right in the hands"
56:10,960;56:16,360;"And he turned around to really sort of thing he threw a dart on that first touchdown - oh"
56:16,360;56:18,800;"Man, that was beautiful"
56:18,800;56:26,560;"That's Brady for the next 15 years throw right there. Yeah, that's like some 35 yards out -"
56:26,560;56:30,560;"right on the head mark will play action turn around and just"
56:30,560;56:35,640;"Absolutely laser right on the money. Yeah"
56:35,640;56:43,240;"And you know those two when Brady gets those like he does that play action and then he hits that back step"
56:43,240;56:47,160;"And he's already like halfway through his throw in motion. You know that hard play action"
56:47,160;56:49,160;"We've got the ball fully extended"
56:49,160;56:51,680;"Back back to the defense"
56:52,400;56:56,500;"maybe Tom Brady of today should look at these tapes and"
56:56,500;57:03,040;"Pick up a few tricks bro. You still doing it. Hey, I don't know. I haven't seen it. Okay"
57:03,040;57:09,060;"Still doing it. I haven't seen it. You blame it on the line. You blame it on father time. I"
57:09,060;57:13,440;"Wish I had another rhyme. Oh, I did but yeah"
57:13,440;57:19,520;"Man, we're not a play the game. God damn it simmer down. Okay. Hey, had a"
57:21,800;57:27,860;"Almost a career-long rushing attempt. That was beautiful and I like the fire from him too bad"
57:27,860;57:31,260;"It went for it was for not but I think that'll serve them well in the future, but anyways"
57:31,260;57:33,320;"the past"
57:33,320;57:36,380;"Yeah, so there was a quote from I"
57:36,380;57:40,380;"Believe it was Steve Tasker was a common to the color commentator"
57:40,380;57:45,840;"About Brady said it looks like a tall drill my antenna looks the same out there"
57:45,840;57:48,740;"Which he may be the first"
57:48,740;57:51,580;"commentator on record"
57:51,580;57:55,580;"to compare Tom Brady to Joe Montana."
57:55,580;57:57,580;"- Which is a bold take because I think this is"
57:57,580;57:59,500;"three or four games into his career."
57:59,500;58:03,100;"- Yeah, especially in the fact that Brady would go on"
58:03,100;58:08,100;"to throw some ill-advised passes down the stretch here."
58:08,100;58:11,420;"When the first half he looked good,"
58:11,420;58:14,420;"he was 13, 16, 119 yards to touchdowns,"
58:14,420;58:17,300;"including that absolute laser to David Patton."
58:18,300;58:23,100;"The other touchdown was the patented kind of goal line area."
58:23,100;58:24,520;"Um,"
58:24,520;58:29,320;"fake the heavy run and throw it to the wide receiver who's like,"
58:29,320;58:32,000;"run that quick post route wide open wide receiver."
58:32,000;58:32,980;"Oh, always."
58:32,980;58:34,800;"And Brady, I don't even think he looks."
58:34,800;58:37,440;"I think we've talked about this in early episodes where you just kind of."
58:37,440;58:41,680;"He, he fakes that hand off like Greg says, hit that back step and just"
58:41,680;58:44,720;"chucks it straight at the, the, the post of the goal post."
58:45,600;58:47,160;"And that's where the receipt was supposed to be."
58:47,160;58:50,160;"And in this case, Troy Brown was there."
58:50,160;58:52,760;"And that was their opening touchdown."
58:52,760;58:57,280;"That was never been touched out."
58:57,280;58:58,080;"I lied."
58:58,080;58:58,920;"Yeah, I was second."
58:58,920;58:59,960;"Second touchdown."
58:59,960;59:01,480;"Yeah."
59:01,480;59:05,840;"In between those was the pages trying"
59:05,840;59:07,680;"to reach in that bag of tricks that"
59:07,680;59:09,880;"worked so well last week against the Colts."
59:09,880;59:11,760;"They have a patent attempted to get another pass"
59:11,760;59:13,840;"on the reverse pass."
59:13,840;59:16,200;"but it got picked off quite easily."
59:16,200;59:19,160;"It was not a, not a great throw."
59:19,160;59:22,520;"No, that was pretty bad actually."
59:22,520;59:24,800;"And to like double coverage, I believe."
59:24,800;59:26,120;"Yeah."
59:26,120;59:27,880;"And it was under thrown under the round."
59:27,880;59:28,360;"Yeah."
59:28,360;59:29,480;"A real easy interception."
59:29,480;59:31,320;"So who was the receiver on that one?"
59:31,320;59:34,200;"Charles Johnson or something, something Johnson."
59:34,200;59:37,040;"I think it was not like it was Charles Johnson."
59:37,040;59:38,040;"Yeah."
59:38,040;59:39,040;"Yeah."
59:39,040;59:41,080;"That's not a guy you want to throw into double coverage."
59:41,080;59:42,240;"Somebody though."
59:42,240;59:44,640;"He is. He was somebody for like a year."
59:44,640;59:46,800;"Yeah, he didn't pan out."
59:46,800;59:49,320;"Yeah, he was awesome in Madden, though."
59:49,320;59:51,240;"Florida. Very fast."
59:51,240;59:56,680;"I will say, though, because you know, you're"
59:56,680;59:58,640;"home wearing it up here. What's called a spade"
59:58,640;01:00:02,200;"is paid early on."
01:00:02,200;01:00:03,760;"The refs were terrible."
01:00:03,760;01:00:07,680;"And yeah, right off the bat, first drive,"
01:00:07,680;01:00:10,960;"you know, the extended Patriots drive because"
01:00:10,960;01:00:15,520;"they call roughing the passer against Brady, Moron Brady."
01:00:15,520;01:00:20,960;"And that was the shades of the NFL wanting Brady to succeed."
01:00:20,960;01:00:22,640;"I feel right from the bat."
01:00:22,640;01:00:27,880;"It was, I mean, other than the fact that it was an obvious and probably intentional"
01:00:27,880;01:00:28,800;"roughing the passer."
01:00:28,800;01:00:30,960;"I don't remember."
01:00:30,960;01:00:38,000;"He, I know what he, he placed his hand and shoved Brady in the head into the ground."
01:00:38,000;01:00:40,360;"But like, like,"
01:00:40,640;01:00:42,040;"But he plays it."
01:00:42,040;01:00:42,760;"Yeah."
01:00:42,760;01:00:44,080;"You didn't sell."
01:00:44,080;01:00:45,080;"That's what I'm saying."
01:00:45,080;01:00:46,320;"It's like any other year."
01:00:46,320;01:00:49,480;"Again, it's the wolves helping Brady and all this other non-tension."
01:00:49,480;01:00:53,120;"When I saw that, like, they threw the flag for intentional ground."
01:00:53,120;01:00:59,240;"I'm like, I can't wait to see the replay given what we've seen this year of, like, how,"
01:00:59,240;01:01:01,560;"like, how much more physical the game was."
01:01:01,560;01:01:04,160;"Like, he must have got his head taken off."
01:01:04,160;01:01:05,680;"I barely touched him."
01:01:05,680;01:01:06,720;"I was."
01:01:06,720;01:01:10,600;"I was mad for Denver."
01:01:10,600;01:01:17,400;"Yeah, I mean to disagree and then and then right you want to talk about the Patriots like don't get any breaks or whatever"
01:01:17,400;01:01:22,960;"Okay, um the Broncos. They got a touchdown because the Patriots jumped off sides"
01:01:22,960;01:01:29,520;"Greasy throws a touchdown pass like 60 yards, but they blew the whistle"
01:01:29,520;01:01:36,120;"Why who knows why because the commissioner at the time putting a call like hey blow the whistle"
01:01:36,120;01:01:42,400;"Because I've never heard a whistle on an ostrich ball ever but it happened here touch that call back"
01:01:42,400;01:01:48,780;"I'm believe it was it was unabated to the quarterback and the left tackle was also moving at the same time"
01:01:48,780;01:01:50,780;"But yeah, right yeah, well whatever"
01:01:50,780;01:01:58,520;"This is gonna be an ongoing thing where apparently Greg and I are gonna keep an eye on how fair this is because I hate"
01:01:58,520;01:02:05,400;"I want the Patriots to win legitimately and we're figuring that out as we go. Oh, we're just speaking truth to power, you know"
01:02:05,400;01:02:09,680;"I think it's a book like this bootlickers both of you."
01:02:09,680;01:02:12,480;"Hey, why, why would anybody listen to this?"
01:02:12,480;01:02:13,920;"If they're not getting the hard facts."
01:02:13,920;01:02:16,720;"You're right."
01:02:16,720;01:02:19,880;"Who would hear also be listening to this other than Patriots haters?"
01:02:19,880;01:02:20,960;"Right."
01:02:20,960;01:02:24,000;"Well, I'm not to say I'm just we got to find out the truth."
01:02:24,000;01:02:25,440;"Are we expanding our market?"
01:02:25,440;01:02:26,280;"Is that what we're trying to do?"
01:02:26,280;01:02:28,800;"Do we have a market to expand on?"
01:02:28,800;01:02:34,560;"Well, yeah, I mean, mama Brad listening."
01:02:34,560;01:02:40,240;"So I think if we if we should on me long, she's already she's gonna listen to this."
01:02:40,240;01:02:42,080;"I apologize for my language."
01:02:42,080;01:02:45,680;"Mrs. Brown and anything else that comes out of my mouth or your son else."
01:02:45,680;01:02:47,200;"You have met Mrs. Brown, right?"
01:02:47,200;01:02:50,160;"Yeah, but I mean, it's been a while since I've chatted with her, man."
01:02:50,160;01:02:51,680;"That's fair."
01:02:51,680;01:02:55,360;"But yeah, I mean, I think if you guys keep shooting on me long enough, McBrown will"
01:02:55,360;01:02:57,840;"even join this and he'll start listening."
01:02:57,840;01:03:00,080;"So I think he scares me to this day."
01:03:00,080;01:03:00,640;"Yeah."
01:03:00,640;01:03:01,840;"He scares the Penn State thing."
01:03:01,840;01:03:07,840;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:03:07,840;01:03:13,480;"So yeah, so first half went pretty well."
01:03:13,480;01:03:16,480;"Ended at a page of 17, Bronco's 10."
01:03:16,480;01:03:18,840;"There was a play I want to talk about in the middle."
01:03:18,840;01:03:25,760;"It was in the second quarter, and Greasy throws a ball that"
01:03:25,760;01:03:29,200;"gets deflected and is picked off by Teddy Bruski,"
01:03:29,200;01:03:30,880;"and then chaos ensues."
01:03:30,880;01:03:32,680;"Did you guys see this play?"
01:03:32,680;01:03:33,180;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:33,180;01:03:37,500;"I mean, if we want to-- if you're bringing up your worst,"
01:03:37,500;01:03:41,280;"that was my best and worst on the same play."
01:03:41,280;01:03:42,700;"Oh, we'll tease that for now."
01:03:42,700;01:03:44,860;"So we'll save that for a little bit,"
01:03:44,860;01:03:48,980;"because that play was absolute bananas."
01:03:48,980;01:03:51,060;"First half, great."
01:03:51,060;01:03:53,700;"The second half, not so much."
01:03:53,700;01:03:58,780;"I think we'll have to get into that a little bit."
01:03:58,780;01:04:00,460;"Well, it was also foreshadowed."
01:04:00,460;01:04:04,560;"I thought by another brilliant NFL.com poll where the question was,"
01:04:04,560;01:04:06,760;"which surprise team can go the distance?"
01:04:06,760;01:04:09,880;"They list like seven or eight teams and the Patriots again,"
01:04:09,880;01:04:12,880;"even though they're covering the Patriots, not on the pole."
01:04:12,880;01:04:16,240;"I took a screenshot of this of the surprise teams this year,"
01:04:16,240;01:04:18,480;"which one has the best shot of going the distance?"
01:04:18,480;01:04:23,640;"Bears, bangles, Browns, Chargers, 49ers, Steelers."
01:04:23,640;01:04:25,920;"Wow. What a list."
01:04:25,920;01:04:28,240;"Big old fuck you. Yeah."
01:04:28,600;01:04:30,800;"So, um, did any of those go the distance?"
01:04:30,800;01:04:33,040;"Hmm."
01:04:33,040;01:04:34,360;"I guess we'll find out, won't we?"
01:04:34,360;01:04:34,960;"The U."
01:04:34,960;01:04:36,440;"ers want to close."
01:04:36,440;01:04:37,760;"I think steel's really close."
01:04:37,760;01:04:38,200;"This right."
01:04:38,200;01:04:42,240;"Who was who's in the NFC championship game that year?"
01:04:42,240;01:04:43,680;"Yeah, they hosted it."
01:04:43,680;01:04:44,800;"Who did?"
01:04:44,800;01:04:47,000;"No, the NFC NFC."
01:04:47,000;01:04:50,520;"Well, obviously the Rams, but who the Rams beat?"
01:04:50,520;01:04:55,760;"The Carolina, maybe that Steve Smith."
01:04:55,760;01:04:56,960;"Is that that year?"
01:04:57,560;01:04:59,240;"I mean, is that the U. Steve Smith be?"
01:04:59,240;01:05:03,920;"Well, just by me, by me some time."
01:05:03,920;01:05:04,360;"I will get that."
01:05:04,360;01:05:04,600;"Yeah."
01:05:04,600;01:05:04,840;"Yeah."
01:05:04,840;01:05:06,320;"I'm a shooter is the"
01:05:06,320;01:05:06,480;"Yeah."
01:05:06,480;01:05:06,880;"I'm doing it."
01:05:06,880;01:05:07,320;"Thanks."
01:05:07,320;01:05:11,080;"Oh, we could just follow the Eagles."
01:05:11,080;01:05:11,960;"The E."
01:05:11,960;01:05:12,880;"Ah, right."
01:05:12,880;01:05:15,380;"I said the"
01:05:15,380;01:05:16,040;"Yeah, right."
01:05:16,040;01:05:23,880;"Uh, I thought it was McNabb error because this was this is the first of the four NFC"
01:05:23,880;01:05:24,680;"championships I got to."
01:05:24,680;01:05:26,360;"And then they finally won it in a four and then."
01:05:26,360;01:05:26,840;"Yeah."
01:05:26,840;01:05:27,320;"Yeah."
01:05:27,320;01:05:29,320;"That's a good point."
01:05:29,320;01:05:30,160;"- Yeah."
01:05:30,160;01:05:37,840;"Our second half, I think we'll start with,"
01:05:37,840;01:05:40,200;"'cause I just wanna put this off as long as possible,"
01:05:40,200;01:05:42,600;"the defensive mistakes."
01:05:42,600;01:05:46,940;"There was a couple of unpatriot-like plays that happened."
01:05:46,940;01:05:49,800;"One was Matt Stevens."
01:05:49,800;01:05:52,320;"He actually started the second half off"
01:05:52,320;01:05:53,640;"with an interception, it was really nice,"
01:05:53,640;01:05:57,640;"But then there was a play where the wide receiver"
01:05:57,640;01:06:00,000;"was covering, caught the ball, fell down,"
01:06:00,000;01:06:01,800;"and he just kind of jumped over him."
01:06:01,800;01:06:03,120;"So the guy got-- - Yeah, which I don't know."
01:06:03,120;01:06:05,280;"I don't know what instinct that is."
01:06:05,280;01:06:07,960;"I mean, he didn't even try to lay a finger."
01:06:07,960;01:06:09,760;"He jumped over him while he was on the ground."
01:06:09,760;01:06:12,360;"Like as if he was like trying not to hurt him or something,"
01:06:12,360;01:06:14,680;"I don't know what the logic was there."
01:06:14,680;01:06:16,400;"- Yeah, it wasn't great."
01:06:16,400;01:06:20,360;"But that was the second touchdown"
01:06:20,360;01:06:22,280;"that the Bronx had of the third quarter."
01:06:22,280;01:06:27,360;"The first one was a first place 65-yard touchdown where the"
01:06:27,360;01:06:29,640;"pages basically just lost track of Rod Smith."
01:06:29,640;01:06:34,400;"And he just just did it quickly, you know, drag like shallow"
01:06:34,400;01:06:37,000;"across a sort of thing, caught the ball and just ran."
01:06:37,000;01:06:38,080;"They can pay."
01:06:38,080;01:06:40,040;"Yeah, there's, it was nobody within 20 yards of them."
01:06:40,040;01:06:41,240;"Easy touchdown."
01:06:41,240;01:06:45,080;"What?"
01:06:45,080;01:06:47,680;"He was pretty fast for how big of a guy he was."
01:06:47,680;01:06:48,720;"Yeah."
01:06:48,720;01:06:50,240;"He was surprised by that."
01:06:50,240;01:06:51,280;"He had some wheels."
01:06:51,280;01:06:51,480;"Yeah."
01:06:51,480;01:06:53,480;"I think it's physical too."
01:06:53,480;01:06:55,480;"Oh yeah."
01:06:55,480;01:06:56,480;"Yeah."
01:06:56,480;01:07:02,480;"Also this is the perfect time to bring up the, the punter, right?"
01:07:02,480;01:07:04,480;"Speaking of speaking of big bodies."
01:07:04,480;01:07:06,480;"I had that in down."
01:07:06,480;01:07:08,480;"I had the Broncos punter."
01:07:08,480;01:07:10,480;"It looks like he eats well."
01:07:10,480;01:07:11,480;"There you go."
01:07:11,480;01:07:14,480;"And what about the, so Lee Johnson is not part of the team anymore."
01:07:14,480;01:07:17,480;"Did we talk about that last week?"
01:07:17,480;01:07:18,480;"We did."
01:07:18,480;01:07:19,480;"Sorry."
01:07:19,480;01:07:20,480;"We had."
01:07:20,480;01:07:22,480;"See that's a very"
01:07:22,480;01:07:29,300;"I'm yeah, no, I meant to start the podcast with with that with condolences to you"
01:07:29,300;01:07:34,880;"Oh, yeah, big Lee Johnson guy"
01:07:34,880;01:07:42,600;"I mean look you had one bad game and Bella check dog house for good, but man Lee Johnson RIP, bro. I"
01:07:42,600;01:07:48,800;"Don't think he's dead. I ain't gonna. Well, I mean like playing I don't mean like"
01:07:49,560;01:07:51,560;"Let me check that"
01:07:51,560;01:07:54,620;"You know twist his ankle they take him out back"
01:07:54,620;01:08:01,340;"Yeah, no, I mean it was disgusting. I'm gonna say this right now. I was disgusted by Bella check and his behavior"
01:08:01,340;01:08:08,900;"Insible yeah, you should have been disgusting fine draft picks right where's punter gate when you need it?"
01:08:08,900;01:08:14,540;"Doesn't exist, but it's Ken Walter Ken Walter ladies and gentlemen if you didn't cover it"
01:08:14,540;01:08:19,360;"He's he's oh we did we talked about how big is your thoughts on him Mike what?"
01:08:19,360;01:08:23,260;"What were you thoughts on him on Ken Walter? Yeah. Yeah."
01:08:23,260;01:08:29,880;"Judas tell I got no one can ever replace. Yeah, I mean, he's serviceable, right?"
01:08:29,880;01:08:34,380;"He's no Lee Johnson Lee Johnson, most punting guards ever most whatever ever"
01:08:34,380;01:08:37,980;"Played for 72 years. He's really"
01:08:37,980;01:08:44,680;"Yeah, yeah lefty Lee. I will confirm though. He is in fact"
01:08:46,360;01:08:49,400;"a live. Oh good. Yeah, it's 58 years old."
01:08:49,400;01:08:53,400;"And glad we played that up. Yeah, like in Leadville."
01:08:53,400;01:08:57,000;"We should just replace Mike with like an Amazon Echo."
01:08:57,000;01:09:02,600;"Just be like Amazon. He's lead you on to the live."
01:09:02,600;01:09:05,000;"Yeah. There's all."
01:09:05,000;01:09:12,120;"Oh, she's. But yeah, Mike, to go back to your question, we did talk about"
01:09:14,840;01:09:22,200;"Ken Walter and I believe my notes on him from last week were that his nose is so big that I"
01:09:22,200;01:09:27,480;"introduced everybody to the concept of Ryan's story and he looks like he's a member of the"
01:09:27,480;01:09:34,520;"story family. Look, I'm not going to be calm too, Ken Sam. I know who who Ken Walter is but I will"
01:09:34,520;01:09:42,040;"say that it's a very mean story is a good friend of mine, a great heart and his family is lovely."
01:09:42,040;01:09:44,400;"So I take exception to what you're saying right now."
01:09:44,400;01:09:51,320;"OK, but answer me this then, honestly, on Ryan's story, which is bigger is heart or is nose."
01:09:51,320;01:09:53,840;"I believe it's his brain."
01:09:53,840;01:09:57,880;"OK."
01:09:57,880;01:10:00,440;"So"
01:10:00,440;01:10:02,640;"all right, moving on."
01:10:02,640;01:10:07,000;"So yeah, Tom ruin the Broncos, Hunter, 6 3 2 25."
01:10:07,200;01:10:12,800;"I don't look like he was wearing Pee Wee football pads as well, which made it look bigger."
01:10:12,800;01:10:20,960;"All right. All right. Yeah. So I think we've put it off enough. This game,"
01:10:20,960;01:10:28,960;"let's see the last three drives for the Patriots. Well, last three or four."
01:10:28,960;01:10:32,960;"Actually, no, let's just let's just do all the drives in the fourth quarter."
01:10:34,960;01:10:38,160;"So at the end of the third, the Broncos drove down, scored a touch down, take the lead."
01:10:38,160;01:10:45,600;"Brady drives past right back down the fields and then his first interception, he throws in the end zone,"
01:10:45,600;01:10:53,040;"aiming for David Patton in the back of the end zone at that like back of the end zone throw you"
01:10:53,040;01:10:59,040;"see him make all the time now to you know the Danny and Doles of the league. I don't even remember"
01:10:59,040;01:11:02,080;"who the guy was that intercepted him. I didn't even write it down because he has some no name."
01:11:04,720;01:11:05,220;"What?"
01:11:05,220;01:11:08,720;"I think we lost Greg."
01:11:08,720;01:11:10,120;"I think we did."
01:11:10,120;01:11:11,020;"Sorry."
01:11:11,020;01:11:11,720;"I stopped away."
01:11:11,720;01:11:12,920;"No kidding."
01:11:12,920;01:11:15,020;"You checked out once we started talking about the one"
01:11:15,020;01:11:15,520;"at this point."
01:11:15,520;01:11:20,420;"I like how you make my job easy in the editing department."
01:11:20,420;01:11:25,220;"We spent two hours on Thursday night."
01:11:25,220;01:11:29,320;"Guys got to stand up every now and then get the circulation going."
01:11:29,320;01:11:31,720;"I just ordered a standing desk."
01:11:31,720;01:11:34,320;"Fucking amateurs will give that a shot."
01:11:34,320;01:11:37,320;"I'm sitting pantsless in my bed."
01:11:37,320;01:11:40,320;"Dude, Matt, everybody has the luxury of having a bed."
01:11:40,320;01:11:42,320;"I guess not."
01:11:42,320;01:11:44,320;"So fucking homeless."
01:11:44,320;01:11:48,320;"Look, we all have our struggles."
01:11:48,320;01:11:55,820;"So yeah, Brady, there was this first ever interception in the end zone in the fourth"
01:11:55,820;01:11:58,320;"court, just some no name who."
01:11:58,320;01:12:03,320;"I mean, I mean, it was pretty epic though, because it was 163 passes."
01:12:03,320;01:12:09,080;"163 passes I was an NFL record for longest streak to start a career without an interception"
01:12:09,080;01:12:12,400;"Warren moon about like 30 passes almost"
01:12:12,400;01:12:15,400;"That has since been broken. I forget by who"
01:12:15,400;01:12:18,160;"I was in my homes"
01:12:18,160;01:12:20,680;"Right"
01:12:20,680;01:12:23,080;"Well, oh really"
01:12:23,080;01:12:26,120;"Like one pick"
01:12:26,120;01:12:30,760;"Right, it was like 20 touchdowns like one or two. Yeah, yeah two picks over on the year"
01:12:31,080;01:12:34,020;"Maybe what's him, but was that to start his career though?"
01:12:34,020;01:12:37,460;"I'm not sure one person beat"
01:12:37,460;01:12:40,180;"Brady, I don't know who"
01:12:40,180;01:12:43,300;"Started their career"
01:12:43,300;01:12:47,300;"Hold on Gregory"
01:12:47,300;01:12:56,780;"Alexa never tells me to hold on dude, I guess you're not asking her hard enough questions"
01:13:00,780;01:13:01,780;"Continue boys."
01:13:01,780;01:13:02,780;"All right."
01:13:02,780;01:13:03,780;"Moving on."
01:13:03,780;01:13:04,780;"Yeah."
01:13:04,780;01:13:06,860;"So Brady throws a pick in the end zone."
01:13:06,860;01:13:11,140;"First one of his entire career, some no name."
01:13:11,140;01:13:16,260;"Broncos don't do anything with the ball, but they run out a bunch of clock."
01:13:16,260;01:13:18,260;"So it's not a whole lot of time left."
01:13:18,260;01:13:19,700;"Pages use up all the time."
01:13:19,700;01:13:23,420;"I was trying to stop the clock."
01:13:23,420;01:13:28,380;"Brady immediately throws another interception."
01:13:28,380;01:13:32,500;"This one was actually to Adeltha O'Neill, and he made like a really athletic play on"
01:13:32,500;01:13:33,500;"the ball."
01:13:33,500;01:13:36,740;"So hard to be mad about that one."
01:13:36,740;01:13:37,740;"Brokers again."
01:13:37,740;01:13:39,740;"I got the answer boys."
01:13:39,740;01:13:40,740;"Oh, good."
01:13:40,740;01:13:41,740;"Thank God."
01:13:41,740;01:13:44,740;"What's the answer?"
01:13:44,740;01:13:48,180;"See it was tricky because I don't know how Alexa does it."
01:13:48,180;01:13:53,140;"But when I first looked for most attempts without an interception, it took me to the"
01:13:53,140;01:13:56,020;"longest streak, but I'm certainly to start the career."
01:13:56,020;01:14:00,260;"I went deep dive and eventually came across Dak Prescott."
01:14:00,260;01:14:02,260;"Really?"
01:14:02,260;01:14:03,060;"Yep."
01:14:03,060;01:14:06,100;"176 passes that started career without an interception."
01:14:06,100;01:14:06,860;"Wow."
01:14:06,860;01:14:08,380;"Oh, I saw it."
01:14:08,380;01:14:08,580;"Yeah."
01:14:08,580;01:14:10,580;"Cause this first year they didn't really throw the ball."
01:14:10,580;01:14:11,900;"I just ran it behind it."
01:14:11,900;01:14:13,900;"176 though."
01:14:13,900;01:14:14,660;"That's great."
01:14:14,660;01:14:15,700;"That's a lot."
01:14:15,700;01:14:17,380;"That's like the most."
01:14:17,380;01:14:18,660;"He's catching up quick now though."
01:14:18,660;01:14:20,300;"It's a good for him."
01:14:20,300;01:14:20,740;"All right."
01:14:20,740;01:14:25,700;"But anyways, I was a little late to the game on that one, but there it is."
01:14:25,700;01:14:28,420;"fellows continue in December. Number three, I think."
01:14:28,420;01:14:32,120;"Thanks Alexa. You're welcome Gregory."
01:14:32,120;01:14:36,560;"Shut up Alexa. Stop being a sassy bitch Gregory."
01:14:36,560;01:14:44,600;"Oh fuck. All right. Yeah. So yeah, so we're actually on his"
01:14:44,600;01:14:48,300;"only on the second interception of the game, the Delpho Neil diving"
01:14:48,300;01:14:54,040;"interception. So then the page get the ball back again. And"
01:14:54,040;01:14:57,040;"Brady throws a pick six into triple coverage."
01:14:57,040;01:15:00,160;"Basically ending in this game, it's now 31-20."
01:15:00,160;01:15:04,160;"And then they get the ball back and it's fourth and 24."
01:15:04,160;01:15:06,320;"And Brady doesn't really have much of a choice"
01:15:06,320;01:15:08,760;"and just throws a desperation interception"
01:15:08,760;01:15:10,520;"for his fourth pick of the day,"
01:15:10,520;01:15:15,960;"which is proving Parcel's clairvoyance,"
01:15:15,960;01:15:19,200;"talking about taking a beating like 31-10"
01:15:19,200;01:15:21,720;"or something and throwing four interceptions."
01:15:21,720;01:15:23,440;"He was off by 10 points."
01:15:23,440;01:15:24,600;"It was actually 31 20."
01:15:24,600;01:15:27,960;"And of course the whole JFK thing as well."
01:15:27,960;01:15:28,520;"Yep."
01:15:28,520;01:15:29,280;"And the JFK."
01:15:29,280;01:15:29,640;"Yeah."
01:15:29,640;01:15:34,200;"Um, but after Brady's pick six, uh, one of the awesome"
01:15:34,200;01:15:36,520;"fantastic commentators that we love so much."
01:15:36,520;01:15:37,480;"Oh God."
01:15:37,480;01:15:40,400;"Um, what do they say this time, Andy?"
01:15:40,400;01:15:44,040;"I'll fucking get to it if you stop interrupting me."
01:15:44,040;01:15:48,280;"After the Brady pick six, uh, they're showing him what"
01:15:48,280;01:15:49,280;"what did I say, Andy?"
01:15:51,040;01:15:53,040;"as he walks off the field"
01:15:53,040;01:15:54,840;"there's a guy who's been through it too"
01:15:54,840;01:15:58,620;"drew blood so he knows what it's like to throw a pic"
01:15:58,620;01:16:00,120;"eating like that"
01:16:00,120;01:16:01,520;"i thought that's pretty accurate"
01:16:01,520;01:16:03,440;"that's throwing some fucking shade i think"
01:16:03,440;01:16:07,080;"true blood so the man's just had some serious surgery recovery serious injury"
01:16:07,080;01:16:08,640;"a throwman on the bus like that"
01:16:08,640;01:16:09,960;"but i can't take that"
01:16:09,960;01:16:14,160;"well he called him a great guy or something to me"
01:16:14,160;01:16:16,480;"did you say something like wow he's a great guy but he really knows how to"
01:16:16,480;01:16:17,520;"throw an interception"
01:16:17,520;01:16:19,320;"i that's how i heard it i don't know"
01:16:19,320;01:16:20,640;"regardless"
01:16:20,640;01:16:21,680;"They went to the best friends."
01:16:21,680;01:16:23,680;"They're what?"
01:16:23,680;01:16:24,880;"Did you hear that one?"
01:16:24,880;01:16:25,560;"No."
01:16:25,560;01:16:27,080;"When they were talking about how"
01:16:27,080;01:16:30,800;"Brady and bloods are good buddies."
01:16:30,800;01:16:31,840;"Oh, yeah."
01:16:31,840;01:16:34,560;"The practice they drove down and went to a Yankees game."
01:16:34,560;01:16:36,480;"Oh, that's right. Yeah."
01:16:36,480;01:16:38,320;"Oh, I missed that one. That's cute."
01:16:38,320;01:16:40,200;"Kind of problematic for Brady."
01:16:40,200;01:16:41,000;"Yeah."
01:16:41,000;01:16:42,280;"Yeah, a little bit."
01:16:42,280;01:16:43,760;"You want to get a jank jock?"
01:16:43,760;01:16:46,160;"I think I was."
01:16:46,160;01:16:49,360;"I was under the assumption there was a Red Sox Yankees game, but maybe not."
01:16:49,360;01:16:51,360;"I"
01:16:51,360;01:16:55,360;"Already were that Yankees. He's a Yankees fan. He is it where you"
01:16:55,360;01:17:00,720;"Yeah, we don't talk about that here. Yeah clearly he's never been to family pack. Yeah clearly"
01:17:00,720;01:17:04,000;"Yeah, I'm fucking a yawkey"
01:17:04,000;01:17:08,340;"Watch dogs far right bra couple Sam Adams"
01:17:08,340;01:17:13,680;"You have a Sam Sauer though"
01:17:13,680;01:17:18,480;"Sam Sauer no no Sam Sauer. Yeah, that's"
01:17:18,480;01:17:23,480;"- What? You're insane. It's an acquired taste, but it's something you sip on."
01:17:23,480;01:17:27,480;"- Greg, do you like drinking seawater?"
01:17:27,480;01:17:34,480;"- If you do, that's right up your alley. Andy, it sounds like you don't have a sophisticated"
01:17:34,480;01:17:35,480;"palate."
01:17:35,480;01:17:40,480;"- Thank you. Ding, ding, ding, ding. Man, I'm on board with Greg on this episode. 100%."
01:17:40,480;01:17:42,480;"- I'm just jumping on board on hating on Andy."
01:17:42,480;01:17:44,480;"- Yeah, no shit."
01:17:44,480;01:17:48,480;"- See, if you get invited back, you prick."
01:17:48,480;01:17:51,480;"- Wow."
01:17:51,480;01:17:54,480;"- I mean, at least you watch the right game this week, so..."
01:17:54,480;01:17:57,480;"- It's true. Did you hear that, Mike, or I watched the wrong game last week?"
01:17:57,480;01:18:00,480;"- Yeah. He told me that. I thought that was classic."
01:18:00,480;01:18:04,480;"I have to tune in and listen to that one, see how it turns out?"
01:18:04,480;01:18:10,480;"- That's not what you were saying. - I watched like, three weeks prior to the Dolphins game."
01:18:10,480;01:18:12,480;"- Yeah. It wasn't even close."
01:18:12,480;01:18:14,480;"all these great J feed their notes."
01:18:14,480;01:18:19,920;"I mean, all I know is I missed one episode. You watch the wrong thing. I heard,"
01:18:19,920;01:18:25,400;"I heard a ground swell of, of folks kind of just saying that they,"
01:18:25,400;01:18:31,080;"they, they like this familiar voice back. And so I decided to come back to really,"
01:18:31,080;01:18:34,160;"uh, get things back on track. So I'm glad to be here."
01:18:34,160;01:18:35,000;"Man of the people."
01:18:35,000;01:18:36,560;"Hey, you're talking to mama Brown."
01:18:36,560;01:18:39,400;"I have not talked to her in a long time."
01:18:39,920;01:18:42,440;"And what's this ground soul of people because she's going to listen to this."
01:18:42,440;01:18:42,920;"Don't worry."
01:18:42,920;01:18:44,720;"Yeah."
01:18:44,720;01:18:47,960;"Just don't worry about it."
01:18:47,960;01:18:51,640;"Look, just relax, man."
01:18:51,640;01:18:55,120;"You guys know Brady and Brian Greasey went to the same college."
01:18:55,120;01:18:59,080;"Their careers were in lock steps since Michigan."
01:18:59,080;01:19:03,760;"No, I didn't know that."
01:19:03,760;01:19:06,240;"It's like they compete against each other there."
01:19:06,240;01:19:08,640;"And then now, but they're on my ground."
01:19:09,480;01:19:11,040;"Oh, it's so weird."
01:19:11,040;01:19:18,140;"So to close this out, one last quote from Steve Tasker and Don"
01:19:18,140;01:19:24,280;"Kricky. This exchange for Tasker starts off saying, I think some"
01:19:24,280;01:19:26,460;"organization is going to make the Patriots an offer they can't"
01:19:26,460;01:19:30,240;"refuse for Tom Brady. To which Don Kricky replies, I don't think"
01:19:30,240;01:19:35,040;"they're going to trade him under any circumstances. So these boys"
01:19:35,040;01:19:37,800;"were ahead of their time. I think we should put them in the"
01:19:37,800;01:19:39,080;"Commutation Hall of Fame."
01:19:39,080;01:19:42,080;"I mean, they were pretty good."
01:19:42,080;01:19:43,800;"Commutationists for sure."
01:19:43,800;01:19:44,840;"I didn't have any agree."
01:19:44,840;01:19:50,760;"Um, I, you know, I like to bring up these segment, uh, football or not football,"
01:19:50,760;01:19:54,600;"but they pretty much spoken away that I understood all the terms."
01:19:54,600;01:19:58,360;"So all of them, all of them, I mean, they did a hell of a job and I don't know"
01:19:58,360;01:20:00,400;"a lot of things, but they helped me a long way."
01:20:00,400;01:20:00,840;"So."
01:20:00,840;01:20:03,000;"All right."
01:20:03,000;01:20:05,000;"I think we're, we're unraveling quickly here."
01:20:05,000;01:20:06,680;"So how do we do?"
01:20:06,960;01:20:15,060;"Wait, wait a minute. I just want to say I want to put it out there as much as the referees were trying to hurt the Broncos and all this other stuff and whatever."
01:20:15,060;01:20:23,640;"I will say that given the four interception performance by Brady, they actually there was five picks in the game total."
01:20:23,640;01:20:32,840;"Like we talked about they were only down by 11. So that is pretty impressive considering that was a garbage second half."
01:20:32,840;01:20:34,360;"It really was."
01:20:35,240;01:20:36,680;"So good job, Patriots."
01:20:36,680;01:20:40,400;"That'll serve them well in the 2001 season."
01:20:40,400;01:20:42,280;"All right."
01:20:42,280;01:20:43,840;"Yeah, we're definitely traveling here."
01:20:43,840;01:20:49,040;"All right, let's let's get some best and worse out the way so we can we can end"
01:20:49,040;01:20:52,360;"this and Mike can probably continue drinking from the sounds of it."
01:20:52,360;01:20:54,360;"Yeah, I've got my coffee, baby."
01:20:54,360;01:20:57,000;"Yeah, that's what I was talking about."
01:20:57,000;01:21:01,840;"All right, Mike, since you're all round up, you want to go first with your best"
01:21:01,840;01:21:02,840;"of worst?"
01:21:02,920;01:21:06,520;"Man, I would say my best and worst came on the same plan."
01:21:06,520;01:21:11,160;"It was that one that you alluded to where, you know,"
01:21:11,160;01:21:13,640;"greasy throws a pass."
01:21:13,640;01:21:17,920;"It's deflected twice on the same plan caught by Teddy"
01:21:17,920;01:21:18,920;"Bruski."
01:21:18,920;01:21:19,920;"He's running with it."
01:21:19,920;01:21:21,920;"Pulls like a couple of juke moves."
01:21:21,920;01:21:28,000;"Kind of breaks away his daylight and then I don't know if you"
01:21:28,000;01:21:31,880;"just try to like change hands or whatever, but he fumbles the ball."
01:21:31,960;01:21:33,400;"Nobody touches him."
01:21:33,400;01:21:34,500;"He's chasing after it."
01:21:34,500;01:21:36,600;"Greasy jumps on top of it."
01:21:36,600;01:21:40,640;"So that's the worst part, I should say,"
01:21:40,640;01:21:42,360;"by Bruceky dropping the ball."
01:21:42,360;01:21:44,560;"But then Greasy comes in."
01:21:44,560;01:21:45,600;"He gets the ball."
01:21:45,600;01:21:47,280;"There's a dog pile."
01:21:47,280;01:21:48,240;"All this stuff is happening."
01:21:48,240;01:21:51,600;"At the end of the play, somehow, the Patriots"
01:21:51,600;01:21:52,520;"ended up with the ball."
01:21:52,520;01:21:56,560;"And Greasy gets flagged for a 15 yard for kicking a rep"
01:21:56,560;01:21:57,160;"somehow."
01:21:57,160;01:21:58,640;"I don't know."
01:21:58,640;01:22:00,040;"I didn't see it."
01:22:00,040;01:22:02,440;"But that was a pretty amazing turn of events."
01:22:02,440;01:22:08,980;"The fact that Brian Greasy got flagged for a personal foul for kicking an"
01:22:08,980;01:22:12,000;"official is my favorite part of this entire game."
01:22:12,000;01:22:12,520;"I agree."
01:22:12,520;01:22:13,680;"That was going to be my best."
01:22:13,680;01:22:15,940;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:15,940;01:22:20,320;"Well, it took them like halfway through the ensuing drive to actually figure"
01:22:20,320;01:22:22,180;"out like, oh, we're being told."
01:22:22,180;01:22:22,840;"Yes."
01:22:22,840;01:22:23,840;"Brian Greasy."
01:22:23,840;01:22:24,560;"Right."
01:22:24,560;01:22:25,200;"That was weird."
01:22:25,200;01:22:29,560;"Well, that whole entire dog pile took like eight minutes."
01:22:29,560;01:22:31,560;"I started doing something else."
01:22:31,560;01:22:36,560;"So that was both your best and worst, was it?"
01:22:36,560;01:22:38,560;"Yeah, I mean that covered everything."
01:22:38,560;01:22:41,560;"Yeah, I can see how that would."
01:22:41,560;01:22:43,560;"All right Greg, what about you?"
01:22:43,560;01:22:46,560;"Well, my worst was going to be the same play."
01:22:46,560;01:22:51,560;"Just because of how unathletic Bruceky looked too."
01:22:51,560;01:22:54,560;"Like he picked it and then he started like,"
01:22:54,560;01:22:56,560;"I don't like waddling almost."
01:22:56,560;01:23:00,160;"It's just a bad look for white people everywhere."
01:23:00,160;01:23:02,080;"It's a linebacker run is what that is."
01:23:02,080;01:23:03,080;"That's gamut."
01:23:03,080;01:23:05,320;"Where's Christian McCaffrey when you need him?"
01:23:05,320;01:23:14,080;"Um, my best was when they came back from a commercial and they had an advertisement for"
01:23:14,080;01:23:15,760;"Swordfish, the movie."
01:23:15,760;01:23:20,560;"Oh, I think it up now on video cassette or DVD."
01:23:20,560;01:23:21,560;"That was great."
01:23:21,560;01:23:23,800;"And Swordfish no less."
01:23:23,800;01:23:26,260;"Uh, oh, well, speaking of"
01:23:26,260;01:23:28,000;"Hey, uh, Ellie Berry."
01:23:28,000;01:23:29,080;"Oh hell yeah."
01:23:29,080;01:23:30,760;"I'm John Travolta, right?"
01:23:30,760;01:23:31,360;"Yep."
01:23:31,360;01:23:33,200;"And it was terrible and it bombed."
01:23:33,200;01:23:35,800;"I would say it, but I will check it out."
01:23:35,800;01:23:37,880;"A bunch of hacking going on in that movie."
01:23:37,880;01:23:43,040;"Um, since we're talking about commercial breaks, I will also say I was not very"
01:23:43,040;01:23:46,360;"pleased with the, uh, the commentators, the only time I wasn't."
01:23:46,360;01:23:53,380;"Um, but, uh, they showed these girls and what looked like Halloween costumes"
01:23:53,380;01:23:56,300;"or something, they were cow costumes."
01:23:56,300;01:24:00,100;"And then one of the commentators says,"
01:24:00,100;01:24:01,700;"look at that, I heard of cows."
01:24:01,700;01:24:04,140;"And then laughs maniacally for like an hour."
01:24:04,140;01:24:04,900;"I just thought--"
01:24:04,900;01:24:06,060;"- Palomatic."
01:24:06,060;01:24:08,220;"- Yeah, I thought that was in poor taste."
01:24:08,220;01:24:11,340;"And I didn't expect it from Don Creaky"
01:24:11,340;01:24:12,580;"and Steve Tasker, to be honest,"
01:24:12,580;01:24:15,660;"because that's more of a Brent Jones type of joke."
01:24:15,660;01:24:19,100;"But I was just, I was disappointed."
01:24:21,300;01:24:27,060;"I'm gonna I'm gonna segue off of that for my worst. We'll start my worst first. Let me guess the announcers. No. Oh"
01:24:27,060;01:24:30,700;"It's animal related actually"
01:24:30,700;01:24:36,120;"Every time Denver scored a touchdown. They trotted out thunder the touchdown horse"
01:24:36,120;01:24:39,860;"Get fucked down, but get fucked"
01:24:39,860;01:24:44,020;"Thunder the touchdown horse. That's your best moment. No, it's my worst"
01:24:44,020;01:24:48,180;"Fucking poor ass horse"
01:24:48,780;01:24:54,580;"I'm on board with that one Andy. I've been getting a hard time, but that is fucking stupid. All right"
01:24:54,580;01:25:02,260;"Yes, exactly. Just get a mascot like everybody else. Just a second human up in a costume and let me"
01:25:02,260;01:25:06,420;"Say that poor horse"
01:25:06,420;01:25:07,420;"so"
01:25:07,420;01:25:14,220;"My best I think you'll probably both agree with this was the story that they told about David Patton and what he was doing before"
01:25:15,100;01:25:21,980;"Before getting into football. That's right. He was loading sacks of coffee into trucks four years ago down in North Carolina"
01:25:21,980;01:25:28,220;"And he was loading him and his partner were loading up to 600 sacks a day"
01:25:28,220;01:25:31,420;"of coffee"
01:25:31,420;01:25:38,220;"It's a lot of ground. Yeah, it's a lot of coffee and as a coffee snob myself. I can I can get behind that. So me and David Patton where"
01:25:38,220;01:25:41,740;"Where it was in tautico. Yeah, absolutely"
01:25:43,020;01:25:44,020;"We're brethren."
01:25:44,020;01:25:48,940;"I mean, what a job though to keep fit while you're waiting for the next opportunity."
01:25:48,940;01:25:50,940;"That's what I'm saying."
01:25:50,940;01:25:52,500;"I like it."
01:25:52,500;01:25:53,500;"All right."
01:25:53,500;01:25:56,300;"Did you guys have any other anything else you want to bring up?"
01:25:56,300;01:25:59,620;"Well, I just want to apologize for giving you a hard time, Andy."
01:25:59,620;01:26:00,820;"Yeah, I mean, it wasn't."
01:26:00,820;01:26:01,820;"I still love you."
01:26:01,820;01:26:03,780;"Yeah, it wasn't meant to go that way."
01:26:03,780;01:26:04,780;"Yeah."
01:26:04,780;01:26:06,700;"And I don't necessarily feel like we did give you a hard time."
01:26:06,700;01:26:12,860;"It's just that we were saying better things than you."
01:26:12,860;01:26:17,160;"It's one of those snowball effect, you know, we start with Penn State."
01:26:17,160;01:26:21,020;"And I was like, all right, it's, I think that a, we're just going to rip Andy at everything."
01:26:21,020;01:26:22,020;"He's that."
01:26:22,020;01:26:24,280;"So I don't want us to come out wrong."
01:26:24,280;01:26:27,100;"I suck at apologies."
01:26:27,100;01:26:29,540;"You know what?"
01:26:29,540;01:26:33,440;"We should actually have like this generic one that we all signed or put our name on or"
01:26:33,440;01:26:34,940;"just played before every episode."
01:26:34,940;01:26:39,100;"So that like whatever, like, I apologize for the thing that we said that one time that"
01:26:39,100;01:26:43,580;"potentially offended somebody, you know, give us another chance to continue listening."
01:26:43,580;01:26:44,820;"We should just play that every time."
01:26:44,820;01:26:46,660;"Just at the end of every episode."
01:26:46,660;01:26:49,940;"I'll see if I can get one up and put it on the end of every episode."
01:26:49,940;01:26:51,820;"Just a general blanket apology."
01:26:51,820;01:26:52,580;"Yeah."
01:26:52,580;01:26:53,620;"But I stand by."
01:26:53,620;01:27:00,740;"All right."
01:27:00,740;01:27:01,100;"Yeah."
01:27:01,100;01:27:04,180;"Uh, I wrote this stuff, but none of it's interesting."
01:27:04,180;01:27:05,820;"Yeah."
01:27:05,940;01:27:10,140;"All I have is that Brady got sacked by four guys on one play and I've never seen that before."
01:27:10,140;01:27:11,380;"That's dirty."
01:27:11,380;01:27:12,040;"Yeah."
01:27:12,040;01:27:15,340;"I had, do we think Mike Shanahan is able to blink?"
01:27:15,340;01:27:24,660;"Oh, man, I actually paused that a couple of times, like on his reactions and had my girlfriend just like, tell me if this guy looked insane or not, like out of context."
01:27:24,660;01:27:26,220;"And it was a hard yes."
01:27:26,220;01:27:31,740;"So I don't know if I feel like great, that guy running an organization by any means."
01:27:31,740;01:27:32,020;"Yeah."
01:27:32,180;01:27:34,920;"My other mike Shanahan comment was I can't tell he's excited or"
01:27:34,920;01:27:37,760;"constipated and the shots of him on the sideline after they score touch"
01:27:37,760;01:27:38,040;"chance."
01:27:38,040;01:27:40,480;"They were always like kind of angry though."
01:27:40,480;01:27:41,640;"It was very scary."
01:27:41,640;01:27:42,860;"Yeah, it couldn't quite tell."
01:27:42,860;01:27:43,240;"Could you?"
01:27:43,240;01:27:44,660;"I don't know."
01:27:44,660;01:27:49,420;"He is a good coach, but I bet our three sees that face in his nightmare"
01:27:49,420;01:27:50,120;"as every now."
01:27:50,120;01:27:53,040;"Yeah, I think you're right."
01:27:53,040;01:27:55,520;"That's why no Sean Moreno had that tier."
01:27:55,520;01:27:58,920;"Oh, you know, that's right."
01:27:58,920;01:27:59,560;"I think."
01:27:59,560;01:28:00,380;"Yeah."
01:28:00,600;01:28:02,040;"That was a lot of the river."
01:28:02,040;01:28:04,160;"I was looking at someone's face."
01:28:04,160;01:28:05,640;"I just had a shot at that."
01:28:05,640;01:28:07,000;"Single tear."
01:28:07,000;01:28:08,000;"You know?"
01:28:08,000;01:28:10,000;"Was it like a river of tears?"
01:28:10,000;01:28:11,840;"It was just like a constant flow."
01:28:11,840;01:28:13,120;"Mass."
01:28:13,120;01:28:14,480;"Yeah, I don't know how that works."
01:28:14,480;01:28:15,560;"It's the fear of ever seeing."
01:28:15,560;01:28:17,120;"Yeah, that was insane."
01:28:17,120;01:28:18,400;"I have to look this up."
01:28:18,400;01:28:19,680;"Hold on, guys."
01:28:19,680;01:28:21,120;"Have you seen it, Mike?"
01:28:21,120;01:28:22,760;"No, I don't think I have."
01:28:22,760;01:28:24,520;"Oh, you're ever a treat."
01:28:24,520;01:28:26,760;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:26,760;01:28:28,520;"The other-- I don't know if you guys caught this,"
01:28:28,520;01:28:30,440;"But did you know Mike Anderson was an ex-marine?"
01:28:30,440;01:28:33,160;"I think I remember that."
01:28:33,160;01:28:33,680;"Yeah."
01:28:33,680;01:28:35,520;"Yeah, they mentioned it four times."
01:28:35,520;01:28:37,120;"I was keeping track."
01:28:37,120;01:28:37,320;"Yeah."
01:28:37,320;01:28:40,920;"Oh, you will the commentary is saying stop over and over again."
01:28:40,920;01:28:41,880;"Oh, damn."
01:28:41,880;01:28:42,840;"That thing is crazy."
01:28:42,840;01:28:46,920;"Is that like, what is that?"
01:28:46,920;01:28:47,920;"Oh, both eyes."
01:28:47,920;01:28:50,480;"And it's only one eye."
01:28:50,480;01:28:52,520;"No, it's both eyes."
01:28:52,520;01:28:54,320;"Second one comes hard to fast."
01:28:54,320;01:28:57,800;"Watch it with slow motion of this."
01:28:57,800;01:29:03,400;"It is insane man. It's intense. I was that's like at least a decade of pain that you're storing"
01:29:03,400;01:29:18,280;"Thank you for that guys dead. Hey welcome. Wow. Oh, I found I remembered that Seahawks cornerback Sean Springs. Oh"
01:29:18,280;01:29:22,040;"He was good. He was good"
01:29:22,040;01:29:25,480;"All right, well go to me"
01:29:25,480;01:29:28,600;"There's no Redskins 24 as well champ Bailey"
01:29:28,600;01:29:39,000;"It up on the Redskins. Yeah, I don't know if he's 24 though. Yeah, it was was a I only got 24"
01:29:39,000;01:29:45,520;"The numbers Josh Norman Josh Norman 24"
01:29:45,520;01:29:48,360;"Let's say this is what I'm saying"
01:29:52,440;01:29:56,840;"Not bad. It's hard to find a quality cornerback who's not number 24"
01:29:56,840;01:30:03,240;"Let's you go old school like night train lane and all that sort of shit, but then I don't even think they had numbers back then so it's fine"
01:30:03,240;01:30:06,320;"Doesn't count"
01:30:06,320;01:30:13,320;"They did wear symbols if I remember correctly. Did they you see those braille jerseys at the Orioles war?"
01:30:13,320;01:30:19,960;"The kids see it you fucking idiot and I'm learning so much today"
01:30:19,960;01:30:27,960;"Oh, you're not kidding."
01:30:27,960;01:30:28,960;"Please."
01:30:28,960;01:30:30,960;"That is terrible."
01:30:30,960;01:30:31,960;"All right."
01:30:31,960;01:30:34,960;"You're using Mike's all sorts of stuff tonight."
01:30:34,960;01:30:35,960;"Yeah."
01:30:35,960;01:30:36,960;"No, that's insane."
01:30:36,960;01:30:41,960;"We do a half hour on that."
01:30:41,960;01:30:43,960;"All right."
01:30:43,960;01:30:48,960;"I think that about exhausts all the topics for this game."
01:30:48,960;01:30:54,880;"for this game. I'm surprised we actually got this much out of it because I thought the same thing."
01:30:54,880;01:31:02,560;"And it's, you know, it's up for debate if we did get that much out of it. But I only have page and"
01:31:02,560;01:31:07,760;"a half notes here. So, well, all right. Well, we made a bullshred away through that one, didn't we?"
01:31:07,760;01:31:15,040;"Well, good job. High school. I feel good about this one. It felt genuine. I felt informative. And,"
01:31:16,240;01:31:22,920;"You know whoever's listening out there captivated fact checked all of it. Yes. I was captivated through this entire thing"
01:31:22,920;01:31:25,520;"You didn't fall asleep. We're a lot of good stats"
01:31:25,520;01:31:31,000;"Yeah, it is a stepping we gotta get like Steve to do this or something remote later or whatever"
01:31:31,000;01:31:34,280;"Just like hit him up and have him do the research"
01:31:34,280;01:31:42,880;"I don't know if we want that, but all right dude. I'm bringing an Amazon Alexa next game. I miss okay next to me"
01:31:42,880;01:31:45,320;"All right. Yeah, let's do it"
01:31:45,320;01:31:47,720;"I'm going to be great."
01:31:47,720;01:31:50,520;"All right, gentlemen, until next week."
01:31:50,520;01:31:52,620;"What is next week?"
01:31:52,620;01:31:54,620;"You tell me."
01:31:54,620;01:31:57,420;"Don't tell me the score though, please."
01:31:57,420;01:31:58,720;"I'm asking the game question."
01:31:58,720;01:31:59,720;"Okay."
01:31:59,720;01:32:00,720;"Is it the Mike Vick game?"
01:32:00,720;01:32:03,520;"I don't believe so."
01:32:03,520;01:32:05,020;"This is pre Mike Vick."
01:32:05,020;01:32:07,520;"No, Chris Chandler game."
01:32:07,520;01:32:09,920;"Yeah, but Mike Vick came on halfway through."
01:32:09,920;01:32:12,620;"Oh, he does come in."
01:32:12,620;01:32:13,620;"Yeah."
01:32:13,620;01:32:15,620;"then he's lit up."
01:32:15,620;01:32:18,260;"- Ooh, somebody knows something."
01:32:18,260;01:32:20,500;"- I remember lawyer Maloy."
01:32:20,500;01:32:22,400;"Is he even on?"
01:32:22,400;01:32:24,180;"He's not on his team."
01:32:24,180;01:32:25,180;"- Oh yes he is."
01:32:25,180;01:32:27,820;"- Yeah, he is."
01:32:27,820;01:32:29,180;"- Oh yes he is."
01:32:29,180;01:32:30,020;"- All right."
01:32:30,020;01:32:30,860;"- Yeah."
01:32:30,860;01:32:31,900;"- I think-- - Strong safety."
01:32:31,900;01:32:33,420;"- Yeah, he definitely is."
01:32:33,420;01:32:35,380;"- Yeah, he's already made a bunch of plays."
01:32:35,380;01:32:36,220;"- Yeah."
01:32:36,220;01:32:38,140;"- I haven't watched any of these."
01:32:38,140;01:32:39,820;"- They've been like letting people up on"
01:32:39,820;01:32:41,220;"like Kick or Tertz and stuff."
01:32:43,340;01:32:45,940;"But yes, yeah, I have a couple of images from this game too."
01:32:45,940;01:32:48,260;"There's a Troy Brown play that I remember specifically."
01:32:48,260;01:32:50,660;"So we've got to have that to look forward to."
01:32:50,660;01:32:52,300;"That's next week, though."
01:32:52,300;01:32:53,340;"And that is next week."
01:32:53,340;01:32:56,780;"Yes, Atlanta in Atlanta in the Georgia Dome."
01:32:56,780;01:33:03,180;"And I can't wait for that one because I think that's going to be a good game to talk about."
01:33:03,180;01:33:05,340;"Do they really kick into high gear?"
01:33:05,340;01:33:09,780;"Yeah, because right now they're they're kind of hanging in there."
01:33:10,220;01:33:12,260;"They're three and four."
01:33:12,260;01:33:16,140;"Things aren't looking particularly great, but I think"
01:33:16,140;01:33:19,300;"the season is about to turn around for the better."
01:33:19,300;01:33:22,020;"I sure hope so."
01:33:22,020;01:33:24,100;"I hope the podcast turns around for the better."
01:33:24,100;01:33:25,580;"Me too, man."
01:33:25,580;01:33:28,700;"What's a what's a hope on three?"

01:33:39,700;01:33:46,420;"It's been fun. Love you boys. Love you too. I'm glad I was included in that one this time."
01:33:46,420;01:33:50,580;"Were you? Yeah, last time you said I love you, but it was like to your brother or whatever."
01:33:50,580;01:33:56,340;"It's not a thing. Were you? I'm not going to make it this time. Oh, I thought it was plural."
01:33:56,340;01:34:02,580;"I don't know. Maybe I heard it with hope. Hope on three guys. One, two, three. Hope. Hope."

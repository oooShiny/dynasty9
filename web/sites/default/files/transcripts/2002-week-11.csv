00:06,840;00:08,280;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,280;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:14,320;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,320;00:15,560;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,560;00:16,560;"Go right ahead."
00:16,560;00:18,400;"I am not your mother."
00:18,400;00:27,200;"Welcome back to the Page of Stiancy podcast."
00:27,200;00:30,280;"This is 2002 week 10."
00:30,280;00:31,880;"I may have just picked that up."
00:31,880;00:32,880;"It's 11."
00:32,880;00:35,560;"I don't know why I have week 10."
00:35,560;00:38,720;"Oh, I know why because the YouTube video had week 10."
00:38,720;00:41,280;"So I've been running week 10 everywhere."
00:41,280;00:42,280;"Good job."
00:42,280;00:43,280;"We have you here, Steve, to stand tight."
00:43,280;00:45,280;"Greg has not shown up yet."
00:45,280;00:50,000;"But this week we have a special guest with us today is our new best friend, Tanya Ray"
00:50,000;00:54,160;"Fox, all the way out from Los Angeles, California."
00:54,160;00:55,160;"Yes."
00:55,160;00:56,440;"Thank you guys for having me on."
00:56,440;00:59,520;"This is my, I haven't done a Zoom podcast,"
00:59,520;01:01,060;"which is like kind of crazy."
01:01,060;01:02,980;"Like, well, we've recorded over Zoom,"
01:02,980;01:05,300;"but I haven't like been looking at people."
01:05,300;01:09,400;"And it's nice, especially because I don't see anyone anymore."
01:09,400;01:12,060;"- Yeah, I mean, it's nice cause Greg's not on."
01:12,060;01:13,100;"He don't wanna see that."
01:13,100;01:15,100;"- Yeah, well, I heard."
01:15,100;01:18,180;"- Yeah, he did finally have to shave his face."
01:18,180;01:19,020;"So that's good."
01:19,020;01:21,380;"Well, the half of it that was growing out."
01:21,380;01:24,260;"So that was horrendous."
01:24,260;01:27,380;"We actually stopped doing video because of that for a while because it was so bad."
01:27,380;01:28,900;"He had a beard."
01:28,900;01:31,060;"Only on half of his face."
01:31,060;01:33,140;"And that was for what reason?"
01:33,140;01:36,580;"We'll let him explain."
01:36,580;01:38,660;"It's a different reason every time."
01:38,660;01:42,180;"The gestator is the duality of man."
01:42,180;01:43,540;"Yeah, it's an art."
01:43,540;01:44,580;"You know what?"
01:44,580;01:47,620;"Now's the time to experiment with facial hair."
01:47,620;01:48,900;"There was one."
01:48,900;01:52,100;"That's true, except he keeps having zoom calls for work."
01:52,580;01:59,060;"Yeah. And doing presentations with that. And he's God with it anyway. As you do. But enough about"
01:59,060;02:06,340;"Greg, let's usually this is where we we shit on our guests because they're one of our friends and"
02:06,340;02:12,180;"they haven't accomplished anything. But I think we actually have a real person on. So how about you"
02:12,180;02:18,500;"actually tell us a bit about like what you do these days? Yeah, so these days as in like immediately"
02:18,500;02:25,780;"Currently I work at Fox Sports 1. I'm a news editor there so it's like behind the scenes in production."
02:25,780;02:34,180;"Essentially I work on all the talk shows so like first things first and undisputed and speak for"
02:34,180;02:39,220;"yourself in the herd. Those are really the four and then the three that are in studio and LA are"
02:39,220;02:45,380;"kind of our focus so the herd and undisputed and speak for yourself and really my job is just to"
02:45,380;02:48,440;"to like go over the topics of the day,"
02:48,440;02:51,560;"make sure that the talent and producers kind of"
02:51,560;02:54,280;"stay on track with more sticky topics."
02:54,280;02:56,800;"And when there's things that are maybe outside the bounds"
02:56,800;03:00,520;"of like the white male perspective"
03:00,520;03:03,160;"or the male perspective in general,"
03:03,160;03:05,720;"or we're trying to broaden the conversation,"
03:05,720;03:08,760;"helping kind of guide the way we go with those stories."
03:08,760;03:12,540;"And then like, I spent a lot of my day curating stuff"
03:12,540;03:14,080;"that I send out to everybody."
03:14,080;03:18,480;"that's like here's some stuff we need to be keeping an eye on topic wise and things like that."
03:18,480;03:24,440;"So right now, because I'm working from home, I don't see anyone and it's a much less interesting job."
03:24,440;03:28,540;"But when I'm in studio, it's great because I'm talking to people all day and like,"
03:28,540;03:31,840;"dealing with the guests and popping in on meetings and stuff."
03:31,840;03:36,120;"To be honest, I have no idea what my job is going to look like going forward,"
03:36,120;03:38,480;"like even when we are back in studio."
03:38,480;03:40,280;"So it's really interesting."
03:40,280;03:42,080;"But that is what I do."
03:42,080;03:44,440;"And then on the side, I podcast sometimes."
03:44,440;03:47,040;"I'm getting back into writing"
03:47,040;03:48,400;"'cause I was a writer for years."
03:48,400;03:49,840;"I wrote for USA Today."
03:49,840;03:53,400;"And I'm sorry, I'm gonna start doing that."
03:53,400;03:55,200;"I think I'm just gonna self-publish on Medium"
03:55,200;03:58,520;"'cause I'm right now I'm feeling"
03:58,520;04:02,960;"like really into my own brand, if I'm gonna be honest."
04:02,960;04:03,800;"- Yep, fair enough."
04:03,800;04:06,040;"- Yeah, just, you know, I've worked like literally everywhere."
04:06,040;04:08,080;"If there's like a place in Boston or LA"
04:08,080;04:09,800;"that I could have worked, I've probably worked there."
04:09,800;04:12,680;"but I'm at Fox Sports now."
04:12,680;04:14,080;"- Very cool."
04:14,080;04:15,080;"So it is a,"
04:15,080;04:15,920;"- So it sounds,"
04:15,920;04:16,920;"(laughs)"
04:16,920;04:18,000;"- I figure out the same page."
04:18,000;04:18,840;"See, I don't know."
04:18,840;04:19,680;"- No, I was gonna say."
04:19,680;04:22,920;"- The amazing way you do is what I do for this podcast,"
04:22,920;04:25,080;"but with much less glory."
04:25,080;04:27,160;"- Yes, yeah, it's a little bit of,"
04:27,160;04:30,760;"it's a little bit of babysitting, you know, the topic."
04:30,760;04:32,000;"- That's the word I was gonna use, yeah."
04:32,000;04:32,840;"Babysitting."
04:32,840;04:33,760;"- Yeah, yeah."
04:33,760;04:35,280;"But I'm gonna work with,"
04:35,280;04:36,560;"I do work with professionals."
04:36,560;04:38,960;"I know that there is a lot of strong opinions"
04:38,960;04:41,120;"about the people on air."
04:41,120;04:43,560;"The people that I don't love on air"
04:43,560;04:47,480;"are already starting to get weeded out, which is nice."
04:47,480;04:49,480;"But I really like skipping Shannon."
04:49,480;04:51,960;"I really like Colin Coward."
04:51,960;04:54,360;"And when I was a writer and doing my own stuff,"
04:54,360;04:56,880;"I used to shit on them all the time."
04:56,880;04:59,080;"There's tweets in these articles where I'd be like,"
04:59,080;05:00,640;"what the hell is this guy talking about?"
05:00,640;05:01,600;"Like blah, blah."
05:01,600;05:04,280;"And then I got into studio and I work with Colin"
05:04,280;05:05,720;"a lot more than I've worked with Skip,"
05:05,720;05:09,080;"but he's such a good guy."
05:09,080;05:10,440;"Like he's like just such a nice guy."
05:10,440;05:11,680;"He works his ass off."
05:11,680;05:14,280;"He tries so hard to build his show every day."
05:14,280;05:18,880;"He doesn't like, he puts in more work"
05:18,880;05:22,120;"for his level of success and what he's achieved"
05:22,120;05:24,880;"than anybody I've worked with."
05:24,880;05:29,880;"So my job isn't nearly as like condescending to these guys"
05:29,880;05:33,280;"is like they're, they are really good at what they do."
05:33,280;05:34,560;"So it's actually, it's really nice"
05:34,560;05:37,340;"'cause I get a lot out of it as well."
05:37,340;05:39,260;"- Are they coming up with their own hot takes?"
05:39,260;05:40,460;"Or are you like, all right,"
05:40,460;05:42,020;"this is your hot take for the day?"
05:42,020;05:44,260;"- No, for the most part, like, you know,"
05:44,260;05:47,020;"they really come into it with their own ideas"
05:47,020;05:50,500;"and Colin specifically does a lot of fleshing it out"
05:50,500;05:51,340;"with his team."
05:51,340;05:54,540;"So it's like, you know, he kind of tries out"
05:54,540;05:57,340;"what he's thinking and it talks it through in his meeting,"
05:57,340;05:59,580;"which is a very long meeting in the morning."
05:59,580;06:01,820;"And that's, you know, it's supplemented by someone"
06:01,820;06:05,500;"who's doing, you know, there's a researcher there,"
06:05,500;06:08,180;"there's PAs and APs and producers and stuff"
06:08,180;06:11,020;"that really just kind of help him curate that"
06:11,020;06:12,500;"and get it to a point where he wants to get it."
06:12,500;06:14,100;"Sometimes he totally abandons a take"
06:14,100;06:15,460;"'cause it's not working."
06:15,460;06:16,900;"You know, sometimes he's working through it"
06:16,900;06:18,620;"and gets it to where he wants to get it."
06:18,620;06:21,500;"Sometimes he leaves the room and everybody's like,"
06:21,500;06:23,060;"""This is gonna be a weird show."""
06:23,060;06:24,740;"You know? (laughs)"
06:24,740;06:26,860;"And it's, you know, but like at the end of the day,"
06:26,860;06:29,060;"he kind of knows the game really well."
06:29,060;06:31,540;"And he says, ""He's as successful as he is"
06:31,540;06:38,860;"because he works really hard. And I've worked at NFL Network. I've worked at NBC Sports"
06:38,860;06:43,380;"Boston. I've worked on a lot of newsrooms. And I'm telling you, he works so hard for"
06:43,380;06:48,380;"how much money and success he already has. It's wild."
06:48,380;06:56,220;"So he's the Tom Brady of Hotting. He loved to think that. Just don't say it to his face,"
06:56,220;06:59,460;"right? Yeah. And he has 90 years. So, you know,"
06:59,460;07:02,900;"I mean, either that it's either him or Russell Wilson. He'll take either one."
07:02,900;07:04,420;"Fair enough."
07:04,420;07:09,540;"But yeah. So I think we can agree on,"
07:09,540;07:16,500;"we've given a lot of players shit over the beginning of these episodes,"
07:16,500;07:21,980;"only to do deep dives on them and find out that we actually liked them as"
07:21,980;07:25,420;"people and have grown like soft spots for them."
07:25,420;07:29,220;"Once we kind of understand who they are is actual people."
07:29,220;07:32,960;"Yeah, yeah, it happens. That's yeah, yeah Steve"
07:32,960;07:36,500;"Yeah"
07:36,500;07:44,760;"Earth Martin now is felt he stabbed me in the back has a little young and oh my god Curtis Martin. Yeah, he's great"
07:44,760;07:51,200;"Yeah, I mean according to his Wikipedia article. He's awesome. No, he's like he's cool like there's he there's like some"
07:51,200;07:55,360;"athletes or you hear their name and you're like assume that they'd be assholes and"
07:56,620;08:00,180;"Then and you meet them and they're like the nicest and then there's the reverse"
08:00,180;08:06,480;"You know that where you're like this guy's gonna be cool and they suck and like the you know the latter obviously is worse when you meet like"
08:06,480;08:12,300;"I'm trying to think in an example of someone. I thought I was gonna hate that. Oh Michael Irvin"
08:12,300;08:18,100;"I thought I was gonna hate Michael Irvin. I grew up like being like this guy sucks"
08:18,100;08:19,260;"you know the"
08:19,260;08:22,260;"cocaine cowboys and all those dudes that were just they were just like a lot and"
08:22,740;08:25,300;"- He talked a lot of shit about the Patriots"
08:25,300;08:28,100;"like growing up and he did,"
08:28,100;08:30,500;"so I thought I was gonna hate him and then I met him"
08:30,500;08:32,100;"and he was like the nicest dude in the world."
08:32,100;08:35,220;"Like truly so nice, not creepy."
08:35,220;08:36,540;"He didn't hit on me."
08:36,540;08:37,660;"He wasn't like nothing."
08:37,660;08:39,740;"Nothing of what you did not have to write."
08:39,740;08:43,380;"Yeah, so you know, you never know with these guys."
08:43,380;08:44,460;"- That's true."
08:44,460;08:49,460;"Oh, so that actually, that gives a question from me."
08:49,460;08:51,940;"Have you met Troy Brown?"
08:51,940;08:52,780;"- Yeah."
08:52,780;08:54,940;"- And is he as wonderful as we think he is?"
08:54,940;08:56,020;"- Oh, yeah."
08:56,020;08:58,620;"- It's actually really funny that you bring him up specifically"
08:58,620;09:03,620;"because he was the first athlete I met,"
09:03,620;09:05,380;"like really met and talked to"
09:05,380;09:07,740;"when I started working in the industry."
09:07,740;09:08,580;"- No, when?"
09:08,580;09:11,980;"- I was, I was, had just started working full-time freelance"
09:11,980;09:13,340;"at NBC Sports Boston"
09:13,340;09:16,740;"and he had started doing stuff on air there."
09:16,740;09:19,740;"And I was, like he was one of those people"
09:19,740;09:21,980;"was like, I know this sounds crazy,"
09:21,980;09:24,620;"but he's the most starstruck I could really be."
09:24,620;09:27,060;"Like, I was obsessed with him."
09:27,060;09:28,460;"- I wasn't so crazy at all."
09:28,460;09:30,620;"- No, no, you're a preacher required."
09:30,620;09:32,060;"- No, not to you guys, but to other."
09:32,060;09:33,860;"(laughing)"
09:33,860;09:36,980;"And I have this like, I knew, I remember exactly"
09:36,980;09:39,340;"when I was like, I hit my freak out moment"
09:39,340;09:41,980;"is he came into studio and he needed somebody"
09:41,980;09:45,020;"to help put the like things in his collar"
09:45,020;09:45,980;"to keep it straight."
09:45,980;09:47,140;"You know those little classic things"
09:47,140;09:47,980;"you put in the collar."
09:47,980;09:49,020;"- Collar stays."
09:49,020;09:52,940;"exactly. And he was like, can you help me with these? And I was like, yeah. And I'm like,"
09:52,940;09:58,060;"I'm doing this. And I was, and I'm like, I was like, I was just losing my mind. And"
09:58,060;10:02,060;"internally, I was like, stay cool, stay cool. I'm like texting my mom after like,"
10:02,060;10:05,820;"I don't ever believe what I just did with Troy Brown. She's like, what? I'm like, no, no."
10:05,820;10:12,460;"But, but the best part was that he's like, super fucking awesome."
10:13,180;10:20,060;"Yes. Yeah, yeah, he works. He like works hard. He was he was like new newer to broadcasting still"
10:20,060;10:28,140;"back then. This was in like 2011 maybe early 2011. And when I like started working at NBC's"
10:28,140;10:34,540;"Force Boston full time and like he was still newer and super you know like excited to be there and"
10:34,540;10:40,140;"gets things done and whatever. So I never had one bad experience with him. Well, you really need"
10:40,140;10:43,620;"need to help us out here because we were talking about how we're going to measure success"
10:43,620;10:50,260;"through this podcast and my measure success is Troy Brown knows who we are. Just just"
10:50,260;10:55,660;"in general, he doesn't have a talk to us. He's generally aware of this podcast. You're"
10:55,660;11:01,900;"like, Oh, I think I've seen that podcast. I'm good. I can just that rest of life doesn't"
11:01,900;11:06,820;"matter. I don't even think I don't play you. There's it's you just like there's the little"
11:06,820;11:11,780;"things is that Patriots podcast, you know, it's not like this is what you guys do. Who,"
11:11,780;11:15,620;"how many more like people could you really care that much about than Troy Brown?"
11:15,620;11:19,940;"Yeah, especially as our last name is Brown. Yeah, that's true. I didn't even"
11:19,940;11:24,580;"say it all. Yeah, it all just works. Yeah. Oh, all the Troy Brown jerseys. Yeah,"
11:24,580;11:30,500;"that makes a lot of sense for you guys. I actually may or may not have just"
11:30,500;11:36,740;"accidentally ordered a Troy Brown jersey like the white blue striped throwback."
11:36,740;11:39,940;"Yeah, I'll less than attended"
11:39,940;11:43,860;"We'll see when that shows up. What happens are sick though. They're like"
11:43,860;11:46,340;"but very"
11:46,340;11:52,180;"I love them. Yeah, there's they're so vintage ugly that they've kind of come full circle and they're"
11:52,180;11:54,900;"Yeah, for sure. It's like you Andy"
11:54,900;11:59,460;"Thanks Steve"
12:02,100;12:05,520;"So how do you reconcile like people you work with"
12:05,520;12:08,620;"Shitting on the Patriots"
12:08,620;12:10,620;"Oh, that's funny. I"
12:10,620;12:16,060;"Had a hard time with it when I first moved to LA so I moved to LA in September of 2013"
12:16,060;12:22,020;"and I'd never lived outside of Massachusetts and I knew like I"
12:22,020;12:24,740;"Obviously had been on Twitter and seen the world"
12:24,740;12:26,260;"I knew people hated the Patriots"
12:26,260;12:31,900;"But it was weird to be in a place where most people weren't Patriots fans and thus hated the Patriots"
12:31,900;12:34,060;"And so I got used to it real quick."
12:34,060;12:36,700;"Like I got used to people identifying me as being"
12:36,700;12:39,220;"from Boston and then shit-talking me."
12:39,220;12:42,700;"And that kind of like, it threw me in the fire being like,"
12:42,700;12:43,900;"OK, I can deal with this."
12:43,900;12:45,180;"I can get used to this."
12:45,180;12:47,700;"And then when I started working with the talent and stuff"
12:47,700;12:50,180;"when they would talk about the Patriots and things like that,"
12:50,180;12:52,300;"that was a totally different story because it actually helped"
12:52,300;12:55,460;"me become way more--"
12:55,460;12:58,780;"you know, it helped me kind of get rid of some of the biases"
12:58,780;13:00,820;"that I have not towards just the Patriots,"
13:00,820;13:04,620;"but like being a Patriots fan and it was,"
13:04,620;13:06,020;"it gave me a little bit of perspective"
13:06,020;13:08,700;"on the more annoying things of the fan base"
13:08,700;13:11,420;"and I could see a little bit of the trailer."
13:11,420;13:12,260;"- I don't know what you're talking about."
13:12,260;13:13,860;"- But I was still like,"
13:13,860;13:16,820;"it didn't ever make me feel less of a Patriots fan"
13:16,820;13:18,300;"and it made me feel like,"
13:18,300;13:19,900;"okay, at least I've seen the other side,"
13:19,900;13:21,140;"like I'm in with the enemies,"
13:21,140;13:24,220;"like they can't do as much damage to us"
13:24,220;13:25,900;"'cause I know how they're gonna operate."
13:25,900;13:28,140;"Like I can work around this, you know?"
13:28,140;13:29,740;"- Oh yeah, that's fair."
13:29,740;13:33,020;"Yeah, I was in Europe when George W. Bush was president."
13:33,020;13:35,500;"So I fully understand."
13:35,500;13:36,980;"Same thing."
13:36,980;13:38,980;"I mean, it happens all the time, like I'll be in a meeting."
13:38,980;13:43,700;"And it was, you know, like all through the 2018 season,"
13:43,700;13:46,380;"the talks every day was like, they don't have the weapons."
13:46,380;13:47,340;"They don't have the weapons."
13:47,340;13:47,900;"They don't have it."
13:47,900;13:48,820;"They can't do it this year."
13:48,820;13:50,940;"And they can't have-- and it was like, I just--"
13:50,940;13:52,260;"you know, you itch a little bit."
13:52,260;13:53,620;"You want to say something."
13:53,620;13:57,020;"But it actually is when you're forced"
13:57,020;13:58,380;"to sit in a room full of people who"
13:58,380;13:59,700;"want to see the Patriots fail."
13:59,700;14:01,500;"And when they see those little cracks,"
14:01,500;14:04,180;"they jump on them, not just because of their own biases,"
14:04,180;14:06,900;"but because it's good television."
14:06,900;14:07,980;"And you're forced to sit in it."
14:07,980;14:12,220;"It really does allow you to figure out"
14:12,220;14:14,860;"how to pick apart those arguments"
14:14,860;14:17,820;"and project where people are going to go"
14:17,820;14:18,860;"in certain situations."
14:18,860;14:21,540;"So you see that, and then you start"
14:21,540;14:24,020;"looking at how they schemed their way out of it"
14:24,020;14:26,580;"and use specific people to their talents"
14:26,580;14:27,700;"and built up their defense."
14:27,700;14:32,100;"And you look at all of the arguments against how that,"
14:32,100;14:33,900;"like all the ways that that wouldn't have worked,"
14:33,900;14:36,900;"you hear that every single day for months on end,"
14:36,900;14:38,620;"then there, it's all of a sudden they're"
14:38,620;14:41,540;"in the AFC Championship again, and then they're"
14:41,540;14:43,060;"at the Super Bowl again."
14:43,060;14:46,060;"And everybody in the meeting room is looking at me."
14:46,060;14:49,020;"Like, how the fuck did they do this again?"
14:49,020;14:52,100;"Like, I've been here the whole time."
14:52,100;14:53,380;"You could have asked me."
14:53,380;14:54,980;"- Yeah."
14:54,980;14:59,180;"- Oh, I lived up in Living in DC since 2006."
14:59,180;15:02,820;"So I'm well-versed in every single comeback you can possibly."
15:02,820;15:03,660;"- Exactly."
15:03,660;15:05,340;"- Tom Brady kisses his son in the lips."
15:05,340;15:07,460;"I wish Tom Brady kissed me on the lips."
15:07,460;15:08,500;"- Yeah, he does it."
15:08,500;15:09,340;"- Great."
15:09,340;15:11,340;"(laughs)"
15:11,340;15:16,340;"- Oh yeah, it's, it is, I think, a skill that you learn"
15:16,340;15:19,500;"quickly if you move outside of New England"
15:19,500;15:22,380;"because you have a target on your,"
15:22,380;15:24,540;"not even on your back, it's on your forehead."
15:24,540;15:25,860;"I think it makes you smart."
15:25,860;15:26,940;"I really do."
15:26,940;15:27,780;"- Yeah, for sure."
15:27,780;15:29,060;"- I agree, yeah."
15:29,060;15:31,820;"- Not no, no like shots at anybody who is, you know,"
15:31,820;15:35,300;"a lifelong Massachusetts person, but you are nuts."
15:35,300;15:37,620;"That's the answer to that is you're probably nuts."
15:37,620;15:39,100;"- Oh yeah."
15:39,100;15:40,500;"Yeah, and if you don't leave soon enough,"
15:40,500;15:42,340;"what you do is you end up starting a podcast"
15:42,340;15:45,260;"where you go back and rewatch every game starting in 2001."
15:45,260;15:46,500;"- Every single one."
15:46,500;15:49,700;"- Honestly, I did check out a couple of clips."
15:49,700;15:52,340;"Like I was just kind of like fucking around"
15:52,340;15:54,500;"and I saw some of the Chargers game from,"
15:54,500;15:57,620;"I think it was 2002, they played the Chargers in 2002?"
15:57,620;15:58,780;"- Yeah, yeah."
15:58,780;16:00,420;"- Okay, so I was looking at some of that"
16:00,420;16:03,260;"and there was like, yeah, just, yeah."
16:03,260;16:05,300;"And there were just these little clips I was watching"
16:05,300;16:07,740;"and I'm like, oh, Christian Fourier,"
16:07,740;16:09,980;"he just threw a touchdown pass to Christian Fourier,"
16:09,980;16:12,340;"this is really taking me out of it."
16:12,340;16:16,180;"Like these people that are now like shitty radio dudes"
16:16,180;16:18,460;"that were like, oh God."
16:18,460;16:21,220;"- Yeah, we're watching the snowball."
16:21,220;16:23,220;"Yeah, and Jermaine Wiggins is having a field day."
16:23,220;16:24,220;"[LAUGHTER]"
16:24,220;16:26,220;"You're like, what the fuck?"
16:26,220;16:26,820;"Yeah, it's--"
16:26,820;16:28,140;"I don't know when he used to be cool."
16:28,140;16:30,420;"And then I was like, why doesn't anyone ever"
16:30,420;16:31,740;"remember Antoine Smith?"
16:31,740;16:33,140;"Like, why?"
16:33,140;16:34,820;"It's like he never existed anymore."
16:34,820;16:36,940;"You go back and-- so I'm with you."
16:36,940;16:38,340;"I like going back and looking."
16:38,340;16:41,540;"Sometimes it's not pretty, but I like it."
16:41,540;16:46,220;"No, especially every game in Miami so far has been borderline"
16:46,220;16:47,220;"unwatchable, actually."
16:47,220;16:48,860;"And it's day like that for 20 years."
16:48,860;16:50,220;"It doesn't get any better."
16:50,220;16:56,700;"I know. I think we looked it up and the longest winning streak in Miami was three games."
16:56,700;17:01,660;"That's true. I can't believe they even won three games in a row. Like I still can't."
17:01,660;17:07,580;"That that still is like what when wait let me try to guess when the stretch was. Do you remember"
17:07,580;17:13,100;"when it was? I can pull it out. I'm trying to remember. I remember what about. Yeah. You remember"
17:13,100;17:18,940;"when the stretch was? Riggly. I'm like the time ish frame. I'm going to guess that it was from"
17:19,820;17:21,720;"2016 to 17."
17:21,720;17:23,920;"All right. Let me see."
17:23,920;17:25,080;"Well, that'd be three years."
17:25,080;17:26,360;"I'd be like 16, 17, eight."
17:26,360;17:27,800;"No, because you're."
17:27,800;17:28,240;"Oh, yeah."
17:28,240;17:28,760;"I was thinking."
17:28,760;17:29,760;"I'm Miami."
17:29,760;17:31,240;"No, because three games."
17:31,240;17:32,320;"So it'd be two games and then"
17:32,320;17:33,400;"another season."
17:33,400;17:34,080;"Right."
17:34,080;17:35,080;"Yeah."
17:35,080;17:36,680;"So when did you say it was?"
17:36,680;17:39,760;"I was saying 2016 into 2017."
17:39,760;17:42,560;"But we're talking at Miami."
17:42,560;17:43,040;"You don't play there."
17:43,040;17:44,480;"Yeah, we're talking at Miami."
17:44,480;17:47,320;"Oh, I thought you were saying just against Miami."
17:47,320;17:48,480;"No, like."
17:48,480;17:49,480;"No."
17:49,480;17:56,440;"Okay, so they always win at home. Yeah almost always. Okay, so then I'll go 2015 to 2017"
17:56,440;18:03,440;"I unfortunately no 2015 to 2017 the only one once"
18:03,440;18:10,280;"You know like 16 14 when was it it was 10 11 12. Oh, yeah, you know"
18:10,280;18:14,560;"That's the secret time when they were actually really good, but didn't win a super bowl exactly"
18:14,920;18:21,000;"Yeah with the those games that's what's Walker's 99 yard touchdown remember that oh, yeah"
18:21,000;18:23,720;"How could how could one forget?"
18:23,720;18:31,400;"I've been watching these games in 2002. I forgot a shitload of those. It's amazing. Yeah, I think for me"
18:31,400;18:37,280;"2002 was the lost season because yeah, I remember nothing of this. I remember like"
18:37,280;18:44,520;"The first couple of games, but even then I don't realize that the patrons were underdogs going into the the opener against"
18:44,520;18:51,960;"the Steelers. I also like wasn't I was in high school and so I was like in 2002 I"
18:51,960;18:57,400;"guess I was like 15 maybe so I was turning 16 whatever it was and so I was"
18:57,400;19:02,600;"like in high school and not sitting down and watching the games the way that I"
19:02,600;19:09,360;"was like later once I was like 17 18 and older because being a girl sports fan"
19:09,360;19:13,360;"in New England in the early 2000s was like you might as well just go fuck"
19:13,360;19:19,280;"yourself. Like, no one wanted to watch a game with me. And I didn't have like, my dad would"
19:19,280;19:23,840;"died when I was 14 and we were estranged. So like, he was a huge, huge sports fan and he would have"
19:23,840;19:28,960;"loved to watch them with me. But he wasn't around for that. But he did inspire me to love sports. So"
19:28,960;19:35,360;"I was like, I was kind of on my own navigating how to like, really introduce myself into like sports"
19:35,360;19:40,560;"conversations and being confident enough to do it. And it took a little bit by the time I was like"
19:40,560;19:42,560;"like a junior and a senior in high school,"
19:42,560;19:44,640;"I started to really like feel comfortable with it"
19:44,640;19:46,160;"and I would go to the Patriots parades"
19:46,160;19:49,320;"and everybody started to like embrace that I was a fan"
19:49,320;19:52,320;"and I felt more comfortable and I got my family like,"
19:52,320;19:54,400;"you know, my mom was always a big Patriots fan"
19:54,400;19:56,360;"but I got my sisters and everybody else into it"
19:56,360;20:00,520;"and then the ball was rolling and so by like, oh, 405,"
20:00,520;20:02,320;"like I remember all those games"
20:02,320;20:05,800;"but even the season like going into the Super Bowl"
20:05,800;20:08,400;"against the Panthers,"
20:09,900;20:13,340;"I don't have a ton of memories of that."
20:13,340;20:15,140;"- Yeah. - So far."
20:15,140;20:17,380;"- I don't have a, I don't know."
20:17,380;20:19,060;"I spoke a ton of weed when I was growing up,"
20:19,060;20:21,020;"so I don't even remember shit."
20:21,020;20:21,860;"- That's fine."
20:21,860;20:22,940;"- This is very formative season for me though,"
20:22,940;20:25,100;"because I realized this is why I hate Brett Favre."
20:25,100;20:27,980;"This is why I love David Gibbons and I had his jersey."
20:27,980;20:28,820;"- That's right."
20:28,820;20:29,660;"- The season right now."
20:29,660;20:30,500;"- Oh, that's, yeah."
20:30,500;20:31,340;"I actually, my first football,"
20:31,340;20:32,580;"I remember my first feeling of being like,"
20:32,580;20:34,900;"oh, I think I like football was watching the Super Bowl"
20:34,900;20:39,740;"against the Packers in 1997 and being like,"
20:39,740;20:43,100;"I was like, I'm so mad we lost."
20:43,100;20:43,940;"- Yeah."
20:43,940;20:45,340;"- Sitting in my neighbor's house"
20:45,340;20:47,060;"and we were just watching it, like his dad was there"
20:47,060;20:48,420;"and whatever and I was just like,"
20:48,420;20:50,780;"I was so fucking mad and upset."
20:50,780;20:53,180;"And then I was like, oh, I'm like,"
20:53,180;20:54,260;"I'm really into this."
20:54,260;20:55,260;"Like, I think we were-- - Oh yeah."
20:55,260;20:57,380;"I think I cried myself to sleep that night."
20:57,380;20:58,580;"- Yeah. - 'Cause we got sent"
20:58,580;21:00,460;"to bed like halfway through the fourth quarter"
21:00,460;21:02,780;"'cause it was obvious it wasn't gonna happen."
21:02,780;21:06,180;"And I turned the radio on on my clock radio,"
21:06,180;21:08,500;"next to my bed and listened to the end of it."
21:08,500;21:12,400;"like maybe maybe there's a chance of they'll they'll be able to use the note that"
21:12,400;21:17,280;"happened. I'm defining memory is making like little men out of cheese and then"
21:17,280;21:21,640;"squeezing the shit out of it. Oh good call. I even had to squeeze the cheese."
21:21,640;21:25,780;"Oh that's right we all have this. There's a picture of being that thing."
21:25,780;21:30,360;"I never remember those they didn't endure as much as squished the fish."
21:30,360;21:33,320;"Yeah I think it was like it's just like a playoff that."
21:33,320;21:34,320;"Probably because they lost."
21:34,320;21:36,920;"Well, I guess that's true."
21:36,920;21:41,440;"And I guess we don't have an ignoring rivalry with the Packers."
21:41,440;21:43,320;"So not really."
21:43,320;21:43,680;"Yeah."
21:43,680;21:47,800;"Because we actually just watched the Packers game a couple weeks ago and"
21:47,800;21:50,280;"remembered nothing of the game."
21:50,280;21:51,480;"Didn't even remember happening."
21:51,480;21:53,680;"Brett Favre in Gillette Stadium."
21:53,680;21:55,640;"You think that would be a big deal?"
21:55,640;21:59,080;"No, no, I try to forget everything Brett Favre does."
21:59,080;22:02,960;"Like ever, I don't know if I started in like 90 in that season and that"
22:02,960;22:04,920;"Super Bowl, like just hating him in my soul."
22:04,920;22:07,960;"But like ever since then, I haven't just been like anti-Bret"
22:07,960;22:11,360;"Favre, I've been like on Twitter, discrediting him."
22:11,360;22:13,600;"Like every time people talk about the goats,"
22:13,600;22:16,600;"I'm like, he's nowhere near there."
22:16,600;22:17,880;"That's anything I can find."
22:17,880;22:21,200;"Like it's a, it's a full, like he definitely like,"
22:21,200;22:22,480;"he's in my head."
22:22,480;22:26,320;"Like it's unhealthy how much I buys Bret Favre"
22:26,320;22:28,680;"and how like little he understands football"
22:28,680;22:31,280;"and how little he tried, he just fucking."
22:31,280;22:34,520;"That was my exact point, because we had this argument"
22:34,520;22:35,560;"that Greg, because Greg was like,"
22:35,560;22:39,080;"oh yeah, and you just hate the fact that everybody loves him."
22:39,080;22:41,800;"I'm like, but he doesn't deserve the love"
22:41,800;22:42,640;"is what I hate about him."
22:42,640;22:44,640;"Like he just, it reminded me a lot of,"
22:44,640;22:46,560;"I feel the same way about Eli Manning,"
22:46,560;22:48,240;"but yeah, probably about the same,"
22:48,240;22:51,480;"because just watching him is frustrating,"
22:51,480;22:53,360;"because on first and second down,"
22:53,360;22:55,680;"he will do the dumbest shit you've ever seen."
22:55,680;22:58,560;"And on third down, his super athletic wide receivers"
22:58,560;23:01,560;"will make some amazing highlight, real catch."
23:01,560;23:02,480;"And then look at it first down,"
23:02,480;23:03,840;"and it just continues that way."
23:03,840;23:06,360;"It just looks like he's looking into everything."
23:06,360;23:07,200;"- Right."
23:07,200;23:10,040;"- And whether or not that's true, whatever."
23:10,040;23:10,880;"But it's just how it feels."
23:10,880;23:13,160;"It's just so annoying to me to watch."
23:13,160;23:15,320;"And I can't, I feel like Brett Farf,"
23:15,320;23:16,560;"it's that mold for me too."
23:16,560;23:18,800;"- I hate him because he's the reason"
23:18,800;23:20,520;"that the Patriots didn't go to the playoffs"
23:20,520;23:24,040;"every single year in Tom Brady's career."
23:24,040;23:27,120;"He is a reason we didn't go in both years in this playoffs."
23:27,120;23:28,400;"- Wait, seriously?"
23:28,400;23:29,240;"Yeah."
23:29,240;23:31,040;"- Because in two days--"
23:31,040;23:32,880;"- When he was with the Packers, he like lost."
23:32,880;23:33,800;"This is why I hated him."
23:33,800;23:34,640;"I'm not even too long."
23:34,640;23:35,920;"- He lost to the Jets."
23:35,920;23:36,760;"- Yeah."
23:36,760;23:37,600;"- Probably favor."
23:37,600;23:38,440;"- I think 17."
23:38,440;23:40,480;"- Which is the reason you didn't win the MVP that year."
23:40,480;23:43,280;"And so the Jets were tied for first place with,"
23:43,280;23:44,920;"I think the Pats and the Dolphins."
23:44,920;23:45,760;"- Yeah."
23:45,760;23:46,600;"- It won on tie breakers."
23:46,600;23:48,480;"So the Pats must have play offs."
23:48,480;23:53,560;"And obviously was it 2008 when he was with the Jets."
23:53,560;23:54,400;"Same thing."
23:54,400;23:55,520;"- He needs to like beat the Dolphins"
23:55,520;23:58,160;"or something in week 17 and fucking blow it again."
23:58,160;24:00,260;"I remember watching that game now that you talk about it."
24:00,260;24:01,860;"I remember exactly where I was."
24:01,860;24:03,980;"And I was like, I can't believe we're going to miss the playoffs."
24:03,980;24:05,380;"And it's a let there are 11 and five."
24:05,380;24:07,780;"Like this is that's fucked up."
24:07,780;24:08,620;"That doesn't happen."
24:08,620;24:09,620;"That's so good."
24:09,620;24:12,740;"But it's like it's it doesn't, you know, it's like there was some dude there that"
24:12,740;24:15,220;"wasn't a sports fan who was like, it's not a big deal."
24:15,220;24:17,220;"Like you can't play up every season."
24:17,220;24:18,900;"I was like, you can when you go 11 and."
24:18,900;24:21,260;"Yes, you can."
24:21,260;24:24,740;"They're probably one of two or three teams that have gone 11 and five and not made the"
24:24,740;24:26,500;"You can say too like the miners that it wants."
24:26,500;24:28,940;"- No, there's no other team that's done it."
24:28,940;24:30,020;"- I'm not interested."
24:30,020;24:30,980;"- One other."
24:30,980;24:35,100;"- No, there's no other team that's won 11 games"
24:35,100;24:36,700;"in a 16 game season."
24:36,700;24:39,120;"I'm 99% sure on this."
24:39,120;24:42,300;"There's been 10 and 16s."
24:42,300;24:46,500;"I don't wanna, you can fact check me, but I'm very proud."
24:46,500;24:49,180;"- Coming the first 11 win team to ever miss the postseason"
24:49,180;24:52,100;"since the playoffs for a spin to 12 in 1990."
24:52,100;24:52,940;"- Yeah."
24:52,940;24:53,780;"- There it is."
24:53,780;24:57,820;"worse than you thought guys. Yeah. Oh, so yeah, fuck breath. We're we're"
24:57,820;25:00,820;"essentially a fuck breath fire podcast now. Yeah, I'm fine. I would"
25:00,820;25:05,500;"actually start that if I had the ball. I like, I truly it's the"
25:05,500;25:08,700;"thing about Eli Manning is like people do waffle on Eli Manning. Like a"
25:08,700;25:11,660;"lot of people are like, yeah, one two Super Bowls and he was weirdly"
25:11,660;25:14,140;"good in those playoff runs. And there are some things like he"
25:14,140;25:18,100;"clearly understands football in a way that's like he can read a"
25:18,100;25:21,680;"defense like when it comes out that Brett Favre didn't know what a"
25:21,680;25:25,720;"like what the nickel package was, like they didn't understand,"
25:25,720;25:28,520;"like this was while he was on the Packers,"
25:28,520;25:31,000;"that he didn't understand what the nickel defense was."
25:31,000;25:33,520;"And someone on his own team had to explain it to him."
25:33,520;25:35,680;"Like this kind of stuff, I'm like, fuck you dude,"
25:35,680;25:40,320;"like you were just a drunk dude, really strong"
25:40,320;25:42,200;"and like just could throw the ball far"
25:42,200;25:43,120;"and didn't give a shit."
25:43,120;25:44,440;"So you just have a ton of yards"
25:44,440;25:46,760;"and a ton of touchdowns and a ton of interceptions."
25:46,760;25:48,760;"Like I genuinely think Matt Stafford"
25:48,760;25:51,400;"is a better quarter than Brett Favre was."
25:51,400;25:53,240;"And just like Brett Favre was on the Packers"
25:53,240;25:54,560;"when they happened to be decent enough"
25:54,560;25:57,320;"that he could win one fucking Super Bowl."
25:57,320;26:00,800;"- That validates my point 'cause I think I--"
26:00,800;26:03,080;"- Yeah, you can listen to our"
26:03,080;26:04,920;"Patriots podcast for that game"
26:04,920;26:07,720;"'cause there's a ton of Brett Favre hating it."
26:07,720;26:09,120;"Y'all really like it."
26:09,120;26:14,120;"- I was saying that I think Brett Favre is Patrick Mahomes"
26:14,120;26:17,800;"if Patrick Mahomes couldn't read a defense."
26:17,800;26:19,320;"It was exactly what I said."
26:19,320;26:20,640;"- You did say that. - Right, right."
26:20,640;26:24,080;"run around, he can throw off, like, on the run,"
26:24,080;26:26,560;"so that he can huck him off from anywhere."
26:26,560;26:28,360;"But he just can't read defense saves life."
26:28,360;26:31,440;"- Yeah, and he also had no, he didn't really have,"
26:31,440;26:32,680;"the other thing was that, like,"
26:32,680;26:34,400;"that makes him different from Mahomes,"
26:34,400;26:36,160;"is that he didn't really have any respect"
26:36,160;26:38,160;"for a game plan at all."
26:38,160;26:43,000;"Like, Mahomes actually follows Andy Reed's offense"
26:43,000;26:45,440;"and the game plan and, like, the play calls."
26:45,440;26:47,960;"He just, right far, didn't listen to the play,"
26:47,960;26:49,160;"like he didn't give a fuck."
26:49,160;26:50,760;"It was a constant audible."
26:50,760;26:53,360;"And so like, and his own coaches have said that,"
26:53,360;26:54,680;"he's said that."
26:54,680;26:56,440;"Like that's not me just making that up."
26:56,440;26:59,240;"Like he talked about it on the NFL 100 last year."
26:59,240;27:01,120;"He kind of just broke all the rules"
27:01,120;27:03,680;"and a lot of times he was talented enough to make up for it."
27:03,680;27:06,440;"Whereas Mahomes plays in a system"
27:06,440;27:09,360;"and has a good offensive coordinator"
27:09,360;27:11,960;"and has one of the greatest offensive coaches of all time"
27:11,960;27:14,840;"as his head coach and benefits from that and listens to it"
27:14,840;27:16,360;"and plays within those parameters."
27:16,360;27:19,280;"And that's like, you know, they run some cool stuff."
27:19,280;27:23,920;"It's not super complex, but he does work in a system."
27:23,920;27:26,560;"- Yeah, and Mahomes has a centenie dick picks"
27:26,560;27:28,440;"to the people on his team."
27:28,440;27:30,440;"- There, yes, yes."
27:30,440;27:33,840;"We don't, like there's a long career ahead of him."
27:33,840;27:35,840;"- Yeah, yeah."
27:35,840;27:37,160;"- That's true."
27:37,160;27:41,960;"- Fucking Brett Favre, God damn it."
27:41,960;27:43,760;"- I'm glad I came on here to Brett Favre"
27:43,760;27:44,640;"of hate contest."
27:44,640;27:45,480;"- Absolutely."
27:45,480;27:50,120;"I just listened to that podcast episode like this week, so it's fresh in my mind"
27:50,120;27:54,280;"All right"
27:54,280;27:59,480;"What is your favorite Patriots moment"
27:59,480;28:05,560;"Mmm my favorite Patriots moment is when they beat the Seahawks in the Super Bowl"
28:05,560;28:08,680;"I had"
28:08,680;28:13,440;"So it had been 10 years since they'd won a Super Bowl the last time they'd won I was in high school"
28:13,440;28:17,440;"I was now out in LA, had a whole new group of friends, a whole new life."
28:17,440;28:26,160;"I was like deep into my career and I had started to feel like they weren't like, it was like"
28:26,160;28:27,160;"not going to happen."
28:27,160;28:31,440;"You know, they were always going to be super good and it was not going to happen."
28:31,440;28:37,200;"And I was at this Super Bowl party with all of my new LA friends and with my boyfriend"
28:37,200;28:40,360;"who I'm now engaged slash married to."
28:40,360;28:43,360;"We can't, we're trying to get married."
28:43,360;28:48,880;"And you know, we're like, and I'm in this like very like everybody's a fan of a different team"
28:48,880;28:51,440;"We're all gathered together to watch Seahawks Patriots"
28:51,440;28:55,080;"My fiance is best friend as a Seahawks fan"
28:55,080;28:59,560;"So and I'm the and I'm a Patriots fan and it's rowdy and I"
28:59,560;29:10,440;"Like when Malcolm Butler intercepted it I blacked out. I don't I don't remember the only thing I know about how I behaved is"
29:10,440;29:13,280;"Stories from other people"
29:13,280;29:16,980;"And I was inappropriate."
29:16,980;29:21,980;"Like I'm really glad that Chris's best friend"
29:21,980;29:23,680;"is a cool dude who just was like,"
29:23,680;29:26,440;"we find to just drink whiskey out of a wine glass"
29:26,440;29:27,880;"until he blacked out and went home."
29:27,880;29:31,200;"He was very cool about it compared to how I was."
29:31,200;29:33,400;"But right before that,"
29:33,400;29:36,760;"I had pulled up a picture of my dad on my phone."
29:36,760;29:38,940;"And I looked at it and I was like,"
29:38,940;29:42,040;"like I need a miracle."
29:42,040;29:43,240;"Like please help us."
29:43,240;29:44,080;"I need a miracle."
29:44,080;29:48,080;"Like I didn't realize how long it had been"
29:48,080;29:50,800;"since it's like I really felt like we were gonna win"
29:50,800;29:52,160;"the Super Bowl."
29:52,160;29:54,600;"And because in both of the Giants ones,"
29:54,600;29:57,600;"they came close but not that close."
29:57,600;30:00,400;"And it was gonna be over and I couldn't believe it."
30:00,400;30:03,520;"And as soon as he, as soon as Russell Wilson"
30:03,520;30:06,960;"threw the ball, I looked away."
30:06,960;30:09,720;"Like my, I just kind of like turned off"
30:09,720;30:12,880;"and everybody else, you know, they said,"
30:12,880;30:15,600;"they said they intercepted it, they intercepted it,"
30:15,600;30:16,800;"and that's when the black got happened."
30:16,800;30:20,760;"And when I kind of came to, there was my dad on my phone,"
30:20,760;30:24,880;"and I just, after all of whatever I said, I just cried."
30:24,880;30:27,240;"And it was honestly like, I was like,"
30:27,240;30:28,840;"I know you guys think this is stupid."
30:28,840;30:31,760;"We've won three Super Bowls, like, I get that,"
30:31,760;30:34,520;"but like it's, this was fucking awesome."
30:34,520;30:36,920;"Like I'm not in, I'm not home, I'm not in Massachusetts."
30:36,920;30:39,680;"I'm far from my family, and like, this is so cool."
30:39,680;30:41,080;"And I called my mom and she was crying."
30:41,080;30:46,080;"And I know that there's been like so many great moments"
30:46,080;30:48,480;"and it might not be objectively the greatest moment"
30:48,480;30:53,480;"in Patriots history, but to me, it was just so,"
30:53,480;30:56,360;"it was like that first win after 10 years,"
30:56,360;30:59,200;"like I think it's the only reason that like"
30:59,200;31:01,800;"they were able to do everything they've done since then."
31:01,800;31:05,240;"And it's just my favorite."
31:05,240;31:07,400;"- I like that one, Super Bowl ones."
31:07,400;31:08,240;"(laughs)"
31:08,240;31:09,080;"- Which one?"
31:09,080;31:11,420;"Yeah, that's Falcons what?"
31:11,420;31:13,740;"I've been here for so long that I've been able to like,"
31:13,740;31:16,020;"through a pretty big group of Patriots fans"
31:16,020;31:19,940;"and we rented out a bar and Grant came up from what Carolina"
31:19,940;31:21,100;"and just--"
31:21,100;31:22,860;"Oh yeah, I saw the videos."
31:22,860;31:26,980;"I was with my friend and my girlfriend at the time there"
31:26,980;31:28,900;"and they're not Patriots fans."
31:28,900;31:31,860;"So like half time I send them home."
31:31,860;31:34,260;"(laughing)"
31:34,260;31:36,820;"Get out, I only want to be surrounded by Patriots fans"
31:36,820;31:42,380;"And then you know the whole comeback happened and it's just like you know those ridiculous"
31:42,380;31:49,860;"Yeah, yeah going back to the sea Hawks one I had as I felt similarly, but I"
31:49,860;31:56,060;"Because of the previous two Super Bowls. I got in a little two into everything and"
31:56,060;32:01,420;"I ended up just like watching them in my house alone"
32:02,020;32:06,760;"With the lights off just drinking heavily all the way from them and so that that one"
32:06,760;32:07,920;"I'm like I'm I'm gonna sit here"
32:07,920;32:11,280;"I'm not gonna drink and at the end I'd kind of like resign myself"
32:11,280;32:16,400;"I was kind of trying to do some deep breathing trying to kind of like accept the fact that wasn't gonna happen again"
32:16,400;32:18,400;"Right and my wife is like"
32:18,400;32:24,380;"Trying to read the moment in because she's not really a football fan"
32:24,380;32:27,520;"and so she kind of like lays out and puts her head on me and"
32:28,000;32:34,240;"And then the interception happens and I just stand up, just stand straight up and dump her on the floor."
32:34,240;32:36,880;"She's like, no idea."
32:36,880;32:41,120;"I think we just won. I don't know what to do with myself."
32:41,120;32:50,400;"It was exactly that moment of it had been 10 years and then I got close a whole bunch of times"
32:50,400;32:55,360;"for a little reason. But that was that final push they finally got over it."
32:55,360;32:59,920;"I was in a bar and I started as spontaneous USA chant for some reason."
32:59,920;33:03,480;"You always got to go Yankee suck in that."
33:03,480;33:04,480;"That's true."
33:04,480;33:05,480;"That's true."
33:05,480;33:08,120;"That would have been better."
33:08,120;33:09,120;"Shit."
33:09,120;33:16,120;"I have actually, since the great Super Bowl incident of 2014 or 15 or 15 or that Seahawks"
33:16,120;33:23,920;"was, I've watched the Super Bowl at home, no guests, just me and Chris."
33:23,920;33:26,020;"and everybody always invites us and I'm like,"
33:26,020;33:27,680;"Patriots are in it again, sorry guys."
33:27,680;33:29,520;"And so then after a while they stopped inviting me"
33:29,520;33:30,360;"because they were like,"
33:30,360;33:31,840;"Patriots in the Super Bowl time, you can't come."
33:31,840;33:33,280;"- Every time."
33:33,280;33:35,360;"- And he had, his friends were trying to get him"
33:35,360;33:38,720;"to FaceTime them in this,"
33:38,720;33:42,000;"at the very end of the Falcon Super Bowl."
33:42,000;33:44,080;"And I was like, fucking FaceTime them."
33:44,080;33:45,080;"I'm gonna kill you."
33:45,080;33:46,840;"I'm like crying."
33:46,840;33:49,160;"I'm like, is this really happening?"
33:49,160;33:50,800;"Like, this is the greatest thing ever."
33:50,800;33:52,600;"And I'm like, I'm not talking to anyone."
33:52,600;33:54,720;"and just like, ""Fuck everybody, fuck the hate."""
33:54,720;33:57,160;"Or like, ""I'm on the team."""
33:57,160;33:59,800;"And then they're like, ""It just felt so good."""
33:59,800;34:01,200;"- It was so nuts."
34:01,200;34:02,760;"It was like totally over at the top."
34:02,760;34:05,880;"And I was like, if you, even, and he was like,"
34:05,880;34:06,720;"""Dude, I'm good."
34:06,720;34:08,240;"I promise you, I won't."""
34:08,240;34:09,280;"I was so worried."
34:09,280;34:10,800;"I was like, ""I look like such an asshole"
34:10,800;34:12,560;"""the last time they saw me and when the Patriots"
34:12,560;34:14,720;"""won the Super Bowl, I was such an asshole."""
34:14,720;34:15,560;"(laughing)"
34:15,560;34:16,400;"""It was a stop."""
34:16,400;34:17,840;"So I cut everybody off from the narrative."
34:17,840;34:21,800;"And now all those moments are, you know, sustained here."
34:21,800;34:24,300;"- Yeah, I have to watch games alone still."
34:24,300;34:25,300;"- Yeah."
34:25,300;34:27,680;"- I'm still a nervous wreck for whatever reason."
34:27,680;34:29,980;"- It's funny because not a lot of the only fans"
34:29,980;34:33,460;"that I know that react like that way sort of regularly"
34:33,460;34:34,800;"where like, 'cause a lot of Patriots fans"
34:34,800;34:36,380;"are like that super superstitious"
34:36,380;34:38,480;"and like wanna be kind of left alone or be"
34:38,480;34:41,020;"in a great space to be with just Patriots fans."
34:41,020;34:44,220;"The only people I know that are like that intense"
34:44,220;34:47,580;"are Eagles fans."
34:47,580;34:50,780;"And I have a lot of Philadelphia friends and like,"
34:50,780;34:52,740;"you know, there's just like a lot of people in LA"
34:52,740;34:53,820;"that are from Philadelphia."
34:53,820;34:56,180;"And I've also just worked with a lot of people from Philly"
34:56,180;34:58,220;"'cause they're also a place that like loves sports"
34:58,220;35:00,140;"and goes into sports media."
35:00,140;35:04,260;"And they also are like psychos who are like,"
35:04,260;35:07,100;"I know I need to be by myself."
35:07,100;35:10,460;"I'm like, all right, well, we can agree on that."
35:10,460;35:13,300;"- I worked with a guy when the Patriots and the Eagles"
35:13,300;35:15,540;"went to this most recent Super Bowl."
35:15,540;35:19,220;"And I have preparations made just in case they won."
35:19,980;35:22,860;"Had a large crunk cut out though. It's gonna put it as desk, but"
35:22,860;35:29,360;"That one didn't hurt that one didn't hurt as much because it was his it was his first"
35:29,360;35:33,020;"Yeah, and he's like you know super excited. They actually want to see the ball. Yeah"
35:33,020;35:35,860;"I'm like I can't hate on you for this. I know how that feels"
35:35,860;35:39,380;"Because I kind of got to experience it twice because you know one you got it"
35:39,380;35:42,300;"And then you almost got it again in 2010 right and like"
35:42,300;35:45,020;"there was something about the like"
35:46,620;35:53,040;"The fact that it was Nick Foles and the way that it all happened that did see it sucked like I"
35:53,040;35:57,060;"Was bummed whatever, but because a couple of my best friends are Philly people"
35:57,060;36:02,340;"They were so they were so fucking nice after they sent me messages like now. We know how you feel"
36:02,340;36:07,020;"And I was like well now what am I gonna be mad about this?"
36:07,020;36:13,740;"The fuck in Super Bowl the year after that after exactly it like maybe if they maybe if that was their last"
36:14,500;36:16,420;"Super Bowl and then they never won again."
36:16,420;36:17,700;"We would feel like,"
36:17,700;36:19,440;"we're definitely Monday morning quarterbacking this"
36:19,440;36:21,780;"'cause like we'd feel shittier about it"
36:21,780;36:24,320;"if the next year they didn't win another ring."
36:24,320;36:26,980;"But even still, it was like at that point,"
36:26,980;36:28,580;"like I couldn't even be that mad,"
36:28,580;36:31,020;"like I couldn't trash talk and I still kind of can't."
36:31,020;36:34,140;"Like they won that one so fair and square"
36:34,140;36:36,660;"that it's like whatever."
36:36,660;36:38,820;"- Yeah, it is what it is."
36:38,820;36:39,660;"- Yeah."
36:39,660;36:42,020;"- I mean, it's not gonna stop me from pointing out"
36:42,020;36:45,300;"that the catch rules were called just slightly differently"
36:45,300;36:47,140;"in that game than they had been all season."
36:47,140;36:49,220;"- Yeah, oh, there was also that touchdown"
36:49,220;36:50,460;"they shouldn't have got, right?"
36:50,460;36:52,380;"- I think it was two, yeah."
36:52,380;36:55,300;"- There was at least one that, but like I go back"
36:55,300;36:56,140;"and I think about that and I'm like,"
36:56,140;36:58,900;"let's say they take that touchdown back, like they were--"
36:58,900;37:00,660;"- Yeah, they're gonna score again anyway."
37:00,660;37:02,140;"- Like they were gonna beat the Patriots."
37:02,140;37:03,460;"I just kind of feel that."
37:03,460;37:04,620;"- If they didn't have that strip sack"
37:04,620;37:06,900;"on the last tribe, we would have scored."
37:06,900;37:08,460;"- Yeah, I mean, listen."
37:08,460;37:09,980;"- Yeah, but they probably wouldn't have come back"
37:09,980;37:10,820;"and scored two."
37:10,820;37:13,220;"don't look back on that one with too much."
37:13,220;37:15,700;"Like it kind of feels like the reverse of the Seahawks win"
37:15,700;37:17,780;"where it's like the Seahawks should have won that one"
37:17,780;37:19,100;"probably they didn't."
37:19,100;37:19,980;"I don't think it's a fake,"
37:19,980;37:21,220;"I don't think anything's a fake title."
37:21,220;37:23,140;"Like you threw the ball, Malcolm Butler"
37:23,140;37:24,620;"made the greatest interception ever."
37:24,620;37:28,860;"But like, holy shit, like talk about coming down to the wire."
37:28,860;37:31,660;"So you know what we got, we got one, you know, you give one."
37:31,660;37:32,620;"It goes back and forth."
37:32,620;37:33,800;"It's sports karma."
37:33,800;37:37,020;"- And again, I'm well practiced."
37:37,020;37:38,500;"Someone was like, yeah, well,"
37:38,500;37:41,080;"- Really, we're over the Philly Sea Reblog, which one?"
37:41,080;37:42,160;"(laughing)"
37:42,160;37:43,000;"- Oh, there you go."
37:43,000;37:43,840;"There you go."
37:43,840;37:44,680;"- Steve."
37:44,680;37:46,880;"- Yeah, we got him all the stuff over here."
37:46,880;37:49,600;"- We're done with knabs, threw up on the field, that one."
37:49,600;37:52,440;"- Oh, the other one, no, okay."
37:52,440;37:54,400;"The one we're talking about, Brady said a record for"
37:54,400;37:56,000;"most passing yard in Super Bowl."
37:56,000;37:58,000;"- That was the most frustrating part, is that like--"
37:58,000;37:59,800;"- Yeah, he was so good."
37:59,800;38:01,440;"- His deadline from that game is like,"
38:01,440;38:03,760;"his fucking wild and people are like,"
38:03,760;38:05,040;"we'll never remember it."
38:05,040;38:07,520;"They always forget, like they always forget it."
38:07,520;38:09,340;"They threw for 500 yards."
38:09,340;38:10,180;"- Yeah, and then I'm the asshole"
38:10,180;38:11,440;"who's reminding people on Twitter"
38:11,440;38:13,120;"and they're like, cool, you lost."
38:13,120;38:15,740;"And I'm like, oh, there's nothing I can say to that."
38:15,740;38:18,140;"Like, one of the six that we can do."
38:18,140;38:19,480;"- One in one."
38:19,480;38:21,800;"- One in one, we'll get a, we'll get a re-bench on it."
38:21,800;38:24,020;"- Hey, it goes right back to like the people"
38:24,020;38:26,640;"who are like six nose better than six nose better"
38:26,640;38:27,720;"than six and three."
38:27,720;38:29,520;"- Oh my God, no it isn't."
38:29,520;38:33,360;"- It's like, I can't, that's when I hit the mute button, man."
38:33,360;38:35,360;"If you do six nose greater than six and three,"
38:35,360;38:36,280;"I go right to mute."
38:36,280;38:38,920;"I don't even give you the block because you don't deserve"
38:38,920;38:40,280;"no that I'm not."
38:40,280;38:41,280;"- Yeah, that you."
38:41,280;38:42,600;"(laughs)"
38:42,600;38:43,440;"Oh man."
38:43,440;38:45,460;"Bro."
38:45,460;38:47,760;"- So do you have a favorite patriot?"
38:47,760;38:51,280;"- All time or like on the team right now?"
38:51,280;38:52,120;"- All time."
38:52,120;38:56,280;"- Who's your Troy Brown for all of us?"
38:56,280;38:58,480;"- Who's your favorite player and why's the Troy Brown?"
38:58,480;38:59,320;"- Yeah, right."
38:59,320;39:03,560;"It was Troy Brown from the first Dynasty."
39:03,560;39:04,400;"Like it really was."
39:04,400;39:10,040;"Like I mean, because that was before Brady was like the icon icon that he is now."
39:10,040;39:17,760;"And I still think he's like one of the most underrated like 21st century NFL players."
39:17,760;39:19,320;"Like just he was like really fucking cool."
39:19,320;39:22,360;"Was the best eighth round draft pick of all time."
39:22,360;39:24,480;"What were they still doing?"
39:24,480;39:26,680;"Yeah, what he was doing is the eighth round."
39:26,680;39:27,280;"Yeah."
39:27,280;39:28,400;"Yeah."
39:28,400;39:32,960;"So, but then like it's like, I think probably since then,"
39:32,960;39:37,640;"if it's not Tom Brady, which I don't think we can all agree,"
39:37,640;39:39,080;"we like really like Tom Brady."
39:39,080;39:41,800;"Like we gotta just move on from that."
39:41,800;39:46,040;"My favorite, it's so hard to pick."
39:46,040;39:51,040;"It's probably fucking, it's either Devin McCordy or Gronk."
39:51,040;39:54,400;"It's hard for me to decide."
39:54,400;39:57,480;"I really, really like Devin McCordy."
39:57,480;39:58,760;"- Absolutely."
39:58,760;40:03,760;"- Yeah, and I still have this feeling in my heart"
40:03,760;40:05,920;"that when we look back on this,"
40:05,920;40:11,020;"the second 10 years that the defense"
40:11,020;40:15,280;"is going to be underrated."
40:15,280;40:18,080;"And that like bums me out a little bit"
40:18,080;40:22,520;"because Bill, he's known for creating defenses"
40:22,520;40:24,120;"that were good matchup defenses."
40:24,120;40:27,000;"And so they weren't always the best statistical"
40:27,000;40:29,860;"Defriends every year, like last year they were, but like, not"
40:29,860;40:33,300;"every year. A lot of it is like football nerd stuff. So like,"
40:33,300;40:36,100;"right, who are football nerds will remember the 10 year"
40:36,100;40:39,740;"stretcher, he didn't have the most dominant defense. And somehow"
40:39,740;40:42,900;"still almost always had like the best overall defense of the"
40:42,900;40:46,160;"decade, because it was so dynamic and could switch around and"
40:46,160;40:48,860;"match up different ways. And he utilized personnel in such"
40:48,860;40:54,820;"unique ways. And the and the way that the defensive sort of"
40:54,940;40:58,940;"through lines are remembered. It's not going to be the same as the Willy"
40:58,940;41:02,780;"McGinnister and you know the guys from the first dynasty who are"
41:02,780;41:06,620;"who are like borderline Hall of Famers and it's like that's what I love about"
41:06,620;41:10,220;"this second dynasty is like guys like Dante Hightower and"
41:10,220;41:14,780;"and you know all the guys who are opting out this season"
41:14,780;41:18,780;"Patrick Chung and like there's a few of them who"
41:18,780;41:27,340;"are like the embodiment of the new type of defense that we play in the NFL these days."
41:27,340;41:33,420;"It's like everybody plays basically, basically everybody's playing in nickel and dime almost"
41:33,420;41:38,620;"all the time. First of the linebackers, the defensive line really functions differently now."
41:38,620;41:43,340;"So, you know, everything. It feels like all the different groups are kind of blending into."
41:43,740;42:11,820;"Yeah, and like the best the best like edge rusher in the league is a defensive tackle. Like it's like, it's not he's not even an edge. It's like, it's so it's it's he's just coming in from inside rather than from the outside. But he's like, he's the best at that. So it's like, everybody's so dynamic now that you don't get the sort of beast monster dudes that we used to get and and I don't want them to be forgotten. So,"
42:12,500;42:14,900;"That's my long way of saying I think I'm gonna say Devin McCordy."
42:14,900;42:15,860;"Love it."
42:15,860;42:19,980;"That's like really all I think all three of us have Matt Slater jerseys."
42:19,980;42:20,860;"Right."
42:20,860;42:22,300;"You got to have a Matt Slater jersey."
42:22,300;42:23,580;"Matt Slater is a fucking man."
42:23,580;42:24,260;"Yeah."
42:24,260;42:29,220;"He's probably my like my second, you know, second dynasty."
42:29,220;42:31,860;"He's also I mean, he's going to be a Hall of Famer, which is cool."
42:31,860;42:35,220;"Like, like he'll figure out a way to put him in the Hall of Famer as a special"
42:35,220;42:37,620;"teamer, which is like he deserves that."
42:37,620;42:39,980;"And then him and his dad will both be Hall of Famer's and that's pretty bad."
42:40,820;42:42,700;"Was dad's a Hall of Famer? I didn't realize that."
42:42,700;42:44,500;"Yeah, yeah, his dad was on the ranch."
42:44,500;42:46,260;"He was a Hall of Famer running back to the ranch."
42:46,260;42:47,740;"I didn't realize he was on the Hall of Famer."
42:47,740;42:48,740;"That's awesome."
42:48,740;42:49,500;"Yeah."
42:49,500;42:51,380;"That's a hell of a family, man."
42:51,380;42:53,060;"Imagine being a Matslator's kid."
42:53,060;42:54,100;"That's a lot to live up there."
42:54,100;42:55,140;"We got the brown, Sandy."
42:55,140;42:58,340;"We have you, me, Grant, Troy."
42:58,340;42:59,820;"[LAUGHTER]"
42:59,820;43:01,580;"Matslator's like the total--"
43:01,580;43:04,420;"he's like the total dork of the world."
43:04,420;43:05,420;"Like, you can't--"
43:05,420;43:07,700;"if he wasn't a football player, like,"
43:07,700;43:10,340;"he'd just be like a high school like science teacher."
43:10,340;43:12,980;"Oh yeah, I'm a professor of professor for sure."
43:12,980;43:14,580;"- Yeah, that's what makes him so lovable"
43:14,580;43:18,020;"is that goofy voice and the glasses and like,"
43:18,020;43:20,140;"you know, you guys just put up the video of him"
43:20,140;43:22,980;"when he was a little kid and he's like,"
43:22,980;43:24,820;"he's talking about going to his dad's games."
43:24,820;43:27,180;"It's like him, it's his face,"
43:27,180;43:30,300;"he doesn't age at all, so he still looks like a child."
43:30,300;43:33,340;"- A five year old and he's like five years old"
43:33,340;43:35,940;"and he's got his little glasses on and they're like,"
43:35,940;43:38,540;"""What do you do when your dad plays games or whatever?"""
43:38,540;43:40,640;"And he's like, it is scratchy little voice,"
43:40,640;43:43,280;"which is still scratchy even as a kid."
43:43,280;43:46,120;"Like, I eat a lot of hot dogs."
43:46,120;43:49,280;"And it's like little faces so cute."
43:49,280;43:51,240;"I'll tag you guys in like, I'll find it on the,"
43:51,240;43:52,880;"I'll find it on Twitter and tag you in it."
43:52,880;43:54,920;"It is so cute."
43:54,920;43:59,560;"It's a, like, if you look back on the team right now,"
43:59,560;44:02,040;"there's like, there's the Holy Trinity."
44:02,040;44:06,040;"It's, it's Slater, McCordy and Julian Edelman."
44:06,040;44:06,880;"- Yeah."
44:06,880;44:08,400;"- That's, they're the Holy Trinity on,"
44:08,400;44:12,000;"you know, of this, of this, uh, dynasty because"
44:12,000;44:15,040;"Gronk leaves, I mean, this is outside of Brady Brady doesn't count."
44:15,040;44:16,360;"We don't. Right. Of course. Yeah."
44:16,360;44:17,680;"Right. Right. He's she's wrong."
44:17,680;44:20,680;"Leaves, you know, like any had that off."
44:20,680;44:23,600;"So it's like he doesn't fully fit into the Trinity."
44:23,600;44:28,760;"Yeah. And they all came before him because they were all 2009"
44:28,760;44:29,960;"and then 2010."
44:29,960;44:30,960;"Yeah."
44:30,960;44:33,000;"I'm so sorry. I burned very bright."
44:33,000;44:34,320;"Yeah."
44:34,320;44:36,560;"So how did how did you feel about Brady leaving?"
44:37,760;44:40,840;"- Um, well, I thought it was gonna be like really fucked up"
44:40,840;44:43,160;"over it, but it all happened during like coronavirus"
44:43,160;44:44,600;"when the whole world was falling apart."
44:44,600;44:47,760;"So I feel like it never really fully kicked in."
44:47,760;44:49,920;"And like now I'm just realizing he's on the books"
44:49,920;44:53,040;"with Gronk and I'm like, this whole season's gonna be weird."
44:53,040;44:56,240;"Everybody's getting COVID or opting out because of COVID."
44:56,240;44:57,520;"Everything's totally nuts."
44:57,520;45:00,960;"So like, I don't think it's fully even kicked in."
45:00,960;45:01,800;"- Yeah."
45:01,800;45:04,400;"- Plus I'm excited about Cam Newton."
45:04,400;45:06,720;"- That's, that definitely saw it on the blow."
45:06,720;45:09,640;"I'm still, I think when it happened,"
45:09,640;45:11,200;"we did an emergency podcast."
45:11,200;45:13,000;"And in that podcast, I said,"
45:13,000;45:16,160;"I'm okay with it only because"
45:16,160;45:17,900;"there's not gonna be a season this season."
45:17,900;45:20,920;"So he's never gonna actually play as a buccaneer."
45:20,920;45:22,360;"- That's what I said about Mookie Betts."
45:22,360;45:23,440;"And now look at us."
45:23,440;45:24,280;"- Ah, yeah."
45:24,280;45:27,760;"- He's had to do that, didn't you?"
45:27,760;45:28,600;"- I had, yeah."
45:28,600;45:31,400;"- I gave a pause in the Red Sox for a little bit."
45:31,400;45:32,480;"- Yeah, I can't."
45:32,480;45:33,320;"- That's fair."
45:33,320;45:35,040;"- I tuned in once and like,"
45:35,040;45:39,840;"This isn't worth watching. I'm all done. Yeah, no, it's not and I live in LA"
45:39,840;45:45,680;"And so like I like my so Chris has been trying to like convince me that like I like me and Mookie are still"
45:45,680;45:49,440;"We still have each other because we're both in LA, you know tries to soften the blow"
45:49,440;45:52,640;"But that's not how it works"
45:52,640;45:57,840;"Like no, you see he's happy on his new team. It's not cool. Yeah, I don't like it"
45:57,840;46:00,640;"I guess the thing that's bothering the most is is his fault though"
46:01,200;46:05,340;"Gronk and Brady like posting ship back and forth to each other on Instagram. Yeah, it's so weird. Listen"
46:05,340;46:08,220;"I'm glad you're happy but we're over here sitting in our own houses"
46:08,220;46:12,540;"Rotting away with those boards right and everybody like yeah"
46:12,540;46:17,200;"We have no mooke bets and everybody is leaving is opting out of the Patriots season"
46:17,200;46:21,320;"And you guys are just down in Tampa just fucking around"
46:21,320;46:27,740;"Elevanting you know we say Troy Brown is now part of the Patriots coaching staff. Yeah"
46:29,260;46:36,360;"All is well, I mean we had to lose darn Dante's Garnetcia to win Troy Brown and guess I don't it's a trade-off"
46:36,360;46:39,460;"Brown"
46:39,460;46:41,460;"The next Garnetcia"
46:41,460;46:51,940;"Garnetc you this season is like of all the seasons like I don't know who's gonna step in for Marcus Cannon and"
46:51,940;46:56,220;"It would be nice to have him there to like bring up whoever it is"
46:56,660;47:02,980;"What's exactly what we said last time we retired right yeah, it's like this is not the season for it. No, it's not gonna play"
47:02,980;47:07,180;"No matter. Yeah, so they're all gonna get two years under"
47:07,180;47:14,360;"Where the new offensive line coach is get a chance to gel together no injuries"
47:14,360;47:20,780;"Mommy will never take a snap for the Buccaneers. Mm-hmm. I'm so I'm still holding fast to that"
47:22,780;47:29,780;"You guys can you guys can follow me on this train of thought I have said and I'll say this again the Patriots fans"
47:29,780;47:34,440;"Always get the first and last words on Tom Brady. We write the narrative"
47:34,440;47:40,020;"He's not like him going to the bucks for a year or two years doesn't fucking matter when he goes to the Hall of Fame"
47:40,020;47:42,740;"No one's gonna talk about the bucks fuck all of it"
47:42,740;47:47,820;"Gronks knock it. No, we're not gonna remember any of that shit. It doesn't matter. We get the last word"
47:47,820;47:57,020;"We always will so like enjoy your vacation in Tampa. It's true, but just because of the last 20 years and how"
47:57,020;48:02,860;"Like scripted is felt like a movie scripted. It's been it almost"
48:02,860;48:11,100;"Kind of felt like it should have ended with the Patriots winning one last Super Bowl and Belichick and Brady just running off in the sunset together"
48:11,100;48:16,140;"And the fact that that didn't happen. I'm still kind of coming to terms with I think what if"
48:17,340;48:22,840;"Patriots play the bucks in the Super Bowl. That's still an option. So that was my other take"
48:22,840;48:27,080;"You're really leading right into Andy here. So my take was"
48:27,080;48:33,680;"This was before came Newton, but the Patriots sneak into the newly expanded playoffs"
48:33,680;48:36,180;"The Jared said I'm just managing the team"
48:36,180;48:39,620;"Similarly to the way Brady did no one"
48:39,620;48:42,900;"Sneaking the playoffs get hot at the right time get the Super Bowl"
48:42,900;48:46,740;"They're facing the the newest greatest show on turf"
48:46,740;48:49,340;"in Tom Brady in the bucket areas."
48:49,340;48:50,640;"And Balechek comes out with,"
48:50,640;48:51,540;"because he knows Brady,"
48:51,540;48:54,100;"so he comes out with yet another one of his"
48:54,100;48:57,500;"big game defensive schemes that completely confuses Brady"
48:57,500;48:59,740;"'cause he's the one that knows how to do that."
48:59,740;49:02,220;"And the Patriots win another Super Bowl 24/17"
49:02,220;49:03,660;"all the last second field goal"
49:03,660;49:04,500;"by whoever the kicker is."
49:04,500;49:06,500;"- I didn't realize you had the whole game planned out."
49:06,500;49:07,340;"- Oh yeah."
49:07,340;49:08,180;"Oh yeah."
49:08,180;49:09,100;"- That's the next level."
49:09,100;49:11,380;"- And that's the beginning of the next era"
49:11,380;49:13,060;"of Patriots dominance."
49:13,060;49:14,460;"- Yeah, I mean, listen,"
49:14,460;49:20,220;"just I just would at that point it would be that that's the end point like we have a new"
49:20,220;49:23,420;"Tie the bow they play each other"
49:23,420;49:30,220;"Someone wins and then for the next 10 years people like argue that that person is that Bella check is greater than Brady"
49:30,220;49:36,660;"Or Brady is better than Bella check and we get to stay like our favorite team and our favorite dynasty stays relevant for another decade"
49:36,660;49:43,880;"Basically on that everyone wins. Oh, yeah, well the part I forgot about that is Brady sets all the"
49:43,880;49:48,360;"the regular season records shattering all of Peyton Manning's records"
49:48,360;49:53,000;"throwing for like you know 5500 yards and like 60 touchdowns sort of thing."
49:53,000;49:57,640;"Wow, you went all on it. He's got this all played."
49:57,640;49:59,880;"So that happens. You know when you heard it."
49:59,880;50:04,360;"You take that from old Peyton Manning. He doesn't you know he has so little to go on."
50:04,360;50:07,240;"He didn't even win his own second Super Bowl and you're gonna"
50:07,240;50:12,840;"his fucking records too. Unbelievable. Well actually right now you're taking them"
50:12,840;50:16,440;"from Drew Brees so that's fine because he doesn't deserve them anymore."
50:16,440;50:18,840;"Yeah that's fine I'm I'm sick of Drew Brees."
50:18,840;50:19,840;"Yeah, yeah."
50:19,840;50:23,920;"Alright guys this is a this has been awesome thank you for having me on."
50:23,920;50:26,280;"Yes thanks for thanks for doing this with us."

50:30,480;50:35,480;"good to talk with a couple of Patriots bros I don't get to do that very often so."
50:35,480;50:40,360;"Yeah well you're talking about Troy we say hi and that we love him very very much."
50:40,360;50:43,140;"I know how many of you favorite podcasts buddy."

50:49,140;50:49,980;"I'll find a model."
50:49,980;50:51,580;"- I'm just trying to die happy here."
50:51,580;50:53,100;"(laughing)"
50:53,100;50:55,380;"- If 2020 is the end, you deserve this."
50:55,380;50:56,820;"This is like your makeup."
50:56,820;50:58,740;"- Yes, absolutely."
50:58,740;51:01,420;"All right, well, thank you so much, Tonya."
51:01,420;51:04,260;"And if you ever wanna come back, you're more than welcome."

51:24,980;51:25,980;"(laughing)"
51:25,980;51:29,980;"- We do it for the fans, so we don't get an echo."
51:29,980;51:30,820;"- That's right."
51:30,820;51:34,420;"- But I'm staring Andy in the face right now,"

54:19,720;54:26,920;"I have to say just listening to that collection of voices made me feel like this game was important"
54:26,920;54:32,080;"You know like when they're doing the intro like opener like this is an important game. Oh, yeah"
54:32,080;54:34,080;"The the intro was ridiculous"
54:34,080;54:39,480;"Yeah, it was just like like them hyping up the whole snow"
54:39,480;54:45,600;"I mean obviously that that was like their main focus, but I had written down some notes of things that they"
54:46,600;54:51,320;"images from the, you know, the opening sequences of the game."
54:51,320;54:53,200;"We had it."
54:53,200;54:54,440;"OK, we had"
54:54,440;54:59,320;"Tyla blowing fake snow out of his hands into the camera like a"
54:59,320;55:04,920;"dude, girl. Adam Vina terra wiggling his toes into the camera."
55:04,920;55:08,040;"It's just ridiculous."

55:14,080;55:15,680;"- Lucky's haired, yeah."
55:15,680;55:19,760;"- And then they cut to Susie Colber on the field."
55:19,760;55:23,600;"She said, ""Any talk of the tuck is taboo."""
55:23,600;55:25,760;"Which, nice narration."
55:25,760;55:27,480;"And then like the next sentence"
55:27,480;55:28,600;"when they went back up to the booth,"
55:28,600;55:31,520;"they were like, ""Wouldn't a tuck play early in the game"
55:31,520;55:32,640;"""be interesting?"""
55:32,640;55:35,040;"Is this not that taboo?"
55:35,040;55:38,160;"- Well, I think they were talking about that"
55:38,160;55:40,200;"for like the Oakland Raiders team."
55:40,200;55:41,440;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
55:41,440;55:44,960;"I actually have the Al Davis video here,"
55:44,960;55:49,360;"because it was super fucking sound picture,"
55:49,360;55:51,320;"pictures, pictures, skeleton saying this."
55:51,320;55:53,600;"- There's almost everybody in the world"
55:53,600;55:54,920;"that the play was a fumble."
55:54,920;55:57,320;"It should have been called a fumble"
55:57,320;56:03,160;"that someone would reverse it without conclusive,"
56:03,160;56:08,000;"indisputable visual evidence is just unbelievable."
56:11,080;56:13,320;"But we've got that Michacondal net going on"
56:13,320;56:22,160;"We got Turkey, you know, just kind of hangs below the chin. I bet his astrological sign is Sagittarius"
56:22,160;56:31,040;"Yeah, like him"
56:31,040;56:35,340;"It did look like you can make a really fancy handbag out of his face"
56:38,680;56:43,840;"And it's somehow like improbly his son is like even more ridiculous looking"
56:43,840;56:50,080;"Oh fucking bull haircut. I love it. He's a legend though. Yeah, you can't not love him"
56:50,080;56:54,120;"Yeah, we talked about him with Navi on that Raiders interview. Yeah"
56:54,120;57:01,120;"Yeah, did you hear the quote he came out with earlier? No"
57:01,120;57:05,800;"He was like, you know, I wish we could have been like one of the teams considered for LA"
57:05,800;57:11,220;"But you know in life sometimes just disappointments, but you just you your next day"
57:11,220;57:14,340;"You just go to PF Chang's you have a good meal and then you're over it"
57:14,340;57:22,900;"Dude my work tried to give me a PF Chang's gift card"
57:22,900;57:28,900;"For like having to work so late that I missed the last bus home and they had to like get me a hotel"
57:28,900;57:32,420;"And I gave it back down like I'm not gonna use this you can just"
57:33,660;57:35,660;"I'll go P.F. Chang."
57:35,660;57:37,160;"- That's fantastic. I'm down street from me."
57:37,160;57:38,420;"Although I've never been there."
57:38,420;57:40,520;"- There's not a new Hampshire, just saying."
57:40,520;57:43,740;"- Really? Nice single one?"
57:43,740;57:45,580;"Stat check, I'm stat checking that."
57:45,580;57:47,820;"(laughing)"
57:47,820;57:49,500;"- You guys have Chick-fil-A yet?"
57:49,500;57:50,320;"- Well, you do that."
57:50,320;57:52,780;"I'm gonna talk about the Raiders coach,"
57:52,780;57:56,540;"Navi's favorite head coach of all time, Bill Callahan."
57:56,540;58:02,540;"- Who took over from Chuckie, what the fuck's his name?"
58:02,540;58:05,140;"- John Gruden. - Thank you."
58:05,140;58:09,420;"- I'm in this house. - Hey, alert, alert."
58:09,420;58:11,580;"P.F. Chang's man, just New Hampshire."
58:11,580;58:13,740;"And actually New Hampshire suck it."
58:13,740;58:15,220;"- In the mall?"
58:15,220;58:16,060;"- I don't know."
58:16,060;58:16,900;"Got him."
58:16,900;58:19,620;"- I think I'm gonna stand alone."
58:19,620;58:22,860;"- Plastau, common plaza and offices, dude."
58:22,860;58:23,700;"- Oh, thank God. - Oh, wait."
58:23,700;58:25,380;"That's Chang longs, never mind."
58:25,380;58:28,140;"Ah, you might be right, dude."
58:28,140;58:29,980;"- Oh, good."
58:29,980;58:30,820;"- I'm just on you. - Good to see you."
58:30,820;58:33,940;"You guys have two Chick-fil-A's."
58:33,940;58:36,940;"- Yeah, Chick-fil-A rules."
58:36,940;58:38,140;"You might be right, Andy."
58:38,140;58:43,140;"Yelp is, I'm gonna leave Yelp a bad Yelp review."
58:43,140;58:46,340;"- Right, the most strongly word of the day."
58:46,340;58:47,460;"- Very misleading."
58:47,460;58:52,700;"- Yeah, I don't see any P.F. Chang's closes in Boston."
58:52,700;58:54,980;"- Yeah, I told you."
58:54,980;58:59,980;"- So, speaking of third world country,"
59:00,780;59:03,820;"I was going to say speaking of bad imitations of the real thing."
59:03,820;59:07,180;"Head coach Bill Callahan took over for..."
59:07,180;59:09,500;"Not bad, right? I was pretty good."
59:09,500;59:15,100;"Took over the Raiders for one year and this was peak Raiders time."
59:15,100;59:19,980;"So they would go 11 and 5 this year and win a really tough AFC West."
59:19,980;59:25,740;"And make it all a super bowl where they faced their old coach who was now coaching the Tampa"
59:25,740;59:30,140;"of my Buccaneers and got their doors blown off because they didn't change"
59:30,140;59:33,740;"literally one thing from when John Gruden was coaching them."
59:33,740;59:35,740;"And sabotage."
59:35,740;59:38,220;"They will hear that."
59:38,220;59:40,020;"No, there's players."
59:40,020;59:45,060;"There was players that were insinuating that Bill Callahan intentionally"
59:45,060;59:46,340;"sabotaged that game."
59:46,340;59:47,180;"Why?"
59:47,180;59:49,140;"I don't know."
59:49,140;59:54,020;"The red didn't really explain like, but they were like, because of course,"
59:54,020;59:55,500;"Callahan hates the Raiders."
59:55,500;59:58,300;"For giving him a shot ahead, coaching."
59:58,300;59:59,900;"Yeah, that makes sense."
59:59,900;01:00:01,740;"Well, but then the next season,"
01:00:01,740;01:00:05,580;"there were Charles Woodson was also like talking"
01:00:05,580;01:00:07,380;"out about him in the middle of the season."
01:00:07,380;01:00:08,620;"And this was something to do with like,"
01:00:08,620;01:00:12,540;"he wanted to move to younger players, like a younger core."
01:00:12,540;01:00:16,580;"And they had that old guard of like Jerry Rice, Tim Brown,"
01:00:16,580;01:00:20,900;"Gannon, and like all those guys like really hated Calhand."
01:00:20,900;01:00:24,260;"So I think there was something to play there,"
01:00:24,260;01:00:29,180;"But I'm guessing it's just those guys being bitter and never trying to just say that like tally socks"
01:00:29,180;01:00:34,680;"I would think so and we're in this sabotage Tim Brown said that in the media. He said"
01:00:34,680;01:00:37,180;"sabotage, yeah"
01:00:37,180;01:00:39,620;"What are you gonna say Steve?"
01:00:39,620;01:00:44,460;"They turned over 10 defensive starters all in this game from the ASU Championship game right"
01:00:44,460;01:00:47,740;"Yeah, we're the wild card game like the defense is completely new except for Charles Woodson"
01:00:47,740;01:00:52,100;"Charles Woodson loved Charles Woodson and they were better and actually this was like"
01:00:52,740;01:00:54,900;"They were talking in this game about how"
01:00:54,900;01:01:02,180;"Rich Ganon was like on pace for breaking mario's record for 5,000 yards passing in the season"
01:01:02,180;01:01:05,380;"We obviously didn't do it, but like the offense was"
01:01:05,380;01:01:08,100;"So how many it was rolling yeah?"
01:01:08,100;01:01:16,820;"And then they collapsed this is this was like literally the peak of their Raiders Empire and also the last"
01:01:17,620;01:01:25,020;"peak because they didn't have a winning record or make the playoffs till 2016 so they went to the Super Bowl in 2002"
01:01:25,020;01:01:27,300;"an 11 to 5 record"
01:01:27,300;01:01:35,380;"The year after they went 4 and 12 in 2003 and Kallen got fired right. Hey, how'd you know?"
01:01:35,380;01:01:40,940;"Imagine winning the Super Bowl and two years later you're fired"
01:01:40,940;01:01:45,720;"Or one year later, I guess we have seen him recently though Bill Callahan"
01:01:46,620;01:01:53,100;"Yes, he was the interim head coach of the Redskins right Washington football team. Yes, really?"
01:01:53,100;01:01:55,820;"In 2019. Yeah, he went three and eight"
01:01:55,820;01:01:58,300;"Build it. I think I think"
01:01:58,300;01:02:10,060;"Doesn't matter wasn't here long enough, but I think wasn't he also like some fucking bum"
01:02:10,060;01:02:15,860;"He was the interim coach and he was still being shit on for being too conservative"
01:02:15,860;01:02:21,200;"And everybody's like you're the you're the interim like just fucking"
01:02:21,200;01:02:26,200;"Just go balls to the wall because you may as well and he just wouldn't so he's like running it on"
01:02:26,200;01:02:28,600;"Third and long when you're down 20"
01:02:28,600;01:02:31,780;"Well, what is he's he's still in the NFL now, right?"
01:02:31,780;01:02:38,940;"There's an offensive line coach somewhere. Is he maybe? Yeah, oh line coach Cleveland Browns"
01:02:38,940;01:02:43,900;"Well, so yeah, if I remember correctly"
01:02:43,900;01:02:49,180;"basically Baker Mayfield got absolutely ragdolled last year."
01:02:49,180;01:02:53,300;"So I can't imagine you did that well."
01:02:53,300;01:02:56,260;"Well, was he interim last year at Threadskins?"
01:02:56,260;01:02:57,260;"Right."
01:02:57,260;01:02:58,260;"Yeah."
01:02:58,260;01:03:00,620;"He's probably the reason why he must have just been recently."
01:03:00,620;01:03:01,620;"Okay."
01:03:01,620;01:03:02,620;"Yeah."
01:03:02,620;01:03:03,620;"You're at 2020 present."
01:03:03,620;01:03:07,700;"If you're watching this game, the Raiders offensive line was phenomenal."
01:03:07,700;01:03:08,700;"Yeah."
01:03:08,700;01:03:12,860;"Rich Gannett had as much time as he watched the pro trip ball, which is why he looks so"
01:03:12,860;01:03:18,900;"good in this game. I think another reason might have been one of the other coaches on"
01:03:18,900;01:03:22,580;"the staff. The quarterbacks coach, you may know him Jim Harbaugh."
01:03:22,580;01:03:24,980;"-Harpog. -Harpog."
01:03:24,980;01:03:27,060;"-Really? -Yeah."
01:03:27,060;01:03:30,500;"-Which one's that one? Is that the Ravens coach or the college coach?"
01:03:30,500;01:03:33,900;"-That's the college coach. -I always get them mixed up too."
01:03:33,900;01:03:38,540;"-Oh yeah. Well Jim and John, I mean, that's just shitty parenting."
01:03:38,540;01:03:40,940;"-It's just a dick move from parents there. -That's what I mean."
01:03:40,940;01:03:41,780;"Oh yeah."
01:03:41,780;01:03:44,380;"And they look almost exactly the same too."
01:03:44,380;01:03:45,620;"Yeah."
01:03:45,620;01:03:47,820;"With the chain and the scowl and everything."
01:03:47,820;01:03:49,460;"Which one do you think about it?"
01:03:49,460;01:03:52,620;"I wouldn't put a pass some to change our names later in life"
01:03:52,620;01:03:54,140;"to be more similar."
01:03:54,140;01:03:55,140;"That's true."
01:03:55,140;01:03:58,060;"Which one was the quarterback for the Colts?"
01:03:58,060;01:03:58,900;"Jim."
01:03:58,900;01:03:59,980;"Jim."
01:03:59,980;01:04:03,700;"And that is the NFL one."
01:04:03,700;01:04:05,540;"No, that's the Michigan one."
01:04:05,540;01:04:06,540;"Yeah."
01:04:06,540;01:04:08,140;"[LAUGHS]"
01:04:08,140;01:04:09,220;"This is fucking--"
01:04:09,220;01:04:10,860;"See, this is..."
01:04:10,860;01:04:12,740;"I don't even know if that's true. I may have made that up."
01:04:12,740;01:04:14,220;"It's like twins."
01:04:14,220;01:04:16,220;"They're not twins, are they?"
01:04:16,220;01:04:18,700;"No. Jim Harbaugh was..."
01:04:18,700;01:04:21,460;"I think he's the older brother, and he was the..."
01:04:21,460;01:04:24,660;"He's the one that's coaching Michigan now, and he played for..."
01:04:24,660;01:04:26,500;"mainly the Colts."
01:04:26,500;01:04:27,700;"Got it."
01:04:27,700;01:04:29,500;"Another quarterback."
01:04:29,500;01:04:36,300;"Uh, other coaches on this team you may have heard of Mark Kressman,"
01:04:36,300;01:04:37,580;"the offensive coordinator."
01:04:37,580;01:04:38,380;"Yes."
01:04:38,380;01:04:41,480;"The failed bears had coached from 2013-2014."
01:04:41,480;01:04:43,000;"- Well failed is a strong word."
01:04:43,000;01:04:46,480;"- Also an accurate one."
01:04:46,480;01:04:50,720;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:04:50,720;01:04:52,480;"- Didn't do well."
01:04:52,480;01:04:54,160;"- Yeah, it was pretty bad."
01:04:54,160;01:04:55,000;"- Yeah."
01:04:55,000;01:04:59,480;"- We talked about the players on this team."
01:04:59,480;01:05:04,480;"Like you said, the older core, Rich Ganon, Jerry Rice,"
01:05:04,480;01:05:08,360;"Tim Brown, Ganon Rice were pro ballers."
01:05:08,360;01:05:11,360;"along with Lincoln Kennedy Barrett Robbins"
01:05:11,360;01:05:13,360;"on the off both of those on the off the line."
01:05:13,360;01:05:15,040;"- Barrett Robbins, remember him?"
01:05:15,040;01:05:16,440;"- No."
01:05:16,440;01:05:20,880;"- He was the dude in this Super Bowl that went missing."
01:05:20,880;01:05:21,720;"- Oh, that was him?"
01:05:21,720;01:05:22,560;"- Remember that?"
01:05:22,560;01:05:23,680;"Yeah. - Yeah."
01:05:23,680;01:05:24,520;"- What?"
01:05:24,520;01:05:25,360;"- I don't remember this at all."
01:05:25,360;01:05:28,560;"- Yeah, he was like the starting center, I think."
01:05:28,560;01:05:29,880;"- He was the center."
01:05:29,880;01:05:33,480;"- It was like the day of the game"
01:05:33,480;01:05:34,920;"and no one could find him."
01:05:36,160;01:05:40,920;"It must have been super will have been in San Diego because he was he ended up in Tijuana"
01:05:40,920;01:05:50,320;"Yeah, and he like it turned out it was like all like a he had like some mental issue"
01:05:50,320;01:05:52,320;"I can't remember what it was like maybe"
01:05:52,320;01:05:56,400;"Make depressive or something and like he was like yeah"
01:05:56,400;01:06:00,800;"Yeah, I think probably had something to play into it if they look back on that"
01:06:00,800;01:06:06,640;"But he like he didn't know where he was and shit and then like he just did play the game"
01:06:06,640;01:06:09,200;"and that was part of why they"
01:06:09,200;01:06:13,720;"Like they changed their approach and the Super Bowl"
01:06:13,720;01:06:17,720;"They were gonna I guess they're gonna do like a big run heavy approach against the box"
01:06:17,720;01:06:23,040;"But then I like changed it the last minute to like pass heavy. I think part of it to do it that guy enough showing up"
01:06:23,040;01:06:26,040;"Crazy yeah"
01:06:26,040;01:06:28,600;"Well, I also made the pro ball. What have you showed up to that?"
01:06:30,120;01:06:35,000;"The week it's hard to get lost when you know why you know isn't it just goes from T. Wanna rate the Hawaii"
01:06:35,000;01:06:42,500;"That's a hell of a occasion. Yeah, and then the only other pro bowler on the defense was Rod Woodson"
01:06:42,500;01:06:46,760;"Which rod and charlotte wait Charles Woodson. He was a pro bow yes"
01:06:46,760;01:06:52,000;"No, no, I don't think so. Oh and Rod wise"
01:06:52,000;01:06:55,060;"Yeah, interesting. I know wait"
01:06:56,920;01:06:58,480;"What is in Wikipedia?"
01:06:58,480;01:07:01,960;"Rob Woodson, eight interceptions this year, which is probably why."
01:07:01,960;01:07:02,800;"There's a free safety."
01:07:02,800;01:07:04,120;"That's a ton."
01:07:04,120;01:07:06,440;"I know, but this is just bullshit stat."
01:07:06,440;01:07:07,960;"Yeah."
01:07:07,960;01:07:09,360;"That's like Saks."
01:07:09,360;01:07:11,400;"Another big name on this team."
01:07:11,400;01:07:13,920;"Our favorite, Dickhole."
01:07:13,920;01:07:14,720;"Dickhole."
01:07:14,720;01:07:15,920;"Bill Romanowski, yeah."
01:07:15,920;01:07:16,920;"Oh, oh."
01:07:16,920;01:07:19,520;"I thought you said his name was Dickhole."
01:07:19,520;01:07:23,000;"So I don't know who that is, but yeah, I like him already."
01:07:23,000;01:07:24,520;"No, that's just his adjective."
01:07:24,520;01:07:25,760;"That's his position."
01:07:25,760;01:07:28,240;"I did my bermons for this game."
01:07:28,240;01:07:29,240;"Bermodisms."
01:07:29,240;01:07:30,240;"Oh, thank goodness."
01:07:30,240;01:07:31,240;"Let's hear it."
01:07:31,240;01:07:32,240;"Yeah."
01:07:32,240;01:07:33,240;"Do you want to just jump and do it now?"
01:07:33,240;01:07:35,400;"Yeah, I mean we're talking about play, let's do it."
01:07:35,400;01:07:38,200;"Okay, all right."
01:07:38,200;01:07:41,800;"Some of them are a stretch, but some of them are funny, I think."

01:07:55,720;01:07:57,080;"- I'm getting better as I go."
01:07:57,080;01:08:00,080;"- This one's kind of a stretch."
01:08:00,080;01:08:03,640;"Rich, I have a very important announcement."
01:08:03,640;01:08:04,980;"Gannon ball!"

01:09:47,920;01:09:48,760;"- What was it?"
01:09:48,760;01:09:51,240;"- It was like a jet with like, T.D.s like."
01:09:51,240;01:09:53,160;"- Yeah, that was the worst thing."

01:10:16,360;01:10:20,000;"God knows what he was about to say in the microphone."
01:10:20,000;01:10:23,400;"He's also about how drinking too, so I bet it would have been."

01:10:45,460;01:10:47,940;"Not football, not football, they're just choice quotes."
01:10:47,940;01:10:49,140;"- Choice quotes, okay."
01:10:49,140;01:10:53,940;"- Wait, are they in you, Endo?"
01:10:53,940;01:10:57,020;"- No, they're more--"
01:10:57,020;01:10:58,900;"- I had a problematic one."
01:10:58,900;01:10:59,740;"- Ooh."
01:10:59,740;01:11:01,180;"- Oh, let's go with you as first."
01:11:01,180;01:11:05,340;"- He said it's a Chinese fire drill out there."
01:11:05,340;01:11:09,900;"- Which, what is a Chinese fire drill?"
01:11:09,900;01:11:13,220;"- A Chinese fire drill is when you get to like a stoplight"
01:11:13,220;01:11:16,060;"And everybody gets out of the car and gets into a different"
01:11:16,060;01:11:18,140;"and runs a lap around the car and then gets back in it."
01:11:18,140;01:11:18,660;"Right."
01:11:18,660;01:11:19,980;"To a different seat."
01:11:19,980;01:11:22,380;"What is Chinese about that?"
01:11:22,380;01:11:23,700;"I don't know."
01:11:23,700;01:11:24,820;"Stat check."
01:11:24,820;01:11:25,620;"Oh."
01:11:25,620;01:11:28,460;"Why is it called the Chinese furniture?"
01:11:28,460;01:11:30,620;"Well, my work computer really shouldn't be googly miss."
01:11:30,620;01:11:31,700;"But no, you shouldn't."
01:11:31,700;01:11:34,300;"Is it?"
01:11:34,300;01:11:36,820;"I mean, Chinese checkers, isn't it?"
01:11:36,820;01:11:38,780;"Well, I think that's what's invented in China."
01:11:38,780;01:11:42,020;"I got a question for you guys to tell me if I'm dumb or not."
01:11:42,020;01:11:43,780;"and I miss the joke."
01:11:43,780;01:11:44,620;"- Yes."
01:11:44,620;01:11:45,460;"- Okay."
01:11:45,460;01:11:46,820;"- Well, next question."
01:11:46,820;01:11:49,900;"- So you know the joke,"
01:11:49,900;01:11:52,980;"why did the chicken cross the road, right?"
01:11:52,980;01:11:57,140;"The joke, everyone is, is it a punchline"
01:11:57,140;01:12:00,020;"to get to the other side as in like to die?"
01:12:00,020;01:12:04,900;"- No, I think it's ironic because it's not,"
01:12:04,900;01:12:06,260;"it's not a joke."
01:12:06,260;01:12:07,420;"- Okay, okay, okay."
01:12:07,420;01:12:11,060;"I thought for a second I had been missing the joke"
01:12:11,060;01:12:12,580;"for like 30 years."
01:12:12,580;01:12:13,420;"(laughs)"
01:12:13,420;01:12:14,820;"- I've had that same thoughts on me,"
01:12:14,820;01:12:15,980;"whereas dumb as each other."
01:12:15,980;01:12:17,380;"(laughs)"
01:12:17,380;01:12:18,220;"Yeah."
01:12:18,220;01:12:21,780;"Chinese."
01:12:21,780;01:12:22,740;"- Yeah, I looked it up."
01:12:22,740;01:12:23,580;"- Fire drill."
01:12:23,580;01:12:24,580;"- And?"
01:12:24,580;01:12:25,420;"- It's your friend."
01:12:25,420;01:12:28,740;"- I guess it comes from like a Korean war."
01:12:28,740;01:12:31,180;"Now the British and Chinese had a fire drill."
01:12:31,180;01:12:34,780;"Oh, there's like a British ship, Chinese sailors."
01:12:34,780;01:12:36,020;"And this was to take the water,"
01:12:36,020;01:12:37,540;"like bucket it to the engine room,"
01:12:37,540;01:12:38,980;"and then it's a drill,"
01:12:38,980;01:12:40,980;"so they're near, so it's a bucket it out as well."
01:12:40,980;01:12:46,280;"But they ended up just bucketing water from one side of the ship and running it over to the other side and bucking it out the other side"
01:12:46,280;01:12:55,360;"During like a world war two and the Marine Corps started using it to describe just general confusion about order to do something"
01:12:55,360;01:12:57,860;"Uber"
01:12:57,860;01:13:00,740;"That's similar"
01:13:00,740;01:13:05,240;"I just want to go through bar means Andy fucked up beyond all repair. Yeah"
01:13:07,420;01:13:09,740;"What movies that is it same prayer Ryan?"
01:13:09,740;01:13:15,660;"Probably I think it's probably a few war movies, but yes, yeah"
01:13:15,660;01:13:23,260;"Well, so that was your that was your problematic one apparently it's not that problematic"
01:13:23,260;01:13:26,540;"Maybe it's like I feel like you can't really I"
01:13:26,540;01:13:32,100;"Don't know you might get some others with yeah nationality. Yeah"
01:13:32,100;01:13:36,180;"So mine I believe it was"
01:13:36,180;01:13:40,940;"was Troy Brown actually, our boy, took a shot"
01:13:40,940;01:13:42,140;"to the Twig and Berries."
01:13:42,140;01:13:43,980;"- Oh."
01:13:43,980;01:13:45,780;"- And-- - Oh, I actually saw this."
01:13:45,780;01:13:47,100;"- And one of the announces says,"
01:13:47,100;01:13:49,540;"that's an injury Hallmark doesn't have a card for."
01:13:49,540;01:13:52,140;"(laughing)"
01:13:52,140;01:13:53,380;"- Which I thought was a choice."
01:13:53,380;01:13:54,380;"- I'll try on that one."
01:13:54,380;01:13:55,220;"- It's kind of funny."
01:13:55,220;01:13:56,340;"- It's not bad, right?"
01:13:56,340;01:13:59,460;"- Yeah, if you're like nationally televised,"
01:13:59,460;01:14:00,940;"you gotta be kind of tiptoeing the line."
01:14:00,940;01:14:02,300;"So that's pretty good. - Yeah, that's right up"
01:14:02,300;01:14:03,340;"against it, yeah."
01:14:03,340;01:14:06,140;"- Yeah, that's pretty good for a Sunday night crew."
01:14:06,140;01:14:09,660;"And then we had a referee sighting,"
01:14:09,660;01:14:12,180;"and the quote was, ""Ed joins us directly"
01:14:12,180;01:14:14,420;"from the weight room this evening."""
01:14:14,420;01:14:16,580;"So you can guess which referee that was."
01:14:16,580;01:14:17,660;"- Oh, Ed Hawkely."
01:14:17,660;01:14:20,660;"- Showed off them guns."
01:14:20,660;01:14:27,100;"And then they made a huge deal out of actually interviewing"
01:14:27,100;01:14:30,380;"the kicker before this game."
01:14:30,380;01:14:31,780;"We're talking about how this is the first time"
01:14:31,780;01:14:34,460;"in 18 years we've talked to a kicker."
01:14:34,460;01:14:35,500;"- Cemetery?"
01:14:35,500;01:14:37,620;"- Yeah, because of the snowball kick."
01:14:37,620;01:14:39,140;"- And the kicks, right."
01:14:39,140;01:14:41,740;"- And they basically spent the next five minutes"
01:14:41,740;01:14:44,900;"talking about how kickers weren't football players."
01:14:44,900;01:14:47,620;"- Which is fair, I mean they aren't."
01:14:47,620;01:14:48,860;"- Out of the military was."
01:14:48,860;01:14:51,340;"- Yeah, but dude, if you've gone to like,"
01:14:51,340;01:14:53,900;"you know, like watch Patriots practice,"
01:14:53,900;01:14:57,780;"the kickers literally do nothing all day."
01:14:57,780;01:14:59,620;"- They learn how to bounce a football"
01:14:59,620;01:15:00,940;"so it'll bounce right back up to them."
01:15:00,940;01:15:03,100;"- Exactly, I know, it's pretty fucking cool."
01:15:03,100;01:15:03,940;"- But it's pretty fucking cool."
01:15:03,940;01:15:07,740;"that because they're so fucking bored because you're not doing anything."
01:15:07,740;01:15:12,500;"You think especially nowadays with how like how much more often I feel like"
01:15:12,500;01:15:16,860;"kickers miss they'd practice a little bit more instead of just standing around"
01:15:16,860;01:15:21,620;"doing that. You mean practice kicking? Yeah. Yeah. It's your job right? I don't know."
01:15:21,620;01:15:26,820;"Like can you over get any better though? It's all muscle memory right? I feel like"
01:15:26,820;01:15:32,140;"the more muscle memory you have the more accurate you're gonna be. I've been"
01:15:32,140;01:15:36,140;"playing a lot of golf and I've been getting like a lot worse."
01:15:36,140;01:15:39,420;"Yeah, there's a how much golf to Tiger Woods play."
01:15:39,420;01:15:41,940;"There's this Asian guy that was leading after two days."
01:15:41,940;01:15:45,740;"And after his second round, he went and practiced for six hours."
01:15:45,740;01:15:49,500;"Whoops. After he just played three days of golf."
01:15:49,500;01:15:50,460;"That's what I mean."
01:15:50,460;01:15:51,460;"Sucked."
01:15:51,460;01:15:52,460;"Yeah."
01:15:52,460;01:15:55,500;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:15:55,500;01:15:58,940;"Sometimes I guess it depends on what works for certain people, right?"
01:15:58,940;01:16:01,380;"Maybe just mental stuff to maybe it's not even physical."
01:16:01,380;01:16:05,080;"Isn't there, is there like a 10,000 hours?"
01:16:05,080;01:16:05,920;"Yeah, apparently."
01:16:05,920;01:16:07,200;"We'll have to learn anything."
01:16:07,200;01:16:08,240;"Yeah, I think it is."
01:16:08,240;01:16:09,140;"Yeah, to be good at it."
01:16:09,140;01:16:09,640;"It's a master."
01:16:09,640;01:16:11,240;"It's put in 10,000 hours."
01:16:11,240;01:16:12,080;"But apparently, that's bullshit."
01:16:12,080;01:16:14,040;"It's also Justin Bieber song."
01:16:14,040;01:16:16,920;"Apparently, according to Google.com."
01:16:16,920;01:16:18,280;"Cool."
01:16:18,280;01:16:21,200;"I have something else the commentator said, which I don't"
01:16:21,200;01:16:23,800;"fault them for, and they're right in now."
01:16:23,800;01:16:26,760;"But looking back, it's hilarious."
01:16:26,760;01:16:29,000;"It was at the end of the game that they'd already"
01:16:29,000;01:16:30,600;"chalked up to Patriots loss."
01:16:30,600;01:16:31,260;"Right."
01:16:31,260;01:16:34,040;"And they're like, well, you want parity?"
01:16:34,040;01:16:36,380;"You got parity and they're on the A.S.E."
01:16:36,380;01:16:37,040;"standings."
01:16:37,040;01:16:39,860;"That's awesome."
01:16:39,860;01:16:41,780;"This would be the last year that you could set."
01:16:41,780;01:16:44,060;"Literally this season only."
01:16:44,060;01:16:44,620;"Yeah."
01:16:44,620;01:16:48,860;"Well, spoiler alert, they do finish."
01:16:48,860;01:16:51,440;"Like, isn't it like three teams, eight, eight and eight or"
01:16:51,440;01:16:53,420;"seven or nine and six, nine, seven, seven."
01:16:53,420;01:16:53,620;"Yeah."
01:16:53,620;01:16:53,960;"Yeah."
01:16:53,960;01:16:55,260;"Yeah, we'll get there."
01:16:55,260;01:16:56,300;"Let's, yeah."
01:16:57,140;01:16:57,820;"We'll cut that."
01:16:57,820;01:16:59,780;"We don't want to spoil the rest of the season."
01:16:59,780;01:17:02,540;"I think we already have for our fans."
01:17:02,540;01:17:04,340;"We went in depth about how"
01:17:04,340;01:17:07,140;"Brett Favre lost the season already for us."
01:17:07,140;01:17:08,500;"Fuck."
01:17:08,500;01:17:10,260;"Right."
01:17:10,260;01:17:13,220;"And Greg, you missed talking to Tanya."
01:17:13,220;01:17:15,060;"We had a big old Brett Favre fest."
01:17:15,060;01:17:15,740;"The hate fest."
01:17:15,740;01:17:17,660;"Yeah, she didn't like she didn't like Brett Favre."
01:17:17,660;01:17:18,500;"Hate them."
01:17:18,500;01:17:19,500;"Why?"
01:17:19,500;01:17:22,580;"Steve, you see what it does."
01:17:22,580;01:17:25,100;"Don't."
01:17:25,100;01:17:25,740;"What?"
01:17:25,740;01:17:32,160;"You guys hate him because like for various reasons one I think Andy you thought he was just like not as good as"
01:17:32,160;01:17:35,760;"He really yes was made out to be in Steve"
01:17:35,760;01:17:40,540;"You know like him because the commentators would blow his medium-sized penis. I was the term"
01:17:40,540;01:17:43,820;"I'm about to say cock, but yeah"
01:17:43,820;01:17:46,580;"But yeah, the time you actually pointed out that"
01:17:46,580;01:17:51,580;"Brett far of actually admitted to not knowing what a nickel defense was"
01:17:52,420;01:17:53,740;"- Could not read a defense."
01:17:53,740;01:17:55,060;"- Makes him better."
01:17:55,060;01:17:56,300;"- No."
01:17:56,300;01:17:58,220;"- Just think about how good he could have been."
01:17:58,220;01:17:59,060;"- Fucking moron."
01:17:59,060;01:18:02,060;"- If he had like tried."
01:18:02,060;01:18:03,180;"- moron."
01:18:03,180;01:18:05,260;"- But he's just like you and I,"
01:18:05,260;01:18:08,020;"so he doesn't give a shit about anything."
01:18:08,020;01:18:10,600;"- He's like a donkey in a pair of fucking"
01:18:10,600;01:18:12,380;"relaxed fit Wranglers."
01:18:12,380;01:18:15,780;"- Real comfortable interceptions."
01:18:15,780;01:18:21,340;"- Real comfortable Percocets."
01:18:21,340;01:18:23,600;"(laughing)"
01:18:23,600;01:18:27,040;"- Yeah, she agreed fully well."
01:18:27,040;01:18:29,360;"So now you're out voted three to one, so."
01:18:29,360;01:18:30,200;"- Well."
01:18:30,200;01:18:31,040;"- You need a dick."
01:18:31,040;01:18:32,840;"- Just let me go find John Gerudin."
01:18:32,840;01:18:34,280;"I bet he likes Brad Farf."
01:18:34,280;01:18:35,280;"(laughing)"
01:18:35,280;01:18:37,180;"He's an absolute specimen."
01:18:37,180;01:18:40,120;"- That's who you want on your side, Jimmy."
01:18:40,120;01:18:43,680;"- John Gerudin, QB camp, Brad Farf would be a fool."
01:18:43,680;01:18:45,680;"- Oh, there'd be no pants on by the end of that."
01:18:45,680;01:18:47,000;"- Yeah, you go with them."
01:18:47,000;01:18:47,840;"- Imagine."
01:18:47,840;01:18:51,240;"By the end of it, they're just both completely"
01:18:51,240;01:18:52,240;"good."
01:18:52,240;01:18:55,240;"He just threw his thumb up his ass."
01:18:55,240;01:18:58,240;"He's just wet."
01:18:58,240;01:19:06,240;"Give me that medium sized kick."
01:19:06,240;01:19:13,240;"It's working himself to a lather."
01:19:13,240;01:19:18,240;"Speaking of lathers, the commentators also mentioned that, remember we talked about Tommy"
01:19:18,240;01:19:19,880;"Maddox back in week one?"
01:19:19,880;01:19:21,720;"- Yes, love Tommy Maddox."
01:19:21,720;01:19:23,400;"- The backup for the Steelers."
01:19:23,400;01:19:24,640;"- The Mad Dog."
01:19:24,640;01:19:28,080;"- Yeah, he would come in and throw for a Steelers record"
01:19:28,080;01:19:32,080;"for passing yards in a tie against the Falcons"
01:19:32,080;01:19:34,620;"and the next week he got paralyzed briefly."
01:19:34,620;01:19:36,920;"They mentioned that on his broadcast,"
01:19:36,920;01:19:38,920;"so this is the week that he got paralyzed."
01:19:38,920;01:19:40,960;"All over the season, hell of a season."
01:19:40,960;01:19:42,200;"- This is the week, huh?"
01:19:42,200;01:19:43,440;"- Mm-hmm."
01:19:43,440;01:19:44,280;"- That's crazy."
01:19:44,280;01:19:45,360;"- Yeah, wishing him well."
01:19:45,360;01:19:47,240;"- Did he ever play again?"
01:19:47,240;01:19:48,600;"- He played again this season."
01:19:48,600;01:19:49,600;"- Okay."
01:19:49,600;01:19:50,100;"Yeah."
01:19:50,100;01:19:55,380;"But yeah, so he had to hell the--"
01:19:55,380;01:19:58,240;"and up and down rollercoaster season this season."
01:19:58,240;01:20:00,840;"I feel like the Steelers have always"
01:20:00,840;01:20:03,760;"had those like back up, random ass backup quarterbacks,"
01:20:03,760;01:20:04,840;"aren't you?"
01:20:04,840;01:20:05,760;"Like who?"
01:20:05,760;01:20:06,760;"Charlie Batch."
01:20:06,760;01:20:10,520;"Yeah, Charlie Batch, Chaz Batch, Tom Maddox."
01:20:10,520;01:20:12,120;"Fucking-- what was it going to just hear?"
01:20:12,120;01:20:13,120;"Dock fodges."
01:20:13,120;01:20:14,320;"True, yeah."
01:20:14,320;01:20:17,320;"Like, they're always like just these generic looking,"
01:20:17,320;01:20:20,320;"but like all areas named caricature guys."
01:20:20,320;01:20:22,600;"And I remember."
01:20:22,600;01:20:26,080;"Yeah, and I remember particularly good, but my college roommate, Joey"
01:20:26,080;01:20:30,560;"Bear, we were watching a Pittsburgh steel is like Monday night game together."
01:20:30,560;01:20:36,160;"And Ross was going down to Charlie Batch came in and he said, if Charlie"
01:20:36,160;01:20:39,040;"Batch wins this game for the Steelers, I'm going to buy a Charlie Batch Jersey."
01:20:39,040;01:20:44,520;"And long story short, he now wants to Charlie Batch."
01:20:44,520;01:20:45,720;"- I just showed you."
01:20:45,720;01:20:47,480;"(laughing)"
01:20:47,480;01:20:50,760;"- Would it be sick to get one that just said Chaz back?"
01:20:50,760;01:20:51,600;"- Chaz back?"
01:20:51,600;01:20:52,880;"Like if you get the full name?"
01:20:52,880;01:20:54,720;"- Was he the Lions guy?"
01:20:54,720;01:20:56,280;"- Yeah, he was."
01:20:56,280;01:20:57,120;"- Do you want me to look up to his career?"
01:20:57,120;01:20:58,960;"- draft pick, I think."
01:20:58,960;01:21:00,880;"- Yeah, I think he was, yeah."
01:21:00,880;01:21:02,120;"What kind of a higher draft pick?"
01:21:02,120;01:21:03,200;"- Yeah."
01:21:03,200;01:21:05,160;"- Like most Steelers backups."
01:21:05,160;01:21:07,360;"- He went to Eastern Michigan."
01:21:07,360;01:21:08,800;"- Okay."
01:21:08,800;01:21:12,640;"- He was the second round pick in the 1998 draft,"
01:21:12,640;01:21:18,240;"played three years with Detroit and then 10 years with Steelers."
01:21:18,240;01:21:19,200;"- TOW."
01:21:19,200;01:21:20,200;"Holy shit."
01:21:20,200;01:21:21,360;"- Yeah."
01:21:21,360;01:21:24,400;"- He's like an off-brand Tom Brady."
01:21:24,400;01:21:25,920;"- Yeah, so he was a local guy."
01:21:25,920;01:21:30,920;"He was, I think he was from the Detroit area,"
01:21:30,920;01:21:35,280;"went to Eastern Michigan, got drafted by Detroit."
01:21:35,280;01:21:38,280;"- And then spent the rest of his--"
01:21:38,280;01:21:39,960;"- Probably sucked dick, yeah."
01:21:39,960;01:21:41,600;"- Yeah, I'm like he's very good."
01:21:41,600;01:22:04,600;"I'm poor Detroit. We'll get there though. I can't wait for the Detroit episode. Speaking of tucking your sack though, my favorite sign in this game was the side like there were some a lot of you know it was a fumble sign and all that bullshit. Oh yeah, but my favorite one was decided two words tuck this."
01:22:04,600;01:22:06,600;"That's so Oakland."
01:22:06,600;01:22:08,600;"Fucking amazing."
01:22:08,600;01:22:15,660;"Dude, I was like, I was like, go go around Wikipedia and stuff and, um, like, they were"
01:22:15,660;01:22:20,640;"talking about the stadium and you know it's such a shady stadium when it's not even a"
01:22:20,640;01:22:21,640;"hyperlink."
01:22:21,640;01:22:24,640;"Like the name of the stadium wasn't hyperlink."
01:22:24,640;01:22:26,840;"It doesn't have a Wikipedia page."
01:22:26,840;01:22:28,160;"That's how shitty it is."
01:22:28,160;01:22:29,160;"That's not good."
01:22:29,160;01:22:34,200;"You would think it would with all the shit that goes on there."
01:22:34,200;01:22:37,440;"I probably just thought it was funny reading that."
01:22:37,440;01:22:41,400;"Should we talk about this game?"
01:22:41,400;01:22:44,200;"Because I'm going to admit something here."
01:22:44,200;01:22:47,520;"I watched the first half like a week ago,"
01:22:47,520;01:22:49,960;"because we skipped a week where it was supposed to record and we didn't."
01:22:49,960;01:22:54,640;"And I was fully just like going to accept the fact that I wasn't going to watch"
01:22:54,640;01:22:58,480;"the second half because setting all this up, I know what the end result is going to be."
01:22:58,480;01:23:02,760;"And I knew how this game ended and I watched first half and I'm like,"
01:23:03,560;01:23:05,480;"The second half is going to be fucking useless."
01:23:05,480;01:23:08,680;"But I watched it today and it was worth watching."
01:23:08,680;01:23:09,640;"It was good."
01:23:09,640;01:23:10,200;"Second half."
01:23:10,200;01:23:10,760;"Yeah."
01:23:10,760;01:23:15,280;"So I think we actually didn't do a Lombardi watchability score."
01:23:15,280;01:23:16,440;"OK."
01:23:16,440;01:23:18,040;"So I'm going to give it."
01:23:18,040;01:23:25,400;"I'm going to give it three out of six Lombardis just for watching, like just"
01:23:25,400;01:23:27,000;"for the second half, like skip the first half completely."
01:23:27,000;01:23:27,560;"Just fuck that."
01:23:27,560;01:23:33,400;"But I'm also going to give it a"
01:23:33,400;01:23:41,760;"three and I'm basing this on the fact there's two two factors here one they"
01:23:41,760;01:23:45,940;"lost so as you get to some stars off there and then I actually watched the"
01:23:45,940;01:23:50,620;"first ten minutes of it and like this Sunday night feel was kind of cool like"
01:23:50,620;01:23:56,260;"the commentators it was it had a special feel moment to it yeah I think this is"
01:23:56,260;01:24:00,760;"like a game you could tell it was like a hyped up game oh yeah and and honestly"
01:24:00,760;01:24:02,760;"hearing crowds."
01:24:02,760;01:24:07,860;"I mean, a lot of nostalgia because I've been watching sports now with no fans."
01:24:07,860;01:24:10,160;"Yes, really is not the same."
01:24:10,160;01:24:12,860;"Yeah, I watch the Bruins playoff game yesterday."
01:24:12,860;01:24:17,260;"playoff hockey is only good because the fans on the playoffs are."
01:24:17,260;01:24:20,660;"And I go get scored and you just hear like the six guys on the ice."
01:24:20,660;01:24:25,760;"Yeah, it's honestly, if this was forever, I'd probably stop watching sports."
01:24:25,760;01:24:27,560;"Yeah, I agree."
01:24:27,560;01:24:30,460;"I'll hang in there because I know fans will be back eventually, but."
01:24:30,660;01:24:34,200;"Well, if it's forever, they'll figure out how to pipe fans and I guarantee you that."
01:24:34,200;01:24:34,760;"I know."
01:24:34,760;01:24:35,960;"And be able to not say."
01:24:35,960;01:24:41,600;"I noticed that the video quality was much improved too."
01:24:41,600;01:24:42,720;"Really?"
01:24:42,720;01:24:43,560;"I thought the opposite."
01:24:43,560;01:24:46,360;"The sky cam."
01:24:46,360;01:24:47,680;"They did have the sky cam."
01:24:47,680;01:24:48,200;"That was cool."
01:24:48,200;01:24:48,520;"Yeah."
01:24:48,520;01:24:49,880;"It was beautiful."
01:24:49,880;01:24:55,120;"Yeah, not HD, but it wasn't like original D."
01:24:55,120;01:24:57,480;"It was somewhere in the mass original."
01:24:57,480;01:24:58,440;"It was a big."
01:24:58,440;01:25:00,400;"They call it Greg in high school."
01:25:00,400;01:25:09,240;"It was like I was trying to pull highlights from it today and like the talk about the"
01:25:09,240;01:25:10,240;"Bruce game."
01:25:10,240;01:25:17,840;"Yeah, talk about the game and the Bruce key interception was hard to see in real time."
01:25:17,840;01:25:20,360;"So I say we skip talking about the first half first half."
01:25:20,360;01:25:24,560;"Okay, I'm gonna give it to well, let's to two out of six."
01:25:24,560;01:25:29,880;"Yeah, I watched it when Andy washes our shuffle game and like half of my notes don't make"
01:25:29,880;01:25:33,080;"sense because I totally forgot this game again in like a week."
01:25:33,080;01:25:34,960;"Why'd you guys watch it so early?"
01:25:34,960;01:25:37,800;"Cause I thought we were going to record last week or so."
01:25:37,800;01:25:41,520;"But you were going and then somebody bailed it was me."
01:25:41,520;01:25:46,840;"Such a ruiner."
01:25:46,840;01:25:47,360;"Yeah."
01:25:47,360;01:25:47,760;"Yeah."
01:25:47,760;01:25:51,200;"So actually I would say just."
01:25:51,200;01:25:55,840;"Yeah, I would watch the end of the third."
01:25:55,840;01:25:59,120;"So let's give them an update on the first half though, right?"
01:25:59,280;01:26:05,080;"All right, so first half, um, it's basically the Raiders are out for blood."
01:26:05,080;01:26:10,680;"Patriots came to anything right and it's 17, six Raiders going into halftime."
01:26:10,680;01:26:13,360;"Rich, can I throw it all over the park?"
01:26:13,360;01:26:13,840;"Yeah."
01:26:13,840;01:26:17,440;"And then the Patriots, Jan Kowski just thumping."
01:26:17,440;01:26:21,320;"Brady missed three patent touchdowns."
01:26:21,320;01:26:21,680;"Yeah."
01:26:21,680;01:26:25,880;"Like deep, deep bombs, a wide open David Patton missed a missed one by a half"
01:26:25,880;01:26:28,200;"if you are missing another by like five yards,"
01:26:28,200;01:26:29,840;"like just couldn't hit that deep ball."
01:26:29,840;01:26:31,160;"Otherwise it was a little bit different."
01:26:31,160;01:26:32,000;"- Wide open, yep."
01:26:32,000;01:26:33,560;"- Oh, I was the defense player."
01:26:33,560;01:26:35,760;"- They were hanging in there."
01:26:35,760;01:26:37,760;"- They were giving up a lot of short passes,"
01:26:37,760;01:26:40,560;"so the Raiders were able to stay on the field."
01:26:40,560;01:26:41,400;"- Yeah."
01:26:41,400;01:26:42,320;"- And they couldn't stop the short run,"
01:26:42,320;01:26:44,240;"so the Raiders would just drive down the field"
01:26:44,240;01:26:46,440;"with short passes and then just run it down"
01:26:46,440;01:26:48,000;"to the throats to score the touchdown."
01:26:48,000;01:26:48,840;"- This looked like a--"
01:26:48,840;01:26:49,960;"- That crocken had a couple."
01:26:49,960;01:26:51,760;"- Yeah, from the bits I watched,"
01:26:51,760;01:26:53,880;"this looked like an offense that was like,"
01:26:53,880;01:26:55,920;"that knew each other's rhythms."
01:26:55,920;01:26:59,200;"You know, like the, I mean, the Tim Brown, Jerry Rice,"
01:26:59,200;01:27:00,520;"the Rich Gannon."
01:27:00,520;01:27:02,160;"So it's like these all these veterans"
01:27:02,160;01:27:05,000;"that know what everyone's supposed to do"
01:27:05,000;01:27:07,040;"and they just go out, do it."
01:27:07,040;01:27:07,880;"- Yeah."
01:27:07,880;01:27:08,720;"And speaking of Rich Gannon,"
01:27:08,720;01:27:10,080;"even if you play like decent defense,"
01:27:10,080;01:27:11,960;"they can still like take and tacky to death."
01:27:11,960;01:27:12,800;"- Yeah."
01:27:12,800;01:27:15,200;"And Rich Gannon was definitely like in complete control of this."
01:27:15,200;01:27:16,040;"- Yeah."
01:27:16,040;01:27:17,480;"- He was, they actually showed a clip"
01:27:17,480;01:27:19,800;"where he was yelling at the sidelines"
01:27:19,800;01:27:21,080;"because they tried to make a substitution."
01:27:21,080;01:27:23,400;"He basically told them, no, set the guy back out,"
01:27:23,400;01:27:25,640;"brought his own guys in and it ran his own play."
01:27:25,640;01:27:29,200;"So there's a few of those."
01:27:29,200;01:27:30,960;"- He's a handful that rich."
01:27:30,960;01:27:33,360;"- He was, he was kind of a loose-"
01:27:33,360;01:27:34,520;"- Kind of a loose-"
01:27:34,520;01:27:35,440;"- Loose-gan and-"
01:27:35,440;01:27:37,320;"- Oh, that's better, that's better."
01:27:37,320;01:27:40,360;"- This is more of a hand-pulled him by five."
01:27:40,360;01:27:42,620;"(laughing)"
01:27:42,620;01:27:45,600;"I don't know how smart is he."
01:27:45,600;01:27:48,400;"- It seems pretty dumb."
01:27:48,400;01:27:51,320;"- You should just smell the voicemail"
01:27:51,320;01:27:56,360;"the Brett farm left to yeah we never really covered that and that package that I know"
01:27:56,360;01:28:03,020;"no no it's hilarious maybe we'll do that hey you know if you if you want to come"
01:28:03,020;01:28:09,320;"over to my hotel room you can but if not it's okay you know I saw you in the"
01:28:09,320;01:28:14,360;"hallway today and I just thought maybe we should want to come over that's really"
01:28:14,360;01:28:18,160;"kind of pressing. Yeah. Oh, by the way, here's a picture of my"
01:28:18,160;01:28:23,600;"day. Got to make it funny, right, Greg? Yeah, exactly."
01:28:23,600;01:28:30,560;"humor. But how about how about Jerry Rice this season? 1000"
01:28:30,560;01:28:33,520;"yards, dude. I looked up his stats like nine, two catches like"
01:28:33,520;01:28:38,240;"1200 yards. Nine touchdowns like I didn't realize he was that"
01:28:38,240;01:28:41,840;"big of a factor for the Raiders. Yeah, I thought that"
01:28:41,840;01:28:42,900;"- I guess Snowball upset."
01:28:42,900;01:28:44,340;"I didn't know he was good again."
01:28:44,340;01:28:46,180;"That was for 49ers."
01:28:46,180;01:28:47,020;"- Oh yeah."
01:28:47,020;01:28:52,580;"Well, he has the most receiving yards after the age of 40"
01:28:52,580;01:28:55,020;"out of anybody in the history of NFL."
01:28:55,020;01:28:56,420;"Can you guess who's second?"
01:28:56,420;01:28:57,420;"- Tom Brady."
01:28:57,420;01:28:58,260;"- Yeah."
01:28:58,260;01:29:00,180;"- Would like Tucker to let up their yards."
01:29:00,180;01:29:01,300;"- Yeah."
01:29:01,300;01:29:03,780;"And then everybody else in the NFL"
01:29:03,780;01:29:05,940;"was zero and Brett Farr with minus seven."
01:29:05,940;01:29:08,300;"(laughing)"
01:29:08,300;01:29:09,780;"- Brett Farr with minus seven."
01:29:09,780;01:29:16,500;"I do have minus seven receiving arts. I asked the same question. So I looked it up Betty. I bet he I bet he had a ball bad"
01:29:16,500;01:29:21,860;"At any caught it exactly and I got sacked. That's such a Brett far thing to do to catch his own pass"
01:29:21,860;01:29:26,780;"The ball thing is gonna make a play and then immediately get sacked for sure. What what a Brady do. What does Brady do?"
01:29:26,780;01:29:31,780;"That's it down on the ground. It's just straight down. Yeah, fuck that. No, I see it"
01:29:31,780;01:29:36,860;"So but yeah, so did"
01:29:36,860;01:29:39,700;"Jerry Rice's career"
01:29:39,700;01:29:41,300;"Such insanity."
01:29:41,300;01:29:43,460;"I'm looking at his stats right now."
01:29:43,460;01:29:49,640;"So remember how like we would give people a bunch of shit, but then we get to know"
01:29:49,640;01:29:51,340;"and better and we're like, actually, we kind of like the guy."
01:29:51,340;01:29:51,860;"Yeah."
01:29:51,860;01:29:53,600;"I've gotten the opposite way of Jerry Rice."
01:29:53,600;01:29:54,420;"You used to love him."
01:29:54,420;01:29:55,540;"Tell me why."
01:29:55,540;01:29:57,660;"And now like the whole."
01:29:57,660;01:29:59,300;"He's a deflate gate truth."
01:29:59,300;01:29:59,780;"Yeah."
01:29:59,780;01:30:03,180;"Like how hard he went on the Patriots and all these like cheating things."
01:30:03,180;01:30:05,140;"Didn't he cry on national TV about it?"
01:30:05,140;01:30:07,460;"No, that was weepy, Bernal."
01:30:07,460;01:30:08,020;"Yeah."
01:30:08,060;01:30:12,540;"But then it came out that he used to stick him."
01:30:12,540;01:30:13,940;"He was like, oh, what everybody was doing."
01:30:13,940;01:30:15,620;"It's like, yeah, wait, me like the flight gate,"
01:30:15,620;01:30:19,620;"that sort of thing, except like you actually gained"
01:30:19,620;01:30:22,460;"a competitive advantage over the people that were using it."
01:30:22,460;01:30:25,900;"So when did you play the 49ers?"
01:30:25,900;01:30:27,300;"We'll get Jeff Carr on here."
01:30:27,300;01:30:30,380;"- Did you ever really like Jerry Rice"
01:30:30,380;01:30:32,020;"because of his personality though?"
01:30:32,020;01:30:35,100;"- I didn't know his personality until he stopped playing"
01:30:35,100;01:30:36,220;"football."
01:30:36,220;01:30:37,060;"- Yeah."
01:30:37,060;01:30:41,380;"mega did you like Dave mega first personality well that's pretty"
01:30:41,380;01:30:47,620;"different Andy I just read that article today that you wrote I liked pretty I"
01:30:47,620;01:30:51,380;"thought Jerry Rice was like an unassuming superstar though right yeah but it was"
01:30:51,380;01:30:56,700;"like kind of like a diva receiver yeah stereotype diva receive but he's kind"
01:30:56,700;01:31:03,020;"of like a yeah like a grandiose dick a good good I don't know I think part of"
01:31:03,020;01:31:08,620;"it is your bias because you don't you don't like people that are critical of the Patriots."
01:31:08,620;01:31:12,940;"Yeah, I don't like people that I'm truth is about like being an anti-patriot."
01:31:12,940;01:31:16,700;"Like you can be anti-patriot all you want and that's fine."
01:31:16,700;01:31:20,860;"Here's an is T.O. and Jerry Rice you know while they're playing I like Jerry Rice more than T.O."
01:31:20,860;01:31:23,340;"Now they're not playing I like T.O. more than Jerry Rice."
01:31:23,340;01:31:26,780;"Yeah. Because Jerry Rice is a fucking-"
01:31:26,780;01:31:31,900;"I like Michael Urban. He's pretty anti-patriot. Like he doesn't he's not a huge fan of him but he"
01:31:31,900;01:31:36,300;"He doesn't like, like he will accept how good they've been."
01:31:36,300;01:31:41,500;"And so I'm a fan of his, even though we don't agree on liking the Patriots."
01:31:41,500;01:31:43,600;"I think you watch too much ESPN."
01:31:43,600;01:31:46,180;"I don't watch any ESPN."
01:31:46,180;01:31:52,260;"Then how do you even know, like maybe that's that, uh, Jerry Rice, like actually likes"
01:31:52,260;01:31:53,260;"the Patriots in respects."
01:31:53,260;01:31:55,380;"I'm just one clip that you heard of him."
01:31:55,380;01:31:57,180;"How do I know it's my job to know, Greg?"
01:31:57,180;01:31:58,180;"That's what I do."
01:31:58,180;01:32:01,100;"This is your full time job."
01:32:01,100;01:32:03,100;"Feels like that sometimes."
01:32:03,100;01:32:08,620;"That makes a lot more sense because I did have"
01:32:08,620;01:32:11,500;"Now you know I hate commentators"
01:32:11,500;01:32:20,700;"I had a jerry rice poster remember that one we had I think just doing it alone and a jerry rice poster until recently"
01:32:20,700;01:32:23,420;"Wait, it was the was it the Nike one?"
01:32:23,420;01:32:28,940;"No, it was like 49ers days one was a Nike one true blood zone"
01:32:29,660;01:32:35,860;"another one where he's like, he's walking to the end zone at the bottom and the whole crowd is going at this is just do it."
01:32:35,860;01:32:46,100;"And then like I just realized like when I grew up that I had a Nike advertisement on my wall for like 10 years."
01:32:46,100;01:32:48,620;"It's like what an asshole was."
01:32:48,620;01:32:53,020;"They really fell into their trap."
01:32:53,020;01:32:54,460;"You know, I've probably got to be fair."
01:32:54,460;01:32:55,980;"They got a nice book club."
01:32:55,980;01:32:56,740;"Yeah."
01:32:56,740;01:32:57,980;"They got a nice trap."
01:32:57,980;01:32:58,740;"Yeah."
01:32:58,900;01:32:59,740;"- That's true."
01:32:59,740;01:33:01,100;"- That's a good job for shit."
01:33:01,100;01:33:03,660;"- Yeah, I also like just like took advantage"
01:33:03,660;01:33:06,060;"of all those free energy drinks they gave us in college"
01:33:06,060;01:33:08,100;"and was like, wait, this is free?"
01:33:08,100;01:33:09,500;"- I'll never get addicted."
01:33:09,500;01:33:12,420;"(laughing)"
01:33:12,420;01:33:13,900;"- And now you do cocaine."
01:33:13,900;01:33:16,140;"(laughing)"
01:33:16,140;01:33:17,700;"- That thing better means, why not?"
01:33:17,700;01:33:21,020;"- Shit."
01:33:21,020;01:33:25,820;"I'll be tired tomorrow, but I'll just drink some energy drink."
01:33:25,820;01:33:27,660;"(laughing)"
01:33:27,660;01:33:28,980;"It's the perfect system."
01:33:28,980;01:33:30,460;"(laughs)"
01:33:30,460;01:33:31,660;"Speaking of perfect systems,"
01:33:31,660;01:33:35,180;"the first drive of the second half"
01:33:35,180;01:33:39,300;"the Raiders who got the ball and went"
01:33:39,300;01:33:46,780;"15 plays 85 yards in nine minutes and 52 seconds."
01:33:46,780;01:33:50,580;"That ended with Zach Crockett"
01:33:50,580;01:33:52,100;"touched down right at the gut again."
01:33:52,100;01:33:55,060;"- Walking. - One or two yards out, yeah."
01:33:55,060;01:33:56,980;"And that was the backbreaker, I think."
01:33:56,980;01:33:59,300;"That point is 24 and 6."
01:33:59,300;01:34:01,260;"Page is reeling."
01:34:01,260;01:34:04,400;"And the next drive, Vinditary Man,"
01:34:04,400;01:34:06,340;"is to miss a 52-yard field goal."
01:34:06,340;01:34:09,100;"Shout out to Connor."
01:34:09,100;01:34:12,260;"Shout out, Connor."
01:34:12,260;01:34:14,700;"And that was basically the game."
01:34:14,700;01:34:18,500;"But as we've seen before, and actually said before,"
01:34:18,500;01:34:22,260;"in a lot of these episodes, especially during the losing streak,"
01:34:22,260;01:34:24,060;"this Patriots team has surprised me"
01:34:24,060;01:34:26,780;"with how they just don't ever give up."
01:34:26,780;01:34:29,100;"Like they're down 24 to six."
01:34:29,100;01:34:31,540;"They're playing kind of like Hog garbage."
01:34:31,540;01:34:38,100;"But two plays after military misses that field goal."
01:34:38,100;01:34:42,140;"I suppose they get a bit of a break on this one,"
01:34:42,140;01:34:45,260;"but again, and tries to,"
01:34:45,260;01:34:48,860;"the announcer said he was trying to throw it away,"
01:34:48,860;01:34:51,020;"but he kind of like tried to bounce it into,"
01:34:51,020;01:34:52,740;"I think it was Tim Brown,"
01:34:52,740;01:34:55,140;"because he had pressure in his face"
01:34:55,140;01:34:57,660;"for the first time all night."
01:34:57,660;01:35:01,100;"And the ball ended up bouncing off of,"
01:35:01,100;01:35:03,540;"I think it was Loyamaloy's foot."
01:35:03,540;01:35:05,940;"And it bounced straight up in the air"
01:35:05,940;01:35:10,340;"to Teddy Bruceky, who returned it like 35 yards"
01:35:10,340;01:35:13,780;"for his first ever pick six."
01:35:13,780;01:35:17,180;"And one that I had completely forgotten about."
01:35:17,180;01:35:18,580;"- First of many."
01:35:18,580;01:35:19,580;"- Yeah."
01:35:19,580;01:35:20,420;"- How many did he have?"
01:35:20,420;01:35:21,820;"- We say first of many."
01:35:21,820;01:35:22,820;"You guys wanna guess?"
01:35:22,820;01:35:24,160;"I'll look it up."
01:35:24,160;01:35:28,680;"I can I want to say four."
01:35:28,680;01:35:30,840;"I can think of three in this probably one more."
01:35:30,840;01:35:33,280;"Do you have you have it looked up, don't you, Andy?"
01:35:33,280;01:35:35,240;"No, I'm not going to go three."
01:35:35,240;01:35:37,040;"You can see me not one of the other ones."
01:35:37,040;01:35:42,280;"He has four and they are all within a span of two years."
01:35:42,280;01:35:42,880;"Wow."
01:35:42,880;01:35:44,480;"So this one sounds like."
01:35:44,480;01:35:45,120;"Oh, wait, wait."
01:35:45,120;01:35:48,560;"When he's a dolphin, this is an interception returns for touchdowns."
01:35:48,560;01:35:49,360;"Yeah."
01:35:49,360;01:35:50,440;"No, no, no, no."
01:35:50,440;01:35:51,160;"Yeah."
01:35:53,480;01:36:00,480;"You're the 2002 and 2002 and 2003."
01:36:00,480;01:36:01,000;"Wow."
01:36:01,000;01:36:06,000;"He doesn't have a fumble return for a touchdown."
01:36:06,000;01:36:07,240;"So you have four touchdowns."
01:36:07,240;01:36:08,560;"All sixes."
01:36:08,560;01:36:12,440;"This one, I remember those one against Miami in the snow."
01:36:12,440;01:36:14,040;"I think we all remember that one."
01:36:14,040;01:36:17,080;"Yeah, we drove the snow every year."
01:36:17,080;01:36:20,840;"And then I think I have one against the audience that I remember,"
01:36:21,360;01:36:24,720;"like when they were in their old, like old school uniforms"
01:36:24,720;01:36:28,080;"that mom hates on maybe Thanksgiving."
01:36:28,080;01:36:31,920;"Because the lines were in their old uniforms too, I think."
01:36:31,920;01:36:33,000;"So that was three."
01:36:33,000;01:36:34,240;"I don't know what the fourth one was, though."
01:36:34,240;01:36:39,160;"But I had to go find out there."
01:36:39,160;01:36:40,520;"We'll get there soon."
01:36:40,520;01:36:42,680;"I'm going to guess it's a cold skier next year."
01:36:42,680;01:36:43,400;"Fuck it. Yeah."
01:36:43,400;01:36:48,280;"So yeah, so that but that goes really those three drives."
01:36:48,280;01:36:51,320;"That was the third quarter because of how much time"
01:36:51,320;01:36:55,480;"Oakland took in the first one. Yeah, 10 minute drive. That's"
01:36:55,480;01:36:59,040;"yeah, nine minutes and 42 seconds. But they actually just"
01:36:59,040;01:37:01,440;"ran it down the page of the throat, which the game"
01:37:01,440;01:37:08,560;"killer is to yeah. So the fourth quarter was actually pretty"
01:37:08,560;01:37:12,560;"exciting as well, because New England starts going like no"
01:37:12,560;01:37:16,960;"huddle just doing whatever they can and try to convert a"
01:37:16,960;01:37:20,840;"fourth and one and fail. So that Oakland drives back down into"
01:37:20,840;01:37:26,480;"New England territory, but Richard Seymour, your big lengthy boy blocks Janet"
01:37:26,480;01:37:27,320;"Cowsie Field Goal."
01:37:27,320;01:37:29,440;"You big lengthy boy."
01:37:29,440;01:37:30,960;"He is a big lengthy boy."
01:37:30,960;01:37:32,560;"He is a big lengthy boy."
01:37:32,560;01:37:34,760;"Real good at blocking these proper struggles."
01:37:34,760;01:37:38,600;"So then New England turned around and goes."
01:37:38,600;01:37:39,560;"Big dummy is what he is."
01:37:39,560;01:37:43,320;"That's reserved for our listeners."
01:37:43,320;01:37:47,920;"New England goes foreign out immediately."
01:37:49,400;01:37:54,400;"And Oakland manages to drive inside New England 10 this time, but have to settle for field goal."
01:37:54,400;01:37:59,240;"And then on the ensuing kickoff, because the United States is like, all right, so the"
01:37:59,240;01:38:03,600;"patrons have to get a quick score here and then get the own size kick and score again."
01:38:03,600;01:38:07,860;"And as he's saying that Kevin Falk returns the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown."
01:38:07,860;01:38:08,680;"Ready, five yards."
01:38:08,680;01:38:12,760;"And everybody's thinking, oh, fuck here comes again."
01:38:12,760;01:38:13,920;"Uh oh."
01:38:13,920;01:38:16,200;"Oh, here they come."
01:38:16,200;01:38:17,120;"Yeah, exactly."
01:38:17,320;01:38:20,480;"And after they put up that graphic with the Patriots lost to."
01:38:20,480;01:38:21,040;"Yeah."
01:38:21,040;01:38:23,760;"So we suspect."
01:38:23,760;01:38:28,080;"So then all of a sudden they start coming out with the Brady's comeback stats and"
01:38:28,080;01:38:29,000;"everything like that."
01:38:29,000;01:38:31,240;"Well, this is how many times he's done it."
01:38:31,240;01:38:33,920;"And this is how many times like last week they came back from how many down"
01:38:33,920;01:38:35,560;"because last week was a Chicago game, remember?"
01:38:35,560;01:38:37,720;"They came back from a bunch down at the end."
01:38:37,720;01:38:40,240;"I'm like, Oh, it looks like they're going to do it again."
01:38:40,240;01:38:43,400;"And then the Patriots fail to recover the own size kick and games over."
01:38:45,920;01:38:46,420;"It was tough."
01:38:46,420;01:38:47,120;"You could do that."
01:38:47,120;01:38:50,320;"What do you think of that rule change they're throwing around?"
01:38:50,320;01:38:51,600;"I don't know if we've talked about this."
01:38:51,600;01:38:55,280;"The fourth and 13."
01:38:55,280;01:38:56,920;"Yeah, you have an on-sides kick."
01:38:56,920;01:39:00,920;"Thought."
01:39:00,920;01:39:02,440;"I like it."
01:39:02,440;01:39:05,160;"I don't know."
01:39:05,160;01:39:08,720;"If an on-sides kick should take a last gasp sort of thing."
01:39:08,720;01:39:11,120;"I think they should just go back to the old on-sides kick."
01:39:11,120;01:39:12,400;"I agree."
01:39:12,400;01:39:13,560;"The on-sides kick is fine."
01:39:13,560;01:39:15,320;"- The same percentage, Steve."
01:39:15,320;01:39:18,040;"- As what, the old on-site kicks?"
01:39:18,040;01:39:20,200;"- It is for now, until they start making more and more--"
01:39:20,200;01:39:21,520;"- Yeah, the more the hamstring that these are."
01:39:21,520;01:39:22,420;"- How is it different?"
01:39:22,420;01:39:29,240;"- I think a play for 13 yards is more high percent"
01:39:29,240;01:39:30,520;"than the on-site kick."
01:39:30,520;01:39:31,840;"- It's literally not."
01:39:31,840;01:39:34,360;"It's the same percentage that's why they pick"
01:39:34,360;01:39:35,360;"that number of yards."
01:39:35,360;01:39:37,840;"- But I think now many times people don't for fourth"
01:39:37,840;01:39:41,120;"and 13 in super high level situations like that."
01:39:41,120;01:39:43,720;"- So, quite a few because you don't usually go"
01:39:43,720;01:39:45,520;"on fourth down."
01:39:45,520;01:39:47,400;"You're only going on 13 yards."
01:39:47,400;01:39:49,320;"- Yeah."
01:39:49,320;01:39:52,640;"- I wonder if it says many times as"
01:39:52,640;01:39:54,560;"- You do on size kicks."
01:39:54,560;01:39:55,920;"- Yeah, more on size kicks."
01:39:55,920;01:39:57,840;"- It's the last gasp effort, right?"
01:39:57,840;01:39:59,280;"You're not going for it on fourth and 13"
01:39:59,280;01:40:03,120;"unless you're like down or like you need points bad."
01:40:03,120;01:40:04,400;"Same thing with an on size kick."
01:40:04,400;01:40:08,720;"It's basically a really long shot thing."
01:40:08,720;01:40:13,980;"You're not gonna get people just doing it for the hell of it. It was like fourth and 20. I'd be more about it 13 scenes"
01:40:13,980;01:40:15,980;"Too little"
01:40:15,980;01:40:18,620;"What if it was fourth and 13 but from your own 10 yard line?"
01:40:18,620;01:40:24,200;"What's what it is right? It's fourth and 13 from your own 20 or so man. Yeah, or your own 30"
01:40:24,200;01:40:28,980;"Or wherever they kick off from I think right the 30 so if you're kicking off with if you do it from the 30 you feel"
01:40:28,980;01:40:32,580;"Like you're still barely in field goal range. If you do it from your own 10"
01:40:32,580;01:40:36,020;"Well, that's my study man. The other teams are trying to score"
01:40:36,420;01:40:40,760;"They might be if they kick a field that might end the game because now it might be too square"
01:40:40,760;01:40:44,480;"It's like generally if I give you recovery on-side's kick you take a knee like they did in this game"
01:40:44,480;01:40:47,300;"Yeah, but there's a lot of men on the field penalty"
01:40:47,300;01:40:54,300;"There's a lot of situations though where Andy's right that you have that option of do we kick it deep and"
01:40:54,300;01:40:57,300;"Try and get it back with like 30 seconds, right?"
01:40:57,300;01:41:03,760;"Because we don't have any timeouts or do we on-side to kick it right so in those cases of like a field goal does matter"
01:41:04,620;01:41:06,620;"Yeah, if you're down six and"
01:41:06,620;01:41:12,320;"You could still get three stops like 30 seconds left this kick a feel roll. It's still it's gonna be game over"
01:41:12,320;01:41:15,000;"Yeah, I"
01:41:15,000;01:41:23,460;"Would think college rules over time fourth and 20 from like a 10 and yeah, oh they did college was I'd love that I"
01:41:23,460;01:41:26,700;"Think college is awesome"
01:41:26,700;01:41:31,460;"I mean, maybe I think points should count but I think"
01:41:32,140;01:41:34,940;"You know yeah, yeah, I agree with that I"
01:41:34,940;01:41:37,540;"Think they should just do"
01:41:37,540;01:41:43,500;"What the X values to do and have two guys start the goal line and the ball in the 50 yard line"
01:41:43,500;01:41:49,220;"And whoever gets the ball first gets it. I think they should make them. That's true. That's no. That's the coin floor"
01:41:49,220;01:41:51,260;"That's the coin flip for the"
01:41:51,260;01:41:54,660;"For overtime"
01:41:54,660;01:41:56,660;"And the time rules are the same"
01:41:58,300;01:41:59,340;"I think you should be."
01:41:59,340;01:42:02,020;"They want to be 300 pound plus guys."
01:42:02,020;01:42:06,340;"So they had to have had played at least half the snaps."
01:42:06,340;01:42:10,060;"They have to both be a 300 pound player and a coach."
01:42:10,060;01:42:11,060;"Greg's onto something."
01:42:11,060;01:42:14,740;"So you have a rare player."
01:42:14,740;01:42:16,580;"Then you have a ringer on the coaching staff."
01:42:16,580;01:42:20,380;"Terrible coach, but the man can run a four or five for you."
01:42:20,380;01:42:22,700;"It's how much does Pepper Johnson way?"
01:42:22,700;01:42:24,020;"Right. No, no, get in the book."
01:42:24,020;01:42:24,780;"Or get in there, bud."
01:42:24,780;01:42:26,020;"Who will for?"
01:42:26,020;01:42:27,340;"I have in fear."
01:42:27,340;01:42:31,180;"Or what you do is you just get the big boys and do like a sumo wrestling contest."
01:42:31,180;01:42:34,620;"I was thinking like, let's make a different sport."
01:42:34,620;01:42:38,020;"Put them both on the 50 like with their head touching or something."
01:42:38,020;01:42:40,180;"And then whoever can push you like I backed the 45."
01:42:40,180;01:42:43,060;"It's like a rugby."
01:42:43,060;01:42:43,900;"Think of the ball, right."
01:42:43,900;01:42:44,500;"That's what I've had."
01:42:44,500;01:42:45,500;"Yeah."
01:42:45,500;01:42:47,420;"Great idea."
01:42:47,420;01:42:48,500;"I'm into that."
01:42:48,500;01:42:49,340;"Yep."
01:42:49,340;01:42:51,540;"There needs to be, yeah, there needs to be like some sort of like,"
01:42:51,540;01:42:52,940;"it can't just be a coin flip to decide."
01:42:52,940;01:42:55,220;"Or like a like a hot dog eating contest."
01:42:55,940;01:42:58,140;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
01:42:58,140;01:43:00,460;"Or like three legged race."
01:43:00,460;01:43:04,820;"Yeah. Can you can you fit this banana in your butthole without touching the sides?"
01:43:04,820;01:43:08,980;"Eli Manning is certainly hired."
01:43:08,980;01:43:16,580;"Eli Manning accepts $20 million deal"
01:43:16,580;01:43:18,740;"every team in the NFL."
01:43:18,740;01:43:22,020;"Oh, shit."
01:43:22,020;01:43:24,180;"Miss Brett Farby ate him."
01:43:24,180;01:43:29,020;"I was super awesome coaches."
01:43:29,020;01:43:34,700;"Did you know that Ivan fears that the longtime Patriots running backs coach?"
01:43:34,700;01:43:35,060;"Yeah."
01:43:35,060;01:43:37,780;"You used to be the wider super coach."
01:43:37,780;01:43:38,860;"I think in this year."
01:43:38,860;01:43:40,020;"Really?"
01:43:40,020;01:43:41,420;"I go one oh two."
01:43:41,420;01:43:42,140;"He was a wide out now."
01:43:42,140;01:43:48,460;"Now you have the man he was coaching Troy Brown working as a running back coach"
01:43:48,460;01:43:48,900;"underneath him."
01:43:48,900;01:43:49,740;"Yeah."
01:43:49,740;01:43:50,820;"So I found that out."
01:43:50,820;01:43:53,340;"That's why Troy Brown is there."
01:43:53,420;01:43:54,900;"Is the running backs coach now?"
01:43:54,900;01:43:56,980;"He is a assistant running backs coach."
01:43:56,980;01:43:57,380;"Yeah."
01:43:57,380;01:43:58,220;"So what is that?"
01:43:58,220;01:43:58,860;"And fear is doing."
01:43:58,860;01:44:01,540;"He's running backs coach."
01:44:01,540;01:44:03,820;"He's been since like three years."
01:44:03,820;01:44:04,380;"Something like that."
01:44:04,380;01:44:05,820;"Running backs coaches."
01:44:05,820;01:44:06,620;"Yeah."
01:44:06,620;01:44:08,300;"We got a lot of running backs."
01:44:08,300;01:44:09,820;"It's true."
01:44:09,820;01:44:11,300;"None of them really panned out lately."
01:44:11,300;01:44:13,820;"So I mean, half of our running backs are wider"
01:44:13,820;01:44:15,060;"series anyways, right?"
01:44:15,060;01:44:16,780;"Yeah, James White practicing with the wider"
01:44:16,780;01:44:18,700;"severs like Greg Brown called."
01:44:18,700;01:44:20,140;"Yeah."
01:44:20,140;01:44:22,420;"I think he's I think it'd be a great wide receiver."
01:44:22,420;01:44:23,380;"I agree."
01:44:23,380;01:44:26,100;"Got good route running skills and he's good after the catch."
01:44:26,100;01:44:27,380;"He's got great hands."
01:44:27,380;01:44:28,380;"That's true."
01:44:28,380;01:44:34,420;"And I'm guessing he's pretty smart and can like read those gaps and cover just too because"
01:44:34,420;01:44:36,580;"that's part of running those screenplays."
01:44:36,580;01:44:43,020;"Oh, speaking of Troy Brown and running backs, he actually lined up in the back field in"
01:44:43,020;01:44:44,020;"this game and got a handoff."
01:44:44,020;01:44:45,020;"Did you catch that?"
01:44:45,020;01:44:46,020;"I'm going to see that."
01:44:46,020;01:44:47,020;"I did."
01:44:47,020;01:44:50,460;"That's what I saw in the stat sheet."
01:44:50,460;01:44:53,060;"Yeah, what was the stat?"
01:44:53,060;01:44:55,020;"Like minus two yards."
01:44:55,020;01:44:58,940;"Yeah, took a draw play and the center got absolutely blown up."
01:44:58,940;01:45:01,820;"So as soon as you got the hand off, you got tackled by the center's ass."
01:45:01,820;01:45:06,780;"So didn't work, but so can you name all the positions?"
01:45:06,780;01:45:07,580;"Troy Brown has played."
01:45:07,580;01:45:13,300;"In his career, other with the Patriots, kick returner, punt returner, wide receiver,"
01:45:13,300;01:45:15,260;"was a corner back."
01:45:15,260;01:45:15,820;"Oh, he did."
01:45:15,820;01:45:17,060;"Why do you see the corner back?"
01:45:17,060;01:45:17,260;"Yeah."
01:45:17,260;01:45:18,140;"I think we said he kicked."
01:45:18,140;01:45:19,340;"He did it like once, didn't he?"
01:45:19,340;01:45:22,660;"in the super bowl safety in the super bowl remember. Yeah,"
01:45:22,660;01:45:26,220;"that's right. Yeah. Well, they need like some sure hands back"
01:45:26,220;01:45:26,780;"there some."
01:45:26,780;01:45:30,700;"When we're back safety, I don't know if I'll put safety on"
01:45:30,700;01:45:30,980;"there."
01:45:30,980;01:45:33,020;"Running back, right?"
01:45:33,020;01:45:34,060;"Play running back."
01:45:34,060;01:45:38,260;"I'm sure he's thrown the ball at some point. Maybe not."
01:45:38,260;01:45:39,500;"Can't remember."
01:45:39,500;01:45:42,340;"No, but but he did."
01:45:42,340;01:45:46,020;"Embrace season line up as a quarterback. He was going to be"
01:45:46,020;01:45:47,180;"the emergency quarterback one year."
01:45:48,260;01:45:55,300;"And he took he took one snap and he handed it off and the running back fumbled it."
01:45:55,300;01:45:57,540;"And he never saw the field as a quarterback again."
01:45:57,540;01:46:00,100;"On the transition."
01:46:00,100;01:46:06,820;"No, no, you got the transition off fine, but then the running back fumbled it like after that."
01:46:06,820;01:46:12,020;"Because I remember Belichick was being like interview before the game, you know, on the sideline"
01:46:12,020;01:46:17,220;"like they do. And like he was being really coy, like, Oh, yeah, we're going to try some things out"
01:46:17,220;01:46:19,620;"I'm not a quarterback, but you know, I'll try some people you're not expecting."
01:46:19,620;01:46:21,660;"And as you said that, I'm like, oh, it's got to be Troy Brown."
01:46:21,660;01:46:23,220;"Like, who else are you going to put there?"
01:46:23,220;01:46:26,300;"Because this was like peak Troy Brown era."
01:46:26,300;01:46:26,940;"And I was right."
01:46:26,940;01:46:30,700;"And you only ever got one play and I was super disappointed."
01:46:30,700;01:46:34,140;"Yeah, I'm sure it would have been different positions."
01:46:34,140;01:46:34,900;"You mean great anything."
01:46:34,900;01:46:40,140;"Left guard."
01:46:40,140;01:46:41,900;"All right, fair enough."
01:46:41,900;01:46:42,420;"No stack."
01:46:42,420;01:46:59,420;"So here's a stat that I was surprised to find out. Bill Belichick after this game was a 500 coach."
01:46:59,420;01:47:10,420;"Interesting. He was 21 after losing this game. I don't know if he would ever be..."
01:47:10,420;01:47:14,040;"It's probably gonna be a 500 or 500. Yeah, ever"
01:47:14,040;01:47:20,520;"What's this game itself with the Patriots? They're all tied. It's got that'd be 21 and 21. That's that's gotta be all time"
01:47:20,520;01:47:25,140;"No, it's gotta be just the paths. Oh, I know you're I'm 40. Yeah"
01:47:25,140;01:47:28,200;"Yeah"
01:47:28,200;01:47:31,060;"It's you're for two and a half though"
01:47:31,060;01:47:36,020;"You do the math what's 16 and eight?"
01:47:36,020;01:47:39,080;"Yeah, so I'm going for it's"
01:47:39,080;01:47:42,080;"Yeah, I think all time."
01:47:42,080;01:47:46,080;"Yeah, let's get to the all time."
01:47:46,080;01:47:47,080;"So."
01:47:47,080;01:47:55,080;"It was 36 and 44 with the Browns."
01:47:55,080;01:47:57,080;"Yeah."
01:47:57,080;01:48:03,080;"So they said that a little bit more to go before he's over 500 for his career."
01:48:03,080;01:48:04,080;"Right."
01:48:04,080;01:48:06,580;"Right I'm probably half in mid year next year"
01:48:06,580;01:48:14,040;"Yeah, probably about then because they go on a run in 2003 2004. Yeah"
01:48:14,040;01:48:18,080;"And then he goes"
01:48:18,080;01:48:21,480;"237 and 83"
01:48:21,480;01:48:27,400;"Not bad it's pretty good"
01:48:30,040;01:48:32,040;"Do you guys have any other notes in this game?"
01:48:32,040;01:48:35,340;"None that I remember or make sense"
01:48:35,340;01:48:38,220;"Give me one that makes the least sense"
01:48:38,220;01:48:42,520;"These commentators suck he dips"
01:48:42,520;01:48:55,140;"I definitely did not like the commentators so really that's surprising not a ton of time for Tom and then in parentheses as they praise the secondary I"
01:48:55,140;01:49:00,020;"Mean yeah Tom Brady had literally no time in this game"
01:49:00,020;01:49:05,080;"You got harassed pretty much the entire time why I can't believe we thought Matt light was good"
01:49:05,080;01:49:09,580;"Yeah, you got you got beat real big was good. It was not in this game"
01:49:09,580;01:49:15,400;"Actually, I do every once in a while. He would have like a really horrible game. Yeah, he does not he's not like it's"
01:49:15,400;01:49:21,680;"Everybody they always go up against the best guys. No, but like not just like had a bad day, but just like"
01:49:21,680;01:49:27,400;"Look like an amateur for you know, like just getting absolutely whooped"
01:49:28,960;01:49:31,680;"I don't have to say are you selling Matt lights name?"
01:49:31,680;01:49:34,720;"Well, I mean can't have a figure that later. Yeah"
01:49:34,720;01:49:40,920;"Like this is a pro matte light podcast not anymore. He just came out as an anti-masker"
01:49:40,920;01:49:43,680;"Daddy, I don't give a shit. I"
01:49:43,680;01:49:46,600;"Know I just want to rally you up"
01:49:46,600;01:49:50,440;"Great you're wearing a mask right now"
01:49:50,440;01:49:53,480;"Then I should be oh"
01:49:53,600;01:49:57,880;"Hey dad your run is uh-oh dad's back. He just gave me the old like"
01:49:57,880;01:50:00,520;"Fuck's going on look"
01:50:00,520;01:50:04,260;"Right as if we haven't been doing this for the past two hours"
01:50:04,260;01:50:08,240;"All right, here's my here's my last note. All right. Give me a last note"
01:50:08,240;01:50:10,720;"on the"
01:50:10,720;01:50:13,120;"They traded Gruden to the box"
01:50:13,120;01:50:19,340;"They go up to first round picks two second round picks and eight million dollars to the Raiders to get Gruden"
01:50:22,160;01:50:26,920;"Wait, they traded what two first round picks two second round picks and eight million dollars"
01:50:26,920;01:50:30,740;"for crude and it still went"
01:50:30,740;01:50:34,320;"better for them because everyone's Super Bowl and"
01:50:34,320;01:50:42,440;"The Raiders those first round picks to go. What was it four and twelve the year after? Yep, it worked out"
01:50:42,440;01:50:46,400;"given up two first two seconds and eight million dollars and they"
01:50:47,040;01:50:52,720;"It was who probably won that deal. Oh, yeah, I would say I mean how much would you pay for Super Bowl?"
01:50:52,720;01:50:55,280;"Too far how long was greeting at the bucks?"
01:50:55,280;01:51:01,520;"Not that long good question. I was like you say that long. Does it retired?"
01:51:01,520;01:51:07,680;"That check Greg I do it. He's stupid. He's looking at them. What are you gonna do?"
01:51:07,680;01:51:11,720;"Stick his tip is yelling a dad and Craig. Yeah, it's fucking dad"
01:51:11,720;01:51:16,000;"You're part of the podcast"
01:51:16,000;01:51:22,480;"Oh two to oh eight oh two so six years that's a decent amount of time in it yeah"
01:51:22,480;01:51:28,120;"yeah then you're tired after that right yeah and that was unretired to go back"
01:51:28,120;01:51:36,100;"with the raiders I kind of hope he doesn't win again personally I don't have"
01:51:36,100;01:51:40,520;"any reason for it I just hope it's a win again I hope he does I don't want to see"
01:51:40,520;01:51:45,160;"the raiders good again I don't know that was cool that stadium was bumping"
01:51:45,160;01:51:48,540;"Do you want to see anybody good again, Andy?"
01:51:48,540;01:51:49,540;"Yeah, the picture."
01:51:49,540;01:51:51,740;"Or you just a bitter prick."
01:51:51,740;01:51:54,100;"Again, they're always good."
01:51:54,100;01:51:58,020;"Yeah, but Brady's gone, so they have to prove the haters wrong again."
01:51:58,020;01:52:01,060;"Who would you like to see successful other than the Patriots?"
01:52:01,060;01:52:02,060;"The Cleveland Browns."
01:52:02,060;01:52:03,060;"Me too."
01:52:03,060;01:52:05,060;"I want to see a brown."
01:52:05,060;01:52:06,060;"I want the lions."
01:52:06,060;01:52:07,900;"I want a brown's lion too."
01:52:07,900;01:52:11,620;"Okay, what about a team that has been good semi recently?"
01:52:11,620;01:52:13,620;"Nah, fuck them."
01:52:13,620;01:52:15,780;"(laughing)"
01:52:15,780;01:52:17,580;"- You don't think it'd be awesome to see the Cowboys"
01:52:17,580;01:52:18,420;"go to the Super Bowl?"
01:52:18,420;01:52:19,340;"- Nah, fuck 'em."
01:52:19,340;01:52:20,180;"I need to go."

01:52:21,020;01:52:21,860;"- 49ers."
01:52:21,860;01:52:23,620;"- Gary Jones is a douche, doesn't deserve it."
01:52:23,620;01:52:24,460;"- 49ers?"
01:52:24,460;01:52:25,540;"- Ah, Andy."
01:52:25,540;01:52:28,220;"Everybody's a dick to Andy."
01:52:28,220;01:52:29,540;"- I like the 49ers."
01:52:29,540;01:52:31,700;"- Oh, nag 'em, mom."
01:52:31,700;01:52:35,260;"This is what looks great about being homeless."
01:52:35,260;01:52:38,820;"I can send mom to nag, Andy, in the other room."
01:52:38,820;01:52:40,140;"(laughing)"
01:52:40,140;01:52:41,340;"For being a dick."
01:52:42,400;01:52:44,400;"Good luck centered down here. Oh"
01:52:44,400;01:52:53,400;"Now she's just like stroking him and telling him she loves them. That's bullshit. I don't see you"
01:52:53,400;01:52:56,760;"You can't nag the golden boy"

01:53:03,960;01:53:06,680;"Yeah, I mean"
01:53:06,680;01:53:13,100;"It is what it is. Oh, um, Bill Romanowski had a dirty hit that was flagged and he was all incensed about it"
01:53:13,100;01:53:19,920;"That was my last note. Yeah, it was a fucking course. He did the dirty prick. I hate him too Greg for your I know"
01:53:19,920;01:53:26,320;"I like him of course you do you can hear it in like a sick-de-praved like zoo animal way"

01:53:42,400;01:53:46,720;"Everybody likes looking at car. I almost got in an accident on the way home"
01:53:46,720;01:53:50,560;"Looking at a car accident watching a car burn on the other side of the highway"
01:53:50,560;01:53:54,700;"And then like I just is staring at it and all the traffic slow down in front of me"
01:53:54,700;01:53:58,120;"Locked up the bricks"

01:54:31,820;01:54:35,920;"The list is shorter of things Andy doesn't hate"
01:54:35,920;01:54:39,300;"That's not true. I hate two things"
01:54:39,300;01:54:45,500;"People who don't do what they're supposed to and things that don't work the way they're supposed to"
01:54:45,500;01:54:50,720;"Stupid piece of shit that doesn't do the goddamn fucking thing. It's supposed to yeah"
01:54:50,720;01:54:57,520;"Exactly, which is a good time in it because that's fucking and we should lose the commentators fall under or is that both?"
01:54:57,520;01:55:01,660;"Oh, no, it's not for the first one."
01:55:01,660;01:55:02,920;"They don't know about Romanowski."
01:55:02,920;01:55:03,160;"He did."
01:55:03,160;01:55:03,820;"He was supposed to."
01:55:03,820;01:55:04,820;"No, he didn't."
01:55:04,820;01:55:06,620;"Yeah, he did antagonize people."
01:55:06,620;01:55:07,520;"I think he did."
01:55:07,520;01:55:11,320;"He's like Brad Marshant, you know, he's out there to be in the past."
01:55:11,320;01:55:12,960;"He did just what he was supposed to."
01:55:12,960;01:55:15,400;"He would injure people on purpose."
01:55:15,400;01:55:17,040;"You know, that's what he was supposed to do."
01:55:17,040;01:55:18,260;"He's probably getting paid to do it."
01:55:18,260;01:55:20,340;"No, he got any gay saints."
01:55:20,340;01:55:20,800;"Yeah."

01:55:21,740;01:55:25,140;"All right."
01:55:25,140;01:55:37,140;"So I think this is the point of the podcast where we ask anybody who's still listening to give us a rating or give us a review and tell us how you really feel."
01:55:37,140;01:55:41,440;"And if you do give us a rating, can you rate each of us individually?"
01:55:41,440;01:55:43,340;"Oh no, yeah, that'll be nice."
01:55:43,340;01:55:44,540;"Oh, here's what we should do."
01:55:44,540;01:55:51,140;"We should ask our listeners to rate us and leave a review telling us which brown brother you like the best."
01:55:51,140;01:55:52,140;"Yeah."
01:55:52,140;01:55:56,300;"like my actually no just just tell us which one you like the least"

01:55:59,900;01:56:10,140;"and by what margin is it so if you do that we would we promise to read all of them"
01:56:10,140;01:56:15,900;"on the air and we will respond to them i suppose i feel like it'd be hard not to"
01:56:17,100;01:56:36,100;"I'm sure you could buy one. They're not expensive. But yes, if you go to rate this podcast.com/passpod, you'll be able to leave us some feedback. Good, bad or otherwise."
01:56:36,100;01:56:41,100;"Preferably bad because I think we're used to getting shit on. That's how we grew up."
01:56:41,100;01:56:41,940;"Yeah, be perfect."

00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:16,000;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:16,000;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:24,640;"I am not your mother."
00:24,640;00:31,120;"Welcome back to the Patriots Dinesy podcast in 2001, week six, moving along."
00:31,120;00:32,120;"- Daddies!"
00:32,120;00:37,760;"- With us today, we changing up a bit."
00:37,760;00:43,360;"We don't have Mike today, but we do have the Brown brothers, Greg and Steve."
00:43,360;00:45,240;"And also you may have heard Kelly."
00:45,240;00:46,240;"- Congratulations."
00:46,240;00:47,240;"- My flag."
00:47,240;00:52,320;"- How are you guys doing?"
00:52,320;00:53,160;"I'm doing great."
00:53,160;00:55,440;"I was asking Kelly."
00:55,440;00:56,600;"Wonderful."
00:56,600;00:57,160;"Thank you."
00:57,160;00:58,000;"Good."
00:58,000;00:59,360;"Steve, how are you?"
00:59,360;01:01,480;"Fantastic."
01:01,480;01:02,400;"Yeah."
01:02,400;01:04,440;"You sound fantastic."
01:04,440;01:10,320;"Especially with that heavy breathing."
01:10,320;01:11,280;"Thanks for that."
01:11,280;01:12,720;"I love it."
01:12,720;01:13,200;"Yeah."
01:13,200;01:15,920;"This is quality radio."
01:15,920;01:17,280;"I can't wait to edit all this out."
01:17,280;01:18,440;"It's going to be fantastic."
01:18,440;01:18,920;"Anything."
01:18,920;01:19,440;"Go on."
01:22,240;01:26,680;"We need a lot easier women to just me and Mike."
01:26,680;01:27,840;"I'm not going to lie."
01:27,840;01:30,920;"Wait, when did you just, when did you do just life?"
01:30,920;01:32,440;"The last two weeks."
01:32,440;01:35,360;"Yeah, we've still been going."
01:35,360;01:36,400;"This has still been happening."
01:36,400;01:38,640;"I go though."
01:38,640;01:40,480;"It went really well."
01:40,480;01:45,120;"Um, it's actually probably a good idea that we catch up a bit actually,"
01:45,120;01:49,040;"because our listeners may need some of that as well now that we're kind of"
01:49,040;01:49,960;"getting through the season."
01:49,960;01:54,960;"So last time we had you guys on was the first Colts game, right?"
01:54,960;01:56,320;"Yeah."
01:56,320;02:02,320;"Brady's first start when they surprisingly blew out the Colts,"
02:02,320;02:04,560;"but Brady really didn't do much."
02:04,560;02:10,160;"Uh, after that, Patience went down to Miami and did what they always do in Miami"
02:10,160;02:18,440;"and got, um, their shit pushed in by Jason Taylor and Zach Thomas and the Miami"
02:18,440;02:26,200;"defense. They beat the hell out of Brady and they got run over by Lamar Smith. Was that his name?"
02:26,200;02:32,120;"The old school dolphins running back who looks just like Antoine Smith but in a dolphins uniform."
02:32,120;02:37,880;"So that I wouldn't say miss that game. I don't think I'd watch that ever again. That would be fine."
02:38,680;02:48,680;"But last week was against the then San Diego Chargers that had, you're actually going to enjoy"
02:48,680;02:54,360;"this, it had on defense, it had Junior Seo, that middle linebacker, peak Junior Seo."
02:54,360;03:01,800;"And also Rodney Harrison playing safety, which I don't know if you could say that was peak"
03:01,800;03:03,880;"he'd run he has somebody was one of his peaks."
03:03,880;03:09,520;"And then at quarterback was hometown boy Doug Flute."
03:09,520;03:12,040;"That's right. Yes."
03:12,040;03:13,640;"Yes. With his,"
03:13,640;03:19,240;"his tie law as a back pedal every time he took a snap under center."
03:19,240;03:20,440;"Oh, yes."
03:20,440;03:21,760;"Spritted backwards."
03:21,760;03:24,200;"I've never seen anybody put so much effort into everything."
03:24,200;03:30,200;"He was drew breeze before drew breeze in terms of how much effort he puts into"
03:30,200;03:31,000;"every throw."
03:31,000;03:37,160;"And even like when he's in the shotgun and he's like lifting his foot to get the snap"
03:37,160;03:41,840;"He's like stomping the man just he was 110 all the time"
03:41,840;03:46,500;"And I don't know if you knew this but he's actually from Massachusetts the"
03:46,500;03:53,480;"Commentators mentioned it a couple times. Oh, yeah, did he play like BC? No. Yeah, and you know he very Hail Mary"
03:53,480;03:55,960;"Yeah"
03:55,960;04:00,200;"It's from like Needham or something like that. I can't remember exactly where they said he was from but they said in a bunch"
04:00,200;04:01,600;"I thought he went to Harvard."
04:01,600;04:03,680;"No, that's right."
04:03,680;04:04,240;"It's Patrick."
04:04,240;04:07,720;"He's from fucking Brockton."
04:07,720;04:09,160;"There it is."
04:09,160;04:12,680;"I was one of those ones that you have to say with a Boston accent."
04:12,680;04:15,200;"Walpole, the Walpole."
04:15,200;04:15,680;"Yeah."
04:15,680;04:16,120;"Oh, yeah."
04:16,120;04:16,400;"That's right."
04:16,400;04:17,640;"I found in his radio."
04:17,640;04:24,600;"They actually posted a infographic of his record in the state of Massachusetts."
04:24,600;04:26,640;"And none of them were Patriots games."
04:28,840;04:34,540;"But the game is actually a really good one because it was the first one Brady actually was the reason they want it."
04:34,540;04:40,640;"Me and Mike were actually talking about how the"
04:40,640;04:45,040;"like even though we knew, well, I knew what the actual score was."
04:45,040;04:54,040;"He goes in not knowing apparently, but I knew that the page has won this and there was like eight minutes left at the end of the fourth quarter and they're down 10 points."
04:54,040;04:56,740;"I'm like, I think I may be watching the wrong game."
04:56,740;04:59,160;"I don't think they win this but Brady pulled it out in the end"
04:59,160;05:04,580;"drove him down fourth quarter touchdown and then drove him down again to"
05:04,580;05:07,940;"Score the game when him field goal by Adam Minnitary"
05:07,940;05:20,340;"I'm gonna come clean here guys"
05:25,140;05:34,220;"I watched the wrong game. I watched the Falcons game. I have a lot of notes on Jay Piedler."
05:34,220;05:40,060;"Yeah. What you just heard was me bringing up me to it. I like some"
05:40,060;05:48,960;"Patriots Colts week six. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know if you'll need them. But guess me and Steve"
05:48,960;05:54,340;"driving this one. The David Patton game. It was. That's a good one. This is like the first game"
05:54,340;05:59,660;"I remember from the season. I don't remember that charges game at all. No, I didn't really remember anybody either"
05:59,660;06:02,100;"Are you going touch down catch? Yes"
06:02,100;06:08,080;"Year it it was his first game of the year. Yep. He was back and then he"
06:08,080;06:12,780;"pulled a hammy and practice the week before this game and"
06:12,780;06:18,180;"Travel with the team and you know, there's all sorts of bullshit going on about how"
06:19,140;06:24,580;"Yeah, he can actually maybe he can play or maybe camp any travel with the team"
06:24,580;06:28,380;"And maybe he'll play with the injured Hammy and then the Patriots said not fuck it"
06:28,380;06:31,220;"so"
06:31,220;06:41,780;"From yeah, I actually do all right so JF either obviously a Dartmouth grad"
06:41,780;06:44,700;"Yep, I'm drafted"
06:44,700;06:47,580;"He's a hall of fame, right? I don't know if you knew about that"
06:48,500;06:54,620;"Excuse me in the National Jewish Museum Sports Hall of Fame. Ah, okay"
06:54,620;06:57,780;"I'm deep dive. Yeah"
06:57,780;07:03,100;"Must be slim pickens apparently yeah apparently he was"
07:03,100;07:11,020;"Like that was like a lot of his reputation was how he was Jewish and good at football never should yeah and"
07:11,020;07:15,580;"Chris Berman used to call him the feedler on the roof"
07:15,580;07:26,580;"- I mean, I heard a fiddler on the roof, but I didn't put that with Jewish people either."
07:26,580;07:32,580;"- Yeah, and I also went down a little rabbit hole on Jewishjournal.com."
07:32,580;07:33,580;"- Okay."
07:33,580;07:39,580;"- And he was the title of the article is Jay Fiehler, the second best Jewish quarterback ever."
07:39,580;07:42,580;"- Who's number one?"
07:42,580;07:44,440;"I am on pins and needles,"
07:44,440;07:46,400;"no eating to know who's number one."
07:46,400;07:48,240;"- Sid Luckman."
07:48,240;07:49,080;"- Oh."
07:49,080;07:51,880;"- I mean."
07:51,880;07:54,460;"(laughs)"
07:54,460;07:56,020;"Yeah, so."
07:56,020;07:57,260;"- Sure."
07:57,260;07:58,100;"- Also,"
07:58,100;08:01,480;"there was an interview in the article"
08:01,480;08:03,840;"and they asked him Brady or Manning"
08:03,840;08:05,980;"and his answer was Brady."
08:05,980;08:06,820;"- Oh good."
08:06,820;08:07,660;"- So, you know,"
08:07,660;08:09,720;"come up with spots in my book."
08:12,160;08:19,720;"Also, he joined the pro volleyball beach volleyball tournament in 2008 after he retired."
08:19,720;08:20,720;"Fuck yeah."
08:20,720;08:23,840;"He competed in one tournament and was 0-1."
08:23,840;08:24,840;"[laughter]"
08:24,840;08:25,960;"All $0."
08:25,960;08:26,960;"[laughter]"
08:26,960;08:32,960;"There was a quote in there that said, ""Bever said he practiced once for the match and"
08:32,960;08:37,680;"otherwise, that only played volleyball at summer camps and in gym class."""
08:37,680;08:38,680;"[laughter]"
08:38,680;08:44,440;"said about these been reading about J. Feed their Greg. Yeah, he's he's"
08:44,440;08:46,640;"well enough."
08:46,640;08:56,000;"In 2005, him and Chad Pennington when they're on the Jets, that season ending"
08:56,000;09:01,760;"injuries within seven plays of each other. Oh, I remember that. And they brought a"
09:01,760;09:08,600;"41-year-old Vinnie Testa Verde off his couch. Yeah, they did. That's"
09:08,600;09:12,520;"That's amazing. Yeah, that's all I have on this game."
09:12,520;09:16,480;"Well, did you actually get to see any of J."
09:16,480;09:18,640;"Feebler play? Yeah, man."
09:18,640;09:20,640;"He was a better one than I remembered."
09:20,640;09:23,240;"Well, that's all he had. He was supposed to be."
09:23,240;09:27,080;"He was the next quarterback after Dan Marino."
09:27,080;09:29,320;"Like he was supposed to be Marino's replacement."
09:29,320;09:31,640;"Yep. That he fucking wasn't."
09:31,640;09:34,240;"He was okay. Well, he had a decent career."
09:34,240;09:38,560;"He could run around, but the man had no awareness."
09:38,560;09:41,120;"of where anybody else was on the field when he was running."
09:41,120;09:41,620;"Yeah."
09:41,620;09:44,360;"Because that man took some fucking shots in the past game."
09:44,360;09:48,560;"Yeah, you're saying it's the best Dolphins quarterback they've had since Marina."
09:48,560;09:53,360;"Hey, I'm dare you to check that it's been like that."
09:53,360;09:55,160;"What about Cleo Lemon?"
09:55,160;09:56,160;"Ooh."
09:56,160;09:58,560;"Ryan Tanohill, thank you very much."
09:58,560;09:59,560;"Rock off, Wilder."
09:59,560;10:00,560;"Yeah."
10:00,560;10:02,560;"We should go down this road."
10:02,560;10:03,560;"Ryan Fitzpatrick."
10:03,560;10:12,280;"where you can say is the best quarterback that the Jets or the Bills or the Dolphins have had since any of their"
10:12,280;10:16,120;"yes, it's just cool. Yeah."
10:16,120;10:16,760;"Yeah."
10:16,760;10:17,120;"Yeah."
10:17,120;10:17,760;"Well,"
10:17,760;10:20,160;"Jets don't have a good quarterback."
10:20,160;10:22,760;"Joe Nameth. Joe Nameth, I guess."
10:22,760;10:29,080;"All right. Well, how about we actually talk about the game we came to talk here about?"
10:29,080;10:33,080;"Yeah, I feel free to chime in whenever you want."
10:33,080;10:35,080;"I'm watching it right now."
10:35,080;10:36,080;"All right."
10:36,080;10:43,640;"So we're talking about week six of the 2001 season, and we've gotten to the first game"
10:43,640;10:47,680;"that you can actually call by name."
10:47,680;10:53,840;"I think if you said the David Patton game to any Pat's fan who was around during this"
10:53,840;10:58,400;"season, they would immediately know which game you're talking about."
10:58,400;11:02,040;"So I think maybe we start there."
11:02,040;11:05,280;"Let's start with David Patton."
11:05,280;11:11,160;"For those who haven't watched this game or became fans after this season or anything"
11:11,160;11:17,360;"like that, the reason it's called the David Patton game is because he was the first player"
11:17,360;11:24,680;"since Walter Payton back in 1979 to run, catch, and throw a touchdown pass."
11:24,680;11:32,000;"Well, I'll touch down in general, I suppose you don't run a touchdown pass."
11:32,000;11:35,640;"And he did it all in the first half of this football game."
11:35,640;11:41,280;"And actually just over a quarter, it was like a quarter and a half."
11:41,280;11:42,880;"He did it very quickly."
11:42,880;11:47,040;"Steve, what did you think about David Patton?"
11:47,040;11:48,040;"Did you..."
11:48,040;11:49,040;"Is this something you remembered?"
11:49,040;11:50,040;"Oh, yeah."
11:50,040;11:54,120;"This is the first game that I remember, really from this season."
11:54,120;11:59,120;"then rewatching it on that passing TD he had."
11:59,120;12:00,540;"- Yeah."
12:00,540;12:04,380;"- Literally the exact same play as the Edelman Todola."
12:04,380;12:05,820;"- Yes, yes it was."
12:05,820;12:08,440;"- He was blocking front of it, it's the same setup."
12:08,440;12:11,680;"And it's the same route with Troy Brown being Amandola."
12:11,680;12:12,680;"- Yeah."
12:12,680;12:13,520;"- It's crazy."
12:13,520;12:17,280;"- And I think the path from both of those wide receivers"
12:17,280;12:19,040;"was spot on."
12:19,040;12:19,880;"- Oh yeah."
12:19,880;12:22,440;"- I don't know, do we know if David Patton"
12:22,440;12:24,040;"was a quarterback at any time in his career?"
12:24,040;12:26,520;"'cause that throw was, it was a dime."
12:26,520;12:28,400;"- Right, Brown didn't even break stride, he was just gone."
12:28,400;12:31,240;"- No, and you just dropped it right in his bucket."
12:31,240;12:32,360;"It was a perfect throw."
12:32,360;12:33,680;"And it's not like it was a short one either,"
12:33,680;12:35,520;"it was similar to Element."
12:35,520;12:37,320;"It was around like the 50-yard line or so."
12:37,320;12:38,680;"- Yeah, it was bomb."
12:38,680;12:40,040;"- And they called it."
12:40,040;12:42,160;"- Well, all three of those touchdowns"
12:42,160;12:45,640;"were pretty like spectacular in nature."
12:45,640;12:47,600;"- Oh yeah, absolutely."
12:47,600;12:50,600;"But I was reading the, the, the,"
12:50,600;12:53,520;"the post-game bossing globe."
12:53,520;12:57,600;"And one of the articles was Charlie Weiss,"
12:57,600;12:59,040;"and they were asking about the game plan."
12:59,040;13:01,960;"And basically, Weiss was saying that he knew"
13:01,960;13:04,480;"that the Colts would probably sell out or overreact"
13:04,480;13:06,840;"to stop the run on first down,"
13:06,840;13:08,960;"because the last time they met him,"
13:08,960;13:11,960;"they gave up 177 yards on the ground."
13:11,960;13:16,960;"So they decided to just take shots on first down,"
13:16,960;13:20,680;"basically every time in the first half."
13:20,680;13:25,380;"And so the first play from Screamage was the reverse"
13:25,380;13:28,400;"to counter that overreaction and selling out in the run."
13:28,400;13:30,260;"And that worked for touchdown."
13:30,260;13:33,200;"- Well, didn't they have a tree now for that though?"
13:33,200;13:34,040;"- That's dead."
13:34,040;13:38,560;"- No, that was their first try because, so yeah,"
13:38,560;13:41,180;"let's start from the beginning."
13:41,180;13:44,600;"The first drive again, cold cut the ball first,"
13:44,600;13:46,840;"drove immediately down the field,"
13:46,840;13:48,440;"which they would do all game."
13:49,560;13:53,880;"kind of petered out in the red zone and then went to kick what was basically a"
13:53,880;14:00,560;"chip shot field goals like a 20s like 2730 yarder field goal from like a"
14:00,560;14:08,880;"Vanderjerk and he got a blocked. And so the paths recovered it and returned it to"
14:08,880;14:15,320;"the Colts 30. And then the first play after that was the reverse, which went"
14:15,320;14:22,740;"for touchdown. Yeah. No, I think. Yeah, so what is I think it's just reverse"
14:22,740;14:29,440;"because it was like a pitch to the left and then the reverse coming from the left"
14:29,440;14:34,220;"to the right. So I think it's I think that's a reverse, but I don't know what an"
14:34,220;14:38,180;"end around is. I think that's just when the the receivers coming and he gets"
14:38,180;14:41,780;"it. Let's just call it a double reverse because it sounds way more badass."
14:41,860;14:43,860;"Yeah, I fair enough."
14:43,860;14:47,020;"So, yeah, so they scored on what we were calling a double reverse"
14:47,020;14:48,660;"because it's badass."
14:48,660;14:53,220;"And that was the first offensive play of the game for the Patriots,"
14:53,220;14:55,980;"which started on a cold 30 and went for a touchdown."
14:55,980;15:00,140;"3D4."
15:00,140;15:03,860;"And, yeah, he was actually the lead blocker."
15:03,860;15:07,740;"They pulled, I think it was the center and him and the two of them"
15:07,740;15:09,580;"were the lead blocker on that play."
15:09,580;15:11,580;"He had a signature"
15:11,580;15:16,080;"I put blocker in quotes in my notes"
15:16,080;15:21,500;"That's on best block of ever seen pretty bro. You watch him block now. He doesn't do any of that"
15:21,500;15:24,940;"He like if you watch him block now, it's exactly fucking safe"
15:24,940;15:29,860;"He just gets in front of a guy and falls over and they have to jump over him and that slows him down long enough"
15:29,860;15:31,860;"I could block"
15:31,860;15:36,180;"That's probably the only thing you can do better than him. Yes, I would agree with that"
15:37,980;15:40,180;"Yeah, I'm faster than Brady too."
15:40,180;15:42,340;"I don't know."
15:42,340;15:43,580;"He's gotten faster now."
15:43,580;15:50,540;"But apparently, I think we touched on it when you guys are in here,"
15:50,540;15:55,500;"but we looked it up and Brady and Vince Wilfork ran about the same 40 time."
15:55,500;15:59,980;"Yeah, I keep getting a guy at work trying to faster for them, Brady,"
15:59,980;16:00,980;"because he thinks he's faster."
16:00,980;16:07,540;"But yeah, so if you look up Brady's 40 was."
16:07,540;16:17,540;"5.28 seconds and Wilfork was 40 seconds."
16:17,540;16:20,540;"Vince Wilfork was faster by 2/10 of a second."
16:20,540;16:23,540;"Well, I think those Wilfork's pretty fast."
16:23,540;16:24,540;"He's a ball."
16:24,540;16:26,540;"He's even played basketball and hard knocks."
16:26,540;16:27,540;"Oh, yeah."
16:27,540;16:31,540;"Well, he keeps calling out Kobe every time he drains a shot."
16:31,540;16:34,540;"Yeah, he's pretty sure he called out Vlade D-Vac."
16:34,540;16:38,980;"one. He did. The most ridiculous person to compare yourself there."
16:38,980;16:43,220;"He's amazing, but he's he's nimble for a big dude. I've had a couple of"
16:43,220;16:47,820;"interceptions. And I think on one of them, he had a what you could"
16:47,820;16:50,260;"generously call a juke move and then a stiff arm."
16:50,260;16:55,060;"Man's a multi talented,"
16:55,060;16:56,540;"how about work?"
16:56,540;17:01,980;"Damn right. Who we will see eventually on this podcast, but let's not"
17:01,980;17:10,300;"spoil that. So yeah, so I mean, this was basically how this game went, at least in the first half"
17:10,300;17:15,660;"where the Colts would literally just waltz down the field, get into the red zone. This is like the"
17:15,660;17:22,940;"early bend don't break defense from the Patriots, which was frustrating a little bit."
17:22,940;17:30,300;"But then as soon as I think they mentioned a stat, I kind of only caught it briefly."
17:30,300;17:36,300;"And I think they said that the Colts had scored a touchdown on every red zone possession they'd had up until that point in the season"
17:36,300;17:39,260;"And yeah, they scored"
17:39,260;17:45,100;"Yeah, that's right. Yeah, and then in this game they were one for like five or six. Oh, they really did"
17:45,100;17:50,620;"Yeah, so the first one they went down and had the field goal blocked and um"
17:50,620;17:53,180;"Which leads me to talk about"
17:53,180;17:55,980;"Mike van der jack"
17:55,980;18:00,140;"Watching this game with the earrings and everything I look"
18:00,140;18:02,140;"- Yeah, I've got to."
18:02,140;18:05,760;"- And he looks like a nerdy football version of Dane Cook."
18:05,760;18:07,500;"- Okay."
18:07,500;18:08,620;"- I can see that."
18:08,620;18:11,260;"- He is the football version of Dane Cook."
18:11,260;18:13,420;"- I kept trying to see if he had both ears pierced"
18:13,420;18:14,700;"or just one."
18:14,700;18:16,020;"- I think it was both."
18:16,020;18:18,100;"- I mean, like my gut tells me it's both,"
18:18,100;18:19,260;"but I couldn't confirm that."
18:19,260;18:22,340;"- Yeah, no, I had the same gut feeling."
18:22,340;18:25,020;"I watched, no, and they never quite showed it"
18:25,020;18:26,780;"where he turned his head so you could see both of them,"
18:26,780;18:29,660;"but I'm pretty sure it was both ears."
18:29,660;18:36,120;"I think they were like big fucking diamonds too. They weren't just like little things. They were like obvious"
18:36,120;18:39,580;"Kelly says that was like the thing back then"
18:39,580;18:44,280;"Double our red earrings style expert"
18:44,280;18:48,020;"Tie-daw shirt and"
18:48,020;18:52,220;"Yeah, Kelly is no taster. She's married to you Greg"
18:58,180;19:00,180;"Oh, did you do?"
19:00,180;19:12,260;"Did you know that Vander Jack was on that movie the garbage picking feel girl kicking Philadelphia phenomenon with Tony Deale"
19:12,260;19:15,580;"He was the stunt double"
19:15,580;19:20,740;"Did he get any kicks blocked"
19:22,220;19:26,460;"Not that he was a phenomenon. Oh, well, he wasn't in this game because"
19:26,460;19:30,580;"not to spoil the surprise but"
19:30,580;19:35,140;"of the five drives in the first quarter"
19:35,140;19:42,380;"The Colts drove into the red zone three three on all three of their drives"
19:42,380;19:47,780;"Had three field goal attempts and had more of them blocked than actually made"
19:50,340;19:52,340;"because on"
19:52,340;19:57,560;"So the paths you know score their touchdown cult immediately drive down the field and actually kick a field goal"
19:57,560;20:03,540;"And the pages go three and out which I think was the only time they did that in this game"
20:03,540;20:08,360;"Like all right here you go the culture culture gonna start doing their thing"
20:08,360;20:14,140;"Cult hit a deep pass to Harrison Marvin Harrison"
20:15,300;20:19,340;"Who I thought was a bit of a div in this game every time he fell over"
20:19,340;20:24,320;"He long off the field and then came back on like two plays later completely fine"
20:24,320;20:30,560;"Actually, I have that stat that you're talking about Andy I wrote down. What is it? They were seven for seven on gold and goes"
20:30,560;20:34,260;"That's what it was when they got that big pass play"
20:34,260;20:40,060;"Yeah at that point in the season. So yeah, so pretty good down"
20:40,740;20:42,740;"Because it was like a it was a broken"
20:42,740;20:48,520;"Coverage and Harrison was wide open and I believe it was to Bucky Jones ran his ass down"
20:48,520;20:54,300;"He caught him at the three and literally like horse tackled the shit out of them horse call it the shit out of them"
20:54,300;20:56,940;"There are so many horse callers in these games"
20:56,940;21:01,680;"So that saved the touchdown and but it set them up set up the Colts it"
21:01,680;21:04,580;"first single from the two I think it was and"
21:04,580;21:08,660;"Like you said they they had scored a touch hour every single goal to go"
21:09,820;21:12,720;"Possessions they had had all season seven for seven or whatever it was"
21:12,720;21:15,900;"And the Colts go three and out from there"
21:15,900;21:18,900;"Just like didn't look good"
21:18,900;21:25,660;"So pages hold them to a field goal and they're literally kicking a field goal from you know line of scrimmage with the two yard line"
21:25,660;21:27,660;"And it gets blocked again"
21:27,660;21:29,980;"And a look on"
21:29,980;21:31,980;"Dane Cook's face was amazing"
21:31,980;21:37,300;"It was up there with Peyton Manning which we'll get to I think later in this game"
21:37,740;21:42,960;"So many good many faces. Oh, it's so good. Yeah, and so"
21:42,960;21:50,020;"Didn't it wasn't to Vanderjack said again. It's a Vanderjack a drunk -"
21:50,020;21:52,940;"That was a rumor. Yeah"
21:52,940;21:54,940;"There's like a thing between him and Manning"
21:54,940;22:00,020;"Where they're off season calling each other out and like man follow the drunk"
22:00,020;22:03,340;"Yeah, and they would they use to blame each other for all sorts of shit"
22:03,340;22:08,080;"Because when they're like a playoff game against the Steelers where he missed what should have been the game winner"
22:08,080;22:13,880;"Yep, yeah, when oh cuz it was the steals were driving for a touchdown and they fumbled it"
22:13,880;22:19,520;"And then like Rothace burger ran the guy down and they had to settle for field goal and they missed it or some shit"
22:19,520;22:23,640;"Yeah, I found it there were down three and he missed a field goal of forty six"
22:23,640;22:28,880;"Yeah, the tie it right right exactly. Yeah, it's helmet on the ground picked up"
22:28,880;22:31,160;"You know what unsportsman like"
22:32,680;22:41,160;"fucking useless. So yeah, so he had two field goals blocked in the first quarter of this game."
22:41,160;22:53,880;"And they set a stat where he up to that point, he had had 100 field goal attempts before this game"
22:53,880;23:00,520;"and had had two of them blocked in those 100 kicks. And then he doubled that today and just"
23:00,520;23:04,480;"look like garbage. Even I was he he was a good kicker, right?"
23:04,480;23:06,000;"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
23:06,000;23:08,320;"Because I mean, he couldn't even do kickoffs."
23:08,320;23:11,720;"Like his kickoffs would reach like the 13 yard line."
23:11,720;23:15,520;"I feel like all of them are like that in this day and age."
23:15,520;23:19,480;"Well, I thought Vittatori was at least getting it like inside the five pretty much"
23:19,480;23:21,280;"every time. Yeah."
23:21,280;23:23,160;"Everyone's a while ago in the end of the day, but"
23:23,160;23:26,520;"Venerjack wasn't even close on any of them."
23:29,800;23:33,040;"So that's the end of the first quarter was the block field goal."
23:33,040;23:38,680;"So second quarter was a couple of drives that ended in puns."
23:38,680;23:43,560;"And then there's like a field possession game."
23:43,560;23:49,280;"Colts punted it and pinned the pages back on their nine yard line."
23:49,280;23:50,400;"My math is correct."
23:50,400;23:57,680;"And first play is Brady hitting patent on the 91 year touchdown, which was at the"
23:57,680;24:07,400;"time the longest play in Patriots history, which I wrote it down somewhere."
24:07,400;24:09,800;"Is there any more between that one and the Welker one?"
24:09,800;24:13,360;"Oh, you're right."
24:13,360;24:13,520;"Yeah."
24:13,520;24:16,480;"Cause the Welker one is now officially it's the longest play."
24:16,480;24:17,080;"Yeah."
24:17,080;24:17,480;"Don't get it."
24:17,480;24:18,520;"Cause it's 99 yards."
24:18,520;24:18,920;"That's right."
24:18,920;24:18,960;"Yeah."
24:18,960;24:19,440;"Yeah."
24:19,440;24:23,800;"Uh, I wonder if there's only like 92s or threes or fours."
24:23,800;24:24,440;"I don't remember."
24:25,440;24:29,040;"Well, probably come across them, but I can't think of any off the top of my head."
24:29,040;24:30,040;"You can drag."
24:30,040;24:32,400;"No, nothing comes to mind."
24:32,400;24:35,000;"Did you happen to catch Steve?"
24:35,000;24:39,880;"Um, what the record was broken on that 91 year pass fly."
24:39,880;24:41,280;"Like who held it before."
24:41,280;24:47,760;"It was a 90 yard touchdown from Tony Eason to Craig James of all people."
24:47,760;24:50,560;"Oh my goodness."
24:50,560;24:53,960;"Those are some, those are some names."
24:53,960;24:57,640;"I suppose you guys are probably a little bit too young for those names, but like a running back maybe"
24:57,640;25:02,120;"Craig James, I believe yeah, but Tony Eason was"
25:02,120;25:10,360;"Supposed to be Drew Bloods up before Drew Bloods. Oh, basically right and fucking wasn't I"
25:10,360;25:13,680;"Think he was the one that got"
25:13,680;25:17,640;"Manhandled in the Super Bowl against the Bears back in the day right?"
25:17,640;25:20,200;"It's that guy"
25:20,200;25:23,760;"So yeah, so that was literally the first play of that drive"
25:23,760;25:30,240;"So cold skip the kickoff and I think that's I don't know that comes up soon"
25:30,240;25:35,880;"Cold skip the ball back go three and out real ugly drive. You can tell that the"
25:35,880;25:38,360;"Patriots defense is"
25:38,360;25:44,360;"Confusing the shit out of Manning and Manning had a rough day in this. I think he ended up like decent numbers"
25:45,360;25:50,420;"He did yeah, so if you look at the the game says he actually did okay"
25:50,420;25:53,760;"That not the story of his career or what?"
25:53,760;25:58,940;"Yeah, I mean it definitely is well great numbers"
25:58,940;26:04,860;"But yeah, I mean let's see in this game alone"
26:04,860;26:10,400;"Yeah, 22 or 34 335 yards and a touchdown"
26:10,920;26:16,540;"But he was sacked for four four times and he had a fumble that will get too soon enough"
26:16,540;26:19,600;"Because that was embarrassing. Oh, yeah"
26:19,600;26:25,760;"But actually on the season they showed a stat that coming into this game. He'd thrown nine touchdowns and nine interceptions already"
26:25,760;26:30,560;"But I mean he threw a handful of those I"
26:30,560;26:35,960;"Guess in the week against Patriots which two of those got return for touchdowns"
26:35,960;26:38,520;"And then I think he threw three the week before this as well"
26:38,520;26:43,800;"You're moving the end of the season pretty even like one to one or close to it. Yeah, I think he was yeah"
26:43,800;26:46,840;"It was not a great"
26:46,840;26:49,560;"Look for him, but he he got"
26:49,560;26:51,640;"um"
26:51,640;26:53,720;"He got absolutely lit up in this game too"
26:53,720;26:57,720;"Well, like one play I think it was in the second quarter where he like"
26:57,720;27:03,880;"Ghost is scramble. Mm-hmm. And he starts taking a couple steps and realizes this is the wrong decision"
27:05,720;27:08,500;"Kind of does the awkwardly slide gets like blown up."
27:08,500;27:09,280;"Yeah."
27:09,280;27:11,760;"He's just started looking for someone to blame."
27:11,760;27:14,000;"Oh my God, just constantly."
27:14,000;27:19,400;"Yeah, because he got he got hit from the front and then also somebody coming"
27:19,400;27:20,680;"around the back absolutely."
27:20,680;27:22,480;"Oh, no, that was a different manning witch."
27:22,480;27:23,160;"That one was."
27:23,160;27:25,640;"Right."
27:25,640;27:26,960;"And that was the hit I was talking about."
27:26,960;27:28,960;"It was for the manning witch."
27:28,960;27:29,760;"Yeah."
27:29,760;27:32,480;"Cause it's the hardest I've ever seen him get hit."
27:33,600;27:37,920;"And you could tell like he probably should have taken a playoff."
27:37,920;27:40,120;"Um, that's actually coming out real soon."
27:40,120;27:41,560;"So let's, let's not spoil that surprise."
27:41,560;27:47,120;"But before that, the Colts had a three and out where it was, you know, one of those"
27:47,120;27:49,400;"things where Manning had no idea what he was doing."
27:49,400;27:54,080;"Seeing ghosts at Sam Donald would say, um, getting hit all over the place, not"
27:54,080;27:55,280;"really sure what's going on."
27:55,280;27:57,360;"So they go three and out, put them all back to Patriots."
27:58,240;28:05,680;"The next play, first down, the culture looking for the run and the pages pull off the"
28:05,680;28:12,800;"trick pass, the Brady to Patton to Brown touchdown on the first play of the drive."
28:12,800;28:20,720;"So now already halfway through the second quarter, the fifth drive of the second quarter,"
28:21,680;28:26,480;"Patton has completed his trifecta, which is fucking amazing."
28:26,480;28:31,000;"But like we said already at the beginning, the throw was an absolute"
28:31,000;28:33,440;"diamonds drop right in the bucket."
28:33,440;28:37,760;"And Troy Brad, I wrote and this like I had seen it before, like on"
28:37,760;28:42,160;"puns and stuff, but he makes every catch that he makes just look easy."
28:42,160;28:43,400;"Like he's not even trying."
28:43,400;28:44,880;"Like he just."
28:44,880;28:47,040;"Okay."
28:47,040;28:48,840;"Yeah, he's got awesome hands."
28:49,560;28:53,640;"Yeah, but it's just like, he just kind of like tosses his hands out there right the last second."
28:53,640;28:54,760;"The ball just like drops in them."
28:54,760;29:00,400;"Like even even puns, it looks like he's just catching him on his hip without really trying."
29:00,400;29:02,400;"You know, it's just"
29:02,400;29:05,000;"Muffled against Miami, though."
29:05,000;29:10,240;"He did. Yeah. And he made a comment after that game where"
29:10,240;29:15,880;"because they had cut into the beginning of the game for some like news announcement"
29:16,680;29:20,160;"And they were telling him about that, about how the game was on TV."
29:20,160;29:23,240;"Like, uh, was, was my punt muff on TV?"
29:23,240;29:24,400;"They're like, yeah, we caught that."
29:24,400;29:25,000;"It's like, damn it."
29:25,000;29:28,680;"So."
29:28,680;29:30,000;"Yeah."
29:30,000;29:35,360;"So the Patriots go and first play from scrimmage, trick play touchdown."
29:35,360;29:42,920;"And then the Colts get the ball back and, um, on the kickoff, drop it, drop the"
29:42,920;29:45,560;"kickoff, get pinned at the two, their own two yard line."
29:46,480;29:48,280;"Um, start driving again."
29:48,280;29:52,240;"And this is the one with the Manning, which he gets absolutely plastered."
29:52,240;29:57,680;"And, um, and you can tell these hurt because I think actually one of the defenders"
29:57,680;29:58,280;"got hurt too."
29:58,280;30:01,240;"Like it was, it was a pretty brutal collision."
30:01,240;30:05,240;"And so Manning was able to kind of like recover while they're"
30:05,240;30:06,960;"carting off the page's defender."
30:06,960;30:09,320;"So the next player that decided they're going to run the ball,"
30:09,320;30:12,400;"handed off to Edgar and James, who immediately fumbles the ball back to the"
30:12,400;30:12,960;"Patriots."
30:12,960;30:14,960;"So soft."
30:15,320;30:16,520;"That's my own set."
30:16,520;30:17,520;"So, yeah."
30:17,520;30:22,960;"Well, actually, I was the one that was ragging on for being soft in that last game, I think."
30:22,960;30:25,200;"And I thought he actually played better this game."
30:25,200;30:28,760;"He was actually running through people and making people miss."
30:28,760;30:31,680;"But I think that's probably has to do with him playing on the dome and it being a quick"
30:31,680;30:34,440;"surface and all that."
30:34,440;30:38,720;"But yeah, so, Paige, get the ball back."
30:38,720;30:43,240;"Immediately, they actually drive down the field, get to the red zone and instead of having"
30:43,240;30:49,320;"their field goal block, they decide to throw a touchdown, play action, Brady to Wiggins."
30:49,320;30:54,560;"That very typical one that you've seen probably for the last 20 years now, but they line up"
30:54,560;30:56,760;"in the heavy set."
30:56,760;31:00,320;"Everybody plays like it's a run except for the tight end or someone like that who just"
31:00,320;31:04,120;"kind of does a quick little in pattern."
31:04,120;31:08,000;"And Brady doesn't even look, he just kind of fakes the hand off, spins around, just"
31:08,000;31:10,400;"trucks it towards the back of the end zone."
31:10,400;31:15,520;"Just your very stereotypical Patriots red zone touchdown."
31:15,520;31:16,680;"They don't see anymore."
31:16,680;31:23,420;"And then that's just about the half."
31:23,420;31:25,080;"Colts had one last drive."
31:25,080;31:32,400;"Super sloppy, but they managed to get into Pat's territory and just barely managed to"
31:32,400;31:33,160;"kick a field goal."
31:33,160;31:37,640;"So at the half we're looking at 26 and this game is fucking over."
31:37,640;31:45,360;"The one they want to bring up about the that last drive though the Colts is I think they"
31:45,360;31:52,160;"were at a bit of a disadvantage because the play clock at the RCA dome like this."
31:52,160;31:53,960;"I don't know if all the stadiums were this bad."
31:53,960;31:57,200;"We just don't remember because that's how it was back in the day."
31:57,200;32:00,760;"But these stadiums were kind of hot garbage."
32:00,760;32:07,120;"Like the RCA dome then like they had the shitty turf but they their clocks like the game clock"
32:07,120;32:11,440;"wasn't working through two and a half quarters."
32:11,440;32:14,920;"Like they finally got him back on at the end of like the third quarter,"
32:14,920;32:17,640;"so they hadn't put the fourth quarter, but there's no game clock."
32:17,640;32:19,960;"So the time was just being kept by the referee on the field."
32:19,960;32:23,200;"And everyone's a while, like, there's eight minutes left in the quarter."
32:23,200;32:25,760;"Yeah."
32:25,760;32:30,240;"And I think that was part of partly to blame for the Colts, like."
32:30,240;32:34,520;"Trying to drive down, not knowing how much time is left on the clock and all"
32:34,520;32:38,280;"stuff is kind of like calling shitty timeouts when they have plenty of time left or not calling"
32:38,280;32:43,160;"timeouts because they don't have much time they have left but it was just kind of a"
32:43,160;32:50,920;"shitty all i'm saying if that happened at jaleste idiom there'd be something gate attached to it"
32:50,920;32:58,520;"oh 100 yeah yeah well if they happen anywhere in the age of social media people would lose their"
32:58,520;33:04,280;"minds yeah no that's very true actually if they really would there's so much more accountability"
33:04,280;33:05,480;"the stuff like that."
33:05,480;33:12,320;"Yeah, I mean, I think it's I think it's gonna be more so with the"
33:12,320;33:16,040;"Patriots, though. I mean, you're still hearing about headsets"
33:16,040;33:17,960;"going out all over the place, but the only time it ever actually"
33:17,960;33:19,680;"makes the news is when it happens in July."
33:19,680;33:21,920;"Oh, my podcast."
33:21,920;33:26,680;"Well, yeah, who the fuck else is gonna do a podcast going back"
33:26,680;33:28,760;"and rewatching Patriots game from 2000?"
33:28,760;33:30,760;"I wanted this later, Andy."
33:30,760;33:35,000;"Later, you destroy this phone."
33:35,000;33:38,840;"Nobody else is docked at footballs and bragged about it."
33:38,840;33:41,000;"You're not a big call on TV."
33:41,000;33:44,960;"Yeah, no problem."
33:44,960;33:46,000;"The podcast, Greg."
33:46,000;33:47,360;"I'll see you anyway."
33:47,360;33:50,640;"Yeah, you can get back on when you become a home again."
33:50,640;33:52,080;"Yeah, that's right."
33:52,080;33:54,200;"We don't have roofed doubters on this podcast."
33:54,200;33:54,600;"Thank you very much."
33:54,600;33:55,240;"Greg, you're out."
33:55,240;33:58,040;"Kelly, you're in."
33:58,040;34:02,380;"was that Kelly thoughts on deflakie"
34:02,380;34:03,900;"well she"
34:03,900;34:06,660;"Kelly said great you're out"
34:06,660;34:09,140;"I mean you didn't even watch the game Greg so what are you complaining about"
34:09,140;34:10,140;"yeah"
34:10,140;34:12,660;"highlights in the last ten minutes"
34:12,660;34:18,780;"yes go to Kelly so she's just as important"
34:18,780;34:22,140;"you know just for that I hear is what I'm gonna do I'm gonna I'm gonna go out and"
34:22,140;34:23,140;"say that uh"
34:23,140;34:25,720;"thai lotta not have a good game this game"
34:25,720;34:27,200;"how dare you"
34:27,200;34:30,620;"that i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm happy with me"
34:30,620;34:31,800;"forty yards"
34:31,800;34:34,900;"and marvin harris i went off in this game"
34:34,900;34:37,040;"did they only give up seventeen points"
34:37,040;34:39,760;"according to the scoreboard that i'm with this"
34:39,760;34:41,900;"this is true but marvin harris and"
34:41,900;34:42,780;"basically"
34:42,780;34:45,460;"eight-thai lofel lunch"
34:45,460;34:47,980;"there is hamstrings acting up"
34:47,980;34:50,780;"he had a bad night sleep the night before"
34:50,780;34:52,960;"yet and harris and still"
34:52,960;34:54,480;"with all that against him."
34:54,480;35:00,280;"Man, it's a although there were that I mean, I think it was a lot of scheme stuff"
35:00,280;35:06,040;"because some of the replays, the commentators didn't actually notice I"
35:06,040;35:08,600;"don't think because it wasn't as prevalent back then as it is now, but"
35:08,600;35:12,040;"there was a whole lot of what nowadays would be called this offensive"
35:12,040;35:15,880;"passing appearance with like the crossers kind of like throw in a shoulder"
35:15,880;35:18,480;"into the trailing defensive backs ownership."
35:19,000;35:24,400;"So there's a lot of that happening, especially in like the two minute drives and stuff like that."
35:24,400;35:30,240;"So I think there was a lot of scheming to get Harrison open on tie law, but."
35:30,240;35:34,200;"He still got lit up just in general."
35:34,200;35:37,240;"There's way more like we see now that's a penalty."
35:37,240;35:37,920;"That's a penalty."
35:37,920;35:38,680;"That's a penalty."
35:38,680;35:38,920;"Just."
35:38,920;35:39,640;"Oh my God."
35:39,640;35:39,840;"Yes."
35:39,840;35:40,440;"All the time."
35:40,440;35:41,960;"Just constantly."
35:41,960;35:43,320;"Yeah."
35:43,320;35:46,680;"Um, so yeah, so we're at the half."
35:46,680;35:48,640;"Um, and then coming out of the half."
35:48,640;35:56,540;"They showed a couple of different stats, which kind of surprised me."
35:56,540;36:04,420;"The first was that the Pats this year at the half here had outscored the Colts 48-6 in"
36:04,420;36:11,060;"the first half of games this season, which is, I mean, usually you would think it'd be"
36:11,060;36:15,820;"the other way because the Colts putting up points, but like that's really bad."
36:15,820;36:19,860;"And the other one that was kind of the opposite was that so far this season, the pages have"
36:19,860;36:26,180;"been outscored 44 to 10 in the third quarter, which is exactly the opposite of what you"
36:26,180;36:33,420;"would expect from a Belichick team who, especially nowadays, kind of almost seemed to just be"
36:33,420;36:37,580;"playing a little bit vanilla in the first half to figure out what adjustments need to be"
36:37,580;36:38,580;"made."
36:38,580;36:42,660;"They go in at halftime, make the adjustments come out and just absolutely put the screws"
36:42,660;36:44,580;"to whoever they're playing."
36:44,580;36:50,860;"Um, but it sounds like I'm the only one that found that interesting."
36:50,860;36:55,420;"So I'm more about the clutch quarterback poll they tried to put out there."
36:55,420;36:58,580;"I actually, I took a screenshot of that."
36:58,580;37:00,740;"The NFL.com interactive poll."
37:00,740;37:06,460;"Um, and it is your team has two minutes left, 80 yards to go, no timeouts and you're down"
37:06,460;37:07,900;"four points."
37:07,900;37:10,220;"Which QB do you want leading your team?"
37:10,220;37:11,220;"Here are your options."
37:11,220;37:12,220;"Oh, okay."
37:12,220;37:18,500;"Marino, Brett Favre, John Elway, Joe Montana, Phil Sims, or Troy Aikman."
37:18,500;37:20,060;"And that's okay."
37:20,060;37:25,980;"The caveat here was, I don't know what your answer was, but he said, just so you know,"
37:25,980;37:30,300;"we're not saying it's Joe Montana, or not saying it's Joe Montana now, of course, it's"
37:30,300;37:32,020;"Joe Montana at his peak."
37:32,020;37:33,020;"Hmm."
37:33,020;37:34,020;"Good clarification."
37:34,020;37:35,020;"Right."
37:35,020;37:37,500;"And they are on Joe Montana."
37:37,500;37:38,500;"Oh, yeah."
37:38,500;37:39,500;"Yeah."
37:39,500;37:43,500;"Who were the commentators in this? It was I and Eagle and Solomon Wilcox."
37:43,500;37:52,500;"And I believe Solomon Wilcox has something along the lines of I've seen him beat me in a Super Bowl in a two-minute drill."
37:52,500;37:54,500;"So I'll take him or something like that."
37:54,500;37:56,500;"Ian, he's there?"
37:56,500;37:57,500;"Yes."
37:57,500;37:58,500;"Not on him."
37:58,500;37:59,500;"Not on him yet."
37:59,500;38:04,500;"Good. I've said that a few times. I don't know if you were there for..."
38:04,500;38:05,500;"Yeah, such a bull."
38:05,500;38:06,500;"He's done so far."
38:06,500;38:11,220;"far, but yeah, I mean, you can't spell IAN and then say it's IAN. It's not, it's IAN."
38:11,220;38:17,300;"Imagine naming your kid, especially in that day and age without like millennial names or"
38:17,300;38:25,060;"teaching. Like actually it's pronounced IAN. That'd be like, Steve, you're like, no, actually,"
38:25,060;38:29,700;"actually it's Stefan. Yeah, exactly. With a pH. Like, no, you're Steven."
38:32,740;38:39,620;"But I know that usually this is the time where I will get riled up about the"
38:39,620;38:41,620;"commentating. But I actually thought they were pretty good."
38:41,620;38:42,900;"Oh, good."
38:42,900;38:46,620;"In this game, because there was one spot where they actually explain what"
38:46,620;38:52,100;"cover two defense was, which was actually really interesting."
38:52,100;38:56,700;"And then they kept coming back to be like, Oh, so that's the reason that Harrison"
38:56,700;38:59,580;"was open in the middle of heels because the cover two and the safeties had"
38:59,580;39:01,340;"and split out wide to cover guys over there."
39:01,340;39:05,700;"And I thought it was actually interesting to hear"
39:05,700;39:08,500;"something useful from football commentators."
39:08,500;39:09,940;"- Yeah, I thought there wasn't a lot of X-Zones."
39:09,940;39:11,580;"I was back then."
39:11,580;39:12,700;"- No, there definitely wasn't."
39:12,700;39:14,900;"But so to hear that was actually,"
39:14,900;39:16,100;"well at least that I remember,"
39:16,100;39:19,660;"but to hear that was kind of surprising in a nice way."
39:19,660;39:21,340;"- Yeah, like Baldly wasn't breaking it down"
39:21,340;39:22,780;"on Twitter after the game at all."
39:22,780;39:25,540;"- Exactly, yeah, you didn't have Tony Romo"
39:25,540;39:26,780;"calling out what the play was gonna be"
39:26,780;39:28,700;"before it happened sort of thing."
39:28,700;39:31,100;"All these breakdowns are must watch."
39:31,100;39:32,240;"- Good, fantastic."
39:32,240;39:34,580;"- They're so good."
39:34,580;39:35,420;"- All those boys too."
39:35,420;39:36,420;"- Yeah, yeah."
39:36,420;39:37,260;"- Yeah, he's getting--"
39:37,260;39:40,420;"- That man loves him some offensive line play."
39:40,420;39:41,260;"- Yeah."
39:41,260;39:42,100;"- That's who loves it."
39:42,100;39:42,940;"- Yeah."
39:42,940;39:46,620;"But speaking of that,"
39:46,620;39:49,180;"shitty commentating and collecting feedback,"
39:49,180;39:51,820;"dude, they were saying the other night"
39:51,820;39:55,140;"that Seattle San Francisco game that went into overtime."
39:55,140;39:55,980;"- Oh yeah."
39:55,980;40:00,980;"Russell Wilson was the most clutch quarterback playing in the game today."
40:00,980;40:07,980;"What an outrageous statement when the play is known for is throwing a pick."
40:07,980;40:10,980;"In the stupid ball, the play is in the..."
40:10,980;40:14,980;"You could say Tom Brady is not the best quarterback, whatever, like skill wise,"
40:14,980;40:17,980;"but undoubtedly the most clutch."
40:17,980;40:20,980;"Yeah, I mean, look what he did at the end of last season."
40:20,980;40:24,980;"And then Russell Wilson just goes and throws an intersectional over time."
40:24,980;40:26,980;"I"
40:26,980;40:29,460;"Was"
40:29,460;40:32,820;"Greg's back on the"
40:32,820;40:39,100;"Love it that's better. That's what we like to hear yeah"
40:39,100;40:44,940;"Most while playing in our game today. What an asshole garbage"
40:44,940;40:54,340;"All right, let's talk about the second half of this game I did actually watch it even though not much happened"
40:54,340;41:06,020;"And the third quarter, the only real exciting thing was Harrison beating tight law on a"
41:06,020;41:12,020;"corner fade for a touchdown, the first touchdown and the only touchdown they called scar."
41:12,020;41:16,860;"And so, yeah, because what did they end up with?"
41:16,860;41:17,860;"17?"
41:17,860;41:18,860;"Yeah, they went for two."
41:18,860;41:19,860;"I got it."
41:19,860;41:20,860;"Oh, that's right."
41:20,860;41:21,860;"Yeah."
41:21,860;41:26,420;"even though it didn't look like they did, but I think that was just the guy's helmet"
41:26,420;41:31,300;"getting knocked off against it so hard."
41:31,300;41:32,820;"So that was kind of the record."
41:32,820;41:34,100;"A couple of field goals happened."
41:34,100;41:35,100;"Nothing exciting."
41:35,100;41:42,580;"The beginning of the fourth quarter was what I think was Brady's play of the game."
41:42,580;41:47,580;"I actually ripped a highlight of it because Brady,"
41:47,580;41:53,380;"it was one of those Brady avoiding pressure in the pocket,"
41:53,380;41:56,260;"but just by taking a couple steps here and there."
41:56,260;41:58,860;"And then he stepped up to the line of scrimmage"
41:58,860;42:01,660;"and realized that he was real close to it."
42:01,660;42:04,580;"And so, but he had Troy Brown running down fields."
42:04,580;42:05,700;"He's a sailor like the 15."
42:05,700;42:09,940;"He chucked it to the goal line standing like straight up"
42:09,940;42:11,500;"with his feet side by side."
42:11,500;42:13,460;"So he didn't even get to like throw into it."
42:13,460;42:15,220;"He didn't want to go over the line of scrimmage."
42:15,220;42:16,580;"He was kind of like lean back"
42:16,580;42:18,980;"and just huck the football 50 yards"
42:18,980;42:20,740;"like just from a standstill"
42:20,740;42:23,660;"with not even putting his body into it."
42:23,660;42:28,300;"And that got called passenger ferrets"
42:28,300;42:30,740;"because the ball kind of hung a little bit,"
42:30,740;42:33,620;"which is fine because he loved the way he threw it."
42:33,620;42:37,700;"And so the pass got the ball at the two"
42:37,700;42:40,340;"and then Brady throws another play action touchdown"
42:40,340;42:45,760;"to David Patton this time, which was that almost the exact same play, but it was David Patton"
42:45,760;42:52,120;"on the slant instead of a tight end lined up tight. But it was the quick play action"
42:52,120;42:59,200;"to spin around, just huck at it. I think Brady just aims for the goal post. I just"
42:59,200;43:02,880;"expect his wide receiver to be right there at the time because it doesn't really seem"
43:02,880;43:06,540;"like he has enough time to actually turn around, locate who he's thrown it to and actually"
43:06,540;43:08,840;"place it where he needs it to be, but it ends there every time."
43:08,840;43:16,800;"There's a snag to yeah, oh yeah, so I was wondering how tall David Pat was Steve. How tall are you?"
43:16,800;43:21,000;"Yeah, so"
43:21,000;43:23,080;"The patent's got an inch on you"
43:23,080;43:27,400;"David Pat's plague why does he even NFL 5 foot 10?"
43:27,400;43:30,000;"which is bananas"
43:30,000;43:32,200;"this was like his rookie year right or"
43:32,200;43:37,120;"And I think he'd actually been around but this is his first year on the Patriots"
43:38,000;43:44,740;"Yeah, you want to hear his history. Yeah, come use history. Yeah, he went to Western Carolina"
43:44,740;43:47,440;"Where he really didn't do anything"
43:47,440;43:54,840;"And went to the arena football week. Yeah, yeah, they've they mentioned that yeah"
43:54,840;43:58,440;"for the Albany Firebirds and"
43:58,440;44:06,320;"Then he kicked around the Giants for three years the Browns for a year and then"
44:06,720;44:08,720;"It was like"
44:08,720;44:11,800;"More of a kick returner for the Giants and"
44:11,800;44:17,800;"And all that yeah catching like 15 balls a year. Yeah. Yeah"
44:17,800;44:26,240;"Yeah, so the first year on the pages was 2001 because yeah three years with the Giants"
44:26,240;44:32,020;"One year with Cleveland and then yeah, you want to hear something else interesting. Yeah, give it to me"
44:33,000;44:41,260;"Football in South Carolina the quarterback that was throwing that for this high school team. Yeah, okay, Reese"
44:41,260;44:46,280;"What a shortstop yeah a shortstop from the"
44:46,280;44:52,640;"I've had that team was amazing"
44:52,640;45:00,360;"I've had great name right there. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's that's top 10 poke Reese. It's amazing"
45:01,320;45:08,280;"Especially because he never hit for power. So all his hits were poked somewhere poke it out there left field. Yeah, it's right. Just poke it"
45:08,280;45:12,520;"Defense stuff. Yeah"
45:12,520;45:15,480;"One of the best defensive shortstop set I've ever seen"
45:15,480;45:18,040;"that his"
45:18,040;45:19,160;"his"
45:19,160;45:20,760;"Ops on"
45:20,760;45:25,240;"Balls hit to him. I've never seen anybody jump that high that wasn't in the NBA"
45:25,240;45:29,560;"Like it looks like he's climbing layers to go catch things"
45:30,600;45:37,080;"And then I thought we're not talking fly ball. We're talking line drives that should be going into the gap and what about no ma"
45:37,080;45:41,480;"No"
45:41,480;45:47,240;"Oh, he was he was a give but he was he's more of a dare dog than anything. Yeah, you're right"
45:47,240;45:51,640;"Um"
45:51,640;45:58,040;"All right, uh, so we're in the fourth quarter. That's right. Um, so Brady throws a touchdown"
45:58,600;46:03,560;"and the Colts it's like the last chance to make it a game drive down to the red zone yet again."
46:03,560;46:10,040;"Manning drops back to pass under no pressure whatsoever goes to throw to a wide open guy in"
46:10,040;46:13,640;"the middle I think it was a tight end and the ball just literally falls out of his hand."
46:13,640;46:16,440;"Patrick cover it looked like."
46:16,440;46:23,080;"James Winston special yeah it was one of those just like just throw it backwards just out of"
46:23,080;46:30,100;"I don't know where had like no pressure, no nothing, beautiful pocket and just ball just flies out past recover and"
46:30,100;46:35,240;"The booze this this I think those two things that made this place so good"
46:35,240;46:39,060;"one was this was peak Manning shrug and"
46:39,060;46:45,360;"I think you both know what I mean by Manning shrug where he has the face on of course right because it's its manning face"
46:45,360;46:52,220;"But the shrugging that he does where he puts both hands out like jazz hands and just starts like shrugging violently"
46:52,220;47:00,220;"was amazing. And then the booze. I mean, the booze actually started in the first quarter."
47:00,220;47:07,140;"I had no sound that there's a ton of booing for the Colts. Just constant booing. It started"
47:07,140;47:12,140;"on the opening, Patriots touchdown. And the first block,"
47:12,140;47:19,460;"yeah, it got worse on both block field goals. And then every time they took a sack, they"
47:19,460;47:23,180;"were booing plays that they thought should have been passing affairs that were blatantly"
47:23,180;47:25,460;"not passing affairs."
47:25,460;47:32,380;"Um, then the one time they didn't boo is, um, at the end of the first half."
47:32,380;47:36,980;"I think it was, let me see, was it after the, the dropped?"
47:36,980;47:37,980;"No."
47:37,980;47:38,980;"Oh yeah."
47:38,980;47:44,380;"It was so is after they, um, they dropped the, the kickoff and got pinned to the two"
47:44,380;47:45,380;"yard line."
47:45,380;47:49,940;"Page went on a short touchdown off of the ensuing drive and then kicked off and"
47:49,940;47:56,860;"They actually managed to take a touch back on that play and they got the sarcastic cheer"
47:56,860;47:59,100;"Which is one of my favorite things in football. I mean"
47:59,100;48:01,900;"It's really got cheered for doing"
48:01,900;48:07,860;"Should just be something that they should do every time I saw that in the room's game tonight"
48:07,860;48:10,980;"Buffalo got 12 shots"
48:10,980;48:14,380;"So for what we got wanted in the first shot the whole TD Garden chair the"
48:14,380;48:19,620;"Yeah, there's there's nothing better than the"
48:19,620;48:25,340;"Sarcastic chair can we have can we go back to the manning face a little bit? Oh?"
48:25,340;48:28,540;"Absolutely, we I mean you can do a whole episode on it if you want"
48:28,540;48:34,100;"Supercut of manning face. There's gotta be right"
48:34,100;48:39,140;"Probably if there is a little make one which one do you prefer the the"
48:39,700;48:41,820;"Manning face or the Eli man face"
48:41,820;48:46,380;"Manning face I think 100% the patent is very much like"
48:46,380;48:49,260;"everybody else sucks"
48:49,260;48:54,420;"You guys do what I want you to do and that you live faces are where I'm like"
48:54,420;48:57,780;"It's not shocked I"
48:57,780;49:02,440;"Know a for something base, but you could tell they're different. Oh"
49:02,440;49:07,100;"Yeah, that's much more rooted in confusion the other ones much more rooted in like"
49:07,740;49:09,000;"derision. Yeah."
49:09,000;49:15,300;"So it's, it, it fuels my soul."
49:15,300;49:17,140;"The man."
49:17,140;49:24,020;"Now I'm still painting because in this game, like at the end of it,"
49:24,020;49:29,140;"Patriots get the ball and they're, they're like just like running out the clock."
49:29,140;49:31,780;"They had like a seven or eight minute drive in the fourth quarter."
49:31,780;49:33,420;"So there's like two minutes left. Yeah."
49:33,420;49:37,140;"And he is literally just kind of going at anybody that'll listen to him."
49:37,140;49:39,500;"So like the offensive line just sitting on the thing."
49:39,500;49:40,920;"And you can see him just like just"
49:40,920;49:43,700;"stimulating and like yelling and all this stuff."
49:43,700;49:45,900;"And then they cut back to him a couple of minutes later"
49:45,900;49:48,220;"doing the same thing to the offensive line coach"
49:48,220;49:50,540;"who's standing there like trying to watch the game."
49:50,540;49:52,940;"And he's just like yelling at the side of his head."
49:52,940;49:54,260;"- It's going full."
49:54,260;49:55,180;"- Full like full letters."
49:55,180;49:57,940;"- Yeah, going on and on and on."
49:57,940;50:01,980;"- Rivers is the best for that."
50:01,980;50:05,180;"- Oh yeah, yeah, but this is the same sort of idea."
50:05,180;50:06,340;"- I love it was."
50:06,340;50:09,420;"Yeah, it's kind of how do you pissy fit."
50:09,420;50:10,660;"Oh, absolutely."
50:10,660;50:17,740;"So yeah, and actually the end of the game was kind of pissy"
50:17,740;50:24,140;"just in general because Pats ate up a shit on a time"
50:24,140;50:27,500;"in their last drive and get it to the two minute warning."
50:27,500;50:29,820;"And so out of the two minute warning,"
50:29,820;50:31,900;"the Pats were up three touchdowns."
50:31,900;50:35,820;"And so they take a knee and the Colts call a timeout."
50:35,820;50:37,220;"Yeah, I thought that was such bullshit."
50:37,220;50:40,060;"Down three touchdowns after the two minute warning."
50:40,060;50:41,820;"So the page like, fuck it, we're on play."
50:41,820;50:45,940;"So they ran three more plays and instead of kicking the field goal on fourth down,"
50:45,940;50:49,060;"they went for it on like fourth and seven and got six and a half yards."
50:49,060;50:54,740;"So the Colts got the ball back with 51 seconds left."
50:54,740;50:55,740;"So what do they do?"
50:55,740;50:58,380;"They put Mark Rippin in the backup quarterback."
50:58,380;50:59,300;"Remember Mark Rippin?"
50:59,300;51:00,380;"Yeah."
51:00,380;51:00,780;"Yeah."
51:00,780;51:01,420;"Redskins."
51:01,420;51:01,820;"Great."
51:01,820;51:02,380;"Mark Rippin."
51:02,380;51:04,300;"And then they handed off twice."
51:05,700;51:08,540;"But so they handed off the first time the pages call timeout."
51:08,540;51:12,900;"Just so the calls get running again and the game ends."
51:12,900;51:16,340;"Pages should have gone for a touchdown there."
51:16,340;51:17,140;"Just said, ""Fuck you."""
51:17,140;51:19,980;"I think if they had gotten the first down, they would have."
51:19,980;51:24,380;"I think they would have kept throwing the ball and actually run up the score."
51:24,380;51:28,140;"So I respect the foul."
51:28,140;51:34,180;"You know, if I would have if they put banning back in there and be like, like, redeem yourself,"
51:34,180;51:36,980;"like have one last drive, but they didn't they put the backup in and ran it twice."
51:36,980;51:38,260;"Like why the fuck all the timeouts?"
51:38,260;51:39,940;"Because fuck that dude."
51:39,940;51:41,940;"It's it's professional football."
51:41,940;51:43,700;"No, that's bullshit."
51:43,700;51:46,420;"No, I'm of the opposite of it."
51:46,420;51:48,340;"I don't care how much I'm losing by."
51:48,340;51:50,020;"I want to lose by less."
51:50,020;51:52,180;"You know what I'm saying?"
51:52,180;51:53,300;"Well, that's fine."
51:53,300;51:57,060;"But then well, then put your starters out and fucking try to score that last touchdown."
51:57,060;51:57,620;"That's true."
51:57,620;51:58,420;"I put the start."
51:58,420;52:01,940;"Yeah, they'll put you back up a quarterback in and running up the middle twice."
52:01,940;52:02,580;"Yeah."
52:02,580;52:05,280;"He talks the point of that."
52:05,280;52:06,640;"That's true."
52:06,640;52:08,900;"The one other thing I wanted to bring up in this,"
52:08,900;52:11,220;"and I'm a little sad that we have to do it without Mike here,"
52:11,220;52:12,900;"because it's a boy."
52:12,900;52:16,580;"But you missed in the last game perhaps the funniest"
52:16,580;52:18,820;"play so far this season."
52:18,820;52:20,820;"Punter Lee Johnson."
52:20,820;52:24,380;"He got a-- it was in the fourth quarter"
52:24,380;52:25,460;"against the Chargers."
52:25,460;52:29,020;"Got-- they were punting in their own ends."
52:29,020;52:31,500;"Caught the ball like the tennis yard line"
52:31,500;52:33,300;"and saw a free rusher coming off."
52:33,300;52:34,900;"So instead of rushing his punt,"
52:34,900;52:36,980;"he tried to take the ball and put it round his back"
52:36,980;52:38,140;"and sidestep the guy."
52:38,140;52:40,820;"But he didn't fool the guy."
52:40,820;52:44,100;"So the guy just grabbed him and threw him to the ground"
52:44,100;52:46,980;"as Lee Johnson flailed the ball out of his hands."
52:46,980;52:48,460;"And then the guy to tackle him,"
52:48,460;52:50,340;"picked up the football while Lee Johnson stood there,"
52:50,340;52:52,060;"thinking the play was over."
52:52,060;52:54,060;"And then the guy ran in for a touchdown"
52:54,060;52:57,460;"to put the pages down 10 points with eight minutes left."
52:59,180;53:03,140;"So that was the last play of Lee Johnson's career as a"
53:03,140;53:03,620;"patriot."
53:03,620;53:08,780;"As Ken Walter took over, punting duties from here on out."
53:08,780;53:15,020;"And if you thought Mike Vannerjack looked nerdy,"
53:15,020;53:22,340;"fucking Ken Walter with that face mask that's kind of like way too low."
53:22,340;53:26,780;"And it looked like he has his helmet pulled too far down over his head."
53:26,780;53:31,380;"So his face mask is like covering his chest and his chin strap is under his neck."
53:31,380;53:34,300;"And that's how he punts footballs."
53:34,300;53:36,460;"Jesus Christ."
53:36,460;53:41,980;"It almost looked like Ryan's story in terms of the size of his nose."
53:41,980;53:43,380;"Yeah, he's got a huge nose."
53:43,380;53:44,220;"Look ridiculous."
53:44,220;53:47,100;"Shadow to Ryan's story are good friends."
53:47,100;53:49,420;"We can even take either."
53:49,420;53:54,100;"Who we call two can Sam just because of the size of his massive honker."
53:54,860;53:57,020;"And I think Ken Walter would give him a run for his money."
53:57,020;54:01,460;"I think Ken Walter with his helmet on if he ran into a wall would hit it knows first."
54:01,460;54:06,260;"Ken Walter with a nose like that should be in the national Jewish Museum"
54:06,260;54:08,060;"Sports. Oh, yeah."
54:08,060;54:11,460;"Bring it all back."
54:11,460;54:12,460;"I love it."
54:12,460;54:15,220;"All right."
54:15,220;54:16,060;"So that's the game."
54:16,060;54:18,020;"Let's do some best and worst."
54:18,020;54:19,020;"Who wants to go first?"
54:19,020;54:21,740;"I'll go first."
54:21,740;54:22,300;"All right."
54:22,300;54:23,420;"Give me a best or it's great."
54:24,100;54:27,000;"I'm going to steal David Patton obviously."
54:27,000;54:28,400;"All right."
54:28,400;54:30,560;"Did you have specific David Patton?"
54:30,560;54:31,200;"That was your best."
54:31,200;54:34,300;"Well, I meet the fact it's the David"
54:34,300;54:35,360;"Patton dude."
54:35,360;54:37,000;"You know, fair enough."
54:37,000;54:39,360;"And we touched down being ridiculous."
54:39,360;54:41,100;"Studies scored or"
54:41,100;54:42,940;"Yeah, I don't know."
54:42,940;54:44,480;"Easy ones that he's getting."
54:44,480;54:45,600;"Yeah."
54:45,600;54:49,060;"And I mean, to this day, I still remember it as the David Patton game."
54:49,060;54:49,560;"Right."
54:49,560;54:51,640;"So yeah, it kind of speaks for itself."
54:51,640;54:52,900;"I agree."
54:53,500;54:56,500;"And then for worst, I'll take myself for watching the wrong game."
54:56,500;54:58,500;"And that's the game."
54:58,500;55:00,500;"All right, at least you went up to at least you're honest."
55:00,500;55:01,500;"That's fine."
55:01,500;55:03,500;"Next week will be better, I'm sure."
55:03,500;55:04,500;"Yeah, we'll see."
55:04,500;55:08,500;"All right, Steve, give me your best of worst."
55:08,500;55:09,500;"Mm."
55:09,500;55:12,500;"I mean, the best is tough with a man in which."
55:12,500;55:14,500;"Yeah, that was a good one."
55:14,500;55:15,500;"That's the good thing."
55:15,500;55:17,500;"I guess I'd forgotten that."
55:17,500;55:22,500;"And as hard as I've ever seen him get hit, kind of got that like, you got it in the back first, which you didn't see coming."
55:22,500;55:27,660;"Yeah, I just tried to get fall forward the guy coming from the front who he did see coming got him right in the chest"
55:27,660;55:32,360;"Oh, yeah, he's kind of got the old whiplash. It was brilliant. He was real boozy"
55:32,360;55:38,680;"The worst is you know some of the tackling on Adrian James he he kind of"
55:38,680;55:42,620;"Tore it up. Yeah James went for"
55:42,620;55:45,340;"Renee somewhere he went for"
55:45,340;55:47,900;"140 some odd yards on 30 carries"
55:48,580;55:54,060;"Like he he didn't score touchdown though. They couldn't they couldn't do anything short yardage"
55:54,060;55:56,460;"But yeah, he he rebounded"
55:56,460;56:03,900;"Nicely from his because the only game they they posted said the only game he didn't rush for 100 yards so far in the season"
56:03,900;56:05,900;"Was the first Patriots match up?"
56:05,900;56:07,700;"so I"
56:07,700;56:10,300;"Almost felt like the Patriots once they got up big"
56:10,300;56:15,780;"They just said if you want to hang out there egg or James keep doing it as long as Manny's not throwing you're not gonna catch up quick"
56:17,620;56:19,620;"So I'll give you that"
56:19,620;56:29,340;"My best I think was a play we didn't actually talk about I forgot because I watched this a few days ago, but"
56:29,340;56:33,300;"Manning had a pass"
56:33,300;56:41,960;"Knocked up in the air by the defensive lineman. I think in this first half at some point and it was caught by his left guard"
56:44,180;56:51,540;"Then decided to take off downfield and with blazing speed managed to get two whole yards on the completion"
56:51,540;56:53,540;"So it's man in completion to"
56:53,540;56:56,980;"Whoever's left guard was a little bit of Marshall new house"
56:56,980;57:01,780;"And then immediately fumbling that's true. Yes"
57:01,780;57:06,980;"There is that poor Marshall new house"
57:06,980;57:13,380;"She's trying his best. I think my worst was the Colts"
57:13,380;57:19,860;"calling bullshit timeouts after two minute warning and then getting the ball back with"
57:19,860;57:23,940;"50 seconds left and throwing their BT out there to run it up the middle."
57:23,940;57:24,940;"I disagree."
57:24,940;57:27,140;"That's some chicken shit stuff."
57:27,140;57:29,340;"It's chicken chick, Greg."
57:29,340;57:32,380;"I have one question that I wanted to pose."
57:32,380;57:33,980;"Yeah, go ahead."
57:33,980;57:42,220;"David, can you take in as a more influential patriot?"
57:42,220;57:44,220;"David 10 or Dion branch?"
57:44,220;57:53,940;"Probably you want to try it you want to just ask that question one more time without opening an entire pack of gum while you're doing it"
57:53,940;57:56,500;"Oh Kelly putting some mozzarella"
57:56,500;57:59,940;"And the"
57:59,940;58:07,380;"Kelly needs a man's hand to you"
58:08,940;58:12,660;"- You want to crinkle some aluminum foil, I added?"
58:12,660;58:13,660;"Great TV."
58:13,660;58:18,900;"- Well, here's kind of the thought line, right?"
58:18,900;58:23,100;"I think Dion Branch probably had better stats,"
58:23,100;58:24,700;"you know, more yards, more catches,"
58:24,700;58:26,980;"touchdowns and all that, but."
58:26,980;58:29,500;"- Hatton had some huge catches"
58:29,500;58:31,980;"in those first three Super Bowls, right?"
58:31,980;58:37,020;"- He had the one against the Steelers from Bloodsoap."
58:37,020;58:37,860;"- Yep."
58:37,860;58:42,580;"one in the first touch in a first Super Bowl against the Rams. That was exactly"
58:42,580;58:47,060;"the same play as the one. Yeah, blood. So yeah, this game like if you talk about"
58:47,060;58:53,740;"memorable games to me, David Patton had more or memorable catches. I don't know"
58:53,740;58:58,580;"the umprench had that Super Bowl MVP though. That's the other four. Yeah. Yeah."
58:58,580;59:03,540;"He also had that play against the Bears in the snow where he got a touchdown"
59:03,540;59:08,580;"right at the end of the half that I remember. And he also came back."
59:08,580;59:09,420;"Yeah."
59:09,420;59:12,900;"Pat did Pat and come back."
59:12,900;59:16,860;"Yep. Pat went to the Redskins, right?"
59:16,860;59:22,120;"He went to the Redskins the same with the Browns and then signed back with the"
59:22,120;59:24,700;"Pats in 2010. I don't think he actually played."
59:24,700;59:29,460;"I don't think he did because his status rushing and receiving stats on"
59:29,500;59:30,420;"profile reference."
59:30,420;59:31,900;"One."
59:31,900;59:33,380;"Yeah."
59:33,380;59:34,740;"And then right."
59:34,740;59:36,740;"Yeah, I'll give them that."
59:36,740;59:37,420;"They came back."
59:37,420;59:44,380;"I mean, I think they're both second to Troy Brown."
59:44,380;59:48,380;"But I think I think I think you can make a case for either one of them."
59:48,380;59:55,900;"Yeah, I think you make a case for either Patton or or Dion branch."
59:55,900;59:56,780;"Yeah."
59:57,060;01:00:04,260;"Have you seen the, it might be the globe that's doing like Patriots Dynasty rosters?"
01:00:04,260;01:00:05,700;"No."
01:00:05,700;01:00:07,300;"Yeah, it's awesome."
01:00:07,300;01:00:11,580;"Like you're, you pick like an all time Patriots Dynasty team and you pick like what"
01:00:11,580;01:00:15,540;"are like four receivers, you know, you go through every position."
01:00:15,540;01:00:20,180;"We should do a live pick for a podcast."
01:00:20,180;01:00:21,900;"Like a draft."
01:00:21,900;01:00:22,740;"Yeah."
01:00:22,740;01:00:25,580;"Cause it's actually like it, it's pretty interesting."
01:00:25,580;01:00:28,420;"There's a lot of questions like this where it's like, ""Ooh, cat in her branch."""
01:00:28,420;01:00:29,580;"I don't know."
01:00:29,580;01:00:30,580;"Yeah."
01:00:30,580;01:00:34,660;"No, I've actually done that for the Patriots Dynasty website."
01:00:34,660;01:00:37,260;"We did a mall."
01:00:37,260;01:00:39,300;"You're a fucking nerd."
01:00:39,300;01:00:43,660;"Sorry to ruin your thunder by having done this two years ago."
01:00:43,660;01:00:45,940;"I'm estimated to my list afterwards."
01:00:45,940;01:00:46,940;"Good for you."
01:00:46,940;01:00:48,660;"Yeah, don't worry about it."
01:00:48,660;01:00:54,820;"And it was voted on by the Patriots subreddit."
01:00:54,820;01:00:57,940;"I think the most contentious was who do you put at cornerback two?"
01:00:57,940;01:01:01,540;"Well, it's tile."
01:01:01,540;01:01:04,580;"Yeah, tile lock is corner back one."
01:01:04,580;01:01:05,740;"Who do you put a corner back to?"
01:01:05,740;01:01:06,340;"Yeah."
01:01:06,340;01:01:12,860;"Revis is probably Gilmore now, but is it pre go?"
01:01:12,860;01:01:16,060;"I would say so with the season he's having this season."
01:01:16,060;01:01:18,260;"No, I mean, do I'll read it?"
01:01:18,260;01:01:19,460;"It's had a shutdown season."
01:01:19,460;01:01:20,300;"They want a Super Bowl."
01:01:20,300;01:01:20,660;"Yeah."
01:01:20,660;01:01:21,100;"Yeah."
01:01:21,100;01:01:24,780;"And Malcolm Butler, I mean, for obvious reasons."
01:01:24,780;01:01:32,980;"I think you could put a Sante Samuel in that list even though he didn't win a"
01:01:32,980;01:01:35,980;"Super Bowl. Yeah he's never like beloved either."
01:01:35,980;01:01:41,580;"His numbers were great though. What was that?"
01:01:41,580;01:01:43,980;"Don't Kelly says willing against."
01:01:43,980;01:01:47,380;"Yeah, you got quad back. Yeah."
01:01:47,380;01:01:48,380;"Big Willie style."
01:01:48,380;01:01:51,780;"Good effort Kelly. Good effort."
01:01:51,780;01:01:53,860;"(laughs)"
01:01:53,860;01:01:56,020;"Yikes."
01:01:56,020;01:02:00,020;"All right, well I think that wraps it up"
01:02:00,020;01:02:05,020;"for this episode of the Patriots Dinesy Podcast."
01:02:05,020;01:02:06,820;"Who are we looking at next week, boys?"
01:02:06,820;01:02:09,940;"- Broncos, I'm gonna write."
01:02:09,940;01:02:14,220;"- Yeah, we're going to Mile High Stadium"
01:02:14,220;01:02:17,060;"to find out why,"
01:02:17,060;01:02:18,500;"- Windy City."
01:02:18,500;01:02:21,060;"- Yeah, why the Patriots?"
01:02:21,060;01:02:22,220;"Big easy."
01:02:22,220;01:02:25,580;"- Had issues in mile high."
01:02:25,580;01:02:28,660;"And that will start next week."
01:02:28,660;01:02:30,420;"Well, we'll see what happens."
01:02:30,420;01:02:34,100;"But until then, we will talk to you guys soon."
01:02:34,100;01:02:36,860;"- Happy Thanksgiving."
01:02:36,860;01:02:37,700;"- Happy Thanksgiving."
01:02:37,700;01:02:38,540;"- Hey, bro."
01:02:38,540;01:02:41,140;"- Not that this will be air to Thanksgiving,"
01:02:41,140;01:02:43,060;"but."
01:02:43,060;01:02:43,900;"- Forever."
01:02:43,900;01:02:46,140;"- Next Thursday for us is Thanksgiving."
01:02:46,140;01:02:48,500;"So happy Thanksgiving to you and yours."
01:02:48,500;01:02:50,300;"- Ooh, it's a Thanksgiving episode."
01:02:50,300;01:03:05,500;"Alright guys, I'm Ben. Yeah, talk to you soon boys. Sleep tight beautiful. You know I love you too. I didn't say I love you. I love you. I love you too. Bye guys."

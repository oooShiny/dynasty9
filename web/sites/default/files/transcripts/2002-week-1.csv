05:52,300;05:56,740;"I mean take out rohan Davy or and Antoine Roma"
05:56,980;06:04,220;"Womack and I mean that just looking at you know knowing what we know now and seeing their careers in"
06:04,220;06:07,480;"completion just like"
06:07,480;06:09,540;"Daniel Graham"
06:09,540;06:15,340;"Jarvis Green Dion branch and then David Givens in the seventh yeah, that's one of the he was"

06:55,940;06:58,420;"and he was you"
06:58,420;07:00,920;"Just it was a really really really good draft"
07:00,920;07:05,120;"Obviously Dion being the highlight Dion branch being the highlight"
07:05,120;07:10,120;"That's true, but I think the the newspapers were were big on"
07:10,120;07:15,040;"The patrons drafting their true bloods or replacement in Rowan, Davey"

07:38,520;07:44,520;"Arena League legend, too. Was he? I think he played a couple of years."
07:44,520;07:49,680;"I'm surprised at how many people were discovering who spent time in the AFL."
07:49,680;07:52,380;"I know we got to bring it back."
07:52,380;07:55,200;"Connor, have you heard of the LA kids?"
07:55,200;07:59,400;"Okay."

08:10,200;08:12,080;"Chatham, Chatham, Matt Chatham."
08:12,320;08:14,600;"- You're not from around here?"
08:14,600;08:15,960;"- I think Chad does."
08:15,960;08:16,960;"- I'm so sure."
08:16,960;08:17,800;"- Fucking Chad."
08:17,800;08:19,160;"- All right."
08:19,160;08:21,200;"Chad, I'm sorry about that."
08:21,200;08:22,920;"- Paul, do you accept me?"
08:22,920;08:25,080;"- No, I really, I have no idea,"
08:25,080;08:27,080;"but I have no idea anything about it."
08:27,080;08:28,600;"I didn't even look into it."
08:28,600;08:30,800;"I figured one of you guys were gonna talk about it."
08:30,800;08:33,640;"- Well, you have to listen to the episode that comes out."
08:33,640;08:34,480;"- Yeah, we--"
08:34,480;08:36,160;"- We cap for two hours."
08:36,160;08:38,680;"- We talked the entire season of the show."
08:38,680;08:40,600;"- I watched 10 episodes"
08:41,560;08:45,560;"of like a hard knocks version of for arena football."
08:45,560;08:47,080;"(laughs)"
08:47,080;08:48,760;"- Well, a team sponsored by--"
08:48,760;08:50,040;"- Is that a rock band?"
08:50,040;08:52,880;"- Is that what it is?"
08:52,880;08:55,000;"- Yeah. - Is it like a gene simmons?"
08:55,000;08:56,680;"- Oh, okay."
08:56,680;08:59,840;"Okay, I think I could get behind this."
08:59,840;09:01,640;"- Right. - It's electric."
09:01,640;09:03,360;"- Yeah, highly recommend."
09:03,360;09:05,280;"- Speaking of tight ends."
09:05,280;09:07,120;"- Kiss has some tight ends, I would say."
09:07,120;09:09,280;"(laughs)"
09:09,280;09:17,400;"Some other in free agency, the Patriots seem to want to address the tight end position this year, since they didn't have one year before."
09:17,400;09:24,120;"Rodding Cam Cleland from the Saints and our old friend Christian Fourier from the Seahawks."
09:24,120;09:25,600;"You start on the Seahawks, isn't he?"
09:25,600;09:27,840;"Back check."
09:27,840;09:30,640;"No, it's not worth it."
09:30,640;09:37,440;"Yeah, I remember looking at it briefly and he didn't do much."
09:37,440;09:38,280;"Oh, fucking hell."
09:38,280;09:42,040;"He played on the Seahawks for since 95 to 2001."
09:42,040;09:42,920;"Jesus Christ."
09:42,920;09:47,520;"I thought he was younger than that when he came to the Patriots, but I guess not."
09:47,520;09:48,120;"Yeah."
09:48,120;09:50,760;"And ironically, he's not Christian at all."
09:50,760;09:51,400;"He's Jewish."
09:51,400;09:57,960;"Seven years with the Seahawks, he caught seven touchdowns."
09:57,960;09:59,800;"Four years with the Patriots, he caught 13."
09:59,800;10:03,160;"So remember that time that he was suspended from E."
10:03,160;10:05,120;"I for making fun of Don Yee."
10:05,120;10:06,360;"I do remember that."
10:07,040;10:13,320;"speaking of the eye. I mean, that's kind of what happens."
10:13,320;10:17,920;"Is that the sports agent, right? Is it the Donny sports"
10:17,920;10:23,000;"dude? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yikes. Sorry. I like to worry. I have a"
10:23,000;10:28,400;"trivia question for you guys. All right. Who caught more balls"
10:28,400;10:32,960;"and yards? Cam Cleveland in this year or mat lacrosse in the"
10:32,960;10:37,360;"past year. Oh, fuck. Cam Cleland. Cam Cleland. Probably"
10:37,360;10:39,840;"in the first game. Yeah. I've already seen him catch like two"
10:39,840;10:44,480;"balls in this first game. Yeah, he had six catches. I think"
10:44,480;10:48,440;"this game. I didn't have any hands up. He ends up with 16"
10:48,440;10:53,440;"grabs for 112 yards. Damn. That's about as much as any"
10:53,440;10:58,060;"hatreds tight ends this year combined. Now, Matt La Crosse had"
10:58,060;11:00,060;"131 yards in your face cam."
11:00,060;11:03,660;"You showed him."
11:03,660;11:05,380;"You're supposed to be like legit, right?"
11:05,380;11:06,100;"Like Cleveland."
11:06,100;11:06,980;"I felt like I was."
11:06,980;11:09,420;"Did he get hurt?"
11:09,420;11:10,260;"Did he get hurt?"
11:10,260;11:12,820;"He came out of the gate with six catches."
11:12,820;11:14,620;"I mean, it was only 40 yards, but he"
11:14,620;11:18,540;"six targets, six receptions first game."
11:18,540;11:21,260;"I wonder if he got hurt or if they just."
11:21,260;11:23,020;"I have no idea."
11:23,020;11:25,660;"So he does get a touchdown."
11:25,660;11:27,220;"I actually had a note about this."
11:27,220;11:30,500;"He gets a touchdown in this game, I believe, right?"
11:30,500;11:31,500;"In this game?"
11:31,500;11:32,500;"I don't think he's showing up."
11:32,500;11:33,500;"No, he doesn't."
11:33,500;11:34,500;"Or yeah, he has a touchdown."
11:34,500;11:39,100;"I'm looking at his Wikipedia and it says, ""When he was a rookie with the Saints, he"
11:39,100;11:46,260;"was struck in the eye by a teammate with a sock filled with coins during a hazing incident."
11:46,260;11:52,500;"What clearly lost his eye in addition to suffering a broken eye socket and broken nose?"
11:52,500;11:55,060;"The injury permanently affected his eyesight."""
11:55,060;12:02,420;"what good lord wow wow all right I think awesome I might"
12:02,420;12:18,940;"he incognito that's one of the reference articles that a wild wild story I mean"
12:18,940;12:28,420;"And now compared to PC culture now, I mean, someone did that in today's game."
12:28,420;12:32,060;"I mean, they didn't rape."
12:32,060;12:36,900;"It's not rape or beaten up kids, so they'd probably like suspend them for a year."
12:36,900;12:41,300;"So you hit someone in the eye with sock filled with coins."
12:41,300;12:42,300;"Yeah, probably."
12:42,300;12:43,940;"What is he joining a gang?"
12:43,940;12:46,940;"Well, depends on how good the guy who hit him was, probably."
12:46,940;12:48,700;"I'll do some research and let you know."
12:48,700;12:51,860;"All right, if you could, that'd be great."
12:51,860;12:53,300;"We'll do a deep dive on that."
12:53,300;12:55,580;"There's a whole LA Times article on it."
12:55,580;13:01,660;"All right, so that's kind of the big changes"
13:01,660;13:04,460;"for the off season."
13:04,460;13:07,460;"There wasn't a ton of turnover, really,"
13:07,460;13:11,500;"on this Patriots team, other than Drew Blood's own Terry Glenn."
13:11,500;13:15,580;"Brian Cox is on the Saints, which you"
13:15,580;13:16,660;"didn't play much down the structure."
13:16,660;13:20,380;"that that was. Did he not played much at the end of 2001?"
13:20,380;13:27,540;"Not really. He broke his leg middle of the season and then came back and played on it."
13:27,540;13:34,580;"But was not the same guy. So it couldn't really couldn't really move much. So he was he was like a just a"
13:34,580;13:41,660;"runstopper on short yardage down. So yeah, I liked. Yeah, I liked old man. I think what do you wear"
13:41,660;13:47,420;"number 92 or 95 or something like that. I loved I like Brian Cox. Yeah, I"
13:47,420;13:52,700;"really have to stop it for the Saints. So once I heard again, I don't I"
13:52,700;13:56,580;"don't I don't think I got into coaching and coached. Matt Chatham, when he went to"
13:56,580;14:00,580;"the Jets, they were didn't see eye to eye when they're on the Patriots. If I"
14:00,580;14:10,740;"recall. And the opponent tonight was the Pittsburgh Steelers, who also really"
14:10,740;14:15,980;"hadn't changed much. Their team was basically the same as well. Yeah. And the commentators"
14:15,980;14:21,420;"actually mentioned that where it was basically almost an exact rematch of the AFC Championship"
14:21,420;14:28,700;"game the year before, because both these teams were exactly the same. Except even though the"
14:28,700;14:35,540;"Steelers defense was the same, they struggled a lot for our Steelers defense, I would think."
14:35,540;14:39,980;"It was the same defense where they finished 16th and points allowed, which is like what"
14:39,980;14:44,400;"middle of the table and seventh in yards loud, which is not bad, but they gave up a"
14:44,400;14:49,460;"shit ton of passing yards and rushing touchdowns for some reason, which we actually saw kind"
14:49,460;14:53,340;"of in this game where the patients decided they weren't going to run the ball and just"
14:53,340;14:58,480;"spread them out and just gas them to death. So they ranked actually 20th in passing yards"
14:58,480;15:03,340;"allowed and 20th in rushing touchdowns allowed. So I think there was a blueprint that came"
15:03,340;15:04,340;"out early."
15:04,340;15:14,020;"They're secondary must have just been abysmal because that's maybe the best line back in"
15:14,020;15:16,700;"core I've ever seen in my entire life."
15:16,700;15:19,940;"There's some big news with Steelers."
15:19,940;15:22,940;"I mean, Jason Gilden, Fairier."
15:22,940;15:28,260;"I don't know if you guys remember, Kendrel, Joey Porter, Kendrel Bell."
15:28,260;15:30,420;"Yeah, Kendrel Bell was so many."
15:30,420;15:32,140;"It's a second year."
15:32,140;15:33,140;"Yeah."
15:33,140;15:35,140;"James Harrison."
15:35,140;15:36,140;"- Stop."
15:36,140;15:39,140;"- I think this is James Harrison's work a year."
15:39,140;15:40,140;"- No."
15:40,140;15:41,140;"- Yeah."
15:41,140;15:42,140;"- Was it really?"
15:42,140;15:44,140;"- Yeah, he's undrafted."
15:44,140;15:45,140;"- He was undrafted."
15:45,140;15:47,140;"- Yeah, they all, uh, first year."
15:47,140;15:48,140;"- Fucking hell."
15:48,140;15:50,140;"- And they also have Larry Foote."
15:50,140;15:51,140;"Larry Foote was no slouchy."
15:51,140;15:54,140;"Larry Foote had some good years in the league as well."
15:54,140;15:55,140;"I mean,"
15:55,140;15:58,140;"- This was a line that I proved that Mike Raebel couldn't crack."
15:58,140;16:01,140;"And now he's starting on the Patriots and winning his U-Voles."
16:01,140;16:03,140;"- He was the only one that did anything in this game, I think."
16:03,140;16:09,140;"But having said all that, the Steelers could get almost no pass rush in this game whatsoever."
16:09,140;16:11,140;"- He was sick. - The first two drives."
16:11,140;16:14,140;"- All time, sack leader in the Steelers, and still is."
16:14,140;16:16,140;"- Who is? - Guilden?"
16:16,140;16:18,140;"- Yeah, he was a monster."
16:18,140;16:24,140;"To be fair, he was also the only one still celebrating down three touchdowns in the fourth quarter"
16:24,140;16:26,140;"when he makes a tackle for a loss."
16:26,140;16:29,140;"down three touchdowns in the fourth quarter when he makes a tackle for a loss."
16:29,140;16:36,060;"They got a style that that sealers Eve. Yeah. So the pro boys."
16:36,060;16:37,140;"Attack case."
16:37,140;16:39,740;"Go ahead. Go ahead."
16:39,740;16:43,940;"I was just going to say their D their D line wasn't bad either."
16:43,940;16:45,260;"It's Casey Hampton."
16:45,260;16:48,980;"I remember all these names like"
16:48,980;16:51,820;"all the Kagan's chemo chemo."
16:51,820;16:54,700;"They're on the whole hop and yeah."
16:54,700;16:58,880;"I mean, do you think? I'm like, I'm like, are you ever seen?"
16:58,880;17:03,180;"That's classic football name right there."
17:03,180;17:06,680;"Oh, yeah. Wonder where he's from. Yeah."
17:06,680;17:12,540;"But yeah, so two of those linebackers, Guilden and Porter would actually make the"
17:12,540;17:14,740;"Pro Bowl along with Hines Ward."
17:14,740;17:18,600;"Do I still hate to this day and out of the panic or their guard?"
17:18,600;17:21,300;"Oh, of course you do because you're you're an asshole, too."
17:21,300;17:23,100;"Just like you."
17:24,560;17:25,560;"I like how I'm doing."
17:25,560;17:28,480;"Yeah, well, you're an asshole too, Steve."
17:28,480;17:29,520;"You got it right."
17:29,520;17:33,280;"And I like kinds where I think I like his compete level."
17:33,280;17:34,800;"Yeah, because you're an asshole."
17:34,800;17:37,360;"Yeah, that's true on both counts."
17:37,360;17:38,720;"Transitive property."
17:38,720;17:39,440;"Yeah."
17:39,440;17:41,040;"Yeah, I think that works."
17:41,040;17:42,200;"Real recognized real."
17:42,200;17:46,960;"And the new face on this offense was Antoine Randall L."
17:46,960;17:50,400;"It was also fantastic, but he was mostly a return man this season."
17:50,400;17:52,240;"Well, he's a Swiss army knife."
17:53,360;17:56,780;"he was yet he was there to brown according to john madden"
17:56,780;17:59,480;"his college quarterback right"
17:59,480;18:01,560;"was that it was a not it wasn't"
18:01,560;18:03,120;"it wasn't uh..."
18:03,120;18:06,800;"i almost had a p tak but that can't be right i can't remember where he went to"
18:06,800;18:08,160;"school"
18:08,160;18:09,760;"i got you"
18:09,760;18:13,120;"but back to what i think i got"
18:13,120;18:17,040;"he went to indiana indiana back"
18:17,040;18:20,640;"yeah"
18:20,640;18:22,880;"Maybe not. I'll get back to you on that."
18:22,880;18:26,800;"There was a yeah, who was the Steelers wide receiver that threw a touchdown pass"
18:26,800;18:29,720;"in the Super Bowl? I'm almost positive it's Randall."
18:29,720;18:32,880;"I guess it's he. I thought it was like his fun fact."
18:32,880;18:37,160;"And then they and they talked right and they talked about him playing quarterback"
18:37,160;18:39,080;"in college. I sort of goodness."
18:39,080;18:47,480;"Yeah. He yeah, he was the first player in Division One history to pass for 40"
18:47,480;18:58,480;"career touchdowns and score 40 career rushing touchdowns. He also played for the Indiana basketball team, which is no like"
18:58,480;19:00,120;"middle program."
19:00,120;19:02,360;"Wait, Joel sported at Indiana?"
19:02,360;19:04,200;"Undercoached Bob Knight."
19:04,200;19:05,720;"What a monster."
19:05,720;19:06,720;"Yeah."
19:06,720;19:08,520;"That's impressive."
19:08,520;19:09,720;"That's pretty sick."
19:09,720;19:10,720;"God damn."
19:10,720;19:12,720;"See, how am I like?"
19:12,720;19:13,720;"I was working."
19:13,720;19:14,720;"He had a dick though."
19:14,720;19:16,200;"He almost didn't get it."
19:16,200;19:18,320;"He had to sit out a year before going Indiana"
19:18,320;19:20,560;"because of low SAT scores though."
19:20,560;19:24,080;"Fucking dummy."
19:24,080;19:27,200;"I say T's don't translate to football, but what was a lot"
19:27,200;19:28,400;"of community service though."
19:28,400;19:31,640;"You know, well-rounded applicant."
19:31,640;19:37,600;"So we actually saw Cordell Stewart again in this game,"
19:37,600;19:39,920;"but he would not last long"
19:39,920;19:41,960;"on the season."
19:41,960;19:44,480;"He he got bench in week four because he couldn't stop"
19:44,480;19:50,100;"throwing interceptions, which he started doing from the get go in this game."
19:50,100;19:52,460;"If we want to actually get into it, let's be real."
19:52,460;19:53,700;"He didn't stop doing it, right?"
19:53,700;19:56,420;"He threw two picks to close out the AOC championship game."
19:56,420;19:59,260;"Comes right back goes over three, two INT."
19:59,260;19:59,940;"That's true."
19:59,940;20:00,440;"Yeah."
20:00,440;20:00,900;"Yeah."
20:00,900;20:03,600;"He threw two picks on his first three passes."
20:03,600;20:06,460;"Uh, both of those two were actually back to back."
20:06,460;20:09,940;"So he threw an interception, came right back and decided one wasn't enough."
20:09,940;20:12,640;"And threw another one immediately to Mike"
20:12,640;20:14,760;"of all people, which is hard to do."
20:14,760;20:17,240;"- Dude, he threw right into Raywell's bed."
20:17,240;20:19,520;"He just didn't see him and it's like, here you go."
20:19,520;20:20,520;"- Yeah, that was bad."
20:20,520;20:23,920;"But I have to say, he can,"
20:23,920;20:27,360;"he can huck a football deep from any body position."
20:27,360;20:29,840;"Like he's running sideways and diagonally backwards"
20:29,840;20:32,240;"and just like, just slings it like he's,"
20:32,240;20:34,520;"he's skipping rocks and it goes 60 yards down."
20:34,520;20:37,560;"- You all remember his nickname, right?"
20:37,560;20:38,380;"- Slash."
20:38,380;20:40,560;"- Yeah. - Got him?"
20:40,560;20:41,880;"Yeah."
20:41,880;20:42,720;"I don't know why."
20:42,720;20:45,160;"Didn't he play a bunch of positions too?"
20:45,160;20:46,480;"Quarterback and wide receiver."
20:46,480;20:48,120;"- That's what I was, yep."
20:48,120;20:49,280;"- Running back and all that shit."
20:49,280;20:50,680;"- That's what I was about to get."
20:50,680;20:51,680;"- Yeah."
20:51,680;20:54,200;"- He'll Randall L, he got drafted too,"
20:54,200;20:55,720;"for Major League Baseball."
20:55,720;20:58,520;"- What about Cordell Stewart?"
20:58,520;21:01,280;"- I don't know, I'm two deep into Randall L right now."
21:01,280;21:03,520;"(laughing)"
21:03,520;21:07,960;"So, but yeah, I wanna break up."
21:09,080;21:17,080;"I wanted to touch on somebody who I found fascinating in this while I was doing my research, and that was the guy who took over for Cornell Stewart."
21:17,080;21:21,080;"And that was my boy Tommy Maddox."
21:21,080;21:23,080;"Yeah."
21:23,080;21:27,080;"Pittsburgh legend Tommy Maddox apparently."
21:27,080;21:33,080;"He played in the AFL, just like everybody else in New Jersey Red Dogs."
21:33,080;21:38,820;"Um, they'd okay and also played now the original XFL if you remember that would he hate me and"
21:38,820;21:42,160;"Was the league MVP for that one seat?"
21:42,160;21:46,800;"He actually got drafted by the Broncos. He was supposed to be Elway's replacement and then"
21:46,800;21:51,460;"Obviously wasn't he's a first round pick. Yeah"
21:51,460;21:58,840;"By the back on the Maddox was the first round pick. Yeah, fuck it by the Broncos though"
21:58,840;22:00,640;"so you know, all the way out of hand."
22:00,640;22:03,800;"Yeah, I always thought he was just like a journeyman."
22:03,800;22:05,720;"I never realized that he had."
22:05,720;22:10,800;"I mean, I felt career before like I remember him coming there,"
22:10,800;22:13,440;"being like, oh, yeah, I played XFL this and that."
22:13,440;22:16,440;"I didn't realize that he already had an NFL career."
22:16,440;22:20,880;"Yeah, he had he'd been around the game for a while."
22:20,880;22:24,040;"Cause he from he was already a journeyman."
22:24,040;22:25,960;"He played for Denver for two years."
22:26,960;22:38,300;"the Rams and then the Giants and then took what six years off to play for the XFL and the AFL and then came back to the NFL because he was the"
22:38,300;22:49,020;"XFL League MVP the Steelers picked him up and now he was backing up Cornell Stewart and then he came in and all he did was"
22:49,020;22:53,000;"which game it was. It was one of his earlier games. He set the"
22:53,000;22:57,460;"week 10 against the Falcons. He set the Steelers record for"
22:57,460;23:02,820;"passing yards in a game with 473. In a game that the Steelers"
23:02,820;23:08,900;"would go on to tie 3434, which has that's got to be like the"
23:08,900;23:12,780;"worst tie in NFL history. That's probably worse than like a"
23:12,780;23:16,700;"three three like a shootout that ends in a tie just that feeling"
23:16,700;23:18,660;"like a blue ball sort of thing. Yeah, come on."
23:18,660;23:28,740;"Right. And then the week after, against the Titans, he got hit as he was throwing, like,"
23:28,740;23:33,060;"tripped over somebody. And apparently, they hit, left him briefly paralyzed and he was"
23:33,060;23:34,500;"taking to the hospital on a stretcher."
23:34,500;23:41,300;"No, yeah. I remember that. Yeah. Right. But then came back in time for the playoffs,"
23:41,300;23:42,220;"the playoffs to the Ravens."
23:42,220;23:46,300;"No, sorry to the Titans, actually. Went and lost the Titans again."
23:46,300;23:48,700;"in a shootout 3134."
23:48,700;23:50,660;"Also over time."
23:50,660;23:57,100;"So he is one of the more fascinating stories that I had no idea about because"
23:57,100;24:01,300;"the only reason I recognize the name Tommy Maddox is because I'm pretty sure I had"
24:01,300;24:04,380;"his rookie card, his football card back in the day."
24:04,380;24:06,100;"1992."
24:06,100;24:06,900;"Yeah."
24:06,900;24:07,100;"Yeah."
24:07,100;24:09,420;"We were collecting football cards back then."
24:09,420;24:09,900;"What was I?"
24:09,900;24:10,860;"Nine."
24:10,860;24:13,380;"That was like peak football cards."
24:13,380;24:22,180;"It's a what I'm just a twinkle in your father's eye in 1992. I was three years old four years old"
24:22,180;24:25,780;"That sounds about right"
24:25,780;24:30,140;"Yeah, I was five. I don't remember shit from 1992. I"
24:30,140;24:36,180;"Was not I barely remember except for my to me Maddox you say la"
24:36,180;24:39,220;"rookie card"
24:39,220;24:42,900;"Probably that would have been worth money now if I knew it was gonna be an XFL MVP. I would have kept it"
24:42,900;24:51,340;"You know easy companies you go the New Jersey Red Dogs is a pretty sick name. I wonder if that's related to the beer"
24:51,340;24:52,940;"hot"
24:52,940;24:58,260;"If it wasn't they missed a great opportunity. Oh, yeah, dude talk about branding"
24:58,260;25:00,900;"Like free giveaways at the game"
25:00,900;25:07,800;"Yeah, all the beers cost money except for red dogs. Yeah, which you can give as many as you want"
25:08,580;25:11,240;"They did the mascot's just shit face the whole time"
25:11,240;25:16,940;"There's a lot you do that he's got the t-shirt gum, but he's just shooting out cans of red dog"
25:16,940;25:21,740;"Apparently there was another LA"
25:21,740;25:27,020;"Oh wait LA extreme is the exit fell right yes. Yeah"
25:27,020;25:30,060;"Did he have a nickname?"
25:30,060;25:33,420;"Tommy Maddox. Yeah, you remember he's putting out"
25:34,100;25:40,060;"Yeah, he's putting nicknames on the back of their jerseys. Yeah, we call himself TM 12. Yeah, I mean"
25:40,060;25:43,780;"He is pretty white, so he probably just went with Maddox"
25:43,780;25:46,580;"Probably what with Tommy"
25:46,580;25:51,900;"That's the other thing the guy is don't go by Tommy like you're loud if you're a grown man like Andy"
25:51,900;25:54,900;"I'm Andrew. Thank you very much"
25:54,900;25:58,580;"How dare you call me?"
25:58,580;26:01,140;"Reserve for my mother stop it"
26:02,340;26:03,340;"about Gregory."
26:03,340;26:06,060;"Greg, don't know about Gregory."
26:06,060;26:08,020;"And then didn't know why."
26:08,020;26:09,500;"That's pretty terrible."
26:09,500;26:12,860;"So bad parenting is what that is."
26:12,860;26:14,500;"Thomas Alfred Maddox."
26:14,500;26:16,980;"And he goes by Tom."
26:16,980;26:18,620;"White is human ever."
26:18,620;26:22,660;"Go by Tom, but Alfred, though."
26:22,660;26:23,660;"Alfred."
26:23,660;26:24,660;"Tommy Al."
26:24,660;26:26,860;"You sure he's gone by TA Maddox."
26:26,860;26:27,860;"That's right."
26:27,860;26:28,860;"TA Maddox."
26:28,860;26:30,860;"Yeah, right"
26:30,860;26:32,800;"T.A. Maddox sounds like he's a fucking"
26:32,800;26:38,580;"writer of short stories, but luckily we didn't have to we didn't have to see T.A. Maddox playing this game"
26:38,580;26:42,820;"It was all Cornell and he was he was generous. I thought"
26:42,820;26:48,340;"Even starting from his first drive you through an interception by our old friend Terrell Buckley"
26:48,340;26:55,140;"Who was all my favorites back in the day before we get too far should we talk about the banner raising the opening ceremony?"
26:55,140;26:57,340;"It's just a less this game. I"
26:58,180;27:01,740;"Yes, I have notes about about that. Oh, it's here"
27:01,740;27:08,580;"Well, I don't want to go. I mean and look did everyone get to watch any of it like the"
27:08,580;27:14,140;"Do you guys see the Dennis Hopper opener? Yeah, dude. What was that?"
27:14,140;27:24,860;"Yeah, it run us through that. You waited it so Dennis Hopper, you know, I think would you know like usually was the first game of the NFL season. I"
27:26,380;27:31,360;"I think it was the first televised game of or was that is right wasn't it wasn't that"
27:31,360;27:35,140;"Game of that season. No, it was a Sunday night games was the first"
27:35,140;27:41,560;"Yeah, primetime game. It was a Monday night. It was it was a Monday night. Sorry. Yeah. Yeah"
27:41,560;27:44,340;"Yeah, it was it was a Monday night game"
27:44,340;27:47,320;"and"
27:47,320;27:49,320;"Dennis Hopper is just like"
27:49,320;27:55,980;"You know recapping the Patriots miracle season from the year before talking about the young kid Tom Brady"
27:55,980;28:00,480;"And then you get into the snowball game with the tuck rule and he like"
28:00,480;28:06,780;"Is dressed like the an abominable snowman with like white paper confetti?"
28:06,780;28:13,460;"fake snow like it was the corniest it was the corniest thing I've ever seen and"
28:13,460;28:18,700;"I thought that was gonna be the thing that the thing that pissed me off the most but no"
28:18,700;28:22,900;"Nick Carter from the backstreet boy"
28:22,900;28:25,340;"shoulder"
28:25,340;28:31,760;"To sing the national anthem for the fucking banner raising night for the Patriots pissed me off so bad"
28:31,760;28:34,020;"Nick Carter. I was"
28:34,020;28:36,420;"disgusted"
28:36,420;28:43,340;"I loved it. It's like I liked the backstreet boys kind of but I was you know"
28:43,340;28:45,340;"I was just appalled seeing that I"
28:45,340;28:52,820;"Wasn't odd choice, but they also coming back from commercial one of the like the the coming back into it things"
28:53,820;29:00,500;"They had a nickelback song on to you. We can cut that. I think it was nickelback. Oh, what a little maybe getting Nick"
29:00,500;29:06,080;"Maybe getting Nick Carter to sing the National Anthem in 2002 is like a"
29:06,080;29:10,660;"Huge deal and I just don't realize it but hey"
29:10,660;29:15,020;"See you from around here Nick Carter"
29:15,020;29:21,340;"Your local boy, I gain Nick cada. I feel like you'd want somebody who's like I'm around here"
29:22,580;29:25,160;"No, he's well. I mean it's nationally televised game"
29:25,160;29:29,200;"The the Boston Globe was pretty pissed off about it, too"
29:29,200;29:34,000;"Look Jeff waggenheim one of his best simwares was"
29:34,000;29:46,240;"A backstreet boy singing in quotations the anthem and then in parentheses wasn't it past bedtime for teeny-bauper?"
29:46,240;29:57,600;"question. Oh, yeah. I'm not coming. That's old man yells at crowd. I mean, I'm going to throw"
29:57,600;30:03,440;"Connor in that category too. But I mean, it's a song. Well, we can't have like a singer sing a"
30:03,440;30:10,800;"song for a game. What's wrong with that? I don't know if I you would just think that they could find"
30:10,800;30:14,140;"someone more impressive. Oh, like,"
30:14,140;30:14,940;"they told her something."
30:14,940;30:15,440;"overnight."
30:15,440;30:20,220;"It's over. Nick, Nick, Nick Carter is,"
30:20,220;30:22,780;"Nick Carter is from New York."
30:22,780;30:25,620;"I don't know. It just, again,"
30:25,620;30:27,360;"it is old man that yells at cloud."
30:27,360;30:29,720;"I was watching the game"
30:29,720;30:33,260;"fucking 18 years later today."
30:33,260;30:35,700;"And I was just like, what is this?"
30:35,700;30:38,300;"I can see both sides of it."
30:38,300;30:40,700;"On one hand, I get"
30:40,700;30:46,780;"You know Nick Carter 2002 pretty fucking famous. Yep, probably that's probably"
30:46,780;30:53,420;"the one that flip side is you having this guy with frosted tips that also matched"
30:53,420;30:58,900;"Lonnie Paxton's newly and like is that really the tone you want to be setting"
30:58,900;31:02,660;"with your football team for the season. John Madden was all about giving Lonnie"
31:02,660;31:07,420;"Paxton shit for what happened to his hair. Someone was telling him his hair. It was"
31:07,420;31:08,920;"- This is ridiculous."
31:08,920;31:12,580;"- We should probably talk about John Madden too,"
31:12,580;31:17,380;"'cause this was his first game on the ABC."
31:17,380;31:18,980;"- And it's risking with Al, right?"
31:18,980;31:20,460;"- Doing Al Michael, yeah."
31:20,460;31:21,620;"- Yeah."
31:21,620;31:24,380;"- And that was a, it wasn't bad."
31:24,380;31:27,220;"- It was the first time since 1979"
31:27,220;31:30,940;"that he had, there wasn't an NFC team involved"
31:30,940;31:32,420;"in the game he was calling."
31:32,420;31:34,020;"- Holy shit. - Wow."
31:34,020;31:35,540;"- Yeah, for the longest time."
31:35,540;31:36,940;"Yeah, 'cause he used to be on Fox,"
31:36,940;31:38,260;"I mean, we did have a seat."
31:38,260;31:39,260;"Exactly."
31:39,260;31:42,220;"So he did have one mess up."
31:42,220;31:43,900;"Well, one of many."
31:43,900;31:47,500;"It was the beginning of the second quarter."
31:47,500;31:49,620;"He is like, replaying a screen."
31:49,620;31:51,820;"And there's three defenders on the screen."
31:51,820;31:52,940;"And he's like, this guy right here."
31:52,940;31:54,660;"He circles around one."
31:54,660;31:55,220;"And then he's--"
31:55,220;31:55,700;"It's horrible."
31:55,700;31:56,500;"Yeah."
31:56,500;31:58,100;"He circles the other guy."
31:58,100;32:01,580;"So you have to not circle the guy you're supposed to watch."
32:01,580;32:04,180;"Yeah."
32:04,180;32:05,940;"And then there was the play where"
32:05,940;32:09,700;"They were replaying Troy Brown's toe tap catch"
32:09,700;32:11,700;"and it was going to replay."
32:11,700;32:13,420;"And first they called it a catch."
32:13,420;32:16,180;"So Bill Coward tried to challenge it."
32:16,180;32:17,580;"And then they overruled it"
32:17,580;32:18,500;"and called me complete."
32:18,500;32:20,380;"So Bellacheck challenged it."
32:20,380;32:23,980;"And Madden seemed to think it was blatantly not a catch."
32:23,980;32:27,420;"So he decided to go on a tangent while they kept replaying"
32:27,420;32:28,660;"that it was obviously a catch"
32:28,660;32:31,660;"and it was gonna get overturned and read a catch."
32:31,660;32:33,060;"And it took him a good five minutes"
32:33,060;32:35,740;"like of a couple of different stores before"
32:35,740;32:37,060;"Somebody must have tapped him on the shoulder and be like,"
32:37,060;32:38,460;"hey, by the way, you should probably talk about this"
32:38,460;32:40,060;"'cause it's gonna be a catch."
32:40,060;32:43,580;"He's like, oh, oh, actually, look at this."
32:43,580;32:45,140;"You guys seeing what I'm saying?"
32:45,140;32:46,460;"- Yeah, I was thinking about that."
32:46,460;32:47,940;"- We've been seeing it."
32:47,940;32:50,100;"- Yep, Jeff Wagonheim from Boston Globe"
32:50,100;32:51,460;"had a comment on that as well."
32:51,460;32:53,340;"(laughing)"
32:53,340;32:55,100;"He seems to have some opinions, let's hear it."
32:55,100;32:58,340;"- Apparently the ref said that brown drug"
32:58,340;33:01,580;"is another foot inbounds rather than dragged."
33:01,580;33:05,340;"So Jeff said that that was the worst drug test"
33:05,340;33:16,300;"of the game. Jeff. Oh my god. Yeah. This guy's like Greg Easter before the Internet. Typical"
33:16,300;33:29,580;"Jeff Wagonheim. Am I right? I wonder if he's still doing this thing. No, it doesn't seem"
33:29,580;33:32,980;"racist enough. Jeff Wagonheim. There's a Jeff Wagonheim on Twitter. He doesn't know"
33:32,980;33:40,420;"to use it when you come to a fork in the road take it yeah that's that's a quote"
33:40,420;33:47,700;"this by Yogi Bear I assume oh man what's your favorite Yogi Bear quote nobody"
33:47,700;33:52,380;"goes or anymore it's too crowded yeah that's my favorite to know like it gets"
33:52,380;33:59,700;"laid out there early that's a good thing but speaking of early if we're"
33:59,700;34:03,640;"talking about the crowd in this game. There was a thing in the Boston Globe"
34:03,640;34:08,940;"about how great the traffic flow was. Yeah, this is fucking right."
34:08,940;34:14,580;"No, at exactly because and they're their only praise was that they were"
34:14,580;34:20,880;"planning on opening the stadium an extra hour early at 4pm for this what"
34:20,880;34:26,600;"nine o'clock game. No time it started. It started nine o'clock. But because"
34:26,600;34:30,060;"people had arrived so early that traffic was starting back up."
34:30,060;34:34,180;"So they opened it at 3.30 just so they could let everybody in early"
34:34,180;34:35,660;"enough to get super fucking drunk."
34:35,660;34:39,520;"And they they felt drunk to me."
34:39,520;34:41,880;"Well, they haven't gone to a few games over the years."
34:41,880;34:43,980;"Like this this crowd was fucking rowdy."
34:43,980;34:46,220;"They started a Madden chant at the end."
34:46,220;34:49,180;"Like at him Monday night football."
34:49,180;34:52,340;"You just come off a Super Bowl raising a banner brand new stadium."
34:52,340;34:53,180;"Hell yeah."
34:53,180;34:54,260;"First banner."
34:54,260;34:54,580;"Absolutely."
34:55,820;34:56,720;"Well, they didn't know that."
34:56,720;34:59,540;"Yeah, the first battle of little big one."
34:59,540;35:00,380;"They don't fucking know, do they?"
35:00,380;35:01,220;"Yeah, could be the last one."
35:01,220;35:02,780;"I think you better make it all the end of it."
35:02,780;35:05,700;"And call a World War one until the second one happened."
35:05,700;35:08,700;"Surprisingly, they're they were underdogs."
35:08,700;35:09,700;"The Pats going in."
35:09,700;35:14,260;"Yeah, they were three point dogs, which I found surprising for this."
35:14,260;35:17,860;"It was they showed us that was the first time since 83 that the Super Bowl champs"
35:17,860;35:19,620;"were underdogs in their season over there."
35:19,620;35:21,020;"Yeah."
35:21,020;35:21,940;"Shit stomped them."
35:21,940;35:22,940;"Bullshit."
35:22,940;35:23,980;"I'll teach you."
35:24,420;35:26,420;"Yeah, we should stay at say the final score. Was it?"
35:26,420;35:32,660;"Oh, yeah, 30 to 14. Yeah, which we'll get to and not be in that"
35:32,660;35:35,820;"close. Wasn't even near that because we were so not it was"
35:35,820;35:39,660;"30 to seven really. But we'll get to that. Do any guys"
35:39,660;35:42,980;"talk about this game? This is officially Gillette by this"
35:42,980;35:47,020;"point, right? Yeah, yes. Yeah, it was no longer. We don't know"
35:47,020;35:50,220;"what happened. Like nobody ever said what happened from CMGI"
35:50,220;35:53,100;"field to Gillette, but they announced it as Gillette field."
35:53,540;35:57,500;"Well, I read an article in the Hartford current about it."
35:57,500;35:59,740;"As you do."
35:59,740;36:05,620;"See, CMG is stock was like the hottest thing in the streets."
36:05,620;36:06,220;"Yeah."
36:06,220;36:13,300;"As recently as January 2000, it was at $163 a share."
36:13,300;36:16,700;"And then by August."
36:16,700;36:17,380;"It's a thousand."
36:17,380;36:18,540;"Yeah."
36:18,540;36:20,860;"Well, it was that in 9/11, I guess."
36:20,860;36:22,740;"Oh."
36:22,940;36:28,220;"But yeah, I think 9/11 kind of like the dot com bubble happened and then 9/11 happened and just kind of like crushed any"
36:28,220;36:35,660;"Anything that was left of right there really depended on the stock market. So like when everything there was no money out there for them"
36:35,660;36:37,660;"Yeah"
36:37,660;36:44,140;"But it went from a hundred sixty three dollars a share to uh 40 cents a share in like a year now. Oh god"
36:44,140;36:49,100;"So, uh, I think people lost a shit load of money"
36:51,820;36:53,580;"God damn, that's brutal."
36:53,580;36:57,820;"Well, that explains why I don't have the rights to the naming of the stadium, I guess."
36:57,820;36:58,540;"-Yep."
36:58,540;36:59,500;"-She's..."
36:59,500;37:00,460;"-Do you take stock?"
37:00,460;37:06,140;"-It would pay in $10 million a year for the rights."
37:06,140;37:08,780;"-That seems reasonable."
37:08,780;37:10,380;"-Yeah, this day and age."
37:10,380;37:11,740;"-Like from a business perspective, yeah."
37:11,740;37:12,940;"-Yeah."
37:12,940;37:17,660;"-I wonder if you have to sign like a multi-year thing, though, like a half-"
37:17,660;37:20,540;"-Yeah, it was $114 for 15 years."
37:20,540;37:25,540;"- Wow, I really am. - But then the stadium itself only costs $3.25."
37:25,540;37:29,840;"- Yeah, so you're getting a good chunk of money back."
37:29,840;37:31,540;"I wonder if all that has to be paid in front."
37:31,540;37:32,880;"- Like isn't the new Raiders stadium like,"
37:32,880;37:35,060;"are the Rams stadium a billion?"
37:35,060;37:36,720;"- Probably. - Yeah."
37:36,720;37:39,380;"- But I mean all that money is like all inflated,"
37:39,380;37:40,620;"everything anyway nowadays."
37:40,620;37:42,060;"- Yeah, it's fake money. - It's triple money."
37:42,060;37:43,340;"- At the time, it was at the time,"
37:43,340;37:45,740;"it was a ridiculous amount of money to spend on the stadium."
37:45,740;37:48,940;"On top of the money that he spent on the team itself."
37:48,940;37:50,100;"- Right."
37:50,100;37:55,680;"is I will be able to do a deep dive on that one day because that's what we guys talking about I had to feed my dog"
37:55,680;38:05,260;"Stadium yeah, sorry. Sorry. I cool Brad. I remember when it first when"
38:05,260;38:08,800;"It wasn't a brag. I'm sorry. He was"
38:08,800;38:15,380;"Anyways, you guys like that open concept. I want it first. Yeah, I do"
38:15,380;38:24,460;"I don't know if it's still a lore from when I was younger and like the that big archway with the open concept seemed like it was pretty"
38:24,460;38:28,360;"Cutting edge not cutting edge, but like a new"
38:28,360;38:35,860;"A new design at that time. Yeah, we're going on what 18 years now of that thing being what it is so"
38:35,860;38:38,260;"For an 18 year old stadium"
38:38,260;38:42,660;"I don't know I go back and forth"
38:43,260;38:50,060;"Like I like it because of like memories I have there, but I think I don't think it has anything to do with like"
38:50,060;38:52,260;"How the stadium is designed?"
38:52,260;38:54,580;"To me, it's kind of like me"
38:54,580;38:59,580;"I think the stadium's fine the whole experience with the route one"
38:59,580;39:05,980;"Really heard right and you go to other stadiums around the country like this stadium is like way better"
39:05,980;39:10,220;"Like whole process of everything. You know where a rescue games are great"
39:12,020;39:14,020;"No time"
39:14,020;39:18,140;"And feel this sweet or like Seattle stadium. It's because the"
39:18,140;39:21,580;"Do you think it's because"
39:21,580;39:27,460;"Our tailgate is so black that you walk into the stadium not feeling"
39:27,460;39:30,740;"Inspired because"
39:30,740;39:35,060;"After bills tailgate, I don't walk in this and I know it's a shit hole"
39:35,060;39:38,020;"I don't walk in and I'm like god this place is a shit hole"
39:38,020;39:42,020;"I'm all pumped because it was just like the best tailgate of my life."
39:42,020;39:48,220;"Whereas Gillette, everyone is just kind of like, I don't know, maybe in 2001 or 2002,"
39:48,220;39:54,220;"people were had a little more pep in their step, but going back in recent these past"
39:54,220;39:58,820;"these past couple years, it's just people are just sitting around like, yeah, where the"
39:58,820;40:03,620;"best, like, I don't know, you know, I'll maybe, yeah, exactly."
40:03,620;40:09,240;"Well, I think even just watching I remember the feeling watching games back then compared to now and"
40:09,240;40:11,700;"I felt it again recently"
40:11,700;40:17,620;"when Brady was suspended for the first four games of whatever season was with 2018 and"
40:17,620;40:24,100;"You would go into the game first game back. No, no those first four games"
40:24,100;40:30,740;"Right. Yeah, and you go into them and it had a completely different feeling because I"
40:30,740;40:32,940;"realized that"
40:32,940;40:39,980;"Over the years you go into the game expecting the patrons to win and now you have this this stress of them living up to your"
40:39,980;40:43,180;"Expectations and if they didn't you get all piss well I got all pissy"
40:43,180;40:49,580;"Because they're not playing like I know that they can sort of thing whereas when you had Jimmy G and it was like hey"
40:49,580;40:54,100;"Maybe they'll win this and maybe they won't but at least it's exciting. Let's find out and I think"
40:54,100;40:57,580;"That part of it. I think it's probably what's missing from"
40:57,580;41:00,380;"Patriots tailgating these days"
41:01,580;41:07,580;"Yeah, I mean you don't really even care. I don't want to say you don't care about you don't really even care about the games"
41:07,580;41:11,740;"Until the playoffs this pet these past like yeah, you just yeah the winds the winds don't mean"
41:11,740;41:22,900;"Just such a spot on when that started I I would say probably from like the 2007 season on yeah, right"
41:22,900;41:26,420;"I think when we went one those first three were still kind of spunky"
41:26,420;41:29,980;"You know spunky fan base like we still have like"
41:31,060;41:37,500;"You know, we're finally starting to see success with the socks, you know, we're like the miserable Boston fan"
41:37,500;41:42,860;"It's just it was it was groomed in red socks misery"
41:42,860;41:45,460;"So we brought that like chip on it"
41:45,460;41:51,540;"We brought that chip on our shoulder like over into football season and with our Patriots fans"
41:51,540;41:58,220;"And then we just became like just cocky and didn't really get up for games probably"
41:58,220;42:03,980;"Yeah, like, it just felt like as soon as, as soon as Brady took over this offense and became"
42:03,980;42:10,140;"elite at what he was doing, like you said in probably 2000, even maybe even 2006, he was dragging"
42:10,140;42:15,340;"the team along with him. And so you just never felt like you're actually out of any game and you"
42:15,340;42:20,940;"kind of expected him to win it every time. So it came with this expectation of if they don't do it,"
42:20,940;42:23,740;"you're disappointed in Tom Brady because he didn't do what he normally does, you know?"
42:24,940;42:28,540;"You're like, I hope they win this game in like a unique way that I remember."
42:28,540;42:29,840;"Yeah, exactly."
42:29,840;42:35,940;"You know, how many lions in Browns and bills fans you're pissing off right now?"
42:35,940;42:39,240;"None because not a fucking papers podcast."
42:39,240;42:47,540;"Literally earlier today, I had my lion's friend try to tell me he was talking himself into Matt Stafford as league MVP."
42:47,540;42:53,140;"Because it's not like 6,000, you know, plus 6,000."
42:53,140;42:55,140;"He's like yeah, man. It's like she not a bad bet"
42:55,140;43:03,500;"Who are they throwing to like with that even Jesus"
43:03,500;43:10,260;"Megatron out of retirement like wrong dude, but like that's his he's like this is my cycle"
43:10,260;43:14,540;"You know I'm at the point right now where like shit man anything's possible"
43:14,540;43:20,780;"Exactly what's most possible that they're like 25 year like playoff street continues"
43:20,780;43:25,780;"Yeah, I think that is."
43:25,780;43:30,780;"You know what part of Gillette is really nice though is their drunk tank."
43:30,780;43:32,780;"Oh really? Yeah."
43:32,780;43:34,780;"Explain it to me."
43:34,780;43:35,780;"It's under the sit."
43:35,780;43:37,780;"Well, I actually don't know where it is."
43:37,780;43:40,780;"Oh, you don't remember where."
43:40,780;43:41,780;"Correct."
43:41,780;43:45,780;"It's very cavernous though."
43:45,780;43:48,780;"So I thought it was under the stadium, but I'm not positive."
43:48,780;43:50,780;"It's very roomy, is what you're saying?"
43:50,780;43:51,780;"Yeah, yeah."
43:51,780;43:52,780;"Yeah."
43:52,780;43:53,780;"All right."
43:53,780;43:54,780;"That's nice."
43:54,780;43:55,780;"Any accoutrement?"
43:55,780;43:58,780;"I was in there with another kid."
43:58,780;44:01,780;"He didn't like me."
44:01,780;44:02,780;"No, why is that?"
44:02,780;44:03,780;"I don't know."
44:03,780;44:04,780;"Don't remember."
44:04,780;44:07,780;"Was the game on?"
44:07,780;44:09,780;"I was banging on the window."
44:09,780;44:11,780;"I was like, tell me the score."
44:11,780;44:13,780;"And they were like, no."
44:13,780;44:17,780;"Oh, Jesus Christ."
44:17,780;44:19,780;"and"
44:19,780;44:26,380;"Then Kelly's learn about your brother picked me up you were with here in months. That's correct"
44:26,380;44:37,500;"Okay, it was a early day still god bless me god unless still stuck around"
44:37,500;44:41,060;"Yep, I mean"
44:41,060;44:43,460;"in"
44:43,460;44:45,460;"in Gillette"
44:45,780;44:49,760;"Securities defense you are insufferable. Yes"
44:49,760;44:57,120;"Once you get one once you get past that level you are you are you're pretty insufferable"
44:57,120;45:02,480;"Yeah in terms of I mean I personally love it because it's usually directed at"
45:02,480;45:06,960;"Me a bill's hands. We go to bills bring together. So and that's always fun"
45:06,960;45:11,780;"But you've certainly gotten some RV tires slashed"
45:11,780;45:15,340;"to"
45:15,340;45:21,660;"Oh, yeah. Yep. It could have been rock good rocks thrown at us"
45:21,660;45:24,620;"Rock stone at us. Yeah"
45:24,620;45:27,060;"Greg had beer starts you didn't you?"
45:27,060;45:31,420;"When you're sitting on top of the over you and I don't know what the inflatable given. Yeah. Yeah, yeah"
45:31,420;45:36,020;"That's annual that's common place. Yeah, just like snow"
45:41,420;45:47,860;"Dear Jesus, are we we gonna get into this game? I want to talk about I'm just gonna say while we've been talking"
45:47,860;45:50,060;"Well, Cornell's do it. Just do another interception"
45:50,060;45:56,800;"We're probably talking about that so yeah, I was gonna talk about you want to talk about Cordell"
45:56,800;45:59,020;"go ahead"
45:59,020;46:02,860;"You have the floor. I was just gonna I was just gonna say that"
46:02,860;46:07,660;"What's all the offseason talk about like knows Tom Brady?"
46:07,660;46:10,660;"Was this just the fluke?"
46:10,660;46:18,020;"is Rohan Devi gonna you know up settle you know take the starting job at some point and"
46:18,020;46:25,420;"Deepa you're gonna figure out Tom Brady and yeah big dick Tommy"
46:25,420;46:30,060;"Had himself a game. I mean I want it"
46:30,060;46:36,940;"67% completion percentage a sea hair under 300 yards"
46:37,460;46:42,580;"No picks three TDs just came out there and was just laying in"
46:42,580;46:46,220;"Yeah, obviously, you know our tenant to run the ball"
46:46,220;46:48,980;"No"
46:48,980;46:55,940;"No, our defense give granted put us in great spots all throughout the game. There's just a ton of turnovers"
46:55,940;47:00,980;"But what a statement from Tom I thought"
47:01,980;47:06,560;"He's a bunch of new faces - I mean Dion branch had a huge game"
47:06,560;47:10,760;"Six receptions the cam Cleveland. I mean he was"
47:10,760;47:14,200;"Don't it all over the field"
47:14,200;47:16,200;"It's a drops in the bucket"
47:16,200;47:20,900;"It started off pork cuz the first Steelers pick they turn it into nothing they went three now"
47:20,900;47:24,740;"Second one field. Yeah, they got touched down on"
47:24,740;47:29,760;"I think that was the first ever points scored in the New Gillette stadium"
47:30,420;47:33,100;"a little trivia thing. Yeah, brave to Christian for you."
47:33,100;47:37,360;"And then I was going, but even natural, I was only because the seals have"
47:37,360;47:41,060;"committed penalties on third down, like defensive holding and jumping off"
47:41,060;47:42,120;"sides and all sorts of bullshit."
47:42,120;47:45,860;"And it's still just got some, they got a going, right?"
47:45,860;47:48,620;"They had that bullshit pass interference on Tyla."
47:48,620;47:50,220;"Tyla, Greg, it's a good job."
47:50,220;47:53,620;"You don't watch this game because Tyla, this is, and you know what?"
47:53,620;47:56,460;"I'm actually a little pissed that you didn't get to see this game because"
47:57,100;47:59,600;"this i thought you were going to actually"
47:59,600;48:01,620;"join me on the dark side"
48:01,620;48:03,300;"because the reason"
48:03,300;48:07,400;"the the past and parents calls were getting called on tyla was because"
48:07,400;48:09,800;"hinds ward was flopping all over the place"
48:09,800;48:11,820;"anytime he was a catch the ball he's kind of like"
48:11,820;48:13,420;"flopped over on the ground"
48:13,420;48:16,100;"and i'll i kept getting called for past and fairs happened twice once the"
48:16,100;48:21,480;"end so he he he he was the that's literally hinds ward"
48:21,480;48:25,080;"he was the best in the league at that he was known for that"
48:25,080;48:30,920;"So he's doing that and he's like starting fights after after turnovers and stuff and he's just like"
48:30,920;48:34,120;"you know, he's obviously known for his his"
48:34,120;48:36,840;"We'll call them"
48:36,840;48:42,280;"Generously his borderline blocks his crack back blocks on people who he's injured and stuff"
48:42,280;48:45,960;"Just not a fan of him. Although to be fair"
48:45,960;48:49,880;"Money is not a new team. Love him when he is. Oh, yeah, and and"
48:50,920;48:54,840;"In his defense, there's a lot of people looking to get their shots in on him."
48:54,840;48:58,360;"So even if he caught the ball, went to ground, nobody like tagged him down."
48:58,360;49:01,480;"They fucking jumped on him like helmet first."
49:01,480;49:06,760;"And especially Lori Malloy, who was just going in heavy literally every time he was"
49:06,760;49:07,760;"even close to the ball."
49:07,760;49:09,360;"And he just like popped back up."
49:09,360;49:10,760;"He's like, yeah, I get it."
49:10,760;49:13,120;"You know, gave the guy a pat on the button."
49:13,120;49:14,280;"I have to the next play."
49:14,280;49:17,360;"That was like elite tie law years too."
49:17,360;49:18,600;"And he still had a game."
49:19,360;49:21,400;"Yeah, you had like 10 tackles."
49:21,400;49:23,920;"Yeah, back."
49:23,920;49:25,480;"I'm sad that one touchdown on him."
49:25,480;49:26,640;"He got him pretty good."
49:26,640;49:29,120;"Always lazy getting over on the defense on the motion"
49:29,120;49:31,840;"and he'd be in a pretty clean."
49:31,840;49:33,280;"Yeah."
49:33,280;49:35,840;"But that PI on that first drive"
49:35,840;49:38,480;"the second half or second quarter,"
49:38,480;49:40,720;"where they called two PIs on tie."
49:40,720;49:42,600;"Both are pretty bullshit."
49:42,600;49:45,360;"So Steve, we had the ball first and goal from the one."
49:45,360;49:46,920;"This is a man's job."
49:46,920;49:48,760;"And then they fall the fuck apart."
49:48,760;49:52,680;"Yeah, the refs called a false start, which was also bullshit, which wasn't there."
49:52,680;49:54,280;"Yeah, that was a bad call."
49:54,280;50:00,400;"And then like Chris, food, Matu, Maha, Fala, like had the ball knocked away from him by lawyer or someone after the play."
50:00,400;50:02,040;"It's personal foul."
50:02,040;50:05,080;"So then they're kicking a field goal and they have a false start."
50:05,080;50:07,160;"He's got their field goal."
50:07,160;50:09,680;"And then it cuts our space."
50:09,680;50:10,720;"Oh, baby."
50:10,720;50:15,280;"It was like, yeah, it was the bill,"
50:15,280;50:16,780;"- All cow faces up there, I think,"
50:16,780;50:20,940;"were on the pantheon of annoyed faces."
50:20,940;50:22,020;"- Yeah, he had a classic."
50:22,020;50:23,380;"- The Manning brothers."
50:23,380;50:24,220;"- Yeah."
50:24,220;50:25,380;"- He's definitely like that kind of that,"
50:25,380;50:29,660;"that jaw, whereas mouth almost becomes like non-existent"
50:29,660;50:32,060;"and it's all bottom chin."
50:32,060;50:34,900;"- Yeah, it extends past his nose, it's ridiculous."
50:34,900;50:36,820;"- It's fantastic, yeah."
50:36,820;50:38,620;"And that was peak because yeah, they did."
50:38,620;50:41,940;"I actually wrote this down 'cause they get a first down,"
50:44,820;50:49,740;"first, like you said, first and go from the one and then they get backed up on penalties"
50:49,740;50:54,240;"and then they complete a pass on third down to Fu Mathu Mahfala."
50:54,240;50:55,240;"One bad Mahfala."
50:55,240;50:56,240;"Exactly."
50:56,240;50:58,260;"So he gets tackled at the one or the two, right?"
50:58,260;51:04,100;"So chip shot field goal, but then Loyah Maloy does his bullshit like, because Fu Mathu"
51:04,100;51:05,340;"Mahfala tries to reach it out."
51:05,340;51:07,380;"So he just like knocks out of his hand."
51:07,380;51:12,300;"And so he gets up and like pushes Maloy in the chest and gets a 15-hour penalty."
51:12,300;51:14,320;"now they're kicking from the 15,"
51:14,320;51:15,780;"which still makeable field goal,"
51:15,780;51:17,500;"but then they do a false start,"
51:17,500;51:18,700;"which moves them back another way."
51:18,700;51:21,500;"They even further back and then they missed the field goal."
51:21,500;51:22,660;"Why is left?"
51:22,660;51:24,260;"- For the peaches to take the fall back down"
51:24,260;51:27,340;"and hit the exact same field goal from Ben and Terry."
51:27,340;51:28,740;"- Exactly, yeah."
51:28,740;51:33,740;"- Yeah, Jeff Wagonheim said that that was the best bus stop."
51:33,740;51:36,000;"(laughing)"
51:36,000;51:40,660;"- There was a lot of bus stops in this."
51:40,660;51:42,260;"I don't know if that's the best one."
51:42,260;51:45,160;"It was one that I think it was um, Willy McGinnis"
51:45,160;51:48,580;"Just came off the edge and the bus tried to do it"
51:48,580;51:54,860;"He was like it wasn't even a sweep it was just like out off tackle sort of thing and just ran him over like he was"
51:54,860;52:01,020;"It was like us playing football back in the day where I was like a foot taller than all of you"
52:01,020;52:06,020;"And I could just tackle you at will is like whatever angle it didn't matter if you had the"
52:06,020;52:11,780;"The momentum or anything like you just hit me and you just fall over and it looked just like that"
52:11,780;52:13,780;"I don't remember this at all."
52:13,780;52:15,140;"- I don't remember that either."
52:15,140;52:16,060;"- Of course you don't."
52:16,060;52:17,900;"It's all the concussions I gave you."
52:17,900;52:20,140;"(laughing)"
52:20,140;52:26,980;"So Pat's opened up half to with a Donald Hayes touchdown."
52:26,980;52:31,220;"It was actually a really nice turn after you get the ball"
52:31,220;52:33,420;"and an awesome block by Dion."
52:33,420;52:37,780;"- Donald Hayes who we saw at the end of last season,"
52:37,780;52:40,020;"regular season playing for the Panthers."
52:40,020;52:45,420;"And he's the one that had a couple of footballs come off his hands that were returned for touchdowns."
52:45,420;52:48,540;"And they were like, I like what I see there."
52:48,540;52:49,780;"Let's sign this guy."
52:49,780;52:50,980;"Exactly."
52:50,980;52:53,900;"I just like sparked my thought this in Cam Cleveland."
52:53,900;52:58,220;"I was like, what are like the skill position players that we've got in that"
52:58,220;52:59,420;"haven't kind of touched down?"
52:59,420;53:02,140;"Cause y'all know that list of Brady touchdown passes."
53:02,140;53:03,100;"Yeah."
53:03,100;53:03,940;"It's on the upside."
53:03,940;53:06,300;"Donald Hayes and Cam Cleveland are on it."
53:06,300;53:08,420;"Like who couldn't crack that group?"
53:08,420;53:09,180;"I couldn't find them."
53:09,620;53:12,620;"People who played more than eight games of Brady and still couldn't catch a"
53:12,620;53:18,260;"PD. Oh, well actually let's do you know, you know, it's a weird one Steven"
53:18,260;53:23,300;"That's true. Yeah, he never caught a Tom Brady touchdown pass. Yeah"
53:23,300;53:26,960;"Still, I mean you got a thing"
53:26,960;53:33,700;"I mean like four years as a starting tail bag you get one in there some point you would think stuff the screen or something"
53:33,700;53:37,260;"Yeah, so you can you guys name the top five?"
53:37,260;53:42,260;"five receivers in terms of tons."
53:42,260;53:44,100;"- Gronk Moss, ranch, Welker."
53:44,100;53:47,140;"- Gronk Moss, Welker so far."
53:47,140;53:50,300;"- Ranch, Edelman, Edelman."
53:50,300;53:53,940;"- Yeah, so it's Gronk, Edelman, Moss, Welker, James White."
53:53,940;53:56,240;"- See, told ya."
53:56,240;53:58,820;"(laughs)"
53:58,820;54:00,380;"- And then Dionne, branch is six."
54:00,380;54:03,780;"Number seven."
54:03,780;54:05,780;"- Theoretical question for Connor."
54:07,180;54:10,260;"Who's a bigger patriot, David Patton or branch?"
54:10,260;54:12,460;"Who was what?"
54:12,460;54:14,420;"Who was like more legendary Patriots player?"
54:14,420;54:16,540;"Brantra Patton."
54:16,540;54:19,540;"Oh God."
54:19,540;54:23,140;"I, the only huge branch."
54:23,140;54:30,460;"I remember more legendary David Patton catches the one in the back of the end zone."
54:30,460;54:31,820;"Was that the one from Drew blood?"
54:31,820;54:35,500;"So in the back of the end zone, Drew had the step in."
54:36,940;54:43,900;"I think the branch I yeah, but brand you know branch also won a Super Bowl MVP. That's a tough one"
54:43,900;54:47,820;"I remember more legendary catches probably in those"
54:47,820;54:55,980;"Especially the first in well branch wasn't there 2001 David Patton had a bunch of catches throughout the playoffs"
54:55,980;54:58,140;"Yeah, and snowball. I think branch"
54:58,140;55:01,900;"Yeah, yeah branch was better Patton. I"
55:01,900;55:06,860;"Don't know it sticks out more in terms of catches. Yeah"
55:06,860;55:08,300;"That was our analysis too."
55:08,300;55:17,580;"Yeah, I think it was Patton had the more memorable catches because he also had that game where he ran past past and caught a touchdown to"
55:17,580;55:19,620;"Yeah, but Dion's best. Yep."
55:19,620;55:21,740;"receiver we've ever drafted and developed."
55:21,740;55:23,340;"Ooh."
55:23,340;55:25,500;"There's a hot take."
55:25,500;55:28,340;"I mean, it's what's ever at all."
55:28,340;55:29,460;"Yeah."
55:29,460;55:31,540;"Yeah."
55:31,540;55:33,460;"Probably a bell check era."
55:33,460;55:33,740;"Yeah."
55:35,220;55:37,260;"Either way, they're like one A1B, right?"
55:37,260;55:39,220;"No, I'll James White."
55:39,220;55:39,700;"Yeah."
55:39,700;55:40,220;"Yeah."
55:40,220;55:43,660;"You can put him on there."
55:43,660;55:47,740;"He's tripped on his team and touchdown catches in the Brady era."
55:47,740;55:48,220;"Jimmy Blanco."
55:48,220;55:52,620;"That's fascinating, though."
55:52,620;55:54,460;"Yeah, he's going to move to wide receiver this year."
55:54,460;55:55,660;"I'm calling it right now."
55:55,660;55:57,580;"Interesting."
55:57,580;55:58,220;"Where, though?"
55:58,220;55:59,540;"Were you going to put him in the slot?"
55:59,540;56:02,060;"Yeah, they play him out wide receiver all the time."
56:02,060;56:04,540;"Anyway, so they might as well--"
56:04,540;56:06,040;"They play everybody watches here, though."
56:06,040;56:07,240;"Yeah, exactly."
56:07,240;56:12,300;"I mean, the Patriots aren't afraid to throw a tight end up there, not"
56:12,300;56:12,580;"tight end."
56:12,580;56:13,900;"They a fullback out there."
56:13,900;56:14,900;"Yep."
56:14,900;56:16,300;"All the way back to the market."
56:16,300;56:16,860;"We're days."
56:16,860;56:17,980;"I know in this game, actually."
56:17,980;56:18,620;"Trust me."
56:18,620;56:19,720;"I've done the film review."
56:19,720;56:22,460;"I don't trust that."
56:22,460;56:23,200;"Sorry."
56:23,200;56:27,980;"We have a we have like a top three type fullback this share."
56:27,980;56:31,260;"Danny by Tal is concatenate."
56:31,260;56:33,420;"Yeah."
56:33,580;56:37,140;"He's what do you think about him as really particles? Oh"
56:37,140;56:40,500;"boy"
56:40,500;56:44,420;"Justin Roar was sir"
56:44,420;56:47,340;"Yeah, I guess he can"
56:47,340;56:49,900;"He can kick at a country mile"
56:49,900;56:57,420;"I think it was one of those classic like he knew exactly what tattoo it was and"
56:57,420;57:00,220;"was just coasting until"
57:00,660;57:02,900;"It came up post draft and"
57:02,900;57:08,900;"Now he's crying on social media saying he's getting it covered up. It's a classic"
57:08,900;57:11,380;"The story is all this time"
57:11,380;57:16,740;"He's named translates to Justin pipe water"
57:16,740;57:25,500;"They passed on Rodrigo Blankenship for fucking tap water"
57:29,700;57:33,460;"I just I can't believe I wanted hot. I wanted hot Rod so bad"
57:33,460;57:36,840;"That would have been great. Yeah, he's just a fucking legend"
57:36,840;57:44,540;"Those glasses man the kid from Georgia. Yeah with the rec specs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
57:44,540;57:49,860;"And he's like a rapper he like hangs out with all the oh god really yeah"
57:49,860;57:54,780;"He's awesome"
57:54,980;58:01,660;"That is named Rodrigo Blankenship like come on as a kicker you gotta you have to sign that guy"
58:01,660;58:10,020;"Yeah, yeah the Colts got him right. Yeah. Oh did they yeah, he went undrafted in the sign. Oh, no shit"
58:10,020;58:12,360;"Well, all right speaking of kickers though"
58:12,360;58:15,540;"Connors boy Adam in a Terry"
58:15,540;58:19,820;"Had himself some kickoff problems in this game. Oh"
58:19,820;58:22,900;"Yeah decided to"
58:23,900;58:29,060;"Right the end of the third quarter kicking out a bounce on the kickoff fucking idiot time"
58:29,060;58:35,200;"Time to hit the panic button. What do you think? I don't think so. Oh, yeah, I think we should probably cut him and draft"
58:35,200;58:42,220;"Draft the kicker in the third round maybe someone more accurate. Yeah preferably somebody more accurate. Yeah"
58:42,220;58:45,500;"speaking"
58:45,500;58:48,900;"So well card to this"
58:51,500;58:58,180;"I wanted to bring this up to you because just to hammer my point of like you just you have selected memory"
58:58,180;59:00,280;"we were watching the"
59:00,280;59:07,180;"AFC championship game from last year against these Steelers, right? That's the paid the Patriots are up 7 and"
59:07,180;59:10,980;"They're driving with like I don't know what two minutes left something like that"
59:10,980;59:17,980;"Yeah, they and they get a 45 yard fuel goal to basically win the game. It's gonna make a 10-point game"
59:18,580;59:25,420;"Pushed it gave the Steelers another chance steel stone interception, but if the steels go down and score there"
59:25,420;59:31,860;"That's a whole different there's a whole different perception on what Adam Vintari's career is it was real. Yeah, okay?"
59:31,860;59:34,780;"That's fair"
59:34,780;59:38,660;"What it was the only it was the only field goal he missed"
59:38,660;59:42,580;"Like I said, I've pretty big one 14 on"
59:42,580;59:45,460;"Yep, but guess what?"
59:45,740;59:48,860;"We won the game so no one remembers that you remember"
59:48,860;59:57,220;"Defense won the game so no one gives a shit about what the kicker did it only matters when like people remember it"
59:57,220;01:00:01,460;"When your team loses yes. Oh my"
01:00:01,460;01:00:11,260;"My questions"
01:00:12,060;01:00:13,800;"What was your question?"
01:00:13,800;01:00:19,040;"Which which player has like the most catches but no touchdowns from Tom Brady. Oh, okay. Oh"
01:00:19,040;01:00:22,380;"What era like what you think we can guess it"
01:00:22,380;01:00:24,940;"Maybe probably not"
01:00:24,940;01:00:31,220;"Play 2007 to 2010 47 games. What position did he play running back?"
01:00:31,220;01:00:36,500;"Ben Jarvis Green Ellis. No, he's on here though. He did not catch one"
01:00:36,500;01:00:39,860;"Ben Jarvis had"
01:00:40,180;01:00:42,180;"26 catches"
01:00:42,180;01:00:45,060;"Let's go ahead"
01:00:45,060;01:00:51,580;"49 49 catches and no touchdowns from the running back spot. No wood head, right? No"
01:00:51,580;01:00:53,820;"No, he's good. No, the girl. What?"
01:00:53,820;01:00:59,220;"No, look there must have one isn't on this list damn"
01:00:59,220;01:01:01,940;"Yeah, I think he does actually"
01:01:01,940;01:01:07,580;"Ridley the reference had 23 catches. Wow double that almost"
01:01:08,700;01:01:15,180;"Fucking hell really has almost games 52 games. That makes sense. I don't tell us 49 catches"
01:01:15,180;01:01:20,940;"No, no, no, I'm no don't tell us just yet. That's he's more time to Google"
01:01:20,940;01:01:30,480;"Connor got it. Yeah, same or hey, dude"
01:01:30,480;01:01:33,260;"Google really is a fucking wonder"
01:01:33,260;01:01:36,100;"Just give me two more second"
01:01:37,580;01:01:43,700;"Thought I heard alex in the background. Okay. Well, there is a there is other running backs to choose from on there"
01:01:43,700;01:01:53,020;"Almost asked if you're going to like if you were being coy and it was like actually a full back"
01:01:53,020;01:01:55,820;"But he's called him a running back just to throw us off"
01:01:55,820;01:02:02,380;"Because I almost said he's Evans, but that would have been a lie. I think he's caught one James Devil never did"
01:02:02,380;01:02:05,740;"He did but it was in the playoffs James seven"
01:02:06,380;01:02:09,740;"Where he has one. It was like it was one of those blowouts against the."
01:02:09,740;01:02:11,420;"Yeah, this is just regular season."
01:02:11,420;01:02:12,900;"Like our Blondley has one though."
01:02:12,900;01:02:13,420;"I guess."
01:02:13,420;01:02:14,220;"Of course."
01:02:14,220;01:02:16,740;"Jacobi Myers is on this list."
01:02:16,740;01:02:17,820;"Kobe Myers."
01:02:17,820;01:02:18,900;"Well, yeah."
01:02:18,900;01:02:19,340;"Okay."
01:02:19,340;01:02:22,460;"I mean, that's definitely Sony Michelle."
01:02:22,460;01:02:24,580;"Yeah."
01:02:24,580;01:02:26,340;"There's really not a lot."
01:02:26,340;01:02:29,700;"Jake, a lot of people that have won though."
01:02:29,700;01:02:32,460;"Hollister 23 games."
01:02:32,460;01:02:33,860;"Antonio Brown."
01:02:33,860;01:02:34,980;"He's got one."
01:02:35,540;01:02:37,340;"missed a big chest himself."
01:02:37,340;01:02:40,820;"He goes, my touchdowns as Matt Mulligan does."
01:02:40,820;01:02:42,940;"I miss him for that matter."
01:02:42,940;01:02:43,780;"I miss him too."
01:02:43,780;01:02:47,460;"I wish he was still Antonio Brown."
01:02:47,460;01:02:49,220;"This would have been a whole different season"
01:02:49,220;01:02:51,180;"if we had had Antonio Brown."
01:02:51,180;01:02:53,180;"Yep."
01:02:53,180;01:02:54,540;"Could have masked a lot."
01:02:54,540;01:02:57,420;"I mean, not--"
01:02:57,420;01:02:58,380;"we probably had what?"
01:02:58,380;01:03:00,540;"The worst production from the tight end position"
01:03:00,540;01:03:05,100;"in the history, maybe in league history this year?"
01:03:05,100;01:03:09,660;"Which one Patriots are probably argue if they probably give that a run for the money"
01:03:09,660;01:03:13,340;"It we just determined came Cleveland was worse"
01:03:13,340;01:03:22,740;"But he wasn't the start of the yeah, it was Daniel Graham who for all intents and purposes looks like a fucking wagon"
01:03:22,740;01:03:26,860;"Yeah, I don't know how he didn't work out because that that's a big man who moves quick"
01:03:26,860;01:03:30,460;"If they don't want while in the league he did not work out"
01:03:30,460;01:03:33,900;"He wasn't the Gronkowski that"
01:03:34,620;01:03:41,340;"He looks like he should be. It looks like he has that same like speed and and smoothness to his route running and stuff"
01:03:41,340;01:03:44,340;"Wait ten years. Yeah"
01:03:44,340;01:03:46,780;"Can you play? Where you go to the Saints?"
01:03:46,780;01:03:48,420;"Denver"
01:03:48,420;01:03:49,420;"Yeah"
01:03:49,420;01:03:51,420;"Denver that's what it was yet"
01:03:51,420;01:03:55,220;"Watson. Yeah. Yeah, what's good. Maybe one of these new"
01:03:55,220;01:03:57,700;"graphics will be a good one"
01:03:57,700;01:04:04,220;"Watson could have he was a specimen coming out of college. He was I thought he was gonna be"
01:04:04,220;01:04:10,300;"I thought he was gonna be dominant when I remember when we I think it was what 2004 when we drafted Watson"
01:04:10,300;01:04:13,140;"I thought he was going to be dominant"
01:04:13,140;01:04:18,540;"He was so fast. He was kind of like he's on the random champion before Vernon"
01:04:18,540;01:04:24,660;"Yeah, he did run dead. That was an that was an incredible play. That's an all-time. I'll never forget that play"
01:04:24,660;01:04:30,060;"Yeah, no, it's a Brunder rated so speaking of underrated should we talk about this fourth quarter?"
01:04:30,060;01:04:33,620;"This fourth quarter is not underrated by the way. It's overrated"
01:04:33,620;01:04:41,020;"Because at this point it's 37 Patriots and the Steelers are giving up literally what this has my best play in this"
01:04:41,020;01:04:43,460;"Does it yes?"
01:04:43,460;01:04:45,580;"Okay"
01:04:45,580;01:04:48,280;"Let's hear it"
01:04:48,280;01:04:50,540;"It actually didn't count"
01:04:50,540;01:04:56,140;"Actually my boy Roman Fyfer"
01:04:56,140;01:05:02,540;"No, it was Willie. Oh no the other one Willie McGinnis. Oh, Willie. Just being a grown-ass man in wrecking plays"
01:05:03,140;01:05:05,140;"Buh-hotties Cordell Stewart"
01:05:05,140;01:05:09,020;"Yeah, Coyle Stewart rolls out and besides the pump fake"
01:05:09,020;01:05:12,780;"To give himself some more time and will let me get issues doesn't take that bait"
01:05:12,780;01:05:18,500;"And just lights him the fuck up the perfectly clean tackle and like in review"
01:05:18,500;01:05:25,100;"It wasn't a fumble right Cordell kind of held it until he met the ground at the ground like it immediately shot out"
01:05:25,100;01:05:28,420;"Yeah, so it looked like a fumble in real time. You know what?"
01:05:29,900;01:05:33,700;"So Roman Pfeiffer returned it to the house, right? Yeah. Yeah, yeah"
01:05:33,700;01:05:36,340;"But if you watch the replay of that"
01:05:36,340;01:05:41,820;"Really, my goodness gets up to go to recover the fumble and I think realizes that"
01:05:41,820;01:05:46,940;"Fifers probably has the better angle so he peels off and blocks whoever the running back or the"
01:05:46,940;01:05:52,580;"Whether the steel running after yeah, yeah, and that's what sprung him for the touchdown"
01:05:52,580;01:05:56,220;"But like you said it it got overturned. It was the body absolutely"
01:05:56,940;01:05:57,940;"he was a big guy."
01:05:57,940;01:05:58,940;"Yeah, I mean, he was a big guy."
01:05:58,940;01:05:59,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:05:59,940;01:06:00,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:00,940;01:06:01,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:01,940;01:06:02,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:02,940;01:06:03,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:03,940;01:06:04,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:04,940;01:06:05,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:05,940;01:06:06,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:06,940;01:06:07,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:07,940;01:06:08,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:08,940;01:06:09,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:09,940;01:06:10,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:10,940;01:06:11,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:11,940;01:06:12,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:12,940;01:06:13,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:13,940;01:06:14,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:14,940;01:06:15,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:15,940;01:06:16,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:16,940;01:06:17,940;"Yeah, he was a big guy."
01:06:17,940;01:06:19,900;"Oh yeah, underrated for sure."
01:06:19,900;01:06:24,820;"Great name to the pH and the fiber, you know, yeah."
01:06:24,820;01:06:29,420;"Also way late in this when they're like scraping for content."
01:06:29,420;01:06:34,340;"They cut to this guy in the Patriots booth called Bucko Killroy,"
01:06:34,340;01:06:41,940;"which absolutely an amazing name who had spent like 60 years in the league or"
01:06:41,940;01:06:42,260;"something."
01:06:42,260;01:06:42,500;"Yeah."
01:06:42,500;01:06:46,660;"I went, I went, I did a little research on him because like what an amazing name."
01:06:47,220;01:06:49,980;"And Lysie in the pages booth and I've never heard of this guy."
01:06:49,980;01:06:51,260;"Nope."
01:06:51,260;01:06:53,420;"He was the founder of the draft."
01:06:53,420;01:06:54,940;"Whoa, fuck."
01:06:54,940;01:06:55,260;"Oh, he's."
01:06:55,260;01:06:59,060;"He's shaped the modern Super Bowl as we know it now."
01:06:59,060;01:07:01,380;"He's really."
01:07:01,380;01:07:04,620;"He's generally not like the like the game because my"
01:07:04,620;01:07:06,020;"reason I felt championship."
01:07:06,020;01:07:07,260;"Oh, right."
01:07:07,260;01:07:09,260;"That's how old this guy was."
01:07:09,260;01:07:12,780;"He's generally known as the dirtiest player ever."
01:07:12,780;01:07:15,460;"Even John Matt on the broadcast calls him that."
01:07:15,460;01:07:24,060;"he was a patriot scouting assistant and the only reason he stopped is because he died."
01:07:24,060;01:07:25,460;"Holy shit."
01:07:25,460;01:07:34,020;"He was RGM in the 80s and he had a head scout in the 2000s when we drafted like Brady and Richard Seymour and all these guys."
01:07:34,020;01:07:35,500;"Fucking hell."
01:07:35,500;01:07:36,140;"Dude."
01:07:36,140;01:07:36,940;"Bucko."
01:07:36,940;01:07:37,600;"Bucko."
01:07:37,600;01:07:38,340;"Killroy."
01:07:38,340;01:07:39,020;"Yeah."
01:07:39,020;01:07:41,180;"God damn."
01:07:42,700;01:07:46,300;"This guy's a legend. He was instrumental in drafting Roger Stobock."
01:07:46,300;01:07:51,300;"Yeah. He played for the Philadelphia steagels."
01:07:51,300;01:07:52,420;"Yes."
01:07:52,420;01:07:57,580;"What were two team that they made when they combined the Steelers and the Eagles?"
01:07:57,580;01:08:00,420;"Yeah. Yeah. I caught that name."
01:08:00,420;01:08:04,060;"I'm like, there's got to be some story behind why is the Steelers and the Eagles combined."
01:08:04,060;01:08:05,780;"That's awesome."
01:08:05,780;01:08:11,140;"I can kill Roy about that. The beanie steel."
01:08:11,300;01:08:14,460;"I need I need a fucking kill Roy Stiegles Jersey."
01:08:14,460;01:08:21,300;"We could probably make it happen."
01:08:21,300;01:08:23,660;"I just know when the dearest player in NFL history."
01:08:23,660;01:08:24,860;"Yeah."
01:08:24,860;01:08:28,260;"Absolutely."
01:08:28,260;01:08:31,700;"Yeah, they were they were definitely grasping at straws in terms of like"
01:08:31,700;01:08:36,660;"content because they were focusing in on the like the the tray of all the"
01:08:36,660;01:08:37,980;"medical equipment."
01:08:37,980;01:08:38,980;"Yeah."
01:08:38,980;01:08:39,500;"Yeah."
01:08:39,500;01:08:43,040;"talking about how they didn't know what any of it was. And John Madden made a joke something"
01:08:43,040;01:08:50,280;"about what was it? thermometer air lines or thermometer airways is what it said. It sounds"
01:08:50,280;01:08:54,360;"like a terrible box to have to open but which I didn't know he was afraid of flying clearly"
01:08:54,360;01:09:00,320;"he must be. And that's why they had always had like that stupid trailer at all that he"
01:09:00,320;01:09:06,240;"would do. Right. And they'd eat the turkey after Thanksgiving from a trailer. Yeah. And"
01:09:06,240;01:09:12,420;"put the player in the game. He had a fear flying. He was definitely a full fledged like"
01:09:12,420;01:09:18,900;"diagnosed phobia. Yeah. That already wouldn't fit in the seat. I mean, you remember that"
01:09:18,900;01:09:25,980;"I got the player off the ground. You remember that bus and the little giants? Remember when"
01:09:25,980;01:09:34,500;"he made his cameo in the little giant? So like Bruce Smith and a. That's a fucking deep"
01:09:34,500;01:09:35,660;"cut right there. God damn."
01:09:35,660;01:09:42,620;"Which there's actually content on the field too. Like we had"
01:09:42,620;01:09:48,420;"really bodying people and then the Steelers scored a last"
01:09:48,420;01:09:53,100;"second absolute garbage time TD. Oh my god. This was fucking"
01:09:53,100;01:09:58,580;"brutal. This was a mad. This was shades of when the patrons"
01:09:58,580;01:10:01,740;"are blowing out the the cold last year and the Colts kept"
01:10:01,740;01:10:04,020;"calling time out so they get the ball back and then they threw"
01:10:04,020;01:10:05,980;"when they're back up quarterback."
01:10:05,980;01:10:07,140;"That's kind of like this felt like,"
01:10:07,140;01:10:08,780;"- Oh yeah, I remember that."
01:10:08,780;01:10:12,940;"- There was literally no reasons why they're down 30 to seven,"
01:10:12,940;01:10:15,500;"under two minutes left, and they're just like"
01:10:15,500;01:10:17,060;"pulling out all the stops."
01:10:17,060;01:10:19,580;"They're running trick plays, they're running no huddle."
01:10:19,580;01:10:22,060;"They're desperate to get in the end zone."
01:10:22,060;01:10:24,220;"And then Cordell barely scores a touchdown"
01:10:24,220;01:10:25,900;"'cause he can't figure out to put the ball"
01:10:25,900;01:10:27,780;"across the plane instead of his feet."
01:10:29,740;01:10:34,740;"And Teddy Bruski was fucking living about it."
01:10:34,740;01:10:37,500;"Like he had to get pulled off of the referee"
01:10:37,500;01:10:39,020;"by multiple players."
01:10:39,020;01:10:42,580;"- It was kind of like that Bill's game,"
01:10:42,580;01:10:45,580;"the 31, nothing bookend year, you know?"
01:10:45,580;01:10:46,420;"- Yeah."
01:10:46,420;01:10:48,060;"- Those are kind of driving their down."
01:10:48,060;01:10:49,860;"But like on that game,"
01:10:49,860;01:10:52,260;"I totally understood the Bill's motivation there."
01:10:52,260;01:10:53,180;"I was like, yeah."
01:10:53,180;01:10:54,020;"- Right."
01:10:54,020;01:10:55,100;"- You don't wanna get shot out."
01:10:55,100;01:10:56,340;"You don't wanna lose that same score"
01:10:56,340;01:10:57,500;"you beat us on week one."
01:10:57,500;01:11:00,540;"like I was not like, what are you doing bills?"
01:11:00,540;01:11:02,780;"You're just wasting your own time."
01:11:02,780;01:11:04,140;"This was felt a lot more like,"
01:11:04,140;01:11:04,980;"what are you doing still?"
01:11:04,980;01:11:06,500;"Is you just wasting everyone's time?"
01:11:06,500;01:11:07,900;"- Yeah, they were."
01:11:07,900;01:11:11,060;"And so to the point where they scored one second left"
01:11:11,060;01:11:11,980;"and the referee is just like,"
01:11:11,980;01:11:13,460;"you know what, we're just gonna run the clock off."
01:11:13,460;01:11:14,740;"It's not worth doing the kick off."
01:11:14,740;01:11:15,580;"(laughing)"
01:11:15,580;01:11:16,500;"We're just done, we'll go home."
01:11:16,500;01:11:18,900;"- No worry about that last second."
01:11:18,900;01:11:20,820;"We'll just-- - Yeah, it's fine."
01:11:20,820;01:11:21,660;"No big deal."
01:11:21,660;01:11:25,460;"So I think that brings us to best and worst."
01:11:25,460;01:11:28,700;"Greg, did you have any best and worst from your boy?"
01:11:28,700;01:11:29,940;"Jeff Wagonheim?"
01:11:29,940;01:11:32,460;"- Yeah, he's got a ton of them here."
01:11:32,460;01:11:35,960;"- Well, give me Wagonheim's best of his best."
01:11:35,960;01:11:36,800;"- Yeah."
01:11:36,800;01:11:41,860;"I'll just give you the two corniest ones"
01:11:41,860;01:11:43,100;"he's got left on here."
01:11:43,100;01:11:49,300;"The worst impression impersonation of Terry Glenn."
01:11:49,300;01:11:52,320;"Christian Fourier, number 88 in your program,"
01:11:52,320;01:11:56,480;"actually made onto the field, caught a TD pass and didn't get hurt."
01:11:56,480;01:11:58,280;"Shit."
01:11:58,280;01:12:01,200;"That's a fucking fire."
01:12:01,200;01:12:01,860;"God damn."
01:12:01,860;01:12:02,560;"Yeah."
01:12:02,560;01:12:07,520;"And then worse superiority complex."
01:12:07,520;01:12:11,080;"The Steelers have claimed their AFC Championship game losses a fluke"
01:12:11,080;01:12:16,260;"and that they were the better football team based upon their tackling last night."
01:12:16,260;01:12:18,720;"Maybe they meant best touch football team."
01:12:21,120;01:12:25,320;"Dude Jeff wagonheim fire flames just"
01:12:25,320;01:12:30,800;"Well like touchful ball"
01:12:30,800;01:12:33,640;"How many more of these do you have Greg?"
01:12:33,640;01:12:38,520;"He has like 12 15 you have the whole season here"
01:12:38,520;01:12:48,560;"I bet we can find him. Yeah, I definitely have I'll keep it out some Jeff wagon. I got more of them for future games"
01:12:48,560;01:12:54,560;"All right, Connor, let's hear your best and worst in this game."
01:12:54,560;01:12:55,560;"Okay."
01:12:55,560;01:12:57,560;"I'll be."
01:12:57,560;01:13:01,560;"I got some good ones here."
01:13:01,560;01:13:03,560;"So best."
01:13:03,560;01:13:05,560;"Here's a here's a fun stat for you."
01:13:05,560;01:13:08,560;"Tom Brady was incredible."
01:13:08,560;01:13:15,560;"He had three touchdown passes, which matched his total for the last eight games of the 2001 season."
01:13:15,560;01:13:22,100;"season. So in the last regular eight, in the last eight regular season games, which we won"
01:13:22,100;01:13:28,140;"all of, Tom Brady had a total of three touchdowns across those eight games. So he came out, I"
01:13:28,140;01:13:35,460;"think he shut up a lot of the media pundits, pundits, he probably shut up a lot of fans"
01:13:35,460;01:13:42,500;"who were wondering if it was a fluke. He was awesome. He was. Terrell Buckley, Terrell"
01:13:42,500;01:13:47,880;"Buckley was so underrated, you know, being in that secondary with lawyer Merloy and Ty"
01:13:47,880;01:13:55,220;"Law, throw a bucky buckly. And even to Bucky Jones, he was just really solid. And I think"
01:13:55,220;01:14:01,900;"he had a five or six, maybe seven interceptions this year, maybe five or six. He only had three"
01:14:01,900;01:14:09,020;"the season before. So he had two picks this game. And my third star, I'm just going to"
01:14:09,020;01:14:19,500;"do losers and winners. My third star probably goes, it's tough to say. I'd have to go give"
01:14:19,500;01:14:23,580;"it to Dion. First game as a rookie coming out was, I think he had like seven or eight"
01:14:23,580;01:14:34,540;"catches 85 yards. The exact kind of like long player and by long I mean just like the stretch"
01:14:34,540;01:14:40,380;"as the field runs a lot on those like deep posts and and fade routes. I think it was just what the"
01:14:40,380;01:14:46,620;"offense was made needed. So that was sweet. Biggest losers, bums or things that sucked."
01:14:46,620;01:14:52,940;"Kendrel Bell, I think, you know, getting injured in the in the first, I think it was the first quarter."
01:14:52,940;01:14:57,420;"He was defensive rookie of the year last year. He was supposed to be a stud. I'm not going to say"
01:14:57,420;01:15:02,620;"they would have won. I do think it kind of changed. Yeah, definitely did the trajectory of the game."
01:15:02,620;01:15:04,620;"and"
01:15:04,620;01:15:07,800;"Jerome Buddess stinks what a big fat load"
01:15:07,800;01:15:14,980;"All he did was I I think he had like 600 rushing yards this season. He just stonked"
01:15:14,980;01:15:16,500;"I mean granted he"
01:15:16,500;01:15:19,100;"Punched it in nine times, but Jerome Buddess"
01:15:19,100;01:15:21,540;"black"
01:15:21,540;01:15:23,540;"And then obvious"
01:15:23,540;01:15:28,440;"And he had a fumble. Yeah, which led I think it led to the branch TV"
01:15:29,820;01:15:40,860;"And then the third biggest loser is I gotta go back to Bill Cowers face and then honorable mention is"
01:15:40,860;01:15:47,580;"Honorable mention is what's his face the quarterback court of l Stuart he"
01:15:47,580;01:15:49,860;"He"
01:15:49,860;01:15:51,860;"after being"
01:15:51,860;01:15:54,140;"offensive player of the year in 2001"
01:15:54,620;01:16:00,420;"All pro he he was like he was I think he was the AFC MVP or our"
01:16:00,420;01:16:03,340;"offensive player the year before he came out and"
01:16:03,340;01:16:10,820;"Showed he still had the yips from the AFC champion sure the game. It was yeah"
01:16:10,820;01:16:15,700;"Yeah, he was last two and a half more games after this so yeah"
01:16:15,700;01:16:18,780;"Yeah"
01:16:18,780;01:16:20,780;"Ben all right Steve Brad"
01:16:21,220;01:16:23,580;"See your best and worst button all right"
01:16:23,580;01:16:28,340;"My worst I have"
01:16:28,340;01:16:32,740;"The every run is a hold note it all caps"
01:16:32,740;01:16:38,620;"Yeah, cuz I don't think the peaches couldn't run the ball. It's just like literally every time they did"
01:16:38,620;01:16:41,420;"They had a hold of penalty. I"
01:16:41,420;01:16:46,260;"Mean they didn't exactly try they had four runs in the first half"
01:16:47,540;01:16:52,020;"That's like four quarter runs they had like four holding penalty to every single run would"
01:16:52,020;01:16:57,380;"That's true, but most of the most of the they had 23 consecutive passing plays between the second"
01:16:57,380;01:17:01,780;"Knowledge I could look like you can't run a ball about God. I'm holding him to throw it anyways"
01:17:01,780;01:17:07,580;"Yeah, but they just went five wide isn't you know fuck it five wide let's just let's just gas his defense"
01:17:07,580;01:17:12,220;"So I had a couple of Bella check bests. Oh good"
01:17:12,220;01:17:15,820;"They talked about the"
01:17:16,060;01:17:21,660;"T-shirt he gave everybody in the organization. Yes, it's like all the standards are zero"
01:17:21,660;01:17:27,780;"Yeah, and the everybody's standing on the back everybody was at zero. Yeah fucking Belichick move"
01:17:27,780;01:17:35,100;"Can confirm that he's been keeping the replay sock or the replay flag in his sock since O2"
01:17:35,100;01:17:41,980;"Yep. Yeah, I didn't see that in the first year. I think they had buzzers last year. They did and because they were so unreliable"
01:17:41,980;01:17:44,180;"They've now got the flag. Yeah"
01:17:45,300;01:17:49,820;"So he's like that's always been his spot is sock which is I've always found"
01:17:49,820;01:17:57,100;"Hilariously endearing. Yeah, I'm curious why the sock and why not just a pocket and then they were talking about Scott purely"
01:17:57,100;01:17:59,380;"They called him the son-in-law and"
01:17:59,380;01:18:05,300;"How he's married to Bill's daughter, and I was like what I didn't know that like Bella check"
01:18:05,300;01:18:11,860;"And Scott you like that and I googled it and it's not they were talking about Bill Parcells. Oh"
01:18:11,860;01:18:14,700;"That's right. Yeah"
01:18:14,900;01:18:16,900;"Not no Scott purely"
01:18:16,900;01:18:21,620;"Is bill Parcel's son-in-law very incestuous same with them?"
01:18:21,620;01:18:24,700;"What's his name in Tom Brady's sister?"
01:18:24,700;01:18:28,180;"Eucalyse yuk"
01:18:28,180;01:18:34,340;"Yeah, yeah, it's all sorts across pollination like that all right my best"
01:18:34,340;01:18:37,340;"That was but chin"
01:18:37,340;01:18:39,340;"In the post game"
01:18:40,100;01:18:45,380;"Oh, I have that let's pre-found. We just like spread it out and through the ball. I hope we get to do more of that I"
01:18:45,380;01:18:49,020;"Have the audio here. Let me see if I can actually"
01:18:49,020;01:18:52,540;"I'll see if I can get because I have it. I also like"
01:18:52,540;01:18:56,820;"Plaxico burst and we didn't lose this one. We got whipped"
01:18:56,820;01:19:01,460;"After the game as it should be love that"
01:19:01,460;01:19:09,940;"With Melissa all right out well when we talked to Tom Brady yesterday or actually on Saturday said we are going to keep"
01:19:09,940;01:19:13,940;"kick their butt. Tom, how'd you know that?"
01:19:13,940;01:19:19,940;"Yeah. Well, we, uh, you know, I think we had a good game plan. I think we were all confident."
01:19:19,940;01:19:22,940;"You know what? It's real tough for me because we had a good week of practice, so."
01:19:22,940;01:19:27,940;"Good to come out in our own stadium and play that way. It's a good way to open this thing up, you know,"
01:19:27,940;01:19:28,940;"a good way to defend our title."
01:19:28,940;01:19:34,940;"This Steelers defense was ranked number one in the NFL last season. How were you able to exploit them so well?"
01:19:34,940;01:19:40,340;"Oh, you're right. They do have a great defense and um, you know, it's just uh, you know Charlie Weiss came over the great"
01:19:40,340;01:19:43,620;"plan and I think we you know, we come here in the first game"
01:19:43,620;01:19:46,980;"We ran a lot of a lot of them no huddle stuff. It's tough on a defense, you know"
01:19:46,980;01:19:52,660;"condition wise and you know, we kind of got on their heels and guys guys Donald Hayes made an awesome play on the on the"
01:19:52,660;01:19:57,420;"curl out and he you know kind of hook and they ran and damn branch and Christian"
01:19:57,420;01:20:00,440;"I mean the three guys we didn't have last year make came up big. So it was a great win"
01:20:00,900;01:20:05,200;"How does anyone love I love Brady? Yeah, he's the fucking dad"
01:20:05,200;01:20:09,840;"I love him, but he's so fucking goofy back in these days. I didn't realize"
01:20:09,840;01:20:13,180;"Sticks out on that interview is like he didn't say hi mom"
01:20:13,180;01:20:16,180;"That's really good this whole"
01:20:16,180;01:20:18,380;"We always"
01:20:18,380;01:20:22,040;"They're like yeah, but he sounded just like"
01:20:22,040;01:20:25,460;"Taking a little bit here. See you just down"
01:20:28,180;01:20:33,260;"I'm just using that as an example to show how awesome a guy Tom Brady is when my thought is like man"
01:20:33,260;01:20:36,060;"He's also usually very gracious to his parents as well"
01:20:36,060;01:20:37,900;"I"
01:20:37,900;01:20:39,900;"Miss him already"
01:20:39,900;01:20:47,020;"God I miss him. I miss him so so much. Yeah, I never not miss him. Was that your worstie Brown the fact that you missed Tom Brady"
01:20:47,020;01:20:49,500;"Sure"
01:20:49,500;01:20:52,940;"Did you have a word it's the worst I mean"
01:20:57,140;01:20:59,380;"Everyone being holding penalty was my worst"
01:20:59,380;01:21:03,380;"All right, um"
01:21:03,380;01:21:07,060;"What the hell is going on over there Connor dogs still hungry?"
01:21:07,060;01:21:10,980;"My roommates are talking in the kitchen"
01:21:10,980;01:21:17,300;"My audio has been fantastic. I'll tell you what and a year audio is cut out a couple of times. You gotta"
01:21:17,300;01:21:20,180;"You know hear a little"
01:21:20,180;01:21:23,700;"Ricochet noise from my roommate telling us shitty story. I'm sorry"
01:21:25,540;01:21:32,820;"It sounded like a good story. Sorry guys. Yeah, maybe we'll get him on the podcast instead. What what what are yours?"
01:21:32,820;01:21:37,060;"What are yours Andy? All right, my best was the referee camp"
01:21:37,060;01:21:44,420;"Yeah, hammer is on the the middle referee the guy behind like in the middle of defense like behind the linebackers"
01:21:44,420;01:21:48,340;"Which i've seen in college. Look, they don't still have that is bad"
01:21:48,340;01:21:51,300;"Because i see in college for sure"
01:21:51,300;01:21:54,180;"And it's not one in that"
01:21:55,380;01:21:57,580;"why they already had it and they already had in 2002."
01:21:57,580;01:21:59,940;"I could see it been never done before, but you did it."
01:21:59,940;01:22:01,420;"It was so good."
01:22:01,420;01:22:04,780;"It was just looks like chaos when you're in the middle of it."
01:22:04,780;01:22:08,620;"Like the fact that anybody understands what they're supposed to be doing is beyond"
01:22:08,620;01:22:10,020;"me when you look at it from that angle."
01:22:10,020;01:22:11,460;"It was fantastic."
01:22:11,460;01:22:14,980;"I'm 100 percent and like the college version is cool as shit."
01:22:14,980;01:22:17,980;"The NFL version will only be cooler because it will be quicker and faster."
01:22:17,980;01:22:18,700;"Right."
01:22:18,700;01:22:19,780;"Yeah, it'd be great."
01:22:19,780;01:22:21,700;"So that was one of my best."
01:22:21,700;01:22:27,700;"My other best was the fullback from the Steelers when they're doing introductions."
01:22:27,700;01:22:30,060;"Dan Crater, UNH alum."
01:22:30,060;01:22:31,460;"How about that?"
01:22:31,460;01:22:32,460;"Ooh."
01:22:32,460;01:22:34,820;"Possibly the most famous UNH football player?"
01:22:34,820;01:22:35,820;"No."
01:22:35,820;01:22:36,820;"Can we say that?"
01:22:36,820;01:22:37,980;"Give me another one."
01:22:37,980;01:22:38,980;"Jerry Azuma."
01:22:38,980;01:22:39,980;"Oh, yeah."
01:22:39,980;01:22:40,980;"All right."
01:22:40,980;01:22:41,980;"All right."
01:22:41,980;01:22:42,980;"Yeah, I'll give you that."
01:22:42,980;01:22:45,860;"So he's got to play for the reruns."
01:22:45,860;01:22:48,220;"Yeah, there's a corner back."
01:22:48,220;01:22:49,220;"Yeah."
01:22:49,220;01:22:51,220;"Kyle Kyle yeah Kyle"
01:22:51,220;01:22:54,180;"What's his name Kyle?"
01:22:54,180;01:23:01,020;"Bears too. No, he picked off manning in a big game. I remember Jimmy's Jimmy something"
01:23:01,020;01:23:05,500;"Ravens yeah, Jimmy Smith"
01:23:05,500;01:23:09,900;"Not him I"
01:23:09,900;01:23:15,980;"Got it one second. I thought it was definitely yeah a zooma was one of them. You're right"
01:23:16,740;01:23:18,900;"But I don't know who this new guy is talking about"
01:23:18,900;01:23:21,420;"Was a great man Corey"
01:23:21,420;01:23:27,100;"Cory who were nice. Yeah, I know Kyle Corey. I know I"
01:23:27,100;01:23:30,520;"Didn't even have to use Google"
01:23:30,520;01:23:38,460;"Was a zoom of the wide receiver"
01:23:38,460;01:23:43,460;"You tell me you're on Google not all that so he's a DB"
01:23:46,060;01:23:48,860;"Now those David Ball who was a"
01:23:48,860;01:23:58,860;"He broke Jerry Rice's touchdown record touch on catch record when I was there and then who broke that record in the chip Kelly days"
01:23:58,860;01:24:04,260;"Don't know who broke that record. He's in the NFL right now. He's a white record"
01:24:04,260;01:24:10,820;"White Cooper cop. Oh, no shit. Yep Cooper cop"
01:24:11,700;01:24:16,120;"Stuff the college football touchdown receiving record"
01:24:16,120;01:24:19,400;"And what those yards maybe catch was a"
01:24:19,400;01:24:26,040;"Undrafted free agent who played for the Bears. Well signed by the Bears. I don't hear Corey Graham played 12 years in the league"
01:24:26,040;01:24:30,740;"Yeah, he's really good. Yeah, I recognize the name didn't know he was a UNH guy"
01:24:30,740;01:24:34,380;"Yep, how about that represent about damn Wow cats"
01:24:34,380;01:24:37,700;"I mean, she had a third round pick in 1982. There you go"
01:24:38,180;01:24:41,380;"And my worst was basically the Steelers."
01:24:41,380;01:24:44,020;"They had six turnovers and 13 penalties"
01:24:44,020;01:24:47,100;"in their season opener when they had an entire off season"
01:24:47,100;01:24:48,300;"to prepare for the team that knocked them"
01:24:48,300;01:24:50,020;"out of the playoffs here before."
01:24:50,020;01:24:50,860;"- That's it."
01:24:50,860;01:24:53,100;"- It was just a hot fucking mess."
01:24:53,100;01:24:56,940;"And off of that, my favorite quote was,"
01:24:56,940;01:25:00,860;"because this is the beginning of the new division alignments."
01:25:00,860;01:25:03,420;"So it's the first year of the AFC North"
01:25:03,420;01:25:04,260;"that the senior team."
01:25:04,260;01:25:05,240;"- Right."
01:25:05,240;01:25:06,420;"- And even with this loss,"
01:25:06,420;01:25:11,220;"were still tied for first place in Madden, his growth was luckily there in a bad division"
01:25:11,220;01:25:17,860;"because it was the Browns and the Ravens were falling apart to you and Wilson at division"
01:25:17,860;01:25:21,340;"Redskins on their mind."
01:25:21,340;01:25:22,340;"What?"
01:25:22,340;01:25:23,340;"The mainstream."
01:25:23,340;01:25:24,340;"I did."
01:25:24,340;01:25:25,340;"They didn't go."
01:25:25,340;01:25:32,740;"When they were like, because again, they were scraping for content and they were talking"
01:25:32,740;01:25:33,740;"about the end of C.E."
01:25:33,740;01:25:39,180;"east for some reason because that's what John Madden knows that's like that they're"
01:25:39,180;01:25:44,140;"John Kitna bangles I've it was yeah it was the dark time for the bangles and the"
01:25:44,140;01:25:48,380;"browns that because it's the browns but yeah and basically the Steelers would"
01:25:48,380;01:25:54,180;"get their doors blown off here finish 10 5 and 1 and still win it for all those"
01:25:54,180;01:25:58,540;"people talking shit about the AC we sit on for the Steelers being recognized as"
01:25:58,540;01:26:03,540;"as one of the greatest, you know,"
01:26:03,540;01:26:05,020;"- Just as."
01:26:05,020;01:26:07,400;"- Teams and franchises."
01:26:07,400;01:26:11,780;"We have an incredible win-loss record against them."
01:26:11,780;01:26:15,260;"I think we've beat them like 12,"
01:26:15,260;01:26:17,100;"like we've won 12, they've won three,"
01:26:17,100;01:26:19,580;"I mean, it's some preposterous number."
01:26:19,580;01:26:20,860;"We've always had their number."
01:26:20,860;01:26:25,500;"Bill has, oh, I mean, it was an easy game plan."
01:26:25,500;01:26:28,220;"It's like, oh, you have all these big, huge linebackers."
01:26:28,220;01:26:34,620;"Okay, we'll just go no huddle and catch you in the wrong scheme and just wear you the fuck out."
01:26:34,620;01:26:43,860;"You know, it was Bill Cowar was always, always out coached by Balachek, that's for sure."
01:26:43,860;01:26:48,380;"So the Patriots against the Steelers in the Balachek era are 12 and 4."
01:26:48,380;01:26:53,620;"All of this information is available on PatriotsDynestee.info."
01:26:55,180;01:26:56,500;"It's exactly where I'm getting from."
01:26:56,500;01:26:58,500;"- It's 454 to 338."
01:26:58,500;01:27:04,180;"- And if you wanna talk, actually I had a quick,"
01:27:04,180;01:27:07,180;"before we end this, a quick trivia question,"
01:27:07,180;01:27:09,340;"'cause I know how much you boy like that."
01:27:09,340;01:27:12,100;"So the Patriots have played the Steelers"
01:27:12,100;01:27:13,980;"three times to open the season,"
01:27:13,980;01:27:15,380;"and never lost their three and oh,"
01:27:15,380;01:27:18,060;"and they actually average the score of 30 to 13,"
01:27:18,060;01:27:19,540;"which is very close to this one."
01:27:19,540;01:27:24,140;"But there's one team that they've played in the OR times"
01:27:24,140;01:27:27,400;"open the season. Do you guys know who that is?"
01:27:27,400;01:27:33,440;"The dolphins. Hmm. No, Baltimore, the Chiefs. Nope."
01:27:33,440;01:27:38,700;"Soon as an AFC team, Bill, this is an AFCs. Yes. They play the"
01:27:38,700;01:27:44,060;"bills four times. They have lost once and I can guarantee you"
01:27:44,060;01:27:46,260;"all I guarantee you don't remember any of the wins though,"
01:27:46,260;01:27:48,820;"because I sure don't. I'm looking forward to rewatching that"
01:27:48,820;01:27:53,620;"game. That's the next I am. But I don't believe it is. They"
01:27:53,620;01:27:55,620;"Only because I know how the season ends, you know"
01:27:55,620;01:27:58,820;"That's true if this was a"
01:27:58,820;01:28:00,880;"easier to watch though"
01:28:00,880;01:28:04,380;"I'll be mad so yeah, oh and we have a new thing before we go"
01:28:04,380;01:28:08,780;"You can actually now leave reviews for our podcast"
01:28:08,780;01:28:12,720;"Don't tell them that yeah, no, I want to get some feedback"
01:28:12,720;01:28:17,180;"Oh, and I think maybe we'll put together for the second season"
01:28:17,180;01:28:23,080;"We'll put together something where the best or our favorite review gets I don't know a free teacher or something"
01:28:23,080;01:28:31,080;"If you go to ratethispodcast.com/patspod, you can rate it on your podcast listener of choice."
01:28:31,080;01:28:32,080;"We're going to say con."
01:28:32,080;01:28:39,080;"You should probably give that pitch in the first 15 seconds when people are still listening"
01:28:39,080;01:28:42,080;"instead of the last minute of the..."
01:28:42,080;01:28:43,080;"Okay."
01:28:43,080;01:28:47,080;"No, I want to know what they really think."
01:28:47,080;01:28:50,080;"I want them to have suffered all the way through this."
01:28:50,080;01:28:53,620;"I don't think they're mind when I go to leave a fucking comment about this"

00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:23,200;"I am not your mother."
00:23,200;00:27,360;"Welcome back to the Pages Down and See Podcast."
00:27,360;00:31,680;"This is 2004, week four, take two."
00:31,680;00:34,160;"Is that right?"
00:34,160;00:35,160;"Yes."
00:35,160;00:40,760;"As we tried to do it last week, we're just going to have a talk with Miguel from Pat's"
00:40,760;00:42,400;"cap."
00:42,400;00:45,360;"And then jump into the game and that just did not happen."
00:45,360;00:47,800;"I can see talks a lot."
00:47,800;00:54,400;"So speaking of which, during that episode, we said that we would donate a dollar for"
00:54,400;00:56,920;"every person who listened to the episode between then and now."
00:56,920;00:59,600;"And we had 88 lessons."
00:59,600;01:03,240;"So if you listened, you are helping out the cause."
01:03,240;01:05,980;"And so we're actually going to just round it up to an even hundred bucks"
01:05,980;01:07,280;"because we're nice guys."
01:07,280;01:12,720;"So we'll be donating a hundred bucks to Patscaps Habitat for a Community page."
01:12,720;01:14,920;"So look for that."
01:14,920;01:17,160;"You're right off on your taxes."
01:17,160;01:18,220;"Oh, I could."
01:18,220;01:18,600;"Could not."
01:18,600;01:18,960;"Yeah."
01:18,960;01:20,800;"Well, I met the listeners."
01:20,800;01:23,520;"Oh, yeah, they're probably good too, actually."
01:23,760;01:25,760;"That whole dollar, just write that off."
01:25,760;01:26,260;"Yeah."
01:26,260;01:28,180;"If the IRS comes come and just send them our way,"
01:28,180;01:29,880;"I'm sure we won't take care of it for you."
01:29,880;01:32,080;"So we'll get a bunch of listens from the IRS too."
01:32,080;01:33,400;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:33,400;01:35,320;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:35,320;01:38,520;"If you're from the IRS, we are not tax professionals,"
01:38,520;01:39,880;"so don't listen to us."
01:39,880;01:40,800;"So there you go."
01:40,800;01:42,960;"Cover those bases."
01:42,960;01:48,040;"Also big news, the new website launched this week too."
01:48,040;01:51,480;"So patzdynesti.com is the new one."
01:51,480;01:52,760;"Go check it out."
01:52,760;01:56,480;"It's just like the old one except newer and cooler."
01:56,480;01:57,320;"So."
01:57,320;01:59,400;"- Is patspods.com still work?"
01:59,400;02:00,760;"'Cause that's right, tell everybody."
02:00,760;02:02,440;"- It does and I'm going to,"
02:02,440;02:03,600;"now that the new one's launched,"
02:03,600;02:07,400;"I'm gonna, that will point to the new website too."
02:07,400;02:10,880;"'Cause there's a podcast thing on that that's fancier."
02:10,880;02:15,240;"- Which the, give me the elevator pitch for the new website."
02:15,240;02:16,080;"- The elevator pitch."
02:16,080;02:19,360;"- Nobody actually wanted it and he just did it anyways."
02:19,360;02:20,840;"- How dynamic is it?"
02:20,840;02:23,000;"It's very dynamic. It's fully dynamic."
02:23,000;02:25,400;"It's fully mobile optimized."
02:25,400;02:31,760;"If you want to learn anything about stats and eventually storylines from the"
02:31,760;02:36,160;"Patriots Dynasty era, the Bill Bell check in Tom Brady era of the"
02:36,160;02:39,400;"this dynasty, the one that we're doing a podcast on."
02:39,400;02:41,640;"That's what you'll get your information."
02:41,640;02:43,720;"That's where we get a lot of our information in terms of"
02:43,720;02:49,280;"all the cool stats and stuff that we come up with and all the cool things"
02:49,280;02:49,600;"like"
02:49,600;02:54,360;"Um, here's a fun fact for you that while I found walls putting this together, um, in"
02:54,360;02:58,480;"the Brady bell check era, patrons did not have a losing record against any team."
02:58,480;03:04,400;"Uh, and they actually were undefeated against more teams than they had a 500"
03:04,400;03:05,080;"record against."
03:05,080;03:09,880;"Can you name the team that they went 500 against over the past 20 years?"
03:09,880;03:10,800;"Damn it."
03:10,800;03:11,320;"Skins."
03:11,320;03:16,640;"No, they were, uh, 10 and nine against Denver."
03:16,640;03:19,120;"So you're close."
03:19,320;03:19,880;"Red Scans."
03:19,880;03:21,960;"There's not the stuff and not the Redskins."
03:21,960;03:23,760;"Yes, it was a Panthers."
03:23,760;03:25,360;"That's right."
03:25,360;03:31,880;"Yeah, Cam Newton, which kind of when you look at it that way and you look at"
03:31,880;03:35,920;"Belichick's pension for bringing in players who have played well against his"
03:35,920;03:39,000;"team, make sense that Cam Newton is here as a quarterback of the New York"
03:39,000;03:39,600;"Patriots right now."
03:39,600;03:44,760;"I think you guys are going to come to Carolina for the game this year."
03:44,760;03:45,800;"I would love to do that."
03:45,800;03:46,440;"I think we should."
03:46,600;03:51,640;"I think we'll shoot do a podcast from the parking lot of the of the Panther Stadium."
03:51,640;03:53,080;"It's a terrible idea."
03:53,080;03:56,320;"It's a big, big bank of America to the ground."
03:56,320;03:58,600;"Isn't it your birthday, Greg, on the birthday?"
03:58,600;03:58,960;"Yeah."
03:58,960;04:01,440;"I'm going to piss on the ashes of Bank of America."
04:01,440;04:06,080;"So if you've ever wondered what Greg Brown sounds like, blackout drunk, listen to that"
04:06,080;04:07,840;"podcast on the Internet down."
04:07,840;04:09,960;"We'll have a listener meetup."
04:09,960;04:11,920;"Yeah, we could do that tailgate."
04:11,920;04:12,440;"Yeah."
04:12,440;04:14,880;"I think we should slash birthday party for Greg."
04:15,080;04:17,080;"Yeah. And then just hope mom doesn't come."
04:17,080;04:20,420;"Just bring your flammables."
04:20,420;04:22,620;"Anything explosive?"
04:22,620;04:23,380;"Bring it. Yeah."
04:23,380;04:25,020;"We're burning it down."
04:25,020;04:28,820;"I haven't been to a sporting event in two years."
04:28,820;04:30,420;"We're burning it down."
04:30,420;04:35,060;"Oh my goodness."
04:35,060;04:38,660;"All right. Well, speaking of sporting events that we've been to,"
04:38,660;04:44,780;"this 2004 Pat's Bills game in Orchard Park, New York,"
04:44,780;04:47,580;"is a game that I was at with Mr. Mike Mellow."
04:47,580;04:49,980;"I'm a friend of the show."
04:49,980;04:53,580;"See, you said this when we first tried to do this game that"
04:53,580;04:56,260;"snowing and you're in a plane, you thought you were going to die."
04:56,260;04:57,380;"Oh, it wasn't snowing."
04:57,380;04:59,380;"I was just in a tiny plane that I thought we were going to die"
04:59,380;05:01,580;"because of the turbulence."
05:01,580;05:02,580;"Oh, come on."
05:02,580;05:03,900;"Man, I'm happy."
05:03,900;05:04,980;"Yeah, probably did."
05:04,980;05:06,340;"The weather was fantastic."
05:06,340;05:08,900;"Oh, so the weather is fantastic."
05:08,900;05:10,380;"You just sort of freight a small planes."
05:10,380;05:12,700;"This one, especially, yes."
05:14,380;05:15,220;"It was terrifying."
05:15,220;05:15,940;"And you know what?"
05:15,940;05:16,980;"I don't care what you say."
05:16,980;05:19,780;"And after that, Andy never left New England ever again."
05:19,780;05:20,380;"That's right."
05:20,380;05:21,180;"Yeah."
05:21,180;05:22,860;"Not not by plane."
05:22,860;05:27,100;"Sometimes I play the plane, not by little plane."
05:27,100;05:28,700;"I'm a little plane like that since."
05:28,700;05:32,660;"So yeah, if I'm going to do it, Carolina is going to be either a big"
05:32,660;05:35,660;"ass plane or a fucking drive in there next plane you get on Greg."
05:35,660;05:37,900;"Tell everybody I haven't been on a plane in two years."
05:37,900;05:39,100;"We're burning this down."
05:39,100;05:44,260;"Oh, I hope you brought your"
05:44,260;05:47,940;"flammables. No, I will not wear a mask."
05:47,940;05:53,380;"Oh, God. I'm dying on this hill."
05:53,380;05:57,780;"And that's how Greg didn't get to Carolina."
05:57,780;06:03,500;"Imagine being like a stewardess these days."
06:03,500;06:06,580;"We have a friend of the pod."
06:06,580;06:10,700;"Shadow Danielle, who is a stewardess for Southwest."
06:11,500;06:12,660;"And she's got some stories."
06:12,660;06:15,060;"It's a tough time right now to be."
06:15,060;06:16,500;"- I can't imagine."
06:16,500;06:17,340;"- Yeah."
06:17,340;06:19,900;"- Like it already probably sucks dealing with people."
06:19,900;06:20,740;"- Yeah."
06:20,740;06:21,580;"- Yeah."
06:21,580;06:24,980;"- And now everyone's just like cooped up, all pissed off,"
06:24,980;06:25,860;"scared."
06:25,860;06:28,460;"- I mean, you see it in every sporting event that's happening"
06:28,460;06:31,260;"now that the fans just don't know how to behave themselves."
06:31,260;06:32,340;"- Those poor, poor,"
06:32,340;06:34,580;"Bank of America stadium employees."
06:34,580;06:40,580;"- I'll have no fury like Greg Brown on the list."
06:40,580;06:42,980;"So we're assuming you're going to get into the stadium, Craig."
06:42,980;06:43,980;"Hmm."
06:43,980;06:45,660;"This is a valid point."
06:45,660;06:48,660;"I'll find a way in Stevie."
06:48,660;06:53,900;"I mean, you have seen the inside of the Gillette Stadium drone tank, so."
06:53,900;06:57,020;"If you believe it, you can achieve it."
06:57,020;07:02,820;"I'm just excited to compare the actual Bank of America stadium to the one that I've read"
07:02,820;07:04,020;"about in that book."
07:04,020;07:05,020;"Oh, right."
07:05,020;07:07,020;"And they came to Newton, uh, Aaronic fiction."
07:07,020;07:08,020;"Yes."
07:08,020;07:09,020;"You read it."
07:09,020;07:11,900;"I was talking to mom. She said that's the only episode she hasn't listened to"
07:11,900;07:18,060;"Thankfully, so that's good. Yeah smart play very smart"
07:18,060;07:21,820;"All right, let's talk some football. We haven't done that in a while"
07:21,820;07:25,260;"this is"
07:25,260;07:31,740;"Football or football football. We're not talking football rest in peace England. Yeah rest in peace there"
07:31,740;07:34,940;"Apparently it's not coming home"
07:34,940;07:36,940;"yet"
07:38,300;07:42,100;"I feel there's this time baby this feels a whole lot like"
07:42,100;07:48,300;"Pre 2004 Red Sox fans. No it feels like Bill's fans"
07:48,300;07:56,260;"Except the Patriots England has won a major tournaments. That's true"
07:56,260;08:02,780;"Just not a very very very long time. So it's like the it's like the Leafs the maple Leafs"
08:02,780;08:07,660;"Okay, they probably have the most brutal record"
08:07,660;08:11,060;"as far as like playoff losses."
08:11,060;08:11,900;"- Yeah, yeah."
08:11,900;08:14,220;"- And I'm not sure people are in tune with it"
08:14,220;08:18,100;"'cause it's hockey, but like you look at some of the ways"
08:18,100;08:20,120;"they've lost in the fan base they have"
08:20,120;08:23,620;"and it's just, it's mind boggling."
08:23,620;08:24,780;"- Oh yeah, it's--"
08:24,780;08:27,060;"- If we had a Cleveland Brown fan on here, they'd be pissed,"
08:27,060;08:29,620;"but they won back in like the 50s."
08:29,620;08:32,540;"- Yeah, they had their whole Jim Brown era"
08:32,540;08:33,700;"and everything. - Right."
08:33,700;08:36,620;"- And they have like other teams in their city really, you know?"
08:36,620;08:45,700;"That's true that of one. Yeah. England doesn't win things. Come on, England. All right. And"
08:45,700;08:52,260;"that's been your football. Now we're a football podcast. Both. No, England and Old England."
08:52,260;09:03,140;"Yeah. You can be getting that shit. Chav it out this one. Speaking of winning though,"
09:03,140;09:08,440;"this page's team coming into this game had one. How many in a row Steve? I don't know."
09:08,440;09:17,040;"17. Nice. Glad you're prepared. And so they're going for their record tying 18th win in a"
09:17,040;09:24,620;"row tied with a whole bunch of teams, but only some that actually are legit. Those the"
09:24,620;09:32,220;"33 34 bears and also the 41 42 bears, which if it's pretty super bowl era doesn't front"
09:32,220;09:38,340;"It's free World War II era. I think we should maybe call that one just a different league"
09:38,340;09:41,780;"That's that's not a football that we know I love exactly"
09:41,780;09:49,260;"And then there was the 72 Miami Dolphins into the 73 season, which obviously they went undefeated 16 and 0 in"
09:49,260;09:54,180;"72 only team to do so and then one a couple games"
09:54,180;09:59,920;"But they still only won 18 in a row even after going undefeated entire season. So that's a little shocking"
10:00,980;10:05,980;"89, 99, 49ers, of course, with their whole dynasty then."
10:05,980;10:09,520;"97, 98 Denver Broncos, that was with,"
10:09,520;10:12,940;"it was a running back back then."
10:12,940;10:13,780;"- Thorell Davis. - Thorell Davis."
10:13,780;10:15,260;"- That's where all Davis, yeah."
10:15,260;10:18,740;"- Then Ricky Williams based his contract negotiations off of."
10:18,740;10:23,220;"- And then the 76, 77 Oakland Raiders surprisingly had 17"
10:23,220;10:24,060;"in a row."
10:24,060;10:28,180;"So the patient would pass then and move into a big old time"
10:28,180;10:32,020;"for first place if they were able to win this game."
10:32,020;10:33,060;"- With a big old asterisk,"
10:33,060;10:35,460;"these are regular season wins, right?"
10:35,460;10:38,380;"- No, no, this is overall."
10:38,380;10:39,900;"- I've got someone to have 17 wins."
10:39,900;10:42,980;"- Well, the commentators, how can you have 17 in a row?"
10:42,980;10:43,820;"- Just kidding."
10:43,820;10:47,020;"- There you go."
10:47,020;10:49,260;"- Well, you could, no, I think there was,"
10:49,260;10:51,300;"like, because they talked about this,"
10:51,300;10:56,020;"the commentators how this wasn't considered a legit record"
10:56,020;11:01,020;"by the NFL wasn't regards official by the NFL because it included the playoffs."
11:01,020;11:05,540;"And there were teams that longer regular season streaks that had lost in playoffs."
11:05,540;11:09,940;"Like I think, I think the Colts around this time were doing something similar."
11:09,940;11:14,180;"They were winning a whole bunch of regular season games in a row,"
11:14,180;11:15,660;"but then losing to the pages in the playoffs."
11:15,660;11:19,860;"So if you only got regular season games, I looked this up."
11:19,860;11:24,380;"The regular season one is the 0.8, 0.9 Colts."
11:24,380;11:25,460;"Right."
11:25,460;11:30,460;"the 06 through 08 Patriots are second with 21."
11:30,460;11:32,900;"- Okay."
11:32,900;11:35,140;"- That was undefeated, Patz."
11:35,140;11:38,820;"This team is third with 18"
11:38,820;11:43,700;"and the 14, 15 Panthers are also third with 18."
11:43,700;11:45,620;"- That's the other one, 15 to one, right?"
11:45,620;11:46,460;"- Yeah."
11:46,460;11:47,900;"- They must have won the last few games at the end of that."
11:47,900;11:49,400;"Yeah, okay."
11:49,400;11:50,240;"- Wow."
11:50,240;11:51,580;"- All right."
11:51,580;11:57,580;"And the list for combined has changed since this day too."
11:57,580;12:06,060;"So the 2010-2011 Packers had 19 straight, which they're actually the second on the list."
12:06,060;12:10,060;"Yeah, because the Patriots are spoiler alert first, right?"
12:10,060;12:10,860;"Correct."
12:10,860;12:12,380;"With 21."
12:12,380;12:12,940;"Yeah."
12:12,940;12:17,340;"And that's just games in a row, including playoffs."
12:18,860;12:27,660;"Yeah, so the one year that Projors won it. Yeah, won it an only year. That Rogers didn't blow it."
12:27,660;12:32,940;"Right. They still couldn't win as many games in a row as Tom Brady. So that feels about right."
12:32,940;12:41,900;"Second to Tom Brady again. But I got a question though. So I also saw the the playoffs record."
12:41,900;12:47,420;"Most consecutive wins in the playoffs. I think that is an official NFL record."
12:47,420;12:52,380;"Okay. So this team obviously has that. So all one through"
12:52,380;12:54,020;"five, they have 10 straight wins."
12:54,020;12:57,420;"Yeah, let's go say because Brady won like 10 straight to start his career."
12:57,420;12:58,420;"Yeah."
12:58,420;13:04,140;"You got the 70 Steelers on there, the nine or the late 80s, 90s,"
13:04,140;13:08,140;"49ers, 90s Cowboys, late 90s Broncos."
13:08,140;13:14,220;"Which of those three records do you think is the hardest to break?"
13:16,420;13:18,820;"I think it's combined games in a row."
13:18,820;13:19,420;"Yeah, for sure."
13:19,420;13:23,620;"Because it's just like, because it's a match up base league,"
13:23,620;13:29,820;"being able to win 22 games in a row all the way through."
13:29,820;13:32,580;"I think that's just--"
13:32,580;13:35,940;"some of that, I think it just comes down to luck at some point,"
13:35,940;13:39,060;"like just being able to reel off that many wins,"
13:39,060;13:41,060;"especially now with the free agency"
13:41,060;13:44,460;"and how tight everything's gotten and drafting"
13:44,460;13:47,620;"everything and the fact that draft picks aren't paid as high."
13:47,620;13:53,620;"So you have that like if you, if a bad team hits on a good draft pick, they can"
13:53,620;13:58,100;"they can make a run pretty quickly and they can turn things around."
13:58,100;14:01,740;"I think that to me is probably the biggest one."
14:01,740;14:03,300;"I disagree."
14:03,300;14:04,140;"Okay."
14:04,140;14:04,900;"Why would you?"
14:04,900;14:05,620;"Your choice now?"
14:05,620;14:05,980;"Yeah."
14:05,980;14:08,140;"I think the playoffs one is the hardest."
14:08,140;14:13,820;"You basically have to win three Super Bowls in a row."
14:13,820;14:16,320;"without losing a playoff game."
14:16,320;14:18,460;"- That's fair."
14:18,460;14:22,100;"- And look at the teams on this list are all like"
14:22,100;14:24,860;"error-defining teams."
14:24,860;14:26,860;"You know, like the Niners of Cowboys, the Broncos."
14:26,860;14:28,220;"- Which you might not have again."
14:28,220;14:29,060;"- Right."
14:29,060;14:30,740;"And even then you're like,"
14:30,740;14:35,020;"you expect those teams to make the playoffs every year."
14:35,020;14:36,300;"So even,"
14:36,300;14:39,740;"you got basically went like three years in a row."
14:39,740;14:40,580;"- Right."
14:40,580;14:41,500;"And then when you're in the playoffs,"
14:41,500;14:43,780;"you're playing the best teams in the league."
14:43,780;14:45,140;"- Yeah, all the way through."
14:45,140;14:47,420;"- And I think winning the Super Bowl and the NFL"
14:47,420;14:52,420;"is much harder than winning consecutive regular season games."
14:52,420;14:54,300;"So you don't get any layups."
14:54,300;14:57,140;"- I don't know, I think the counterpoint is"
14:57,140;14:59,420;"when you're on a huge win streak,"
14:59,420;15:02,140;"the pressure ratchets up every single week"
15:02,140;15:03,340;"and everyone's coming for you."
15:03,340;15:04,940;"And I like this so much."
15:04,940;15:05,780;"- Well until you win a Super Bowl."
15:05,780;15:07,300;"- We're about to see it on the rest of this one."
15:07,300;15:09,500;"There's so much, gonna have so much bullshit about it."
15:09,500;15:10,700;"Oh my God, like the--"
15:10,700;15:13,300;"- Or even the '07 season where the Patriots go into feet"
15:13,300;15:16,220;"And then like, can you finish this off?"
15:16,220;15:17,860;"Which the answer is obviously no."
15:17,860;15:20,340;"Spoiler alert."
15:20,340;15:22,340;"But once you win that Super Bowl, right,"
15:22,340;15:24,460;"the pressure ratchets up 'til you win the Super Bowl"
15:24,460;15:26,220;"and then the next year,"
15:26,220;15:27,500;"it's not really a huge deal"
15:27,500;15:30,900;"until you get close to breaking a record."
15:30,900;15:31,780;"Maybe."
15:31,780;15:33,820;"I mean, I think, but once you win that Super Bowl,"
15:33,820;15:36,060;"you have that target on your back too now, right?"
15:36,060;15:37,980;"Yeah, I guess."
15:37,980;15:39,860;"And a lot of teams,"
15:39,860;15:42,540;"you know, you also don't have much recovery time"
15:42,540;15:44,700;"because you played a whole bunch of extra weeks."
15:44,700;15:46,340;"So teams that make it to the Super Bowl"
15:46,340;15:49,240;"don't often do as well as they did the year before."
15:49,240;15:51,100;"And usually if you're winning a Super Bowl,"
15:51,100;15:54,500;"you're kind of like a lot of teams sell out to do so"
15:54,500;15:56,180;"'cause they know there are in the cuffs."
15:56,180;15:57,660;"And so you have a lot of turnover"
15:57,660;15:59,580;"the next year for the most part."
15:59,580;16:00,420;"Not necessarily this year,"
16:00,420;16:02,820;"obviously with every single buck and year coming back,"
16:02,820;16:06,420;"but generally speaking, there's a whole lot of people"
16:06,420;16:09,660;"that like, I want my Super Bowls who are gonna pay day, you know?"
16:09,660;16:10,860;"- Okay, so then are you saying"
16:10,860;16:15,860;"that the cults from 2008 and 2009 are better than the Patriots."
16:15,860;16:17,740;"- No."
16:17,740;16:19,540;"- No, I would ever say that, Craig."
16:19,540;16:20,420;"- 'Cause that doesn't include,"
16:20,420;16:22,580;"'cause that's just we're winning regular season games."
16:22,580;16:24,620;"- Well, it doesn't matter if they still allow the way"
16:24,620;16:26,580;"we're talking with the way you're just describing it."
16:26,580;16:28,700;"- No, I'm talking about wins in a row."
16:28,700;16:29,620;"He's the hardest."
16:29,620;16:31,520;"- I disagree."
16:31,520;16:34,220;"- I think you have a fair argument."
16:34,220;16:36,500;"- Well, I think-"
16:36,500;16:37,340;"- Not only do I disagree,"
16:37,340;16:41,620;"but I think both of you are complete idiots."
16:41,620;16:42,460;"There it is."
16:42,460;16:45,260;"And I might walk out of this podcast right now."
16:45,260;16:46,100;"- That's fine."
16:46,100;16:47,860;"- I didn't realize this was a..."
16:47,860;16:50,820;"- Can you insert the door slamming noise in this city?"
16:50,820;16:53,020;"- How about this?"
16:53,020;16:55,820;"(mumbling)"
16:55,820;16:56,660;"- He's probably more, bro."
16:56,660;16:59,300;"- Okay, Greg walked out and he's back."
16:59,300;17:00,260;"Welcome back, Greg."
17:00,260;17:01,900;"- Yeah, they just apologized."
17:01,900;17:03,500;"Apology accepted."
17:03,500;17:04,500;"- And he got that."
17:04,500;17:06,420;"'Cause he comes everything from the spot gas."
17:06,420;17:07,260;"That's right, yeah."
17:07,260;17:10,780;"I do a lot of editing to this, to make it listenable."
17:10,780;17:13,620;"You should hear all the shit that gets left"
17:13,620;17:14,980;"on the cutting room floor."
17:14,980;17:18,380;"Yes, so okay."
17:18,380;17:20,260;"So this is the unofficial"
17:20,260;17:23,540;"wind streak according to the NFL,"
17:23,540;17:28,260;"but Patriots coming in at 2-0 against the Bills team"
17:28,260;17:29,580;"that are 0-2."
17:29,580;17:32,020;"And we'll just get out in front of it"
17:32,020;17:33,260;"'cause I think everybody knows at this point"
17:33,260;17:35,420;"the Patriots do win this game."
17:35,420;17:38,500;"to move to 18 victories in a row."
17:38,500;17:43,500;"And on the NFL prime time video,"
17:43,500;17:46,300;"this was like the game of the week,"
17:46,300;17:48,220;"because it was a good game"
17:48,220;17:50,300;"and the Patriots set this record."
17:50,300;17:51,540;"- The prime cut."
17:51,540;17:52,860;"- Yeah, that's what they called it,"
17:52,860;17:55,020;"right, the prime cut of the week."
17:55,020;17:57,900;"And they showed a step where the Patriots have 18 wins"
17:57,900;18:01,060;"in a row, Buffalo Bills have 17 wins"
18:01,060;18:02,740;"since the beginning of 2001."
18:03,740;18:06,700;"But it's not this is the bills are at least decent as points."
18:06,700;18:08,340;"This is the 31 nothing revenge game."
18:08,340;18:11,900;"No, they already had that revenge at the end of the season."
18:11,900;18:12,660;"Remember, right?"
18:12,660;18:13,620;"But this is the game."
18:13,620;18:14,140;"But it's in Buffalo."
18:14,140;18:15,140;"The 31 31s."
18:15,140;18:15,420;"Yeah."
18:15,420;18:16,260;"Yeah, absolutely."
18:16,260;18:16,780;"Absolutely."
18:16,780;18:18,580;"It's the last time the page is here and they get their ass."
18:18,580;18:19,580;"What 31 is it?"
18:19,580;18:23,900;"Yeah, but I still think the bills hadn't they've been pretty up and down."
18:23,900;18:28,420;"Yeah, because in true bills fashion, they started off hot, got the hopes up of"
18:28,420;18:32,460;"everyone in the Buffalo area and then faded down the stretch."
18:32,460;18:33,700;"That is classic bills."
18:33,700;18:36,580;"Right, exactly. As we all know in love."
18:36,580;18:40,580;"Kind of similar to, um, listening to Lions fans in there."
18:40,580;18:44,060;"I don't know. Lions don't even get hot to start."
18:44,060;18:46,820;"No, but they always have that like there."
18:46,820;18:49,700;"They're ready to go at the beginning of the year and then, you know,"
18:49,700;18:53,220;"the Lions early season is their draft. Yes, exactly."
18:53,220;18:58,100;"So, uh, big news in this game."
18:58,100;19:00,460;"Corey Dillon on the first drive,"
19:00,460;19:03,500;"scores his first TD as a Patriots right up the middle."
19:03,500;19:09,340;"Great little run looking very solid as a running back, which is"
19:09,340;19:12,200;"nice to see because we haven't seen that since we started this"
19:12,200;19:12,940;"podcast really."
19:12,940;19:17,900;"Yeah, with some flashes from Antoine, but nothing at this"
19:17,900;19:26,700;"level. But he would fumble later on in the game as a page of"
19:26,700;19:31,700;"driving for a touchdown like inside the five yard line"
19:31,700;19:33,780;"Fumbles and the bills recover."
19:33,780;19:36,540;"- Almost did it again towards the end of the game,"
19:36,540;19:38,600;"but it was ruled not a fumble."
19:38,600;19:43,940;"- So, but this game was actually a wild one,"
19:43,940;19:47,340;"even for like Bill's Patriot standards, I thought."
19:47,340;19:50,420;"- Let's give the final score in a watchability rating."
19:50,420;19:52,060;"- Oh yeah, we haven't done that in a while."
19:52,060;19:55,660;"It's 31-17 Patriots at the end."
19:55,660;19:58,780;"It felt a lot closer than that up until right at the end,"
19:58,780;20:01,340;"which we'll talk about in a bit."
20:01,340;20:04,300;"In terms of regular season watchability game,"
20:04,300;20:06,620;"we're out of six, I would say."
20:06,620;20:08,220;"A good four and a half for me."
20:08,220;20:09,340;"- One parties."
20:09,340;20:12,580;"- Yeah, four, four and a half is very entertaining."
20:12,580;20:15,460;"A little sloppy, especially at the beginning."
20:15,460;20:16,300;"- Yeah, I am."
20:16,300;20:18,140;"- Ton of big plays, turnovers."
20:18,140;20:20,620;"There's a lot of exciting plays going on."
20:20,620;20:21,460;"- Yeah."
20:21,460;20:24,980;"There was a substitute referees,"
20:24,980;20:26,300;"He was a referee got injured."
20:26,300;20:28,260;"I don't know what he did, but he like,"
20:28,260;20:30,180;"what, I'm sure I wrote a data somewhere."
20:30,180;20:31,580;"- I do remember the bill stands at him."
20:31,580;20:33,420;"- Oh yeah. - To make this more watchable."
20:33,420;20:35,060;"- Yeah, he had a torn leg muscle."
20:35,060;20:37,260;"And they were like, they put him on the bill's bench"
20:37,260;20:38,500;"and were like icing up his knees"
20:38,500;20:39,780;"and he'd come back and he couldn't."
20:39,780;20:44,780;"So they like had the linesmen come in to be the head referee"
20:44,780;20:46,380;"and like they had to switch his hat"
20:46,380;20:47,620;"to the white one and everything."
20:47,620;20:51,140;"And they was like, the commentators were all up about it."
20:51,140;20:52,900;"Jim Nans and Phil Sims, of course they were."
20:52,900;20:53,940;"- And they're in like the hurry up."
20:53,940;20:55,580;"So the bills. Yeah. So the bill. Yeah."
20:55,580;20:59,940;"And the reps had to stop the no huddle because the head ref comes up limping"
20:59,940;21:01,460;"like early on in the game."
21:01,460;21:06,220;"And there was like a ton of penalties, a ton of like close plays"
21:06,220;21:10,140;"that got reviewed and this fucking backup referee was completely overwhelmed."
21:10,140;21:13,220;"Well, doing his best, but just like struggling."
21:13,220;21:15,460;"I'm like, yeah, 21 penalties total."
21:15,460;21:19,140;"A lot of penalties. Yeah."
21:19,140;21:22,540;"And like everyone was getting injured."
21:22,540;21:25,980;"Um, the page was very watchable."
21:25,980;21:28,980;"Refereries, just like nobody was safe in this game."
21:28,980;21:33,060;"Well, there's tons of penalties, tons of reviews, tons of injuries."
21:33,060;21:35,580;"No, but like in a fun way though."
21:35,580;21:36,060;"Yeah."
21:36,060;21:37,300;"It was exciting."
21:37,300;21:41,660;"I got to admit the replacement referee season was awesome."
21:41,660;21:42,180;"Yeah."
21:42,180;21:45,740;"And it was kind of like just a little sprinkle of that into this game, you know."
21:45,740;21:51,140;"It was nice, but there was like, uh, there's all sorts of just like weird shit that"
21:51,140;21:58,940;"happens. The Patriots force the the bills to punt at some point."
21:58,940;22:05,060;"I have it somewhere. Don't matter. Can't find it. Yeah. But so"
22:05,060;22:08,600;"the Patriots force the bills to punt. They go to punt it and"
22:08,600;22:12,620;"the punter drops the football and picks it up like almost as we"
22:12,620;22:15,140;"about to get blocked anyway. And then just picks up and takes"
22:15,140;22:17,540;"off running gets like 30 yards 34."
22:18,540;22:21,620;"This is the highlight of the Bill's fans lives in this game"
22:21,620;22:25,620;"As long as Carrie he fucking"
22:25,620;22:32,500;"Gampers and he's running pointing out blockers to like who to block and then he immediately gets run down from behind"
22:32,500;22:37,260;"It is a nice dude if you could have turned that corner, right?"
22:37,260;22:43,760;"It's still be running. Yeah, there was a Buffalo scored a kick return touchdown to you like right after the Patriots"
22:43,760;22:48,140;"Nice move a little shimmy in the hole. Yeah, yeah, the whole yeah"
22:48,140;22:50,500;"I fucking faked him out and then outran Adam Minnitary,"
22:50,500;22:52,460;"which you know, Herschel Walker can't do."
22:52,460;22:53,460;"- Mm-hmm."
22:53,460;22:54,820;"- So impressive."
22:54,820;22:58,940;"Blood cells throwing in aceptions as he normally does,"
22:58,940;23:03,420;"but then like, fucking connecting deep to molds"
23:03,420;23:06,420;"on this like beautifully thrown touchdown pass."
23:06,420;23:07,940;"- It was vintage blood cell."
23:07,940;23:09,300;"- It was, yeah."
23:09,300;23:14,140;"- 18 completions, like 275 yards."
23:14,140;23:15,460;"- Mm-hmm."
23:15,460;23:18,340;"one pick, one touchdown, six sacks."
23:18,340;23:20,780;"- Oh yeah, and they were actually talking about"
23:20,780;23:23,620;"the bills are having trouble with sacks because-"
23:23,620;23:26,500;"- He only threw like four or six actual incompletions"
23:26,500;23:29,500;"'cause they're the six sacks in his incompletions"
23:29,500;23:31,180;"or in his attempts, you know?"
23:31,180;23:34,740;"- Yeah, but no, the week before it was sacked seven times"
23:34,740;23:39,740;"and he's like leading the league and being sacked, I think."
23:39,740;23:42,460;"Like by a decent margin over-"
23:42,460;23:44,380;"- Oh yeah, since 2002, they showed a stat."
23:44,380;23:52,700;"2002. This is a hell of a graph. Most times, sex in 2002, Drew Bloodsohn first plays with 111"
23:52,700;24:01,500;"sacks in just over two seasons. David Carr in second with 101 feels right. And then Dante"
24:01,500;24:07,900;"Callpepper, 93, Aaron Brooks, 77, and Donovan McNabb of all people, 77. So you've got some"
24:07,900;24:11,740;"mobile quarterbacks in there and then also Drew Bloodsohn, David Carr, who are just sack machines."
24:12,940;24:15,220;"So good for them."
24:15,220;24:19,020;"What else?"
24:19,020;24:22,380;"There was a, we get the punt back."
24:22,380;24:24,500;"No, they get a punt."
24:24,500;24:29,180;"They stop us on third down, then they throw a dumb pick, then we hit a big bomb to David"
24:29,180;24:32,060;"Patton, and then there's that Corey Dillon fumble all in fourth place."
24:32,060;24:32,420;"Right."
24:32,420;24:33,100;"Yeah."
24:33,100;24:35,820;"Like this, it's just back and forth the entire time."
24:35,820;24:41,340;"There was one page ended up in a first in 35 due to like penalties and stuff,"
24:41,860;24:45,940;"converted it and end up scoring a touchdown, I think, which is ridiculous."
24:45,940;24:50,260;"Then there was a bunch of what I'm going to call bills, B and bills."
24:50,260;24:53,260;"Yeah. You're ready for this? I'm going to read these off."
24:53,260;24:56,900;"First play of the game, late hit London flexure."
24:56,900;24:58,100;"Yes."
24:58,100;25:02,380;"They get the Patriots into a first and 35."
25:02,380;25:05,020;"Yes. 44 yard completion of David Givens."
25:05,020;25:06,020;"Exactly."
25:06,020;25:10,220;"They get an interception in the end zone."
25:10,860;25:13,820;"And there's a flag and I'm like, I've got to be on the bills."
25:13,820;25:16,860;"No, it's on the Patriots challenge over turns the interception."
25:16,860;25:26,380;"So they're they get a two minute drive, just do a million penalties."
25:26,380;25:31,340;"Then they get the ball back to start the second half and I have only the bills can turn a first"
25:31,340;25:34,700;"down from the 35 into a third in 21 from their own 40."
25:35,820;25:37,820;"It's true. That's so bled. So"
25:37,820;25:45,660;"Patriots are attempting a field goal bills off sides give the pictures are first down and the Patriots score touchdown. Yeah"
25:45,660;25:50,380;"Brady 75th TD. Yeah. Oh, you also miss one where"
25:50,380;25:55,340;"On the Patriots third down like in their own"
25:55,340;25:57,980;"Half"
25:57,980;26:00,700;"It's a catch by I think uh, david paten"
26:01,660;26:06,220;"where and then it's like a bang bang play where he fumbles it. Buffalo recovers a fumble,"
26:06,220;26:10,140;"returns is one of the linebackers returns it like all the way to the five yard line,"
26:10,140;26:15,660;"gets caught and somebody punches him from behind, ball goes out the back of the end zone,"
26:15,660;26:23,980;"pages ball again. And so the bills challenge whether he was down before the ball came out"
26:23,980;26:26,860;"and actually the play was ruled incomplete after all that."
26:26,860;26:27,700;"- Mm-hmm."
26:27,700;26:29,700;"- You're for the battle."
26:29,700;26:30,540;"- Battle of Johnson."
26:30,540;26:32,540;"- Yeah, he got jacked up in that play."
26:32,540;26:33,900;"These hurt."
26:33,900;26:35,540;"- Yeah, I don't think he came back from that yet."
26:35,540;26:40,380;"- And they dropped Watson was on IR, which I didn't know."
26:40,380;26:42,540;"- Yeah, and Dion Branch was also up with injuries."
26:42,540;26:46,500;"So it was not a lot of offensive weapons."
26:46,500;26:48,460;"There was no, didn't seem to be any Troy Brown really either"
26:48,460;26:50,500;"'cause they had Tyrone pool returning punts."
26:50,500;26:51,340;"- Yeah."
26:51,340;26:52,180;"- So."
26:52,180;26:55,940;"- Yeah, you could get that feeling as a fan"
26:55,940;26:58,420;"when shit's just not going your way in games."
26:58,420;26:59,260;"- Yeah. - Yes."
26:59,260;27:01,260;"- And you're like, we're not wearing this game."
27:01,260;27:02,660;"- Right."
27:02,660;27:04,180;"If the Patriots weren't playing the Bills,"
27:04,180;27:05,540;"we would have lost this game."
27:05,540;27:06,380;"- Yeah."
27:06,380;27:07,220;"- 'Cause I felt that a lot of times"
27:07,220;27:08,340;"against the Bills too."
27:08,340;27:09,320;"There was one,"
27:09,320;27:14,140;"I think Danny Amidola's first season"
27:14,140;27:15,980;"and he was hurt the whole game."
27:15,980;27:17,740;"And Brady, the only person who was going through"
27:17,740;27:20,260;"the entire game and they somehow managed"
27:20,260;27:22,180;"to claw the way back and win that one."
27:22,180;27:25,900;"Yeah, there's definitely been a lot of those."
27:25,900;27:29,940;"I don't get it as much with the Patriots, probably because they know how to execute,"
27:29,940;27:30,940;"but you do get it."
27:30,940;27:37,180;"I got seen it with, you know, the Celtics or the Bruins where you're just like, or the"
27:37,180;27:41,900;"Bruins losing against the Islanders is a great example of like, every, every single"
27:41,900;27:44,100;"mistake they just get punished for."
27:44,100;27:45,100;"Yep."
27:45,100;27:50,740;"And then like every bounce is not going your way and you're like, I've seen this play before"
27:50,740;27:53,260;"and I know how this thing ends."
27:53,260;27:54,260;"Yeah, exactly."
27:54,260;27:55,260;"Yeah."
27:55,260;28:01,100;"That's brutal to watch. Yeah, it's brutal to play in two because even when you're playing in those games"
28:01,100;28:06,880;"It's like the bounces aren't going your ways you start forcing it more and you get like penalties and it's like"
28:06,880;28:09,640;"you just"
28:09,640;28:14,640;"There is something to that like all right one play at a time. I know it's a cliche, but"
28:14,640;28:18,220;"It definitely has an impact. Oh, yeah"
28:19,220;28:19,720;"I agree."
28:19,720;28:22,520;"We'll save the best bills being bills for the end."
28:22,520;28:23,960;"You want to talk about the commentators, Andy?"
28:23,960;28:25,020;"I know you got that on your."
28:25,020;28:29,280;"Uh, I didn't really have a lot of notes on the commentators themselves."
28:29,280;28:31,960;"What what what is I've learned that Jim"
28:31,960;28:34,040;"Nance and Phil Sims, I can just tune them out."
28:34,040;28:37,960;"Like that's just I think that's become a defense mechanism for me"
28:37,960;28:41,520;"because they've done so many Patriots games, especially Phil Sims."
28:41,520;28:46,840;"And I just like it's like the, uh, the teacher in Charlie Brown,"
28:46,840;28:50,160;"- There's a lot, lot, lot, lot, lot in the background."
28:50,160;28:53,120;"- See, despite there was a lot of penetration talk,"
28:53,120;28:55,880;"which, you know, is what it is."
28:55,880;28:56,720;"- I mean, yeah."
28:56,720;28:58,040;"- I know they had some good nuggets in there."
28:58,040;29:00,520;"They were talking about the 49ers dynasty"
29:00,520;29:02,480;"being able to get the most out of veterans,"
29:02,480;29:05,400;"come to the team and try to win a ring,"
29:05,400;29:07,040;"before shadowing there."
29:07,040;29:08,120;"- Right, yeah."
29:08,120;29:10,400;"- And then I forget which one said it,"
29:10,400;29:12,680;"but they were talking about Michael, Mike Rabe's,"
29:12,680;29:15,000;"and they said he's a classroom coach."
29:16,600;29:18,720;"Yeah, they did. Yeah. Real foreshadowing."
29:18,720;29:24,300;"Yeah, they that's come up a few times in the past where they're like, Oh, Mike"
29:24,300;29:27,720;"Frable, he's like a coach on the field and all this stuff."
29:27,720;29:30,320;"He might want to get into coaching once he's finished."
29:30,320;29:33,120;"Once he's finished playing football."
29:33,120;29:40,560;"Speaking of veterans, what do you guys just general thoughts on Corey Dillon"
29:40,560;29:42,400;"on and off the field?"
29:42,400;29:44,920;"I don't know much about him off the field."
29:44,920;29:49,920;"I know that like when he came to the Patriots, he had a lot of,"
29:49,920;29:53,800;"he was known to have a lot of baggage and there was talk about,"
29:53,800;29:55,520;"like we tried to look it up."
29:55,520;29:57,040;"I couldn't find him to talk about him."
29:57,040;30:01,040;"Like his offensive line saying they wouldn't block for him"
30:01,040;30:10,880;"for some reason, like towards the end of his 10 years in San"
30:10,880;30:15,100;"He moves much more fluidly than I think he should"
30:15,100;30:18,620;"as a big man, similar to like a Rob Gronkowski."
30:18,620;30:21,140;"Like he's just too big to move as fast"
30:21,140;30:24,020;"and to change direction as quickly as he does."
30:24,020;30:26,140;"- I think Greg doesn't give a shit what we think"
30:26,140;30:27,440;"and he's just asking that question"
30:27,440;30:28,580;"'cause he has his own answer."
30:28,580;30:29,420;"He's gonna give me--"
30:29,420;30:30,260;"(laughing)"
30:30,260;30:31,180;"- No, no, no, no."
30:31,180;30:35,820;"Well, I remember like my perception being like he's--"
30:35,820;30:38,780;"- I think like, oh, Corey Dillon arrested for this"
30:38,780;30:40,540;"- Yeah, I'm not kidding."
30:40,540;30:41,540;"- I'm not kidding too."
30:41,540;30:43,740;"It's like, I was like, remember thinking of him,"
30:43,740;30:46,020;"like, oh, he's just misunderstood,"
30:46,020;30:47,860;"like Randy Moss type where,"
30:47,860;30:48,700;"- Right, right, right."
30:48,700;30:51,580;"- Nothing that bad, he's just like wants to win."
30:51,580;30:53,220;"So I looked up like,"
30:53,220;30:54,060;"- See, he's doing it."
30:54,060;30:55,460;"- Hodge, perversing for Corey Dolan,"
30:55,460;30:57,980;"and dude, there's some dark shit in there."
30:57,980;30:58,820;"- Really?"
30:58,820;30:59,660;"- Yeah."
30:59,660;31:01,260;"So was he perhaps a,"
31:01,260;31:02,700;"- Sometimes a naughty boy."
31:02,700;31:04,900;"- Y'all and Naughty's an understatement."
31:04,900;31:06,140;"- Oh, all right, let's hear it."
31:06,140;31:06,980;"- Yeah."
31:06,980;31:07,980;"- I didn't realize this."
31:07,980;31:10,100;"saw this coming from a fucking mind."
31:10,100;31:11,260;"- He did call this."
31:11,260;31:15,620;"- I mean, he was convicted twice for assaulting women."
31:15,620;31:18,860;"Apparently hit his wife with his car."
31:18,860;31:20,940;"And when the cops showed up, she had like blood"
31:20,940;31:22,860;"in his mouth, in her mouth."
31:22,860;31:27,940;"That was 2002."
31:27,940;31:30,500;"So that was before the downstream forum."
31:30,500;31:31,340;"- Yeah, yeah."
31:31,340;31:36,340;"- 2010, he was arrested for assaulting his wife"
31:36,420;31:39,700;"in an argument at their South California home."
31:39,700;31:40,540;"- Oh boy."
31:40,540;31:47,060;"- DUI, whatever, drug stuff, whatever."
31:47,060;31:48,940;"(laughing)"
31:48,940;31:51,340;"- I can't believe you're skipping over those, Greg."
31:51,340;31:53,060;"(laughing)"
31:53,060;31:57,100;"Well, hitting your car, your wife with your car,"
31:57,100;31:59,660;"seems like a bit of a--"
31:59,660;32:00,500;"- Yeah."
32:00,500;32:02,380;"- I said, what if he was drunk when he did it though?"
32:02,380;32:03,980;"Is that changed things?"
32:03,980;32:05,660;"Is that just a DUI or is that--"
32:05,660;32:12,280;"Well, did he need to I don't know be PTSD to me now CTE oatmeal brain. Yeah"
32:12,280;32:16,340;"CTI CTE CTE"
32:16,340;32:18,560;"Hey, oh"
32:18,560;32:20,560;"PTSD from CTE"
32:20,560;32:23,180;"You can do you know it's CT stands for Steve?"
32:23,180;32:26,100;"No"
32:26,100;32:31,100;"Andy passion I do but there's one like super long word in there. Yeah"
32:32,020;32:33,220;"And I couldn't tell you."
32:33,220;32:35,540;"- Let's put our, let's put our guesses on record here."
32:35,540;32:39,980;"I think it's chronic, traumatic,"
32:39,980;32:41,620;"and Sephylophopety."
32:41,620;32:43,180;"- And Sephylophopety."
32:43,180;32:45,380;"(laughing)"
32:45,380;32:46,220;"- I'm gonna give it to you."
32:46,220;32:47,620;"- I'm gonna be nailed it dude."
32:47,620;32:48,460;"- Nailed it."
32:48,460;32:49,300;"- You've already won."
32:49,300;32:52,300;"- And Sephylophus."
32:52,300;32:54,580;"- And Sephylophagus."
32:54,580;32:56,740;"- You got me, Sephylophagus?"
32:56,740;33:00,580;"- Chronic, traumatic, excuse."
33:00,580;33:01,900;"(laughing)"
33:01,900;33:02,740;"Oh boy."
33:02,740;33:07,380;"- But do you have that perception too"
33:07,380;33:08,740;"of like the Randy Moss?"
33:08,740;33:11,160;"- Yeah, I felt they were kind of like similarly"
33:11,160;33:12,000;"misunderstood people."
33:12,000;33:15,740;"- Yeah, I didn't remember like serious offenses off the field."
33:15,740;33:17,180;"- No, like a lot of that came."
33:17,180;33:20,780;"We said 2010, that's four years after you were tired."
33:20,780;33:22,900;"- Well, also 2000 though, right?"
33:22,900;33:24,860;"Which is still earlier."
33:24,860;33:27,980;"- That's like pre-media hype, social media."
33:27,980;33:30,100;"If that happened nowadays, it's on the 24 hour"
33:30,100;33:30,940;"news cycle, it's--"
33:30,940;33:33,140;"Well, I'm just looking for just Sherman right now going through it."
33:33,140;33:34,380;"Yeah."
33:34,380;33:34,900;"Yeah."
33:34,900;33:35,420;"Yeah."
33:35,420;33:36,700;"It's probably similar."
33:36,700;33:39,100;"Yeah, situation."
33:39,100;33:39,780;"It feel."
33:39,780;33:41,620;"Yeah, it kind of has that feeling to it, doesn't it?"
33:41,620;33:45,500;"But I'm not going to comment on things that aren't out there yet."
33:45,500;33:47,780;"So I'll wait and see what happens."
33:47,780;33:48,780;"Dude, that's our job."
33:48,780;33:49,580;"We're journalists."
33:49,580;33:51,060;"Are we?"
33:51,060;33:52,540;"So we're calling ourselves there."
33:52,540;33:53,180;"We're analysts."
33:53,180;33:54,180;"Analysts."
33:54,180;33:55,740;"We analyze."
33:55,740;33:58,300;"I didn't realize this was a trial for W.E."
33:58,300;33:58,500;"Yeah."
33:58,500;34:00,460;"We totally told Miguel we're journalists."
34:00,460;34:05,500;"He left. Yeah, he did. We told Jeff how the same thing. He laughed at us too."
34:05,500;34:09,460;"He was polite about it, but yeah, I get it."
34:09,460;34:12,420;"It was a nervous lap though, because he never come for that."
34:12,420;34:18,860;"As soon as you started asking about how to get a press passes to Belichick's conferences,"
34:18,860;34:21,660;"you got a little worried. He's going to see those hundred dollars we donated."
34:21,660;34:27,380;"Be like, Oh, shit. Yeah. Coming for you. Yeah. All this big ball is spending all this"
34:27,380;34:31,540;"money from the, the, the, the fat stacks of pages,"
34:31,540;34:35,260;"dynasty that we have in our bank account, which for some reason"
34:35,260;34:37,780;"looks very similar to my personal bank account, strangely."
34:37,780;34:40,460;"But we'll have to forget that."
34:40,460;34:41,380;"Daddy fat stacks."
34:41,380;34:43,060;"Daddy fat stacks is only a B.I."
34:43,060;34:44,500;"B.O.I."
34:44,500;34:50,540;"Give me them ducats."
34:50,540;34:57,220;"Speaking of bodies though, there was definitely a moment in this"
34:57,220;35:04,300;"game where the stadium was playing the aforementioned song by"
35:04,300;35:04,980;"Drowning Pool."
35:04,980;35:05,900;"Really?"
35:05,900;35:06,620;"Yeah."
35:06,620;35:09,180;"So that was definitely some Drowning Pool in the background."
35:09,180;35:10,860;"It's such a good song."
35:10,860;35:13,460;"So that's confirmed and not disturbed."
35:13,460;35:14,860;"Let the body sit the floor."
35:14,860;35:16,820;"We had this is drowning pool."
35:16,820;35:17,460;"Okay."
35:17,460;35:18,140;"Yes."
35:18,140;35:19,900;"Yeah."
35:19,900;35:22,460;"Speaking of one hit wonders."
35:22,460;35:23,020;"Yeah."
35:23,020;35:24,380;"Yeah."
35:24,380;35:26,580;"I used to listen to that to go to sleep."
35:26,580;35:27,980;"Yeah, me too."
35:27,980;35:29,940;"Really?"
35:29,940;35:30,980;"That was the only one."
35:30,980;35:31,580;"Oh, no."
35:31,580;35:34,460;"Well, it was that until Slipknot came out, I think."
35:34,460;35:36,940;"And then it was, which everyone came out for."
35:36,940;35:39,180;"I don't remember, but I used to listen to that album."
35:39,180;35:42,260;"I'd listen to that song and be like, what am I doing?"
35:42,260;35:44,780;"I was supposed to help me sleep."
35:44,780;35:47,060;"I used to be a CD."
35:47,060;35:50,220;"We had a kick around the house where it was like a mix of rock songs."
35:50,220;35:52,100;"It had like slipknot and a bunch of stuff on there."
35:52,100;35:52,980;"Oh, yeah."
35:52,980;35:56,260;"I wouldn't listen to the Rob Zombie one before bed"
35:56,260;35:58,260;"because it used to give me nightmares."
35:58,260;36:00,420;"- I just think that about slipknot"
36:00,420;36:01,940;"when I first started listening to him."
36:01,940;36:04,540;"Like this is a little much for me."
36:04,540;36:08,020;"- And then next year he's wearing spiky backpacks"
36:08,020;36:10,540;"and weird snowboarding hats in the high school."
36:10,540;36:13,020;"- Yeah, and starting a metal band called Liquid Fetus."
36:13,020;36:16,260;"So, you know, life comes at you fast boys."
36:16,260;36:17,100;"- Mm-hmm."
36:17,100;36:19,340;"(laughs)"
36:19,340;36:23,820;"- Yeah, so what else happened in this game?"
36:23,820;36:26,700;"Let's get to the biggest bills B and D."
36:26,700;36:29,160;"- Is there anything else you want to get to until like,"
36:29,160;36:31,060;"because when we mentioned this play,"
36:31,060;36:31,900;"like people are gonna be like,"
36:31,900;36:34,140;"""Oh, that's right, I remember this game now."""
36:34,140;36:34,980;"- I think so."
36:34,980;36:35,820;"- I didn't remember this game."
36:35,820;36:36,660;"- I didn't remember it either."
36:36,660;36:38,180;"- Oh really, this is what I remember this game for."
36:38,180;36:40,060;"- I laughed out loud when I saw it."
36:40,060;36:40,860;"- Yeah."
36:40,860;36:44,140;"All right, so let's go over this play."
36:44,140;36:44,980;"So."
36:44,980;36:47,340;"- Yeah, I really set the whole table here."
36:47,340;36:52,340;"- So the score is 21 17 Patriots fourth quarter"
36:52,340;36:53,340;"It's fourth quarter."
36:53,340;36:55,840;"Patience scored the go ahead."
36:55,840;36:57,040;"Yeah."
36:57,040;36:58,340;"Yeah, 24 17."
36:58,340;36:59,640;"I know math is hard."
36:59,640;37:00,940;"No, I said 17."
37:00,940;37:07,740;"So the Patriots on the play you mentioned where they went to kick a field goal and the bills were off sides and the"
37:07,740;37:08,740;"Patriots scored a touchdown."
37:08,740;37:10,940;"So that was the beginning of the fourth quarter."
37:10,940;37:13,140;"Patriots go ahead by a touchdown."
37:13,140;37:17,440;"And then Buffalo went three and out and punted."
37:17,940;37:19,940;"Patriots"
37:19,940;37:25,620;"Three and out again and punted and then Buffalo drove inside Newland 20"
37:25,620;37:29,220;"And they have third and two right around the 20-yard line"
37:29,220;37:35,660;"And the handoff Travis Henry and he has for that they called time out. They won't think about it. No"
37:35,660;37:37,660;"I'm talking about the third down before this"
37:37,660;37:46,340;"So third down Travis Henry has a gaping hole. They run to the right side gaping hole trips over nothing and falls over"
37:46,700;37:49,460;"So now it's fourth and one that could have picked up the first step"
37:49,460;37:53,980;"Probably may have actually been a line is where touchdown untouched falls over in the hole"
37:53,980;37:59,660;"He's nothing getting like the first ten yard line at least he's a you might be still running to this day exactly"
37:59,660;38:04,880;"Yeah, let's I'm from those chows before they"
38:04,880;38:09,060;"Is yeah, he is running from somebody"
38:09,060;38:13,300;"So fourth fourth and short"
38:14,300;38:20,560;"Bill's called time out talking over like you know what silly as a perfect patriot beater. We can convert this"
38:20,560;38:22,980;"We're gonna beat the Patriots just like we did last year"
38:22,980;38:25,660;"And so they get to the line"
38:25,660;38:29,900;"Bloods oh drops back to hand it off. There's no running back there"
38:29,900;38:32,820;"turns around the other way and"
38:32,820;38:35,860;"Teddy Bruce he is there"
38:35,860;38:40,220;"Hits him so hard and also knocks the ball out of bloods those hands straight to the ground"
38:41,420;38:44,740;"Richard Seymour picks it up and returns it almost 80 yards for"
38:44,740;38:49,100;"the game ceiling touchdown with Rodney Harrison"
38:49,100;38:57,420;"Escorting the entire way. Yeah, just it's one of those plays that you just like sometimes will happen you like oh, that's it's a broken play, you know"
38:57,420;39:00,020;"Turn the wrong way running back on the wrong way"
39:00,020;39:06,540;"The guy nobody decided to block Teddy. Yeah off of a timeout right in the middle. Yeah, nobody"
39:06,940;39:11,940;"Everybody every single person if you I watched the replay of this play over and over again"
39:11,940;39:16,860;"And it's I couldn't tell what the play was supposed to be because half the offensive line pulled one way"
39:16,860;39:21,220;"The other half blocked like half of it like a couple guys pulled to the right"
39:21,220;39:27,500;"The wrestling offensive line blocked to the left the running back went to the right and still didn't block Teddy Bruceky"
39:27,500;39:30,820;"He came in untouched. He is a naked bootleg"
39:30,820;39:34,260;"Well, they actually showed afterwards they showed"
39:35,420;39:40,140;"Bledso on the ground, like look around and you could see him out the words."
39:40,140;39:41,820;"He went the wrong way."
39:41,820;39:44,620;"So it was definitely a broken blade."
39:44,620;39:46,780;"There was no naked bootleg to this whatsoever."
39:46,780;39:49,420;"It's just the this is classic bills."
39:49,420;39:51,020;"You called the time out."
39:51,020;39:51,260;"Yeah."
39:51,260;39:54,620;"To get on the same page and this is how you do it."
39:54,620;39:59,260;"If this happens in the first quarter, you're like, you know, it's fine."
39:59,260;40:00,620;"No, but with the game on the line."
40:00,620;40:01,660;"Time execution."
40:01,660;40:03,820;"That's always been the Mills Bugaboo."
40:03,820;40:04,460;"Yeah."
40:04,460;40:09,300;"See, wide comma, right."
40:09,300;40:13,660;"No word comma Scott."
40:13,660;40:14,660;"Yeah."
40:14,660;40:15,660;"Yeah."
40:15,660;40:21,180;"It was, I don't know, just, what do you guys want to do?"
40:21,180;40:22,180;"Okay."
40:22,180;40:23,180;"I got it."
40:23,180;40:24,180;"Mike, we're lucky looking for his first dumbie."
40:24,180;40:26,580;"He goes, all right."
40:26,580;40:29,540;"So you go the wrong way running back half the live blocks."
40:29,540;40:30,860;"One way half blocks the other way."
40:30,860;40:32,100;"Let's open up Teddy."
40:32,100;40:34,300;"So when Drew turns around, he's right there."
40:34,300;40:36,220;"It's goddamn face that he's gonna fumble it"
40:36,220;40:37,260;"to the Richard Seymour."
40:37,260;40:38,180;"All right, break."
40:38,180;40:39,980;"- So good."
40:39,980;40:42,060;"- See Sheldon, whatever his name was,"
40:42,060;40:44,420;"that took that punt, that kickoff out of the end zone"
40:44,420;40:45,260;"and then fumbled."
40:45,260;40:46,340;"- Leo just to Calvin."
40:46,340;40:47,740;"Leo's. - Yes, yeah, yeah."
40:47,740;40:52,700;"- Yeah, it's just such a bills way to lose."
40:52,700;40:54,700;"- I'm telling you, if anybody has any bills fans"
40:54,700;40:56,500;"in their famous football league,"
40:56,500;40:59,380;"make them listen to every single bills episode"
40:59,380;41:01,420;"'cause them reliving this is just a--"
41:01,420;41:05,860;"You know what? That might actually be a good like coming last place in fantasy football."
41:05,860;41:06,760;"That's what I'm saying."
41:06,760;41:11,900;"Yeah. Like punishment is to have non-patriose fans listen to this, listen to the games."
41:11,900;41:15,140;"Dude, we should skip every game that the bills went."
41:15,140;41:20,380;"Oh, you know, we're only going to miss like a couple."
41:20,380;41:22,400;"Do you know how many that is?"
41:22,400;41:24,740;"I actually have 40 done one."
41:24,740;41:28,320;"It's three with Brady."
41:28,820;41:33,820;"Overall, the bills have won five games out of 40."
41:33,820;41:36,780;"- Amen."
41:36,780;41:40,020;"- In fact, if you sort the,"
41:40,020;41:42,460;"you can do this on the new Patriots dynasty website,"
41:42,460;41:44,220;"pastdiancy.com."
41:44,220;41:48,940;"But if you sort the Patriots records"
41:48,940;41:51,900;"versus opponents by win percentage,"
41:51,900;41:53,820;"you have the Falcons and Cowboys,"
41:53,820;41:57,620;"Patriots undefeated, so 100% win percentage."
41:57,620;42:01,460;"They're eight and one against the Jaguars, which is 889."
42:01,460;42:04,220;"They're six and one against the Rams and Raiders, which"
42:04,220;42:05,820;"is 857."
42:05,820;42:07,580;"But between the Jaguars and the Rams,"
42:07,580;42:11,420;"so basically what would account to a seven and one record"
42:11,420;42:16,300;"is the pages record against the Bills, which is 35 and 5."
42:16,300;42:16,940;"Feels--"
42:16,940;42:19,180;"So they have a seven and one record against the Bills"
42:19,180;42:21,620;"five times."
42:21,620;42:24,060;"And this is just Tom Brady, or what do we talk about?"
42:24,060;42:25,940;"No, this is just overall."
42:25,940;42:28,780;"Tom Brady, I think is, I'll have that too."
42:28,780;42:29,620;"Give me one second."
42:29,620;42:31,700;"- And one of those Tom Brady losses against the Bills"
42:31,700;42:35,780;"is a weak 17 game where he plays the first half and sits."
42:35,780;42:40,340;"- Brady's 32 and three, the 9-14 win percentage."
42:40,340;42:41,700;"- We can not count that one really."
42:41,700;42:43,500;"- One is the 61. - One is the 31"
42:43,500;42:45,460;"nothing game and one is that West Welker"
42:45,460;42:47,420;"getting 200 yards and still losing game."
42:47,420;42:49,700;"- Yep, yep, those are the three."
42:49,700;42:51,660;"You just know him off top, but he had done it."
42:51,660;42:56,660;"And then the other two, one, when Brady to sit out his,"
42:56,660;42:58,420;"oh yeah, one against Machouse,"
42:58,420;43:00,620;"and one when Brady had to sit out the four games."
43:00,620;43:02,580;"And they didn't actually have a quarterback to start."
43:02,580;43:03,700;"- Jacobi Bursett."
43:03,700;43:04,540;"- Yeah."
43:04,540;43:06,300;"- And then Jacobi Bursett and his still almost won."
43:06,300;43:07,460;"They lost like 16-0."
43:07,460;43:08,820;"- They should have won that game though."
43:08,820;43:10,060;"- Yeah, it was at a building."
43:10,060;43:12,740;"- They had a long touchdown call back at the beginning."
43:12,740;43:15,060;"- And the Bill Sands were so hyped,"
43:15,060;43:17,340;"and I was leaving, and I said, ""Enjoy your Super Bowl."""
43:17,340;43:18,300;"- Enjoy your Super Bowl."
43:18,300;43:19,300;"Enjoy your Super Bowl."
43:19,300;43:20,780;"And I could see it in their eyes."
43:20,780;43:22,420;"like hockey's right. Yeah."
43:22,420;43:23,900;"One the Super Bowl."
43:23,900;43:25,620;"Like, yeah."
43:25,620;43:27,740;"That was their Super Bowl. Yeah."
43:27,740;43:29,020;"It really was. Yeah."
43:29,020;43:32,380;"Yeah. I mean, I I feel like I don't want to skip the"
43:32,380;43:34,380;"build losses just because they're so"
43:34,380;43:39,380;"out of the ordinary, you know, and they're and because of that, they're so memorable."
43:39,380;43:41,600;"I don't really remember that West Walker getting a tiny"
43:41,600;43:43,300;"arts game. So I wouldn't. Yeah."
43:43,300;43:45,100;"Well, it must be an electric game."
43:45,100;43:48,860;"I only remember it because because it was an electric park, I believe, too."
43:48,940;43:52,460;"Yeah. And it was a five-foot Patrick as a quarterback. Yeah."
43:52,460;43:55,740;"And he threw, I think he threw four touchdowns and four interceptions."
43:55,740;43:57,900;"So it's your typical Rive as Patrick."
43:57,900;44:01,500;"It's sort of similar to this game, this game was really back and forth."
44:01,500;44:03,900;"And then the builds just absolutely choked in."
44:03,900;44:05,120;"Yeah. And that was the one-"
44:05,120;44:06,060;"Critical moment."
44:06,060;44:07,820;"You know, fourth down, you're inside the red zone."
44:07,820;44:10,620;"You were third and two and then it got stumbles and then you called time out."
44:10,620;44:12,060;"And then you have the absolute-"
44:12,060;44:14,540;"Yours play."
44:14,540;44:15,420;"Worst play."
44:15,420;44:17,180;"Worst play."
44:17,180;44:23,520;"man I didn't feel the box score and the"
44:23,520;44:24,960;"Patriots ran away with it right now"
44:24,960;44:26,360;"being like two touchdowns like you"
44:26,360;44:27,760;"just scrolling through that list on"
44:27,760;44:29,120;"that page signs like yeah right being"
44:29,120;44:32,180;"3117 oh hum yep but no this is like"
44:32,180;44:33,900;"super exciting it kind of came down to"
44:33,900;44:37,160;"why except for that last 14-point swing"
44:37,160;44:40,520;"basically that bills could have won it if"
44:40,520;44:43,400;"they hadn't fucked that up and gone"
44:43,400;44:49,240;"off-size-and-that-feel-go-attempt. Right. Right. It's just those small little things that"
44:49,240;44:55,480;"classic build. So, we've been doing this and we haven't seen a loss in 18 games. Do you remember"
44:55,480;45:02,520;"what coach Steve Spariar? Damn it. You can't believe you got that so quickly."
45:02,520;45:11,240;"It was 371 days ago. It was the last time the page is lost and it was to Steve Spariar's"
45:11,240;45:13,240;"Washington Redskins"
45:13,240;45:18,280;"Fucking ridiculous of all the teams too, but again that was a game like we're talking about that"
45:18,280;45:23,480;"Nothing went right, you know, they just it's a good book end. Yeah, exactly"
45:23,480;45:27,880;"So we got a dog alert and how did she get ever craze?"
45:27,880;45:31,160;"I opened the door to the room too"
45:31,160;45:36,840;"Get her over here get her on the pot. Oh my god. We got a dog that's smarter than Steve. Oh gosh"
45:36,840;45:40,360;"Smells some questions for you"
45:40,360;45:45,480;"for you. If you had to sniff any players butt in the league,"
45:45,480;45:48,840;"who's but would it be and why is he had to hump one leg?"
45:48,840;45:50,680;"Tom Brady's like, come on."
45:50,680;45:52,280;"Is it Tom Brady's left or right leg?"
45:52,280;45:55,280;"She's on the left side."
45:55,280;45:59,200;"Like I just knew that."
45:59,200;46:00,400;"Well, that's the treat side."
46:00,400;46:01,400;"I'm gonna treat some left side."
46:01,400;46:01,960;"So she's always."
46:01,960;46:02,760;"Oh, yeah."
46:02,760;46:03,280;"That's fair."
46:03,280;46:06,280;"So it's your fault."
46:06,280;46:07,360;"Yeah."
46:07,360;46:07,600;"Right."
46:07,600;46:09,080;"It's the best of worst here."
46:09,080;46:10,080;"All right, all right."
46:10,080;46:11,360;"Give me your best of worst, Steve."
46:11,360;46:19,520;"From my perspective, the best."
46:19,520;46:23,040;"There was a couple of milestones for Brady in this game,"
46:23,040;46:26,320;"early Brady milestones, where we did not have good."
46:26,320;46:28,480;"1,000 completions."
46:28,480;46:29,320;"OK."
46:29,320;46:30,600;"Corey Dillon had a sweep."
46:30,600;46:31,400;"Let's pick up, too."
46:31,400;46:34,040;"That was going to be one of my best, yeah."
46:34,040;46:37,560;"He caught Tom Brady's 1,000 completion."
46:37,560;46:41,460;"And he blocked the defensive end and got like lit up doing it."
46:41,460;46:41,860;"Yeah."
46:41,860;46:45,440;"Gets up, catches the dump off, which was like, wasn't even a great throw."
46:45,440;46:49,640;"Um, makes a nice snag and then runs for 12 yards on the first down."
46:49,640;46:50,140;"Yep."
46:50,140;46:51,120;"Solid."
46:51,120;46:54,780;"And then 75 touchdown passes."
46:54,780;46:58,800;"Daniel Graham and I have a note that was an easy catch."
46:58,800;46:59,880;"I'm surprised he made it."
46:59,880;47:04,600;"I might out on Daniel Graham was if he learned how to catch, he had been, uh,"
47:04,600;47:05,880;"the original Rob Gronkowski."
47:07,040;47:12,040;"And then my worst is poor Drew."
47:12,040;47:15,040;"You know, I love Drew Bledsoe."
47:15,040;47:18,320;"And after that hilarious play,"
47:18,320;47:21,760;"they trotted him back out there after they got the ball back"
47:21,760;47:25,480;"and he was just getting blitzed."
47:25,480;47:26,600;"They're just bringing this,"
47:26,600;47:27,800;"Rodney Harrison over and over."
47:27,800;47:28,800;"- Every single play."
47:28,800;47:30,680;"- And he was-- - And they couldn't stop it."
47:30,680;47:33,160;"Yeah, he got sacked twice on the first two plays"
47:33,160;47:34,160;"after that. - But it's Drew Bledsoe."
47:34,160;47:35,680;"He's just not gonna quit."
47:35,680;47:36,520;"He's gonna stay in there."
47:36,520;47:38,200;"He's gonna throw deep balls."
47:38,200;47:39,240;"He's gonna chuck it up."
47:39,240;47:41,680;"And he actually moved them down the field a little bit,"
47:41,680;47:43,760;"but he was just taking a beating."
47:43,760;47:46,120;"And you're like, dude, it's like a,"
47:46,120;47:47,360;"there's four seconds left."
47:47,360;47:48,800;"Like what are you doing?"
47:48,800;47:49,720;"You're gonna die."
47:49,720;47:50,560;"- Yes."
47:50,560;47:52,720;"Yeah, it was rough."
47:52,720;47:56,200;"- All right, Greg, you know what I mean?"
47:56,200;47:57,720;"Best of worst?"
47:57,720;47:58,960;"- That was gonna be my worst."
47:58,960;48:02,800;"They sacked him three times on that last drive."
48:02,800;48:03,800;"- They did, yeah."
48:03,800;48:04,640;"So bad."
48:05,560;48:06,760;"And you just stood there and took it."
48:06,760;48:07,600;"You couldn't--"
48:07,600;48:08,440;"- Yeah, sack."
48:08,440;48:10,200;"Seven-yard completion, incomplete."
48:10,200;48:11,680;"- Yeah, sack."
48:11,680;48:15,320;"- Six yards, two yards, 10 yards, sack,"
48:15,320;48:18,640;"complete 13 yards, incomplete in the end zone,"
48:18,640;48:20,080;"which should have been a pick."
48:20,080;48:21,280;"- Yeah."
48:21,280;48:22,120;"- Yeah, that was--"
48:22,120;48:23,280;"- 10-yard win three."
48:23,280;48:24,120;"- Yep."
48:24,120;48:26,800;"- And the people in season over there."
48:26,800;48:28,280;"- Yeah, and the people in Buffalo were talking about"
48:28,280;48:29,640;"how Drew just can't play anymore,"
48:29,640;48:30,560;"and they wanted to get rid of him"
48:30,560;48:31,760;"because that's how Buffalo works."
48:31,760;48:32,920;"- Yeah, I don't blame."
48:32,920;48:33,760;"They scared--"
48:33,760;48:34,880;"- They barely squirt at any point"
48:34,880;48:38,840;"the first two games. This game happens. You're only three. You're"
48:38,840;48:42,640;"punting on the year. You have an old quarterback. Let's move on."
48:42,640;48:46,080;"Yeah, I'd be saying the same shit. Yeah, because how long did you"
48:46,080;48:48,880;"last in Buffalo for your trades? Dallas and had a bit of a"
48:48,880;48:55,000;"Renaissance with Bella check, Parcells and an entire Glenn"
48:55,000;48:58,320;"to kind of like who do the bills end up moving on to it? It's"
48:58,320;49:03,000;"like, well, John, that's the question. It's awesome. It is"
49:03,000;49:05,880;"- I'm flutey, JP Lawson."
49:05,880;49:07,540;"- Wait, is flutey before this?"
49:07,540;49:09,260;"- Yeah, remember we had the whole flutey,"
49:09,260;49:12,640;"Rob Johnson, the conundrum."
49:12,640;49:14,400;"- Who did they have?"
49:14,400;49:15,240;"- It's Lassman."
49:15,240;49:16,080;"- It is JP Lassman?"
49:16,080;49:17,880;"- It's a high that they drafted, yeah."
49:17,880;49:20,100;"- Wow, I think I had a JP Lawson rookie card"
49:20,100;49:21,400;"back in the day."
49:21,400;49:22,640;"I don't think I kept it."
49:22,640;49:24,040;"- That's probably not worth anything."
49:24,040;49:26,560;"- Yeah, no kidding, if I had to venture a guess."
49:26,560;49:30,440;"- Swear has not worth the paper to print it on."
49:30,440;49:31,560;"- Oh man."
49:31,560;49:36,200;"All right, my best is Terrence McGee."
49:36,200;49:37,780;"- Ooh, all right."
49:37,780;49:44,000;"- Two passes defense, seven tackles."
49:44,000;49:48,600;"And four returns for Buck 76,"
49:48,600;49:50,840;"44 yard average and a touchdown."
49:50,840;49:51,760;"- Yeah."
49:51,760;49:53,120;"- Dude had a really good game."
49:53,120;49:54,840;"- He did, yeah, he stepped up."
49:54,840;49:55,680;"And that kick was done."
49:55,680;49:56,840;"- Except for that one,"
49:56,840;49:59,040;"where he got absolutely burned by Patton"
49:59,040;50:01,320;"on that touchdown right before the first half."
50:01,320;50:03,000;"- Yeah, I don't know if that was so much damage."
50:03,000;50:04,560;"It was like, just the fourth time."
50:04,560;50:05,760;"- So you kick returns it for a touchdown,"
50:05,760;50:07,000;"like, yeah, look, yeah, let's go."
50:07,000;50:08,520;"And then he just absolutely gives it up"
50:08,520;50:09,680;"on the other end, oops."
50:09,680;50:10,680;"- Yeah."
50:10,680;50:12,560;"Steve, why can't you let him have nice things?"
50:12,560;50:14,120;"- Well, the touchdown of Patton,"
50:14,120;50:16,320;"Patton didn't have anyone literally within like"
50:16,320;50:17,520;"20 square yards of that."
50:17,520;50:19,480;"- And like they replayed it and then like isolated,"
50:19,480;50:20,560;"yep, that's his fault."
50:20,560;50:22,840;"(laughs)"
50:22,840;50:25,000;"- We got caught up in the, in the chaff."
50:25,000;50:26,080;"- All right."
50:26,080;50:28,120;"- Did you have a worst, Craig?"
50:28,120;50:29,280;"Just the Tom Bray stuff?"
50:29,280;50:30,400;"- Oh, that's true blood, so?"
50:30,400;50:31,240;"Yeah."
50:31,240;50:33,000;"All right."
50:33,000;50:35,920;"All right."
50:35,920;50:42,560;"My best was learning that this is kind of like a sad best"
50:42,560;50:45,720;"for the bills, but those are the best ones."
50:45,720;50:48,960;"Eric Molds of the--"
50:48,960;50:54,080;"he has every single Bill's offensive touchdown this season."
50:54,080;50:56,640;"And do you anybody want to guess how many that is?"
50:56,640;50:59,560;"Wait, sitting in every Bill's offensive touchdown?"
50:59,560;51:04,100;"Every single builds offensive touchdown so far this season three three weeks so far. I think yeah"
51:04,100;51:10,840;"And yeah, he had won this game you did yeah, so I'm gonna guess one three"
51:10,840;51:20,340;"They lost both games 13 to 10 to start the year I think oh really and he had all those touchdowns so it was just him"
51:20,340;51:28,380;"Caron the league we're 10 10 catches for a buck 26 and a touchdown. That's a good game. Yeah 15 targets"
51:28,380;51:33,380;"which he had earlier where Bledsoh had an absolute bomb until the end."
51:33,380;51:36,380;"So Bledsoh was throwing some classic Bledsoh."
51:36,380;51:37,380;"Yeah."
51:37,380;51:41,660;"As he does, but it takes him a while in the pocket to get there."
51:41,660;51:45,220;"And so if you can get to him, you're going to get your six sacks and that's not going"
51:45,220;51:49,820;"to work for him."
51:49,820;51:53,380;"My worst was the bills fans in this game."
51:53,380;52:00,380;"I know it's tough and buffalo, but they were dying to get a late hit penalty and they were"
52:00,380;52:03,020;"being super salty about it."
52:03,020;52:06,140;"Lots of booing and jeering and whatnot."
52:06,140;52:08,380;"It's not a great look."
52:08,380;52:09,380;"Come on, Andy."
52:09,380;52:10,940;"Not a great look."
52:10,940;52:11,940;"I'm just saying."
52:11,940;52:12,940;"What?"
52:12,940;52:13,940;"I don't know."
52:13,940;52:20,340;"I saw criticizing refs for them not calling penalties for your team in their favor."
52:20,340;52:21,340;"Right."
52:21,340;52:23,140;"You're the king of that."
52:23,140;52:27,420;"I thought a cut of a dude with a wind up camera and wearing a link."
52:27,420;52:28,180;"Yeah."
52:28,180;52:31,300;"Just just a look."
52:31,300;52:32,620;"Tough look."
52:32,620;52:36,420;"Um, and then we won the herd raft was a tough look."
52:36,420;52:37,900;"Yeah."
52:37,900;52:38,740;"Yeah, that was great."
52:38,740;52:42,580;"Um, and then booing the guy that came in for him who was completely"
52:42,580;52:42,980;"in over."
52:42,980;52:45,100;"You have struggled."
52:45,100;52:46,420;"That guy gets food."
52:46,420;52:47,380;"Yeah."
52:47,380;52:49,380;"Uh, and then, um,"
52:49,380;52:56,660;"speaking on that, I hate when people call like entire fan bases, like scumbags or whatever,"
52:56,660;53:04,260;"over like a couple hundred people booing a ref. It's like, every single fan base in the"
53:04,260;53:10,180;"entire world does things like that. I think people would be like the studio Buffalo,"
53:10,180;53:16,980;"very problematic. It's like, dude, you mean humans in general? I have a person down the"
53:16,980;53:20,700;"Some people are doing stupid shit. Yeah, I hate that shit"
53:20,700;53:27,700;"I feel like I've heard you talk shit on Eagle stands and Raven stands. Yeah, and there's plenty of good Eagles fans. Yep"
53:27,700;53:32,900;"Would you I don't know what I mean Baltimore or Philly. Yeah, of course I would"
53:32,900;53:37,180;"I've never been to a game of Baltimore Philly. You wouldn't go to one"
53:37,180;53:41,740;"I have no real desire to just from those fan bases reputation because yes"
53:41,740;53:46,460;"There's bad apples in every group, but there's more in those from in my opinion. Yeah Philly. I think has"
53:46,460;53:50,900;"more of a reputation. I've been to Pittsburgh twice."
53:50,900;53:56,740;"Baltimore wouldn't bother me. I think that's a good rivalry. I think the Baltimore fans are okay."
53:56,740;53:59,740;"Yes, get off of it."
53:59,740;54:04,140;"Got you down."
54:04,140;54:06,940;"Down."
54:06,940;54:11,180;"Poop, poo right there on the bed."
54:11,180;54:15,620;"That's it. Now, puke on the floor, guys. This is such good radio."
54:15,620;54:19,940;"- Steve, what's been the hardest part about owning a dog?"
54:19,940;54:21,540;"- Best and worst of owning a dog."
54:21,540;54:23,940;"- Best and worst of owning a dog."
54:23,940;54:28,180;"- Best is, yes."
54:28,180;54:29,780;"- She's awesome having a dog."
54:29,780;54:31,020;"- That's shit."
54:31,020;54:34,180;"- Okay, pets, is that where you're going?"
54:34,180;54:36,100;"- Not just the dog. - Compared to the ship."
54:36,100;54:37,300;"- Not just the dog you own,"
54:37,300;54:39,020;"but all the other dogs can meet on the street too."
54:39,020;54:40,460;"- Oh, that's fair."
54:40,460;54:41,740;"- You get to pet a lot of dogs."
54:41,740;54:43,980;"- But I could pet other dogs on the street."
54:43,980;54:44,820;"It's not the same."
54:44,820;54:45,660;"It's not the same."
54:45,660;54:46,480;"- Yeah."
54:46,480;54:47,320;"- Why not?"
54:47,320;54:48,160;"- You'd be a weirdo tryin' to be like,"
54:48,160;54:49,000;"""You can go up there and be a dog,"
54:49,000;54:50,340;"""but you don't cook, but you don't cook, but you don't cook."""
54:50,340;54:53,020;"- You dug it, now Gus meets every single dog she sees"
54:53,020;54:54,940;"'cause she's fuckin' loves everything."
54:54,940;54:57,940;"- You think so?"
54:57,940;54:59,540;"You think that's a thing?"
54:59,540;55:00,380;"- Yeah."
55:00,380;55:02,380;"Oh yeah, I pet a lot more dogs with Gus."
55:02,380;55:04,900;"- Yeah, I guess 'cause you stop and you stand there."
55:04,900;55:06,820;"- Right, 'cause the dogs have to meet each other."
55:06,820;55:08,220;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
55:08,220;55:09,900;"Isn't that kinda awkward though?"
55:09,900;55:12,620;"Like what do you talk with dog owners?"
55:12,620;55:13,460;"- Oh yeah, our kids."
55:13,460;55:17,380;"I love it. I love meeting new people but Lauren is that if you don't like meeting the people you're not gonna like it"
55:17,380;55:19,380;"Yeah, I would hate that"
55:19,380;55:22,100;"You're like oh kind of breed is it oh?"
55:22,100;55:31,540;"Yeah, she's as cute as she is crazy"
55:31,540;55:37,140;"Oh, yeah, but they know that's backed up by Gus go buck fucking wild while she's meeting other dogs, you know"
55:37,140;55:40,180;"I'm gonna give you a little a little pro tip here"
55:40,180;55:41,840;"- Oh, if you do. - Oh, if you do."

55:43,520;55:44,360;"- You're a little bit. - No, no."
55:44,360;55:45,200;"- No, no. - But he did his,"
55:45,200;55:47,340;"he just stepped in dog shit this past weekend."

55:49,420;55:52,220;"People know when you got a line that you say all the time."
55:52,220;55:53,060;"- Obviously."
55:53,060;55:53,900;"- You know?"
55:53,900;55:54,740;"- Yeah. - It's like,"
55:54,740;55:55,780;"when you hear old men say that shit."

55:58,660;56:00,180;"- No shit, I don't need to hit the same."
56:00,180;56:01,380;"He's a fucking random stranger."
56:01,380;56:02,220;"He's a medium on the street."
56:02,220;56:03,980;"I'm not trying to fucking be best friends with him, Greg."
56:03,980;56:06,380;"- Of course you're being like, be fair enough."
56:06,380;56:07,220;"- Fair enough."
56:07,220;56:10,140;"(laughing)"
56:10,140;56:12,140;"- Let's see if we don't see."
56:12,140;56:13,540;"Instead of we just say."
56:13,540;56:16,340;"(laughing)"
56:16,340;56:17,820;"- Be material."
56:17,820;56:18,900;"- Yeah right."
56:18,900;56:19,740;"- It's craziest."
56:19,740;56:20,580;"- Shocks."

56:24,860;56:26,420;"where you don't know the people that well"
56:26,420;56:28,580;"is like almost inherently being material."
56:28,580;56:29,420;"- Yeah."
56:29,420;56:30,940;"I just like the fact that Steve thinks he's got"
56:30,940;56:32,100;"a material too."
56:32,100;56:32,940;"That's the best point of all."
56:32,940;56:40,460;"I got even sometimes sometimes it's unintentional. I'm laying on my a material out on this podcast, okay to me really when"
56:40,460;56:45,020;"They everyone when I was down in North Carolina said I love the podcast because he should I'm Greg all the time"
56:45,020;56:48,740;"That's my a material people"
56:48,740;56:51,380;"polite"
56:51,380;56:55,820;"They tell me that about you Steve yeah care"
56:57,300;57:01,460;"So the best part is is petting other people's dogs"
57:01,460;57:07,060;"Plus other people's dogs"
57:07,060;57:14,180;"Worst it's just you have to play in your you know everything around the dog"
57:14,180;57:18,580;"Here I thought it'd be pooper related, but we're going we're going back in the office now"
57:18,580;57:22,100;"So we're like that and we're going to Maine and we got to figure that out"
57:22,100;57:26,300;"You know, he was always just complicates plans. You can't get up and leave anymore. Yeah. Yeah"
57:26,300;57:28,300;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
57:28,300;57:31,300;"- Do you feel like you are kind of like a,"
57:31,300;57:37,260;"I don't know if proxy's the right word,"
57:37,260;57:40,540;"but like when the dog is acting inappropriately"
57:40,540;57:42,780;"that you're getting judged for it?"
57:42,780;57:45,820;"- I don't get a lot 'cause Gus is super easy."
57:45,820;57:46,980;"She's so chill."
57:46,980;57:47,820;"She loves everything."
57:47,820;57:50,260;"She doesn't really have any behavior problems."
57:50,260;57:51,460;"- Like jumping on people though."
57:51,460;57:53,260;"He told me she does that."
57:53,260;57:54,100;"- Yeah. - Well, at least she's"
57:54,100;57:54,940;"pulling back."
57:54,940;57:56,940;"people in the face."
57:56,940;57:58,940;"- It's not gonna do that, it's just me."
57:58,940;58:00,940;"(laughing)"
58:00,940;58:02,940;"- I mean that's 'cause you put your face in the way."
58:02,940;58:04,940;"- Yeah, I'm putting my face right here."
58:04,940;58:08,940;"- Also I'm entering the day that Steve's like impossible to shame."
58:08,940;58:10,940;"- This is true."
58:10,940;58:12,940;"- Yeah, he's just zero to how like the social cutie did."
58:12,940;58:14,940;"(laughing)"
58:14,940;58:16,940;"- I'm gonna do, I should be like, I should be ashamed right now,"
58:16,940;58:18,940;"but I just, I'm just not."
58:18,940;58:19,940;"I just don't care."
58:19,940;58:21,940;"Thanks, so here we go."
58:21,940;58:23,940;"- You just never learned the shame piece."
58:23,940;58:25,940;"No, everybody loves my dog."
58:25,940;58:28,780;"They might not love my dog."
58:28,780;58:30,940;"I just don't care that they don't love my dog."
58:30,940;58:38,660;"I agree."
58:38,660;58:41,140;"Rough housing dogs is wicked fun."
58:41,140;58:42,140;"It's wicked fun."
58:42,140;58:43,140;"Yeah, I do enjoy it."
58:43,140;58:44,340;"It's a good rough housing too."
58:44,340;58:47,340;"Yeah, just like pushing around and being like, yeah, what's not?"
58:47,340;58:48,500;"I'm the king here."
58:48,500;58:53,900;"Told bites in the face and then I'm the king."
58:53,900;58:55,900;"The game over and somebody cries."
58:55,900;58:58,140;"No blood, no hurt."
58:58,140;59:00,380;"That's how we used to play grown up."
59:00,380;59:05,180;"So we talked to the pooping though."
59:05,180;59:05,980;"Jeez man."
59:05,980;59:09,340;"Yeah, that would not that would probably my worst part of the pooping."
59:09,340;59:10,300;"Yeah."
59:10,300;59:12,700;"Well, this talk doesn't poop in."
59:12,700;59:15,980;"If they could just come up with a breed, I was actually thinking of this the other day."
59:15,980;59:22,060;"It just like doesn't poop that just uses every fiber of the food source."
59:22,860;59:27,620;"Or even a food source that you know and then I was thinking like what kind of like?"
59:27,620;59:31,500;"Like the human body is like a miracle right?"
59:31,500;59:38,380;"What are we pooping for? Why are we just using it like I don't know if there's everything poops guy having you read that book?"
59:38,380;59:41,680;"I know it's better if you ever thought why everything"
59:41,680;59:46,580;"Because not everything that goes in you is is good"
59:47,140;59:53,580;"Like if you're in the fucking entire box of Cheetos like some of that stuff. Okay, what about peeing then like it's just water"
59:53,580;59:59,460;"I should be using the water. No, it's good rid of all this shit that your liver is filtering. All right, liver"
59:59,460;01:00:03,500;"Just like a car. Yeah, you there's waste when you press a gas"
01:00:03,500;01:00:07,260;"Shut up Gus we're talking"
01:00:07,260;01:00:11,280;"I'm just saying if we could get a dog that didn't poop"
01:00:16,580;01:00:18,580;"Get on that science"
01:00:18,580;01:00:20,980;"Write this down"
01:00:20,980;01:00:24,460;"Talk that doesn't poop. How do you patent something?"
01:00:24,460;01:00:32,020;"Or even a food that makes them not have to poop but keeps them alive like that"
01:00:32,020;01:00:36,740;"I mean think about how much you've a ball think of how much more you get done in a day if you didn't poop"
01:00:36,740;01:00:42,700;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I would go a lot. Well. Yeah, I wouldn't get as much I wouldn't get as far my my"
01:00:42,700;01:00:45,060;"games on my phone"
01:00:45,060;01:00:50,420;"If I enjoy pooping, though, you know, yeah, it's nice little sanctuary. Yeah, sleeping's also"
01:00:50,420;01:00:53,120;"It's like why are we why do we got to sleep before we thought that one out?"
01:00:53,120;01:01:01,820;"Yeah, we just go crazy if you don't sleep that's ridiculous"
01:01:01,820;01:01:09,980;"How do we function like this the brain gonna watch it out what if you're pooping because you're sleeping when you're sleeping you're making"
01:01:09,980;01:01:13,460;"Yeah, so maybe should I want to see anything eliminate sleep you eliminate poop"
01:01:13,740;01:01:16,520;"How long do you think you go without sleeping and or pooping?"
01:01:16,520;01:01:19,720;"I don't know six hours"
01:01:19,720;01:01:22,700;"Go a long time 45 minutes. I"
01:01:22,700;01:01:30,420;"I've always wanted to do that to push the limits of sleep in and see how weird it gets you should talk to Mr"
01:01:30,420;01:01:36,220;"Melo, you know, I'm stopping you Greg did that with your big. That's the thing. No one stopping you"
01:01:36,220;01:01:38,860;"except for yourself"
01:01:41,300;01:01:47,780;"Yeah, well, yeah, you'd be miserable. I know Mike Mellow has done that and he talks about after I"
01:01:47,780;01:01:49,860;"think he did"
01:01:49,860;01:01:53,860;"Like 30 something hours or 40 something hours and he started like hallucinating shit"
01:01:53,860;01:02:00,300;"That's not good often like just miss one night asleep. Yeah, no, but this is like chips and shit"
01:02:00,300;01:02:05,620;"Yeah, missing like two nights. Yeah, two nights of sleep probably crazy. Yeah, good or rack"
01:02:05,620;01:02:09,380;"Join Isis get captured you'll find out"
01:02:10,380;01:02:19,100;"Yeah, Jesus. I bet it's different when you got that adrenaline going, you know, yeah, maybe that natural adrenaline keep you up longer"
01:02:19,100;01:02:23,220;"Dylan Bill ejection adrenaline, bro. Yeah, yeah, dude. I'll be fun"
01:02:23,220;01:02:30,620;"And we get you can buy adrenaline you can buy synthetic adrenaline. Oh, so it's called ice. Oh Steve. Okay. I"
01:02:30,620;01:02:33,260;"just"
01:02:36,860;01:02:38,900;"We'll just ship it to Peyton Manning's wife."
01:02:38,900;01:02:39,900;"So yes."
01:02:39,900;01:02:44,580;"It's how you bring it back to football."
01:02:44,580;01:02:46,180;"Bring that back to the podcast."
01:02:46,180;01:02:46,820;"Yeah."
01:02:46,820;01:02:48,900;"I was, yeah, that was all done."
01:02:48,900;01:02:52,420;"I was going to say, speaking of people who didn't give a fuck."
01:02:52,420;01:02:56,820;"We'll end on the quote from Bill Belichick when asked about what he thought about matching"
01:02:56,820;01:02:58,700;"the 18 win record."
01:02:58,700;01:02:59,940;"Anybody have a guess?"
01:02:59,940;01:03:02,380;"Do you think you thought this was important?"
01:03:02,380;01:03:03,780;"No, you don't."
01:03:03,780;01:03:04,220;"I don't know."
01:03:04,220;01:03:06,460;"He's kind of like a historian of the game."
01:03:06,460;01:03:08,960;"So could go either way quote."
01:03:08,960;01:03:10,120;"We don't care about that."
01:03:10,120;01:03:12,460;"I care about this season and that this is a divisional game."
01:03:12,460;01:03:14,500;"Yeah."
01:03:14,500;01:03:14,860;"Come on."
01:03:14,860;01:03:16,960;"That's where that's where bullshit."
01:03:16,960;01:03:18,000;"That's full of shit."
01:03:18,000;01:03:18,340;"Did."
01:03:18,340;01:03:18,660;"Yes."
01:03:18,660;01:03:19,600;"He does care about it."
01:03:19,600;01:03:21,400;"Like because he claims to be like a media."
01:03:21,400;01:03:22,660;"Yeah."
01:03:22,660;01:03:26,140;"He claims to be like a historian of the game and respect history and shut like that."
01:03:26,140;01:03:29,580;"Well, I think he knows when you break a record, like, shouldn't you acknowledge that?"
01:03:29,580;01:03:31,180;"It's not breaking."
01:03:31,180;01:03:31,420;"He just."
01:03:31,420;01:03:32,140;"I'm not going to do it."
01:03:32,140;01:03:33,480;"He's never going to do it in the moment."
01:03:33,480;01:03:35,220;"He's not going to do it to the media."
01:03:35,320;01:03:37,880;"He might be like, he meetings or something, but."
01:03:37,880;01:03:40,560;"Which means he's just feeding you bullshit."
01:03:40,560;01:03:41,320;"That's fine."
01:03:41,320;01:03:42,480;"It's all an act."
01:03:42,480;01:03:42,720;"Yeah."
01:03:42,720;01:03:46,240;"And like this podcast isn't doing the same exact thing."
01:03:46,240;01:03:47,400;"Reading people bullshit."
01:03:47,400;01:03:47,920;"Yes."
01:03:47,920;01:03:50,200;"These are my most authentic takes."
01:03:50,200;01:03:51,280;"See."
01:03:51,280;01:03:52,160;"Which are bullshit."
01:03:52,160;01:03:52,720;"I'm not saying--"
01:03:52,720;01:03:54,080;"Well, no, they're tall."
01:03:54,080;01:03:55,740;"But that's how you know they're authentic"
01:03:55,740;01:03:57,520;"is because they're clearly not thought out."
01:03:57,520;01:03:58,640;"They're just like off--"
01:03:58,640;01:04:01,800;"What are my emotions are telling me at this moment?"
01:04:01,800;01:04:04,280;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:04,280;01:04:07,200;"All right. So what do you have to look forward to next week?"
01:04:07,200;01:04:10,040;"Well, do we have any quotes from Belt Bledsoe after the game?"
01:04:10,040;01:04:12,480;"Yeah, he ran the wrong way."
01:04:12,480;01:04:15,880;"That was during the game, but yeah, well, you know, it's close enough."
01:04:15,880;01:04:16,880;"Here we go. I got one."
01:04:16,880;01:04:18,080;"Yeah. OK."
01:04:18,080;01:04:19,280;"Yeah, Bledsoe."
01:04:19,280;01:04:21,880;"It said Bledsoe seemed at a loss."
01:04:21,880;01:04:25,360;"I was sitting at my locker for 10 minutes trying to figure it, figure it out."
01:04:25,360;01:04:27,480;"And in the shower, trying to figure it out."
01:04:27,480;01:04:30,360;"What can I do to make a change?"
01:04:30,360;01:04:32,880;"We're making mistakes at the wrong time,"
01:04:32,880;01:04:34,680;"especially against the defending world chance,"
01:04:34,680;01:04:37,020;"you can't make mistakes like that."
01:04:37,020;01:04:38,960;"- I do a lot of my thinking in the shower too."
01:04:38,960;01:04:42,560;"Like if I come up with a lot of these stupid ideas"
01:04:42,560;01:04:44,200;"for this podcast in the shower."
01:04:44,200;01:04:48,080;"So I'm thinking about you boys while I'm naked"
01:04:48,080;01:04:49,720;"and what, just so you know?"
01:04:49,720;01:04:50,880;"- No."
01:04:50,880;01:04:51,720;"- You're welcome."
01:04:51,720;01:04:52,960;"- Play that naughty boy thing, naughty."
01:04:52,960;01:04:54,320;"- Naughty boy."
01:04:54,320;01:04:57,680;"- Sometimes a naughty boy, very naughty."
01:04:57,680;01:04:58,520;"Yes."
01:04:58,520;01:05:00,080;"(laughing)"
01:05:00,080;01:05:01,160;"- You're welcome."
01:05:01,160;01:05:02,420;"And that is a sad Ramon."
01:05:02,420;01:05:07,720;"All those feel appropriate for that."
01:05:07,720;01:05:09,080;"I need a door closing one."
01:05:09,080;01:05:12,200;"So I quit this podcast again every episode."
01:05:12,200;01:05:15,960;"Oh, my goodness."
01:05:15,960;01:05:17,480;"All right."
01:05:17,480;01:05:19,720;"Uh, so next week."
01:05:19,720;01:05:22,760;"Patience will be playing."
01:05:22,760;01:05:27,880;"Uh, so they have the chance to break the record of the 1972 dolphins"
01:05:27,920;01:05:31,800;"against the 2004 Dolphins."
01:05:31,800;01:05:34,100;"I don't know if the game is home or away"
01:05:34,100;01:05:35,600;"because I don't have that in front of me."
01:05:35,600;01:05:38,880;"But it doesn't really matter because who the fuck cares?"
01:05:38,880;01:05:40,360;"It's the Miami fucking Dolphins."
01:05:40,360;01:05:41,200;"- I don't know when."
01:05:41,200;01:05:42,280;"- I guess we win."
01:05:42,280;01:05:44,680;"- Yeah, it is at home against the Dolphins."
01:05:44,680;01:05:46,200;"The open for Miami Dolphins."
01:05:46,200;01:05:48,440;"This is not a good year for the AFC East,"
01:05:48,440;01:05:50,880;"it doesn't seem like, except these new Patriots."
01:05:50,880;01:05:56,880;"I'm curious to know actually how the 2004 AFC East did."
01:05:57,840;01:05:58,680;"Not bad."
01:05:58,680;01:05:59,600;"The bills actually--"
01:05:59,600;01:06:01,000;"The cover that's on the Dop and Game Andy,"
01:06:01,000;01:06:02,040;"let's save this for next."
01:06:02,040;01:06:04,400;"The bills, I'll just tell you this."
01:06:04,400;01:06:08,040;"The bills this season, finished 9 and 7."
01:06:08,040;01:06:08,920;"9 and 7?"
01:06:08,920;01:06:10,040;"9 and 7."
01:06:10,040;01:06:11,440;"So they're just like, oh, 3."
01:06:11,440;01:06:14,760;"So wait a turn it around."
01:06:14,760;01:06:16,920;"They went 9 and 4 from here on out."
01:06:16,920;01:06:18,400;"Yeah."
01:06:18,400;01:06:20,240;"And Bloodsoe started every game."
01:06:20,240;01:06:21,760;"They didn't last here."
01:06:21,760;01:06:27,040;"They could have been 10 and 6 if they hadn't gone off sides"
01:06:27,040;01:06:31,320;"in a field goal attempt and then stumbled in the hole on third and two."
01:06:31,320;01:06:33,720;"It calls the timeout and then not blocked the microwave."
01:06:33,720;01:06:38,880;"I'm just looking at their Wikipedia from 0 4."
01:06:38,880;01:06:44,280;"Buffalo needed a win in the final game of the season against Steelers to qualify"
01:06:44,280;01:06:45,600;"for players playoffs."
01:06:45,600;01:06:48,560;"However, despite the Steelers playing their third stringers,"
01:06:48,560;01:06:52,520;"Buffalo lost and subsequently missed the playoffs."
01:06:52,520;01:06:53,960;"Darn it."
01:06:53,960;01:06:56,200;"Oh, you."
01:06:56,200;01:06:58,360;"Oh, let's go."
01:06:58,360;01:07:02,400;"So close as always."
01:07:02,400;01:07:04,360;"So close."
01:07:04,360;01:07:10,240;"According to football outsiders who has tracked every play in the NFL since early"
01:07:10,240;01:07:17,520;"1990s, the 2004 Bills are statistically the best NFL team in their record keeping"
01:07:17,520;01:07:20,920;"history to have failed to qualify for the playoffs."
01:07:20,920;01:07:22,320;"Isn't that ridiculous?"
01:07:22,320;01:07:25,280;"That's a fucking Bill stat right there, baby."
01:07:25,600;01:07:28,160;"That is the ultimate bills being bills."
01:07:28,160;01:07:29,640;"It really is."
01:07:29,640;01:07:31,560;"God."
01:07:31,560;01:07:32,360;"Not bad."
01:07:32,360;01:07:34,320;"I can't wait to see him again this year."
01:07:34,320;01:07:35,080;"Yeah."
01:07:35,080;01:07:37,840;"I think, yeah."
01:07:37,840;01:07:40,280;"That's very true, because they'll get better."
01:07:40,280;01:07:42,560;"We'll see what happens in Gillette."
01:07:42,560;01:07:44,120;"They were one in five."
01:07:44,120;01:07:44,600;"Yeah."
01:07:44,600;01:07:47,040;"And they were one in five."
01:07:47,040;01:07:49,960;"And then they would win every game,"
01:07:49,960;01:07:51,880;"except for the one against the Patriots."
01:07:51,880;01:07:53,680;"And so it's 17."
01:07:53,680;01:07:54,880;"And then--"
01:07:54,880;01:07:56,880;"It's just a see"
01:07:56,880;01:08:04,640;"Yeah, 14 to one at that point they were on a 60 or a six game win streak going to that game in week 17"
01:08:04,640;01:08:07,600;"What where was it in Pittsburgh or?"
01:08:07,600;01:08:13,760;"No in Buffalo. Oh, that's even worse losing that game at home. Yeah, oh"
01:08:13,760;01:08:21,960;"I can't wait. I can't wait. Yeah, I'm gonna go down that rabbit hole. This is gonna be a great"
01:08:23,040;01:08:28,040;"This is one of I think this is the best season that I don't remember. Yeah, I feel like I remember all the other"
01:08:28,040;01:08:32,480;"See but this one like because they just kept winning so much. You just kind of like oh, yeah"
01:08:32,480;01:08:39,000;"This is just what happens out here fatigued. This is our life. Yeah, which is probably like the it's probably similar to"
01:08:39,000;01:08:44,600;"Like a Cleveland Browns team going four and twelve, you know, like oh, yeah, this is just our life now"
01:08:44,600;01:08:46,240;"This is we always lose"
01:08:46,240;01:08:48,240;"And so they all kind of blend together and this one's"
01:08:48,240;01:08:51,920;"Blended over the years into the other seasons"
01:08:52,680;01:08:55,320;"But alright, um,"
01:08:55,320;01:08:58,120;"boys have anything else for this?"
01:08:58,120;01:09:00,640;"No, no, no, check out the new website."
01:09:00,640;01:09:03,880;"Uh, yeah, that's all I got."
01:09:03,880;01:09:06,040;"We'll see you, uh, we'll see you next week."
01:09:06,040;01:09:08,360;"As the pages try to break the, uh,"
01:09:08,360;01:09:11,200;"the record from those wins in a row."
01:09:11,200;01:09:15,640;"Arguably, the hardest record in the NFL to break."
01:09:15,640;01:09:19,120;"Uh, so until then, we will see you later."
01:09:19,120;01:09:24,480;"See you later."

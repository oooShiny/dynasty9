00:06,840;00:08,280;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,280;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:14,320;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,320;00:15,560;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,560;00:16,560;"Go right ahead."
00:16,560;00:18,880;"I am not your mother."
00:18,880;00:25,520;"Welcome back everybody."
00:25,520;00:32,560;"Taking some dynasty podcast getting close to the end of the 2002 season on week 15 as we travel to"
00:32,560;00:35,120;"I don't know where in Tennessee is it?"
00:35,120;00:36,000;"Nashville?"
00:36,000;00:41,280;"It is. Yeah, it's got to be Nashville. You boys have you boys have been I have not"
00:41,280;00:45,760;"The Nashville, Tennessee to face the eight and five"
00:45,760;00:49,640;"Tennessee Titans"
00:49,920;00:53,720;"The Patriots also eight and five so this is a game that means a lot in the playoffs"
00:53,720;00:58,320;"And we will come across that soon enough at least for the Patriots"
00:58,320;01:01,440;"But before we get stuck in"
01:01,440;01:03,920;"Steve Brown would you like to introduce your guest?"
01:03,920;01:09,120;"Yeah, we have Scott joining us not because he's a Titan spin though just because"
01:09,120;01:18,040;"You heard how awesome Trevor had here. So here he is. I heard Trevor on I got really jealous felt like I needed to one up them"
01:18,880;01:25,380;"We'll see how it goes, but I was also kind of a Titans fan just because they had like a cool logo"
01:25,380;01:31,120;"Yeah, and cool. So was Steve actually is I could draw the logo really well"
01:31,120;01:34,880;"To draw because like I'm a child"
01:34,880;01:40,800;"It was like a team, but it was also like a sword. It was super cool to draw and I had like playing the shit off it"
01:40,800;01:45,880;"That's flames. I just thought it was a tea with like some stars around it as I'm sure now"
01:45,880;01:48,480;"And then I had a circle had like the red and blue flames coming off it"
01:48,480;01:51,120;"I was really good at drawing the Falcons logo"
01:51,120;01:56,120;"Because it was like a straight line at the top and then a curve at the bottom. It was super easy"
01:56,120;01:59,560;"Yeah, it's a good one to fucked up with an impossible to draw"
01:59,560;02:05,280;"Impossible the new one's not that bad. It's easy. I don't know. I'm terrible at that"
02:05,280;02:09,080;"I've had a lot of practice I bet Greg can draw it. I"
02:09,080;02:13,120;"Mean it's tough to make it look like it's supposed to look"
02:14,600;02:18,940;"Yeah, I'm a couple of them out and but like it still comes out where we're looking"
02:18,940;02:25,520;"Because I'm a terrible drawer. That's why I like the Titans one. It's just a tea. It's just straight lines and shit"
02:25,520;02:32,400;"It's easy. It was a super downgrade from the Oilers though those old Oilers jerseys and helmets are so sweet the color"
02:32,400;02:37,040;"Yeah, I feel like those helmets were up there with the old Patriots helmets"
02:37,040;02:41,160;"Like it just screams old school. Yeah, I agree"
02:41,160;02:47,000;"I was just a fan of the baby blue on the Titans, you know, it's nice. It's like the Chargers baby blue. Yeah"
02:47,000;02:53,320;"I think it's better than what the charges are wearing now. Have you seen this here with those like knee-on-yellow fans?"
02:53,320;02:56,120;"It's like if Steve had designed a uniform"
02:56,120;03:02,200;"Titan's kind of a shitty name, you know, like does it even have any relevance to Tennessee?"
03:02,200;03:10,440;"Probably not. Maybe they're the Titans of industry. It's super scary though. Well, didn't Chris Burman who wanted to be the"
03:10,440;03:15,180;"Tennessee tuxedos which would have been fucking cool."
03:15,180;03:16,820;"- Yeah, sick."
03:16,820;03:17,660;"- Sick."
03:17,660;03:21,220;"- It's like, yeah, just like black everywhere except for like the"
03:21,220;03:24,660;"front like chess piece would be white."
03:24,660;03:26,140;"Well, bow tie at the top."
03:26,140;03:27,440;"- Bow ties."
03:27,440;03:30,060;"God, that is sweet."
03:30,060;03:31,060;"- That would be so sweet."
03:31,060;03:33,500;"- I feel like it would look kind of soft though, you know,"
03:33,500;03:35,580;"just like guys out there and fake tuxedo."
03:35,580;03:37,100;"- You look like a gentleman."
03:37,100;03:39,020;"- Everyone looks great at the--"
03:39,020;03:41,600;"Is a gentleman like are you scared of a gentleman now?"
03:41,600;03:44,000;"I feel like you look at someone in a tuxedo."
03:44,000;03:45,440;"You feel like you can fuck them up."
03:45,440;03:46,440;"No, you break."
03:46,440;03:47,440;"Yeah."
03:47,440;03:48,720;"Yeah, say that to James Bond."
03:48,720;03:49,400;"Yeah, you're right."
03:49,400;03:50,000;"You're right."
03:50,000;03:50,360;"Sorry."
03:50,360;03:51,920;"I take it back."
03:51,920;03:54,360;"But this was not the Tennessee tuxedos."
03:54,360;03:57,560;"This is the Tennessee Titans, unfortunately."
03:57,560;03:59,960;"And unfortunately, they kicked their shit out"
03:59,960;04:01,640;"of the Patriots in this game."
04:01,640;04:02,320;"We lost."
04:02,320;04:03,800;"We start with a score."
04:03,800;04:04,720;"Yeah, they're lost."
04:04,720;04:05,640;"Damn."
04:05,640;04:06,760;"Thanks for coming, Greg."
04:06,760;04:07,960;"They lost 24/7."
04:07,960;04:14,400;"There were no highlights for this game awful good if someone shit. That's why that's how bad it was there were no highlights"
04:14,400;04:19,080;"Yeah, yeah, they were actually I literally couldn't find any highlights except for one guy"
04:19,080;04:22,920;"Who was I think some like Titans historian or something like that?"
04:22,920;04:29,080;"You had like a minute 52 clip of the pick six and that was at the time ready through"
04:29,080;04:37,160;"All right, this is a hard all for my party. I really really regret coming on this episode. Yeah, this is not a great episode"
04:37,160;04:38,560;"Did you actually watch the game?"
04:38,560;04:44,460;"I actually watched the game. I was like I'm gonna be all in on this and then I watch I look at the score"
04:44,460;04:46,060;"And I'm like fuck"
04:46,060;04:51,540;"I already made a mistake and then I watched the first half and I'm like this is just the fucking worst this game sucks"
04:51,540;04:56,000;"You watch first half you like how can I get worse and then it does yeah, and then you watch the second half"
04:56,000;05:01,800;"So yeah, so let's do the watchability score on a six-long party Steve. I think I heard you say you gave it a one"
05:01,800;05:04,800;"Yeah, it was final scores. What was it 24?"
05:06,440;05:13,040;"And it wasn't that close. It wasn't that we should have been the Titans were running clock basically halfway through the third quarter"
05:13,040;05:17,080;"After Brady through the pick six. Yeah"
05:17,080;05:22,760;"It was a microcosm of the entire season where the Patriots couldn't stop the run"
05:22,760;05:27,340;"Couldn't actually run the ball and then just like gave up on it completely. I think"
05:27,340;05:30,160;"Greg do you have the stats there?"
05:30,160;05:32,480;"Let's see"
05:33,680;05:42,440;"Rushing yards forward against well George had a hundred yards to the ground with another 50 from McNair"
05:42,440;05:47,480;"Oh another 80 85 from Robert Holcomb right so"
05:47,480;05:50,360;"Tennessee got"
05:50,360;05:52,280;"238 rushing yards the patrons had 56"
05:52,280;05:59,880;"Yeah, kind of those were from top though because Eddie George had 31 rushes. Yeah, a hundred yards 31"
06:00,880;06:04,880;"Like, uh, like, Garrett Blunt, but without like Garrett Blunt,"
06:04,880;06:05,880;"making a big run."
06:05,880;06:07,480;"And I'll just three yards fall over."
06:07,480;06:08,980;"Yeah, it was not good."
06:08,980;06:10,960;"The average three yards."
06:10,960;06:14,480;"And I felt like every single run he had was also three yards."
06:14,480;06:15,880;"Yeah."
06:15,880;06:18,880;"Except for that, we had one that was 15."
06:18,880;06:21,320;"And then everything else was literally three yards of care."
06:21,320;06:24,360;"Yeah."
06:24,360;06:26,440;"This is 2002, huh?"
06:26,440;06:27,520;"Yeah."
06:27,560;06:33,320;"120 passing yards to the Patriots and 127 for the Titans. Yeah"
06:33,320;06:37,820;"That's what I'm saying. I knew that I looked that up at a time"
06:37,820;06:41,560;"Yeah, yeah, I didn't say anything Steve"
06:41,560;06:46,320;"Like how bad is it really and it was it was that bad so yeah, I give it I"
06:46,320;06:51,000;"Mean this is probably I'd say the worst loss we've seen so far"
06:51,000;06:53,620;"I mean there's been some dolphins ones that were brutal, but this is"
06:54,560;06:59,560;"score wise. Like the pages don't lose this big. Really ever."
06:59,560;07:04,640;"So I felt like it was much worse than the score as well, just because like I said,"
07:04,640;07:08,480;"they seemed like they were just running out the clock the entire game."
07:08,480;07:11,680;"They just ran the ball over and over again and we couldn't stop them."
07:11,680;07:15,080;"And if they tried to pass it, uh,"
07:15,080;07:19,400;"McNair would drop back to pass and then the field would open up in the middle and"
07:19,400;07:21,240;"he'd just like, it wasn't even running."
07:21,240;07:23,560;"He was more like limping for 10 yards a pop."
07:23,560;07:30,040;"Yeah, he was although I mean the first maybe watch the first 10 minutes of it because"
07:30,040;07:33,440;"There's some awesome names in there. Oh, yeah"
07:33,440;07:38,800;"Those I didn't come back again later, but there's so many good players that you're like oh shit. I remember him"
07:38,800;07:43,740;"I remember him. Yeah, I think I see the Titans next year. Let's let's get in this Titans team"
07:43,740;07:47,320;"They would finish the season 11 and 5"
07:47,320;07:50,900;"First in the AFC South the vaunted AFC South"
07:52,920;07:57,420;"They would beat the Steelers in overtime in a shootout 34 31 in the divisional and"
07:57,420;08:02,200;"Lose they get their doors blown off by the Raiders who would you know go to the Super Bowl?"
08:02,200;08:07,560;"2441 not great. Yeah, and this was Jeff Fisher though"
08:07,560;08:11,360;"Which it was this guy was surprising"
08:11,360;08:15,720;"To see Jeff Fisher beat the Patriots because this was literally his only"
08:15,720;08:21,620;"Time he did it in the seven games that he played. Can we get his record against the Patriots because"
08:22,280;08:26,160;"Yeah, he was six and one but no the Patrets were six and one against Jeff"
08:26,160;08:31,200;"I thought it'd be more around 500"
08:31,200;08:34,600;"Not against it's a Patriots"
08:34,600;08:43,560;"Everybody overall, but they were they were rolling coming to this game, right? They started one in four. Yeah, so they kind of mirrored the Patriots season where"
08:43,560;08:51,640;"They won their first game that lost four in a row so the Patriots won their first two games in lost four in a row and then they won"
08:51,640;08:56,980;"I think it was coming into like six of the last seven or something like that to get to eight and five and"
08:56,980;08:59,540;"The pages, you know, it kind of did the same sort of thing"
08:59,540;09:01,700;"so"
09:01,700;09:04,140;"They were kind of mirror images, but I think I"
09:04,140;09:07,060;"don't know why but it seemed like the"
09:07,060;09:10,300;"Titans were more legit"
09:10,300;09:14,860;"Eight and five in the Patriots were because even in like these wins that we've seen this year and they haven't been particularly"
09:14,860;09:17,300;"Like dominant in any fashion"
09:17,540;09:21,640;"They've just they've been winning, but they've been kind of like boring wins like we talked last week"
09:21,640;09:25,160;"Yeah, yeah that game in Chicago is really boring Andy"
09:25,160;09:31,540;"Guys in Chiefs snoozer"
09:31,540;09:41,380;"Talking about since those now you're talking about the podcast that we're recording based on the season. That's what's boring. I"
09:41,380;09:44,420;"Just agree"
09:45,380;09:53,140;"Well, this is a legit team though. I mean there what two years three years removed from their Super Bowl, right? Correct. 1999"
09:53,140;09:54,740;"Yeah"
09:54,740;09:58,900;"So they went through they went 13 and three for 1999 and 2000"
09:58,900;10:06,140;"And a lot of those guys are still on this team. Yeah, but they're they're kind of starting to break down now"
10:06,140;10:09,380;"Like we're talking about McNair. He they were talking about"
10:09,380;10:13,620;"No, this was an Michael's and John Madden first of all amazing"
10:13,900;10:15,900;"But they were talking about how"
10:15,900;10:18,180;"McNair didn't practice during the week"
10:18,180;10:26,220;"Yeah for like the last six or something. He just gave up on practicing. Yeah, he just shows up on game day and fucking slings it"
10:26,220;10:32,320;"Classic steeping there though. He did that forever. Yeah, cuz they showed some like"
10:32,320;10:37,840;"infographic of like all the injuries he'd had over the years. It's like oh he has a"
10:37,840;10:41,880;"Bad tone. He's got a bad knee and he's got a bad shoulder. He's got a bad ribs"
10:41,880;10:49,160;"He's got a bad other shoulder and they just on and on like every single year. He was just like dragging his ass"
10:49,160;10:51,720;"Through the season"
10:51,720;10:58,600;"But doesn't go to win an MVP after this in like two years remember when Patriots beat the co-MVPs manning"
10:58,600;11:03,560;"And I was next year. I want me to want to get into Steve McNair. I got a lot. Yeah"
11:03,560;11:10,520;"For sure. See McNair. I got a lot of notes. I watched his a football life Steve McNair. He's the man"
11:10,520;11:11,520;"Nice."
11:11,520;11:13,120;"He is the man."
11:13,120;11:15,280;"So let's start at the beginning here."
11:15,280;11:18,040;"He's a country boy through and through."
11:18,040;11:21,160;"He's from Mount Olive, Mississippi."
11:21,160;11:24,560;"So he's super talented."
11:24,560;11:25,560;"He gets it."
11:25,560;11:28,280;"He was drafted by the Mariners out of high school."
11:28,280;11:35,080;"He got offered a full boat to play at Florida, but they wanted to play like defensive back."
11:35,080;11:40,400;"So he said no, and he went to Alcorn State, which is a..."
11:40,400;11:45,400;"in Mississippi, it's in HBCU, and it's also Division 1 AA."
11:45,400;11:49,560;"- So basically, you are in the age of Mississippi."
11:49,560;11:51,400;"- Dude, and yeah."
11:51,400;11:53,240;"(laughing)"
11:53,240;11:55,920;"He fucking dominated."
11:55,920;11:58,800;"I can't remember who's stats we were talking about last week,"
11:58,800;12:02,280;"but his senior year stats at Alcorn State,"
12:02,280;12:08,480;"he had combined yardage on the ground and through the air."
12:08,480;12:13,480;"He had 6,281 yards and 56 touchdowns in 11 games."
12:13,480;12:17,480;"- 11 games?"
12:17,480;12:21,280;"- He was averaging 570 yards of offensive game"
12:21,280;12:22,640;"and five touchdowns."
12:22,640;12:26,040;"- Holy shit."
12:26,040;12:28,040;"- Like a holy crap."
12:28,040;12:31,280;"- You should look up his college highlights there."
12:31,280;12:33,160;"- Does he have college highlights?"
12:33,160;12:34,160;"- Mm-hmm."
12:34,160;12:35,000;"- Oh fuck yeah."
12:35,000;12:37,040;"- Dude he was a thick boy too."
12:37,040;12:39,640;"They kept mentioning it in the football life."
12:39,640;12:40,880;"There was-- - They mentioned the game"
12:40,880;12:41,720;"all the time too, yeah."
12:41,720;12:42,560;"- Yeah, like a lot of them."
12:42,560;12:44,320;"(laughing)"
12:44,320;12:48,840;"- Dude, he actually came third in Heisman voting."
12:48,840;12:50,200;"- At Alcorn State."
12:50,200;12:51,760;"- Yep, that's the same."
12:51,760;12:55,140;"- It's tied for the highest ever,"
12:55,140;12:58,000;"like, finish for a one-double-A player."
12:58,000;12:59,280;"- Holy shit."
12:59,280;13:02,160;"- Did he run a bunch in college too,"
13:02,160;13:04,840;"or did he kind of pick that up in NFL?"
13:04,840;13:07,160;"I think he did run a bunch in college."
13:07,160;13:09,840;"I want to, I mean, not like everyone."
13:09,840;13:12,280;"Yeah, he goes like 5,000 through the air"
13:12,280;13:15,440;"and 1,000 on the ground in 11 games."
13:15,440;13:17,040;"That's insane."
13:17,040;13:19,160;"I have a hard time doing that in Madden on easy."
13:19,160;13:22,600;"He was a thick boy though, you know?"
13:22,600;13:28,560;"So he, there was a great story from when he was like"
13:28,560;13:30,560;"at college and they were talking about"
13:30,560;13:33,440;"how he hated lifting weights"
13:33,440;13:35,780;"And the strength coach was like,"
13:35,780;13:38,840;"I said that if he could go over there"
13:38,840;13:42,640;"and bench press 260 10 times,"
13:42,640;13:45,080;"he wouldn't have to work out for the year."
13:45,080;13:46,840;"And he said he just went over, knocked it out,"
13:46,840;13:49,160;"and then went, took a nap in the weight room."
13:49,160;13:51,420;"(laughing)"
13:51,420;13:53,360;"- Bad ass."
13:53,360;13:54,760;"- Yeah, that's what I got."
13:54,760;13:56,400;"- It's incredible. - I got a problem, yeah."
13:56,400;14:01,120;"- So then he, so he has a really successful senior year,"
14:01,120;14:03,120;"and he's pretty highly touted coming out of there."
14:03,120;14:08,120;"So 1995 draft, he's picked third overall by the Houston Oilers."
14:08,120;14:13,100;"He's the highest drafted African American quarterback"
14:13,100;14:15,100;"at the time, which I thought was pretty interesting."
14:15,100;14:16,780;"- Wait, when did he get drafted?"
14:16,780;14:18,100;"- '95."
14:18,100;14:18,940;"- Wow."
14:18,940;14:23,620;"- So he's like, I looked it up in the names you'd recognize,"
14:23,620;14:26,220;"the form like Cunningham and War Moon."
14:26,220;14:29,060;"Those are the guys that kind of like set the standard, I think."
14:29,060;14:29,900;"- Yeah, I'm awesome."
14:29,900;14:32,980;"- But he was the first ever MVP, like Steve was saying,"
14:32,980;14:35,180;"He was the first ever black MVP,"
14:35,180;14:37,820;"second ever black quarterback"
14:37,820;14:38,940;"to starting a Super Bowl."
14:38,940;14:39,980;"Can you name the first?"
14:39,980;14:42,660;"- Doug Williams."
14:42,660;14:43,780;"- Nice, Andy."
14:43,780;14:44,780;"- Wow."
14:44,780;14:45,620;"- Nicely done."
14:45,620;14:46,460;"- Nailed that."
14:46,460;14:48,060;"- 1988."
14:48,060;14:49,100;"- Yeah, Redskins."
14:49,100;14:49,940;"- Yeah."
14:49,940;14:51,620;"- He's got no reason to name."
14:51,620;14:54,860;"- So I mean, he took him a little while to get,"
14:54,860;14:56,620;"like, the win the starting job."
14:56,620;14:58,940;"By the time they went to Tennessee,"
14:58,940;15:00,780;"that's when he started really picking it up."
15:00,780;15:03,580;"So I think that was 99, I believe."
15:03,580;15:04,420;"- Yeah."
15:04,420;15:06,220;"- And that was the year they went to the Super Bowl,"
15:06,220;15:08,140;"they had the music, steady miracle,"
15:08,140;15:08,980;"- Oh, right."
15:08,980;15:09,820;"- They had the Pro Bowl, so that,"
15:09,820;15:12,020;"they went 13 and three that year."
15:12,020;15:15,820;"So 2000 to 2005 is really is like hey day."
15:15,820;15:18,020;"So we're kind of in the midst of it here."
15:18,020;15:19,140;"- Yeah, no kidding."
15:19,140;15:22,500;"- Yeah, he won the MVP in 2003 with Manning."
15:22,500;15:23,340;"- That's nice."
15:23,340;15:28,300;"- There was more people talking about him napping."
15:28,300;15:30,220;"He loved taking naps apparently."
15:30,220;15:32,220;"I"
15:32,220;15:41,280;"Fisher that said like he used to nap before every practice in every game and that if he didn't get his nap in he'd play really poorly"
15:41,280;15:47,020;"He's like all grumpy and shit cuz he"
15:47,020;15:54,900;"Beds in the locker room just for him dude, I don't know"
15:58,700;16:02,400;"He's just a country boy, you know, you just like take a snooze forever"
16:02,400;16:07,180;"Did you go play for bar after let me think a little nap"
16:07,180;16:16,140;"Yeah, so he ends up he it sounded like kind of a sour ending in Tennessee they drafted Vince young now"
16:16,140;16:18,140;"It was just replacement. All right"
16:18,140;16:21,260;"So they traded him to the Ravens"
16:21,260;16:27,020;"Yeah, he actually went 13 and 3 with the Ravens in 06. That's right and"
16:27,700;16:31,540;"Then after that he kind of tailed off and then he retired like two years later"
16:31,540;16:36,100;"And then if you remember he actually was murdered"
16:36,100;16:45,240;"A little while ago. Did you know that? I thought I thought it was a something else. Yeah, it was a murder suicide"
16:45,240;16:46,680;"so oh"
16:46,680;16:49,740;"It was one of his mistresses, right?"
16:49,740;16:51,980;"It's like"
16:51,980;16:53,980;"It's this 20 year old"
16:54,860;16:58,240;"Iranian bartender at David Buster"
16:58,240;17:08,580;"This back check it did so hell Kazimi"
17:08,580;17:13,940;"So she's his mistress and I guess"
17:13,940;17:18,860;"What they think happened was she saw his other mistress"
17:19,660;17:23,740;"Leaving there his like he had like a separate apartment where he like took"
17:23,740;17:26,940;"Women back to I guess that his wife didn't know about"
17:26,940;17:31,020;"Okay, so he went there one night and"
17:31,020;17:34,220;"basically she"
17:34,220;17:37,860;"Shot him three times and then shot herself in the head"
17:37,860;17:42,060;"At the apartment shit. That's super sad. Yeah"
17:42,060;17:48,880;"Yeah, I mean it's fuck. I mean it's one of those things right this is a lot of like conspiracy"
17:48,880;17:55,840;"she sure shit floating around about it. But it seems pretty cut and dry. I mean, she was"
17:55,840;18:01,920;"going through like issues with money. And then she saw the other chick. She was, I think,"
18:01,920;18:10,080;"a bit. I mean, she's Iranian. So how many Iranian listeners do we have?"
18:10,080;18:16,080;"And if you think no offense I ran at all, it's fine. We love you guys. Hopefully none right now."
18:18,560;18:22,800;"So yeah, a tragic ending, but a pretty sick career."
18:22,800;18:25,920;"And like there's all sorts of cool stuff he did with like,"
18:25,920;18:29,360;"they said he had like a football camp in the south"
18:29,360;18:32,240;"where he had like 11,000 kids come through the camp"
18:32,240;18:34,280;"and not a single, it was completely free"
18:34,280;18:35,600;"for every single person."
18:35,600;18:38,880;"And like Cam Newton went there, Vince Young went there."
18:38,880;18:41,760;"So like some pretty big names went through his football camp."
18:41,760;18:42,360;"Yeah."
18:42,360;18:42,760;"That's good."
18:42,760;18:43,760;"That's sweet."
18:43,760;18:45,440;"Yeah."
18:45,440;18:47,720;"Another one of the reasons I actually liked the Titans"
18:47,720;18:50,160;"because they had Steve McNair and he was like,"
18:50,160;18:52,920;"he was like the original like Deshawn Watson."
18:52,920;18:54,640;"Like, no, I think I got a good comp."
18:54,640;18:56,240;"It's Ben Rothaceberger."
18:56,240;18:59,920;"- Oh, you have to cap that up the dog."
18:59,920;19:01,680;"- He's more athletic than Dan."
19:01,680;19:03,000;"- Definitely more athletic."
19:03,000;19:05,720;"- He also, Ben also always seems to be hurt."
19:05,720;19:08,520;"I'm like skipping a ton of practices and playing."
19:08,520;19:10,360;"You know, Ben's a tough son of a bitch."
19:10,360;19:11,280;"- That's true."
19:11,280;19:12,120;"- Yeah."
19:12,120;19:12,960;"- And he's like, he can run pretty well"
19:12,960;19:14,200;"and he's tough to bring down."
19:14,200;19:15,600;"- He's tough to bring down for sure."
19:15,600;19:17,520;"- In his game, he had that touchdown run"
19:17,520;19:21,560;"where he broke that guy and then just with Tyler."
19:21,560;19:23,320;"I just threw right through."
19:23,320;19:28,160;"I went to the meet with the goal line and he just ran over him and he got like ping pong"
19:28,160;19:30,520;"with another safety coming across."
19:30,520;19:33,480;"It was a fucking grit tee run."
19:33,480;19:35,080;"He had that fourth goal."
19:35,080;19:36,080;"QB sneak."
19:36,080;19:37,080;"Yep."
19:37,080;19:40,560;"He was a pure grit."
19:40,560;19:43,200;"I love how he's just like a country strong boy too."
19:43,200;19:44,920;"I need to meet somebody like that."
19:44,920;19:45,920;"You know?"
19:45,920;19:47,480;"Don't you live in North Carolina?"
19:47,480;19:53,320;"Yeah, but that's not really country, you know, I mean they can't be too far from there. Not"
19:53,320;19:57,000;"I'm talking like Louisiana"
19:57,000;19:59,480;"Yeah"
19:59,480;20:06,200;"He opened like a crawfish restaurant to in Nashville like, you know, just super southern shit. That's what that's the thing. I need"
20:06,200;20:11,960;"Was this stadium the same one that we went to Greg? I didn't know if they built a new one"
20:11,960;20:15,200;"Yeah, it's the same same. It's a different name"
20:15,200;20:20,360;"It was a Delphi a Delphia Colesthem. So they built it when they moved"
20:20,360;20:23,900;"All right in 1999 I believe I"
20:23,900;20:26,600;"Think it's gonna be better now though"
20:26,600;20:30,040;"Because there was a shit on a talk in this game about how"
20:30,040;20:36,200;"God awful the grass was really basically they only replaced the turf between the numbers"
20:36,200;20:43,120;"So there's a strip of like actual grass and the rest of it was they literally called a painted dirt because they were spray painting the sidelines"
20:43,280;20:46,980;"Because you couldn't actually see where it was. There's a bunch of guys like stepping out of bounds"
20:46,980;20:52,000;"Like trying to catch your pass because they didn't know they were out of bounds because you couldn't actually see where the line was"
20:52,000;20:55,600;"Hmm and Bellacie back was for the game had like yeah"
20:55,600;20:59,440;"He made them like repaint it to make it more obvious and it still didn't work"
20:59,440;21:03,680;"Yeah, they showed a clip of him before the game like pointing at the sideline like hey"
21:03,680;21:08,920;"We need to paint this spot right here. This is gonna be an issue and it was yeah"
21:08,920;21:10,920;"multiple time for both teams"
21:10,920;21:18,760;"Yeah, it was bad. He was yeah Madden was like this is all these these teams are like billion dollar industries"
21:18,760;21:24,200;"And they can't afford grass the fuck is this? What are they doing? Are they working on golf courses? This is unacceptable"
21:24,200;21:27,400;"It was awesome"
21:27,400;21:33,320;"Yeah, I enjoy I've forgotten how much I enjoyed Madden did madman. It's a lot of you gets a lot of shit"
21:33,320;21:35,080;"but"
21:35,080;21:40,200;"Like looking back at on what he's talking about now compared to the guys we have today. I think"
21:40,200;21:42,800;"I think I take Madden over any of them."
21:42,800;21:45,640;"- Yeah, did you catch that at the end of the first half"
21:45,640;21:48,120;"when the Patriots had just like a little bit of time out left"
21:48,120;21:50,720;"and like one or two time outs?"
21:50,720;21:52,200;"And they should go for it."
21:52,200;21:53,200;"They need to throw this ball."
21:53,200;21:55,360;"I need to get down the field."
21:55,360;21:56,680;"- He's like, I've learned my lesson."
21:56,680;21:58,160;"- Yeah, yeah."
21:58,160;21:59,160;"I don't know that was hilarious."
21:59,160;22:00,080;"- Yeah, that was great."
22:00,080;22:01,080;"- I've taken shots at himself."
22:01,080;22:01,920;"No, he was great."
22:01,920;22:03,600;"I really enjoyed him."
22:03,600;22:05,600;"- Sad for me that when I hear Madden,"
22:05,600;22:09,640;"I just think of like Frank Caliendo's impression of Madden"
22:09,640;22:13,360;"Every time it's like a sad thing with me."
22:13,360;22:15,480;"I don't even remember the axle, Madden."
22:15,480;22:18,000;"Great impression though."
22:18,000;22:18,920;"He's in all time."
22:18,920;22:20,280;"He is all time."
22:20,280;22:21,120;"He's really good."
22:21,120;22:23,200;"Rewatch these games is giving me a whole new appreciation"
22:23,200;22:24,360;"for his commentary."
22:24,360;22:24,920;"Yeah."
22:24,920;22:27,200;"The only thing I could remember from Madden was like,"
22:27,200;22:29,080;"it was always him doing Cowboys games."
22:29,080;22:31,560;"It was like the only memories I had of John Madden."
22:31,560;22:34,400;"And him saying in the Super Bowl, don't go for it."
22:34,400;22:36,800;"That was like the defining memory for me for Madden."
22:36,800;22:38,600;"Yeah."
22:38,600;22:42,440;"Everybody forgets that he changed this two and a half or two is like, actually, you know, what fuck it. Let's do this."
22:42,440;22:47,120;"I mean, he's just, you know, saying that call it as he sees it, which is pretty sweet, which I like."
22:47,120;22:51,560;"That's how he saw it at that time. And I think we sat on that Super Bowl episode. You can kind of see where he's coming from."
22:51,560;22:53,120;"Oh, absolutely. Yeah."
22:53,120;22:57,280;"Can we talk about his eyebrows for a second? They're incredible."
22:57,280;23:00,440;"They're a different color from his hair. It's insane."
23:00,440;23:02,080;"Which makes sense."
23:02,080;23:06,000;"That's super bushy, too. Incredible."
23:06,000;23:09,320;"Like as a guy with bushy eyebrows, I appreciate his eyebrows."
23:09,320;23:11,520;"You tweeze him."
23:11,520;23:15,080;"I should instead just let him go wild."
23:15,080;23:16,240;"He doesn't get that guy."
23:16,240;23:17,920;"He just like someone's going crazy."
23:17,920;23:19,160;"Yeah."
23:19,160;23:23,800;"You know, you have bushy eyebrows when if you go to like get your haircut"
23:23,800;23:27,040;"and they take the trimmers and the the the cold."
23:27,040;23:28,640;"They do you know how they do it?"
23:28,640;23:29,440;"Like buy your ear."
23:29,440;23:31,080;"They do that on your eyebrows too."
23:31,080;23:31,640;"Like off."
23:31,640;23:34,160;"Yeah, I had to tell the lady, Hey, Hey, what are you doing?"
23:34,160;23:35,240;"Leave the eyebrows."
23:35,320;23:36,960;"She just started buzzing them off."
23:36,960;23:38,640;"They have no better than I do."
23:38,640;23:39,720;"They can do whatever the fuck they want."
23:39,720;23:40,120;"Yeah."
23:40,120;23:42,240;"They are a different color."
23:42,240;23:45,080;"Yeah, they're like a dark brown."
23:45,080;23:46,200;"And he has gray hair."
23:46,200;23:47,160;"It's bizarre."
23:47,160;23:50,600;"He's a he's a rough looking dude."
23:50,600;23:52,560;"Oh, yeah."
23:52,560;23:53,200;"He's good."
23:53,200;23:57,200;"Well, what's the clothes that he's been ridden hard and put away wet?"
23:57,200;24:00,440;"I mean, that's why he didn't like flying."
24:00,440;24:01,640;"Why?"
24:01,640;24:03,320;"What was that?"
24:03,320;24:04,920;"I think it's a motorcycle thing, but"
24:04,920;24:05,920;"Yeah."
24:05,920;24:11,880;"And written hard and put away what is that specific to him or is that just a phrase you"
24:11,880;24:14,160;"know, that's just a phrase I've heard that phrase."
24:14,160;24:19,560;"I think it's like saddles or something like that, where they're fucking all whether"
24:19,560;24:23,720;"hidden hard and put away what definitely sounds like a sex joke."
24:23,720;24:25,520;"It hasn't been taken care of."
24:25,520;24:29,120;"Okay, it was written hard in this game."
24:29,120;24:32,760;"The Patriots offense by the Titans defense."
24:32,760;24:39,760;"for"
24:39,760;24:40,480;"it's"
24:40,480;24:43,640;"the defense report showing something else but carry"
24:43,640;24:45,840;"garbage"
24:45,840;24:48,840;"that tight is defense had a ton of studs too"
24:48,840;24:49,800;"yeah they did"
24:49,800;24:53,320;"yes and big names on the defense rookie albert hanesworth"
24:53,320;24:54,600;"driven care"
24:54,600;24:57,360;"should we talk about albert hanesworth"
24:57,360;25:00,320;"yet and it's like he's getting a little bit of a loss"
25:00,320;25:02,960;"roughing the passer. Do you see that super dirty roughing the passer?"
25:02,960;25:05,600;"Yeah, it wasn't that dirty, but it was definitely."
25:05,600;25:11,040;"I mean, we've been watching these gays for the last couple of years and it's"
25:11,040;25:14,200;"astounding how few, you know, roughing the passers are."
25:14,200;25:17,480;"Yeah. That now amazing. It definitely is."
25:17,480;25:21,040;"Yeah. Oh, yeah. That would have been in today's NFL."
25:21,040;25:23,800;"But back then, I think it was, I was surprised to see it called."
25:23,800;25:24,200;"Oh, yeah."
25:24,200;25:27,080;"We've seen a break and hit like that before and there's been no flag."
25:28,000;25:31,360;"But I mean, with what we know about Albert Haynesworth now, I'd say it's"
25:31,360;25:33,280;"deserved, even though it wasn't the time."
25:33,280;25:36,900;"Maybe they just encouraged him to be who he is today by calling a"
25:36,900;25:38,680;"foul on him on the soft one early."
25:38,680;25:39,640;"Yeah."
25:39,640;25:40,000;"What do you know?"
25:40,000;25:41,320;"What do we know about him now?"
25:41,320;25:49,120;"Well, we know that he's six, five 317 pounds."
25:49,120;25:50,680;"I can run a 48 to 40."
25:50,680;25:54,880;"That's pretty quick, which is fucking bananas, considering Tom Brady"
25:54,880;25:55,880;"ran a five to eight."
25:57,480;26:00,660;"So you're in a four eight four eight"
26:00,660;26:08,600;"three seventeen apparently so absolutely fucking monster of a man but uh and"
26:08,600;26:13,540;"According to Wikipedia and it's in an incident foreshadowing future incidents with Hanesworth"
26:13,540;26:16,180;"occurred at the Titans training camp in 2003"
26:16,180;26:22,940;"Where Hanesworth kicked his former teammate centered Justin Hartwig in the chest and had to be restrained by other teammates"
26:22,940;26:26,700;"So started our victim in the chest, huh?"
26:27,180;26:32,260;"Was that like a standing kick to the chest? Was he sitting down like cuz if it's a standing"
26:32,260;26:34,180;"kick to the chest that's impressive."
26:34,180;26:39,780;"Yeah, I don't know if I mean he can run fast, but I don't think Hamesworth is getting his"
26:39,780;26:41,500;"foot up to somebody's chest."
26:41,500;26:43,020;"Yeah, I don't know what's his name."
26:43,020;26:45,860;"Maybe it was on his knees or something. I don't know."
26:45,860;26:46,620;"All right."
26:46,620;26:46,820;"All right."
26:46,820;26:52,980;"But three years later in 2006 is the famous one where in third quarter of a game against"
26:52,980;26:56,780;"Cowboys running back Julius Jones scored rushing play in the center"
26:56,780;26:59,460;"Andre Garrode, I guess"
26:59,460;27:02,620;"Felt to the ground whose helmet was removed by Hanesworth"
27:02,620;27:07,500;"Hanesworth attempted to stomp on Garrode's head, but missed so he tried it again"
27:07,500;27:12,500;"Second stop opened a severe wound in Garrode's head forehead narrow missing his right eye"
27:12,500;27:17,420;"Clean play that's better"

27:30,840;27:38,600;"Jesus yeah, it's on the extra point. So who cares yeah, and then he kicked the locker room attended in the chest"
27:43,340;27:51,040;"He's a good guy or I swear what's worse Jason Garrett or that I mean that's gotta be where I don't know Jason Garrett Jason Garrett. I'm not Garrett"
27:51,040;27:56,860;"From the Browns miles Garrett. Oh, yeah with the helmet smash"
27:56,860;28:03,440;"Probably this I might know I don't know if he connects with the helmet though. That's gonna"
28:03,440;28:08,260;"You did you brought them on the top of the head he bonked him"
28:10,420;28:12,420;"It's an incredible word"
28:12,420;28:16,500;"And the fact that you can call it a bunk. I think there's a show that"
28:16,500;28:21,500;"Haynesworth literally trying to curb stomp some dude in the middle of a football play"
28:21,500;28:25,860;"It's probably worse to me what I mean"
28:25,860;28:29,500;"The guy"
28:29,500;28:37,300;"I want to be hit in the head by male mile Garrett with a football helmet or stomped curb stomped by Albert Haynesworth"
28:37,300;28:39,940;"Which would you rather"
28:39,940;28:46,480;"which death is better. I'll probably take the stomping. I might take the helmet to"
28:46,480;28:52,440;"the head. I feel like he really gets you in the head or the eyebrow can knock you out."
28:52,440;29:00,300;"I don't think so. In 2010, Sylvia Mina, a stripper from New York claimed in a"
29:00,300;29:04,580;"$10 million lawsuit that Haynesworth impregnated her and left her with no"
29:04,580;29:08,620;"financial assistance. As I said, he's a good guy."
29:08,620;29:13,620;"- Are we adding that to the pogreg or like?"
29:13,620;29:20,060;"- You beat somebody up in a traffic altercation."

29:31,580;29:33,860;"- Holy shit."
29:33,860;29:35,300;"- We know what this guy's doing now."
29:35,300;29:36,300;"- He's still playing, man."
29:36,300;29:37,780;"- Yeah."
29:37,780;29:40,280;"Well, in 2015, he pled guilty for reckless voting."

29:53,080;29:59,380;"If you will, he's working at the David and Buster's with that."
29:59,380;30:01,140;"Oh, they're talking about"

30:20,120;30:21,460;"It was a fat bitch."
30:21,460;30:22,500;"It was."
30:22,500;30:27,340;"It wasn't he the one that had the play where he just like, felt down and"
30:27,340;30:29,460;"then just like gave up on the play, just lay there."
30:29,460;30:31,140;"Yeah, that was an idea of a play."
30:31,140;30:32,980;"That was amazing."
30:32,980;30:34,540;"That was legitimately hilarious."
30:34,540;30:35,540;"That was a, oh yeah."
30:36,100;30:37,100;"He was on the Redskins, right?"
30:37,100;30:38,800;"Yeah, I think it was a Redskins."
30:38,800;30:40,380;"Of course it was a Redskins who else would it be."
30:40,380;30:42,660;"How many of the good years did he have?"
30:42,660;30:44,580;"That's the question."
30:44,580;30:45,780;"He's pretty good."
30:45,780;30:46,940;"He's good for a while."
30:46,940;30:47,220;"Yeah."
30:47,220;30:50,900;"Like yeah, he got one wicked huge contract, right?"
30:50,900;30:51,700;"Yeah."
30:51,700;30:52,300;"Yeah."
30:52,300;30:54,940;"So we're like the same kind of player right around the same time."
30:54,940;30:56,540;"Oh, seven and away."
30:56,540;30:58,780;"He was after first he mopped."
30:58,780;31:03,020;"Yeah, because I think the 07 that was his last."
31:03,340;31:06,300;"How long did he play with the Redskins with the Titans?"
31:06,300;31:08,300;"So two to oh wait."
31:08,300;31:11,900;"So those last two years and that's what got him paid."
31:11,900;31:13,500;"And then as soon as you got paid, he's like, now fuck it."
31:13,500;31:14,940;"Was he on the big kids?"
31:14,940;31:17,580;"Yeah, 2011. Yeah."
31:17,580;31:18,860;"He didn't even make it out."
31:18,860;31:20,700;"Did he make it out of training camp?"
31:20,700;31:21,980;"No, I don't think he made out of camp."
31:21,980;31:25,260;"He left less than four months with the Patriots."
31:25,260;31:28,460;"And on November 8th, 2011, Hanesworth was placed on waivers."
31:28,460;31:29,260;"So yeah, technically."
31:29,260;31:30,300;"Oh, yeah."
31:30,300;31:33,020;"His placement on waivers came days after he got into a confrontation"
31:33,020;31:35,060;"with assistant pepper Johnson on the sidelines."
31:35,060;31:37,460;"That's a decision."
31:37,460;31:38,860;"Yeah, come on."
31:38,860;31:39,620;"What are you doing?"
31:39,620;31:40,580;"Bad decision."
31:40,580;31:41,540;"We want the pepper."
31:41,540;31:42,860;"Yeah."
31:42,860;31:43,500;"All right."
31:43,500;31:45,900;"So so they have they have got guys on both end of spectrum."
31:45,900;31:47,140;"We've got Steve McNair."
31:47,140;31:47,940;"We've got Albert Hingsworth."
31:47,940;31:49,820;"And we got Eddie George."
31:49,820;31:50,900;"Eddie George."
31:50,900;31:51,220;"Yep."
31:51,220;31:52,300;"Eddie George."
31:52,300;31:53,660;"I'm going to say something right now."
31:53,660;31:57,020;"Oh, and we're in the circle of trust here."
31:57,020;31:59,300;"He's an incredibly good looking man."
31:59,300;32:00,500;"Yeah."
32:00,500;32:01,860;"It's very good looking."
32:02,140;32:03,980;"I think he looks a bit like an alien."
32:03,980;32:08,180;"Andy, I think your insecurities are really coming to the surface right now."
32:08,180;32:12,100;"Cause if you don't think and the picture I'm staring at of you right now."
32:12,100;32:14,460;"Oh, I'm sorry."
32:14,460;32:18,220;"I wasn't either one that brought up the hotness of the Patriots quarterbacks last week."
32:18,220;32:19,700;"That's true."
32:19,700;32:22,300;"I mean, maybe it's better."
32:22,300;32:23,740;"Maybe you're just racist."
32:23,740;32:27,820;"No, it's just a head shape."
32:27,820;32:29,940;"Man, do you call me pictures?"
32:29,940;32:30,620;"All right."
32:30,620;32:35,900;"No, I'm gonna show you the picture I'm looking at. Okay, tell me if I'm right. I took it because I was looking at his headshot from"
32:35,900;32:37,760;"From the game"
32:37,760;32:40,660;"So let me let me put it up so y'all can see this I"
32:40,660;32:47,180;"Feel like it's like a hot bald head though. Yeah, it's like good ball. Yeah, but like this is the picture"
32:47,180;32:50,700;"I'm looking at I still think he looks good there. He's very symmetrical. He's a"
32:50,700;32:57,620;"Strong very strong. Yeah, but then if you Google him like some of these are much better like this"

33:01,340;33:05,340;"Yeah, it looks a lot better"
33:05,340;33:10,620;"Not in a uniform. I think I might be the uniform with the shoulders. It's just a good looking dude"
33:10,620;33:14,300;"Yeah, I don't know you go with the sand. It looks like you can be like on a talk show"
33:14,300;33:17,460;"You see I"
33:17,460;33:20,540;"Tack me"
33:20,540;33:22,540;"It's a fact check"

34:18,540;34:22,060;"Some of them are like some of the pictures are not great."
34:22,060;34:23,980;"- Look at his smile."
34:23,980;34:25,280;"- Smiles it up."
34:25,280;34:27,580;"- But if he's not smiling, he's got that like stare on."
34:27,580;34:28,420;"- Is he still there?"
34:28,420;34:29,260;"Oh yeah."

34:57,220;34:58,820;"You should sound like a nice guy."
34:58,820;34:59,620;"Is that good?"
34:59,620;35:01,140;"I feel like it's a yes or no sort of thing."
35:01,140;35:02,180;"Look at that six-five."

35:10,820;35:13,060;"All right, thank you, Kelly."
35:13,060;35:15,460;"I think we need to see Greg's search history."
35:15,460;35:20,340;"Eddie George, naked."
35:20,340;35:22,900;"Eddie George porn, Eddie George penis."

35:35,540;35:40,020;"Like how many lengthwise, you know, brommium parties?"
35:40,020;35:47,700;"Kelly, be gone."
35:47,700;35:49,700;"I"
35:49,700;35:55,380;"Speaking of sexual inn windows though"
35:55,380;36:04,060;"Alan Michaels, I feel like back in the day the the primetime commentators were always trying to walk that line. I"
36:04,060;36:06,780;"think it was because"
36:06,780;36:09,980;"Who was the guy that they had in the booth was supposed to be like a comedian?"
36:09,980;36:14,460;"He didn't work out. Well, he's like the third guy. He was always supposed to be like toe in the line. It's like a leery"
36:15,060;36:17,380;"Dennis something other yeah, Dennis"
36:17,380;36:24,780;"Fuck me so bad. It's a leery sounds like it could be a person and it's Miller Dennis Miller"
36:24,780;36:25,620;"Yes"
36:25,620;36:29,060;"So I feel like this was like the time when the guys are trying to be edgy"
36:29,060;36:37,820;"And al Michael's like introducing the game comes in and says as the 15 15th week of the NFL season climaxes"
36:37,820;36:40,900;"And then he starts like introducing the game like how"
36:40,900;36:43,540;"why would you"
36:44,980;36:54,600;"the week climaxes especially the week 15 yeah is that even a night yeah I guess"
36:54,600;37:00,160;"a week day climax I don't know if I put Sunday night scaries as my climax either"
37:00,160;37:05,080;"you know it crescendos that's probably the low maybe crescendos ago of a climax"
37:05,080;37:10,040;"like I feel like he's trying to shoehorn that in that's that's a bad"
37:10,040;37:12,540;"- Dude, you had a fit as me doing football not football."
37:12,540;37:17,200;"That's how Michael's trying to do football not football."
37:17,200;37:20,020;"- But he said a few questionable things though."
37:20,020;37:23,360;"At one point, like they go to the PTI crew"
37:23,360;37:24,700;"and he comes back and says,"
37:24,700;37:28,560;"""I feel you're angst like a 6.9 earthquake."""
37:28,560;37:30,840;"Like, is that a 69 reference?"
37:30,840;37:33,000;"What is he trying to say there?"
37:33,000;37:34,240;"- I missed that, yeah."
37:34,240;37:37,400;"- I feel like he's just trying to be edgy"
37:37,400;37:39,280;"and he's just really bad at it."
37:39,280;37:46,120;"just not good at is like me also I did not know PTI was that old 2002 yeah and"
37:46,120;37:51,160;"that was the halftime early which fuck that glad that didn't make it into the"
37:51,160;37:56,080;"recording that we watch another L Michael's thing after they showed PTI he"
37:56,080;38:01,480;"said those guys are a very unusual combination as in a black guy and a"
38:01,480;38:04,480;"Jewish guy, like also questionable thing to say."
38:04,480;38:06,080;"That's pretty questionable."
38:06,080;38:13,560;"Yeah, they were definitely trying to make this like because it turned into a blowout"
38:13,560;38:17,640;"in second half and they were trying the best to make it like still watchable and"
38:17,640;38:19,200;"like in events."
38:19,200;38:22,560;"So they had Hank Williams Jr."
38:22,560;38:23,280;"in the booth too."
38:23,280;38:25,120;"I think it was probably the fourth quarter."
38:25,120;38:26,080;"Oh, he sucked."
38:26,080;38:26,760;"Yeah."
38:26,760;38:29,920;"And they're like, oh, well, you know, because you're part of the other guy that"
38:29,920;38:32,280;"Does the, uh, are you ready for some football?"
38:32,280;38:35,280;"So are you like, bro, it's the fourth quarter."
38:35,280;38:39,640;"He's been ready for the football from Nashville, but his garbage."
38:39,640;38:40,920;"He's so bad."
38:40,920;38:43,040;"He had a really nothing important to say."
38:43,040;38:44,280;"Yeah."
38:44,280;38:47,320;"So I brought Matt and the cowboy hat, which mad and tried to put it on,"
38:47,320;38:48,360;"but then he didn't have his headphones."
38:48,360;38:49,480;"So he couldn't actually commentate."
38:49,480;38:53,000;"And then he gave down Michaels, read suspenders."
38:53,000;38:56,880;"And you could tell Michaels was like not having like, I thought it was a seatbelt."
38:56,880;38:58,200;"What the fuck?"
38:58,200;39:01,400;"I have a confession to make."
39:01,400;39:05,160;"I've watched all the games so far, except this one at that point, when he"
39:05,160;39:08,320;"gave pulled out the cowboy hat, I skipped forward like 10 minutes."
39:08,320;39:12,000;"I was like, you've watched every minute of every game, Steve."
39:12,000;39:14,320;"The podcast said that on."
39:14,320;39:15,120;"Yeah, I didn't watch."
39:15,120;39:16,800;"Was on early."
39:16,800;39:17,880;"Yeah, that's pretty good."
39:17,880;39:18,840;"It's not bad."
39:18,840;39:21,120;"Yeah, I did the same once once we got to the fourth quarter."
39:21,120;39:22,480;"I just had on the background."
39:22,480;39:23,480;"I was like doing other stuff."
39:23,480;39:27,240;"So I'm literally on the worst game that you guys have seen."
39:27,240;39:34,300;"Yeah, it's up there that we've had some games in Miami when Brady first started that where I miss those games"
39:34,300;39:36,300;"I'm not my ami game"
39:36,300;39:40,280;"So I think that I think the first Miami game was"
39:40,280;39:43,700;"Probably right now the only game I give a zero to"
39:43,700;39:48,220;"Zero Lombardi's in terms of watchability score. Why did you give this one?"
39:48,220;39:52,120;"I'll give this one a half. I'll give it a while"
39:52,120;39:56,540;"You just talked about how good the commentators were Andy. There's a bunch of great names in it"
39:56,540;40:03,180;"Which it didn't it's not a redeeming factor Greg. You talk about great names. Are you saying like funny names or like players?"
40:03,180;40:10,960;"That like yeah, and thought I like like Steve McNair dude, you know, he was like Ron curse on curse on it. Yep. Yep"
40:10,960;40:13,860;"So Mari roll. Mmm. Yeah"
40:13,860;40:19,900;"Keith Bullock he was fucking sick in this game Frank. Why check? Yep, who is the other?"
40:20,660;40:21,920;"- Dyson?"
40:21,920;40:23,720;"- Dyson, yes."
40:23,720;40:27,080;"- There's a cornerback Dyson and a receiver Dyson."
40:27,080;40:27,920;"Remember Kevin Dyson?"
40:27,920;40:29,040;"He was like their best Dyson brothers."
40:29,040;40:30,040;"- Yeah, right, right."
40:30,040;40:30,880;"- Derek Mason."
40:30,880;40:33,200;"- And in this game, he didn't do anything."
40:33,200;40:34,040;"- Yeah, he didn't."
40:34,040;40:34,880;"One of them was injured."
40:34,880;40:35,720;"There's another one."
40:35,720;40:37,120;"They had those super good."
40:37,120;40:38,800;"- Derek Mason?"
40:38,800;40:40,640;"- Derek Mason was awesome in this game."
40:40,640;40:41,480;"He was like their best player."
40:41,480;40:43,440;"- Yeah, Dyson was injured and Mason was in."
40:43,440;40:45,920;"But yeah, they had two fucking sick receivers."
40:45,920;40:48,000;"- I honestly thought Hulk might've done their best player"
40:48,000;40:49,000;"in this game, which is weird."
40:49,000;40:50,040;"'Cause I don't even know who that is."
40:50,040;40:53,720;"Neither do I yeah, it was like some they just picked him up"
40:53,720;40:58,840;"I think was it from the Rams or something yeah, here's the third down back and you absolutely gash the team"
40:58,840;41:03,720;"It was incredible. We couldn't stop them every time we got the ball. They ran for like 20 yards. Yeah"
41:03,720;41:07,560;"Did 8.9 average Greg said like 81"
41:07,560;41:13,160;"And Eddie George had like a 3.0 average. Yeah, so"
41:13,160;41:16,520;"It's a pretty good team. Yeah"
41:16,520;41:19,240;"Shame the Jeff Fisher, huh?"
41:19,240;41:20,240;"Yes."
41:20,240;41:21,240;"Al Y."
41:21,240;41:22,720;"They were stacked."
41:22,720;41:24,120;"So I was shocked."
41:24,120;41:26,480;"They showed Jeff Fisher's record at one point."
41:26,480;41:30,520;"I didn't write it down, but it was above 500 by like 20 games."
41:30,520;41:35,720;"I thought he was 500 like his whole career, but apparently actually was decent at one"
41:35,720;41:36,720;"point."
41:36,720;41:43,440;"I think this run with the Titans basically got him."
41:43,440;41:44,920;"All the way to the ramp."
41:44,920;41:46,680;"All the leeway in the world."
41:46,680;41:47,680;"Yeah."
41:47,680;41:51,420;"- Just to ask. - I looked into this"
41:51,420;41:53,740;"and I wrote it down 'cause it was funny."
41:53,740;41:55,740;"So I looked back to when he started."
41:55,740;41:59,860;"So you're right, since like 99,"
41:59,860;42:02,620;"he'd been good, he had like a couple 13 and three years."
42:02,620;42:06,500;"So, but he took over, his first full season was in 95."
42:06,500;42:08,400;"They went seven and nine,"
42:08,400;42:10,420;"96, they went eight and eight,"
42:10,420;42:14,100;"97, they went eight and eight, 98, they went eight and eight."
42:14,100;42:17,380;"And I was like clicking through on profile reference"
42:17,380;42:19,500;"And I was like, is this loading correctly?"
42:19,500;42:20,660;"(laughing)"
42:20,660;42:24,340;"It was, it was just the same fucking record every year."
42:24,340;42:25,740;"- It's only shit, you're right."
42:25,740;42:26,580;"- Yeah."
42:26,580;42:27,420;"- Yeah."
42:27,420;42:28,540;"And then he had a few good years in a row."
42:28,540;42:32,140;"Because he finished, he was at, well,"
42:32,140;42:35,160;"Tennessee/Houston for 17 years."
42:35,160;42:40,060;"And was 142 and 120 overall."
42:40,060;42:42,540;"It's not been so 542, which is above 500."
42:42,540;42:46,700;"But then he went to the Rams and was never over 500"
42:46,700;42:48,920;"in any of the seasons with them."
42:48,920;42:51,660;"- See seven and nine every year."
42:51,660;42:52,940;"- Let's see what the Rans here was,"
42:52,940;42:55,380;"seven, eight and one, seven and nine, six and 10,"
42:55,380;42:56,980;"seven and nine, and then four and nine"
42:56,980;42:58,180;"before I got fired."
42:58,180;43:01,640;"- It's like hitting the minimum to not get fired"
43:01,640;43:03,100;"is what he did forever."
43:03,100;43:04,740;"(laughing)"
43:04,740;43:05,940;"It's incredible."
43:05,940;43:09,100;"- Yeah, 'cause if you win like, go ahead, see."
43:09,100;43:10,900;"- Did he have a record that he was trying to set"
43:10,900;43:13,660;"with like a number of losses or something like that?"
43:13,660;43:14,500;"- Oh."
43:14,500;43:15,740;"- He was like, ""I'm gonna wipe it."""
43:15,740;43:20,620;"And he got fired right before he would have broke the record for most losses as a head coach or something like that"
43:20,620;43:24,840;"Yeah, something like that wasn't it just embodied his because I if I was him"
43:24,840;43:27,120;"I'd be like let me get another coaching gig. I just want to go"
43:27,120;43:33,140;"I just need a little more game just again. Yeah, like it like just just sign up to be like the Redskins interim"
43:33,140;43:39,780;"When someone gets fired which happens all the time every year just bring me in for the last game of season. Yeah"
43:39,780;43:43,220;"Get on the team like"
43:44,700;43:48,380;"He got fired right after he played the paths right when he was about to set that record"
43:48,380;43:52,180;"Was it I remember we dominated him because that was the game that"
43:52,180;43:56,540;"Blunt had that fourth and one carry that he ran for a touchdown"
43:56,540;44:00,380;"Was like the beginning of Jared Goff's career - or something like that"
44:00,380;44:05,820;"Something like let's see pages against Jeff Fisher. What was the last game we played against him?"
44:05,820;44:09,660;"pages dynasty.info/search/games"
44:09,660;44:13,060;"2016 was their last game against him"
44:13,580;44:18,560;"Page of beat him 26 to 10. I think he does have the most losses ever"
44:18,560;44:21,500;"Really? Yeah, that was the blouse"
44:21,500;44:28,180;"Fourth and one. I feel like that's like a really a achievement though. It's like exactly the most interceptions"
44:28,180;44:32,420;"Yeah, have to be you gotta be around there. Yeah, yeah enough to still be there. Yeah"
44:32,420;44:35,420;"It's true"
44:35,420;44:37,580;"Tom Coughlin's on there number five"
44:37,580;44:41,780;"That's not a brush and Shula Tom Landry"
44:41,780;44:48,380;"Tom Cauch will have a couple years left in him. He could catch Jeff Fisher. How long"
44:48,380;44:53,900;"did Don Shula coach for if he has both the most wins and the most losses in NFL history?"
44:53,900;44:54,900;"It's a good question."
44:54,900;44:58,980;"Isn't Bell check chasing him and he's still like 40 wins away."
44:58,980;44:59,980;"Yeah, you would say like that."
44:59,980;45:06,900;"This is from a pro football coaches record. Here we go. This is what we need. Don Shula."
45:06,900;45:09,540;"Don Shula 490 and 328."
45:09,540;45:10,280;"Geez."
45:10,280;45:11,100;"Wow."
45:11,100;45:13,940;"Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, no, 328 and 156."
45:13,940;45:14,960;"How many seasons is that?"
45:14,960;45:15,980;"33 years."
45:15,980;45:16,460;"33 years."
45:16,460;45:17,900;"500 coaches."
45:17,900;45:20,060;"33 years as a head coach."
45:20,060;45:21,060;"Oh, dude."
45:21,060;45:21,860;"You're right, Steve."
45:21,860;45:27,860;"He is exactly tied for the most losses ever with Dan Reeves."
45:27,860;45:29,380;"Dan Reeves."
45:29,380;45:32,380;"165 losses."
45:32,380;45:34,460;"What's Jeff Fisher's overall record?"
45:34,460;45:36,100;"Reeves must have more wins, right?"
45:36,100;45:38,820;"Yeah, Reeves is 190 and 165."
45:38,820;45:41,380;"Fisher is 173 and 160."
45:41,380;45:43,220;"- That is so perfect."
45:43,220;45:45,820;"- Wow."
45:45,820;45:49,420;"I mean, that's fascinating."
45:49,420;45:51,380;"- I could see Jeff Fisher coming back."
45:51,380;45:52,980;"- That's what I'm saying is giving him one more loss."
45:52,980;45:53,820;"- Let's bring him back."
45:53,820;45:54,900;"- Bring him back for week 17."
45:54,900;45:56,180;"No one cares, you know?"
45:56,180;45:58,980;"And the other team's sitting there, starters anyways."
45:58,980;46:01,580;"- I could see a dumb organization just bringing them in"
46:01,580;46:02,780;"like as a fresh start."
46:02,780;46:04,100;"Like, oh yeah, we need a fresh start."
46:04,100;46:05,700;"Let's bring him Jeff Fisher."
46:05,700;46:07,500;"You know, he'll be able to get us to 500."
46:07,500;46:12,860;"You probably could think anyone to seven to nine."
46:12,860;46:17,300;"The jets of like, ooh, seven or nine looks pretty good right now."
46:17,300;46:23,620;"Oh man, my favorite thing so far has been to go to the jets subreddit."
46:23,620;46:25,140;"Oh, season."
46:25,140;46:26,980;"They are melting."
46:26,980;46:27,940;"They're not even melting down."
46:27,940;46:28,100;"All right."
46:28,100;46:29,220;"They're just numb to it, I think."
46:29,220;46:33,940;"That's just the atom case is still their quarterback, their head coach."
46:34,300;46:39,980;"I like reading about that shit more than I like reading about the Patriots or any other Boston sports is Jets tears is like my number one"
46:39,980;46:44,380;"I figured I figured you'd be the same. I love it."
46:44,380;46:46,300;"Every little bit of it."
46:46,300;46:48,260;"All right."
46:48,260;46:49,780;"Should we do some best and worst for this then?"
46:49,780;46:52,580;"Yeah, let's get there."
46:52,580;46:53,260;"All right."
46:53,260;46:54,580;"Steve, let's go first there."
46:54,580;46:57,420;"No, I'm going to pass on going first."
46:57,420;46:58,100;"You go first."
46:58,100;46:59,780;"Greg, you want to go first?"
46:59,780;47:02,340;"I'm going to pass as well."
47:02,340;47:03,300;"I may go first."
47:03,300;47:04,360;"- You want me to go first?"
47:04,360;47:06,280;"- Yeah, you go first."
47:06,280;47:08,920;"- All right, I tried to take some notes, let's see."
47:08,920;47:12,680;"All right, best Belichick's jacket that he was wearing"
47:12,680;47:13,760;"was incredible."
47:13,760;47:16,640;"It was like a starter jacket, bright red."
47:16,640;47:17,560;"- Yes."
47:17,560;47:18,720;"- I want that thing."
47:18,720;47:20,760;"- It was one of the elastoms on the wristband, right?"
47:20,760;47:21,600;"And like the..."
47:21,600;47:23,320;"- Yeah, and the elastic on the..."
47:23,320;47:25,760;"I have one like that, but it's blue"
47:25,760;47:28,160;"and it actually has a number 11"
47:28,160;47:29,960;"in blood cell on the back of it."
47:29,960;47:30,800;"- What, you have a little?"
47:30,800;47:32,440;"- It's fucking legit, yeah."
47:32,440;47:34,440;"I still have your original starter jacket"
47:34,440;47:37,320;"The Patriots one"
47:37,320;47:44,040;"Yeah, I'm surprised it still fits you. I just felt like the red Pat starter jacket like you never see that"
47:44,040;47:49,540;"I've never sold school like paths like scroll text logo on it. Yeah"
47:49,540;47:54,720;"I'm like the early P. I want to find that and all checks closet you can find an eBay. Oh"
47:54,720;47:57,400;"We may have to go on eBay"
47:59,880;48:06,340;"Patriots red starter jacket. It's a puffy windbreaker though. It's not like the zip down mode the hood. It's like no"
48:06,340;48:11,760;"Yeah, yeah, you know last at the wrist and at the waist. Oh my god"
48:11,760;48:14,140;"Yeah, it is that kind of like shiny material - yeah"
48:14,140;48:19,640;"Yeah, that thing was gone awful. Absolutely far. You have a worse Scott. Well, can I give another best?"
48:19,640;48:23,920;"I tried to focus on the positives because the game was so bad. I just wanted just like say"
48:26,240;48:31,060;"All right, so I this was my first like old Pat's game I had watched in a while"
48:31,060;48:37,520;"So my best was actually Tom Brady's like but chin no one ever talked like it just vanished one day"
48:37,520;48:41,120;"But like he used to have a nice but chin. I don't know what happened to it"
48:41,120;48:47,440;"We were legit talking about that last week. Why are we like wait, yeah, just it's just gone like he must have had some work done"
48:47,440;48:53,200;"But I think I think that we decided was that if you were married to Giselle you would also have worked on"
48:53,200;48:55,200;"Wasn't that where we landed?"
48:55,200;48:57,960;"Yeah, whatever she's got whatever I do"
48:57,960;49:03,320;"Maybe it's like all the water he drinks just like went straight to his chin"
49:03,320;49:07,320;"Yeah"
49:07,320;49:13,360;"Yeah, it's definitely right I know like that blew my mind because all the old pictures of him"
49:13,360;49:18,880;"They show him with that little dimple butch in and all of a sudden. It's just not there anymore"
49:18,880;49:20,880;"So then is that a best or a your age?"
49:21,360;49:26,840;"I said best I like the little butch in I kind of miss it. Oh, was your worst that it disappeared?"
49:26,840;49:29,680;"Yeah, sure"
49:29,680;49:37,720;"My worst was gonna be the field because it was so bad, but we already talked about that. Oh, it was awful though"
49:37,720;49:46,400;"It was really really bad. It was literally and I mean this literally painted dirt like they were out there with spray paint guns like painting"
49:46,400;49:49,840;"The the field green and the sidelines white"
49:50,440;49:52,440;"Is this there?"
49:52,440;49:54,440;"Do you guys hear those jets?"
49:54,440;49:56,440;"Is that what that was?"
49:56,440;49:57,440;"Yeah."
49:57,440;49:59,440;"Oh, dare you give a Jets reference on this podcast?"
49:59,440;50:00,440;"Yeah, right."
50:00,440;50:01,440;"You son of a bitch."
50:01,440;50:03,440;"That's an anguarine green."
50:03,440;50:05,440;"Who the fuck are you, Steve?"
50:05,440;50:06,440;"It's a Celtics."
50:06,440;50:07,440;"It doesn't matter."
50:07,440;50:08,440;"Still green."
50:08,440;50:12,440;"The only way to get rid of a butt chin is with an implant."
50:12,440;50:13,440;"All right."
50:13,440;50:14,440;"There it is."
50:14,440;50:15,440;"That check."
50:15,440;50:18,920;"- You probably got a chin implant."
50:18,920;50:22,240;"If that's implanted, what else is implanted?"
50:22,240;50:26,480;"- This wall. - He's fucking deflating balls"
50:26,480;50:28,040;"and planting shins, dude."
50:28,040;50:30,400;"We can't trust anything this man says."
50:30,400;50:34,480;"- Oh fuck me."
50:34,480;50:38,360;"He's still beautiful."
50:38,360;50:40,320;"- All right, he's best as well now."

50:55,880;50:56,920;"pros"
50:56,920;50:58,960;"yeah it's such a great view"
50:58,960;51:02,360;"it was sick when he got hit in the head with the ball where you're going to"
51:02,360;51:06,200;"stop to ask how to say yeah i was going to be my best was the web the uh... the"
51:06,200;51:07,280;"ref cam"
51:07,280;51:10,200;"tom Brady drilled a referee in the face like the"
51:10,200;51:16,880;"Whoever the guy stands in the middle like drill them square in the face and he's one that was wearing the camera and the video of it is amazing"
51:16,880;51:23,120;"I'll put on on the website and I'll put on I'm not gonna lie. I miss that when I skip through. Oh, yeah, you miss it was awesome"
51:23,120;51:26,560;"Oh, he got let me see if I can pull it up real quick for you boys"
51:26,560;51:32,280;"The ref like tried to cool afterwards too because he's got had just been drilled in the face"
51:32,280;51:35,740;"But you could tell he was pretty sure you should show you should do"
51:37,440;51:41,440;"And it was a it was a cannon too like it wasn't just like a quick throw"
51:41,440;51:44,960;"Yeah, he was trying to gun it into the tight end coming across the middle"
51:44,960;51:52,560;"I can't wait for the uh the quarterback cam that will get eventually like the VR. Oh, yeah"
51:52,560;51:58,720;"Why isn't that a thing now? Yeah, I want to watch the james winston like stare down or receiver in throw kick"
51:58,720;52:02,000;"From his"
52:06,000;52:08,680;"So right what a great and here's the actual"
52:08,680;52:19,880;"I mean he didn't go down to his he's on his feet still yeah, but like an absolute cannon shot. Yeah"
52:19,880;52:26,600;"Like square amazing also like if you're a referee fucking duck. What are you doing?"
52:26,600;52:29,300;"What are you watching?"
52:29,300;52:34,440;"Almost an interception too. God damn it"
52:34,640;52:37,440;"the other best is the"
52:37,440;52:42,300;"I guess that could be a worst in me, you know rough getting on the way at Tom Brady he would have been like no"
52:42,300;52:48,180;"It's worth for the content worth to you. Oh best 40. We're already done at that point. It was just like"
52:48,180;52:55,440;"In the fort Brady probably did that on purpose. He's like check out the same view I can get my other best is"
52:55,440;52:58,600;"So board this game they had a"
52:58,600;53:01,060;"promo for the nets"
53:01,060;53:03,060;"Celtics Christmas day game so I looked it up"
53:03,840;53:07,040;"Yeah, they did scallop reenie played for the Nets then"
53:07,040;53:10,960;"Game they blew us out like crazy"

53:33,280;53:38,340;"Clutch I'm getting there for some reason like preparation age. Oh never mind. That's different"
53:38,340;53:52,620;"Good for real though. Why preparation age I did joke, but I am getting preparation a sats"
53:52,620;53:55,260;"Know me better than I know myself"
53:55,260;53:59,360;"They just googled Eddie George or bunch maybe yes"
53:59,360;54:01,600;"(all laughing)"
54:01,600;54:07,780;"- There's the Haynesworth, it's a pseudonym for something."
54:07,780;54:10,440;"- Even busters?"
54:10,440;54:11,760;"- Right, what you got?"
54:11,760;54:13,600;"Best of worst."
54:13,600;54:15,480;"- All right, best of worst."
54:15,480;54:16,520;"- Yeah, go ahead, Jay."
54:16,520;54:17,360;"- Yeah, I'll go."
54:17,360;54:20,120;"I got my worst."
54:20,120;54:22,640;"I've been holding this tape for a little bit"
54:22,640;54:24,600;"'cause I didn't want to admit to it,"
54:24,600;54:28,460;"but I think Antoine Smith kind of sucks."
54:29,280;54:30,780;"He's not as good as I remember."
54:30,780;54:31,780;"Oh, yes."
54:31,780;54:34,760;"I remember thinking he was like a powerback."
54:34,760;54:38,880;"Maybe I'm thinking Corey Dillon, that era."
54:38,880;54:46,960;"But he had six carries with 31 yards with one rush of 23."
54:46,960;54:47,480;"Yeah."
54:47,480;54:49,840;"So he had five carries for what?"
54:49,840;54:51,560;"Eight yards?"
54:51,560;54:52,400;"Pretty rough."
54:52,400;54:53,360;"Dude, woof."
54:53,360;54:54,360;"Yeah."
54:54,360;54:55,360;"He wasn't bad."
54:55,360;54:56,040;"He was good."
54:56,040;54:57,960;"Like when we first started watching,"
54:57,960;54:59,960;"He we've seen his decline seen the back half"
54:59,960;55:07,940;"First got on this podcast we were talking about how they signed them from the bills. Yeah, like the first well remember"
55:07,940;55:11,560;"They they had their choice between him and priest homes, but priest homes is more expensive"
55:11,560;55:13,560;"So they went with the cheaper option"
55:13,560;55:15,560;"There was Anton Smith"
55:15,560;55:20,640;"And then what I got them what they needed in 2001 and then it was good enough to win the zoo ball, right?"
55:20,640;55:27,340;"Would you rather have and tawnsmith and Corey Dillon or priest homes because they kind of went and got Corey Dillon and one"
55:27,340;55:30,140;"and Priest Holmes still pretty good, I would think."
55:30,140;55:30,980;"- That's probably true."
55:30,980;55:32,040;"- Corey Dillon was sick."
55:32,040;55:33,780;"I might choose those two."
55:33,780;55:37,700;"- I mean, yeah, I wonder what the overlap would be"
55:37,700;55:40,220;"between Priest Holmes, his career,"
55:40,220;55:43,580;"and when he was good versus Corey Dillon, I don't know."
55:43,580;55:44,780;"- Quite pretty close, right?"
55:44,780;55:47,820;"Corey wanted to build us for sure."
55:47,820;55:48,660;"- Yeah."
55:48,660;55:51,140;"Yeah, that's gonna be coming pretty soon, I think."
55:51,140;55:51,980;"Oh, three, you can see."
55:51,980;55:52,820;"- Priest Holmes, maybe."
55:52,820;55:55,180;"- That's down records better on than two, I remember."
55:55,180;55:57,580;"him and LT those two years back to back."
55:57,580;55:58,940;"- Right, right."
55:58,940;55:59,780;"- Yeah."
55:59,780;56:03,900;"- Antoine Smith doesn't get any better from here."
56:03,900;56:05,380;"- No."
56:05,380;56:07,100;"- How long did he play for?"
56:07,100;56:07,940;"- Three more years."
56:07,940;56:10,380;"He's one more year in New England with--"
56:10,380;56:11,220;"- All right."
56:11,220;56:12,940;"- And then Corey Dolan comes in at 04, right?"
56:12,940;56:13,940;"- Yeah."
56:13,940;56:14,780;"- Okay."
56:14,780;56:17,100;"- I didn't know that Antoine Smith went to Tennessee"
56:17,100;56:18,340;"and then New Orleans."
56:18,340;56:20,540;"- I know, yeah."
56:20,540;56:21,700;"- I vaguely remember him in New Orleans."
56:21,700;56:23,820;"I don't remember Tennessee."
56:23,820;56:26,020;"ran for like 700 yards in a row."
56:26,020;56:27,020;"Damn."
56:27,020;56:28,580;"That's my flow is first."
56:28,580;56:29,080;"Yeah."
56:29,080;56:30,940;"How long was he there?"
56:30,940;56:33,180;"He was there for four years."
56:33,180;56:34,180;"The fourth, right?"
56:34,180;56:34,180;"Yeah."
56:34,180;56:36,100;"And kind of like he was really good and kind of"
56:36,100;56:39,380;"tailed off because he wasn't getting as much usage."
56:39,380;56:40,380;"Yeah."
56:40,380;56:43,220;"And he was coaching system if I recall."
56:43,220;56:44,900;"Looks like that's true."
56:44,900;56:45,980;"Yeah."
56:45,980;56:48,420;"My best from this game, Rohan Davy,"
56:48,420;56:49,980;"getting some action."
56:49,980;56:51,700;"He did."
56:51,700;56:53,800;"the fucking Jim, Jim,"
56:53,800;56:55,740;"making cannon from the bayou."
56:55,740;57:01,540;"And actually a garbage country boy, dude."
57:01,540;57:04,180;"And you make him that played at LSU."
57:04,180;57:07,040;"God, I bet that guy got some six stories."
57:07,040;57:08,280;"The size is Steve."
57:08,280;57:11,080;"Yeah, he was a thick boy."
57:11,080;57:13,280;"Do you want to do a guesses weight?"
57:13,280;57:15,480;"Sure."
57:15,480;57:17,020;"Two forty five."
57:17,020;57:18,520;"Okay."
57:18,520;57:20,020;"Two fifty eight."
57:20,020;57:21,520;"Whoa, Steve."
57:21,520;57:23,560;"I got two 64."
57:23,560;57:26,560;"Six to two 45."
57:26,560;57:27,640;"Yeah."
57:27,640;57:28,560;"Wow."
57:28,560;57:30,920;"He was thick with two C's boy."
57:30,920;57:33,640;"I think there's a McNair was two."
57:33,640;57:34,240;"Yeah."
57:34,240;57:34,720;"Yeah."
57:34,720;57:36,840;"It was because that Brady was two twenty five."
57:36,840;57:39,760;"McNair was two thirty, but they were built different."
57:39,760;57:43,440;"Because McNair was like a line back there."
57:43,440;57:46,760;"And McNair is shaving a few pounds off of that."
57:46,760;57:47,320;"There's no."
57:47,320;57:47,720;"Yeah."
57:47,720;57:48,240;"Yeah."
57:48,240;57:50,400;"I think he's a bit more than that."
57:51,320;57:53,020;"- We had some on."
57:53,020;57:54,020;"- I don't know."
57:54,020;57:56,500;"- What was Jared Lorenzo?"
57:56,500;57:58,360;"- Oh yeah, the half you lefty."
57:58,360;57:59,780;"- We'll put that as the benchmark."
57:59,780;58:02,220;"Yeah, the round mound of touchdown."
58:02,220;58:03,300;"- Yeah."
58:03,300;58:04,140;"- He had to have been three."
58:04,140;58:04,980;"- No way."
58:04,980;58:05,820;"- He told me for a while."
58:05,820;58:09,020;"- He came in, what was it here in Ben Raffesberger size?"
58:09,020;58:15,020;"- He was six, four, 315 pounds."
58:15,020;58:16,380;"- 315 pounds."
58:16,380;58:20,220;"- Hey, what do we say Albert Hanesworth was?"
58:20,220;58:22,020;"Yeah, right around there. Yeah."
58:22,020;58:24,940;"The public names are very throw boy."
58:24,940;58:27,220;"The hefty lefty."
58:27,220;58:30,420;"Ran a faster 40."
58:30,420;58:32,540;"Albert Haynesworth or the full story."
58:32,540;58:32,820;"Oh, God."
58:32,820;58:35,980;"He ate me."
58:35,980;58:38,620;"Albert Haynesworth with 3.5."
58:38,620;58:41,700;"Very bad."
58:41,700;58:43,620;"That hands worth ran a faster for sure."
58:43,620;58:45,380;"Yeah, it's not even close."
58:45,380;58:47,740;"What a story Jared Lawrence in his, huh?"
58:47,740;58:51,660;"He actually played in the NFL as the 300 pound quarterback."
58:51,660;58:53,220;"That is just right."
58:53,220;58:55,220;"Incredible."
58:55,220;58:56,340;"Incredible."
58:56,340;58:58,500;"Never gave it one of your dreams."
58:58,500;59:00,500;"He died the reason, didn't he?"
59:00,500;59:02,380;"Uh, it was like an unexpected thing to you."
59:02,380;59:02,860;"Might have."
59:02,860;59:06,380;"I know he really, he like really struggled with weight after he played."
59:06,380;59:06,980;"Yeah."
59:06,980;59:08,340;"No, I think he did though."
59:08,340;59:09,340;"He could."
59:09,340;59:14,820;"When he came out of the womb, it was 13 pounds, three ounces."
59:14,820;59:15,820;"Damn."
59:16,300;59:20,820;"Right. It's a fucking wide load, dude."
59:20,820;59:23,740;"Talk about being built different."
59:23,740;59:26,460;"Found a baby coming out of the wall."
59:26,460;59:30,900;"Oh, well, mom just give birth to linebackers."
59:30,900;59:32,940;"All right, Andy, what's your best and worst?"
59:32,940;59:35,100;"All right."
59:35,100;59:39,820;"My worst was Brady throwing a pick six."
59:39,820;59:42,180;"Because we haven't talked about it."
59:42,180;59:43,300;"That was the game."
59:43,300;59:44,860;"That was the game change on that play."
59:44,860;59:45,580;"It was over."
59:45,580;59:46,080;"That was it."
59:46,080;59:48,380;"And then touchdown to open the second half."
59:48,380;59:48,880;"Yeah."
59:48,880;59:50,180;"Ports of pun."
59:50,180;59:50,980;"Boom."
59:50,980;59:52,380;"Pick six and then."
59:52,380;59:53,780;"Literally the first play."
59:53,780;59:54,280;"Yeah."
59:54,280;59:58,480;"Great throws over flashbacks to the other game where we threw it."
59:58,480;01:00:00,780;"So Logan Ryan to end British career."
01:00:00,780;01:00:01,680;"Yeah."
01:00:01,680;01:00:02,180;"Yeah."
01:00:02,180;01:00:03,780;"It felt similar."
01:00:03,780;01:00:04,780;"Rich Cody."
01:00:04,780;01:00:06,480;"Shout out white defensive backs."
01:00:06,480;01:00:12,980;"I'm going to shout out every white defensive back I come across because I don't think there's been one in like 10 years, right?"
01:00:12,980;01:00:15,380;"Uh, Jason Sehorn."
01:00:15,380;01:00:19,240;"Yeah, he isn't played in 10 years. It's probably true. Adam Marchcheletta"
01:00:19,240;01:00:22,160;"Yeah, fuck"
01:00:22,160;01:00:24,160;"John Lynch is somewhat recent, right?"
01:00:24,160;01:00:27,520;"It's I think it's cornerbacks. I think is what it is now, isn't it?"
01:00:27,520;01:00:29,880;"Because Harrison Smith is probably white"
01:00:29,880;01:00:37,420;"No, although I was looking at the black quarterbacks thing. Patrick Mahomes is black. Yeah. Yeah, of course"
01:00:37,420;01:00:41,020;"What? Yeah, I don't know"
01:00:43,620;01:00:45,620;"He looks like"
01:00:45,620;01:00:49,380;"He sounds white is that where do you even draw that line?"
01:00:49,380;01:00:52,740;"Yeah, we're off from PING here, right? So we're off"
01:00:52,740;01:00:59,900;"Yeah, I was I've read a little civilization. We're all I was reading another book by Bill Bryson something about the body"
01:00:59,900;01:01:07,940;"And apparently the color of your skin is literally like the top paper thin layer of your your epidermis"
01:01:07,940;01:01:12,920;"That's the only thing who is different between you and Patrick Mahomes Craig"
01:01:12,920;01:01:13,920;"Yeah."
01:01:13,920;01:01:14,920;"It was that top layer."
01:01:14,920;01:01:16,920;"And I have a stronger arm."
01:01:16,920;01:01:19,920;"Well, you do have a button in plane as well."
01:01:19,920;01:01:20,920;"Yeah."
01:01:20,920;01:01:22,920;"Better looking wife."
01:01:22,920;01:01:23,920;"Oh shit."
01:01:23,920;01:01:25,920;"Shots fired."
01:01:25,920;01:01:26,920;"They're not married though."
01:01:26,920;01:01:27,920;"I know."
01:01:27,920;01:01:28,920;"We're an idiot."
01:01:28,920;01:01:29,920;"Twenty five years old."
01:01:29,920;01:01:32,920;"He's about to make half a billion dollars."
01:01:32,920;01:01:34,920;"Yeah, that's ridiculous."
01:01:34,920;01:01:36,920;"I said make him an idiot."
01:01:36,920;01:01:37,920;"I'm pretty."
01:01:37,920;01:01:40,920;"I would immediately divorce my wife."
01:01:40,920;01:01:43,180;"(laughing)"
01:01:43,180;01:01:48,020;"- Now it's 12 minutes in, I'm gonna cut this"
01:01:48,020;01:01:49,380;"so I can send it to Kelly."
01:01:49,380;01:01:51,380;"(laughing)"
01:01:51,380;01:01:54,540;"- No, just pull the fucking Steve McNair."
01:01:54,540;01:01:55,980;"There's a warning."
01:01:55,980;01:01:56,940;"(laughing)"
01:01:56,940;01:01:57,840;"There's the warning."
01:01:57,840;01:01:58,680;"- Right."
01:01:58,680;01:02:00,580;"(laughing)"
01:02:00,580;01:02:01,460;"- Oh fuck."
01:02:01,460;01:02:03,300;"- There it is."
01:02:03,300;01:02:06,700;"Speaking of worse, I have another worse"
01:02:06,700;01:02:09,220;"and it's our stat check department."
01:02:09,220;01:02:15,860;"and this probably includes me. But we talked about how in the snowball game Tom Brady's"
01:02:15,860;01:02:22,320;"rushing touchdown was the longest in his career. Yeah, it wasn't. Oh, it was a touchdown in"
01:02:22,320;01:02:28,340;"this game. It was everybody remembers. Yeah, for a whole 10 yards for a QB sneak for 10"
01:02:28,340;01:02:32,980;"yards. Yeah, it wasn't even like it was a design QB sneak. Yeah, it was a goose center"
01:02:32,980;01:02:34,980;"and ran off his ass."
01:02:34,980;01:02:36,180;"- Goostin."
01:02:36,180;01:02:37,020;"- Goostin."
01:02:37,020;01:02:38,740;"- That's the longest sneak of all time."
01:02:38,740;01:02:40,060;"- There's 10 yard, 10 yard touchdown"
01:02:40,060;01:02:41,980;"as long as his career."
01:02:41,980;01:02:43,060;"So. - Wow."
01:02:43,060;01:02:44,060;"- Good for him."
01:02:44,060;01:02:45,660;"- That's gonna be as long as QB sneak anywhere"
01:02:45,660;01:02:47,220;"on the field though."
01:02:47,220;01:02:49,340;"He could have kept going for 20 yards."
01:02:49,340;01:02:51,300;"- So I'm sure it's as long as QB sneak, yeah,"
01:02:51,300;01:02:52,500;"but he's had longer run."
01:02:52,500;01:02:55,340;"I think as long as he's like 20 something yards."
01:02:55,340;01:02:56,180;"- I was supposed to get to--"
01:02:56,180;01:02:57,500;"- Where everyone in the middle of the bench."
01:02:57,500;01:02:58,340;"- Play was."
01:02:58,340;01:03:01,620;"- I thought he looked a little faster now than he does,"
01:03:01,620;01:03:03,980;"or sorry, then then he does now."
01:03:03,980;01:03:06,140;"He looks pretty slow now when he runs."
01:03:06,140;01:03:09,140;"- To be fair, he's what, 40 for the year, so."
01:03:09,140;01:03:10,620;"- That's true."
01:03:10,620;01:03:12,660;"- 20 years, yeah, I'll do that to him, man."
01:03:12,660;01:03:13,500;"- Yeah, we're still talking about you."
01:03:13,500;01:03:15,580;"- I'm a little slower now, too, than I was in high school."
01:03:15,580;01:03:17,340;"- We're trying to get Scott to do a 40-yard dash"
01:03:17,340;01:03:19,060;"and see if he's faster than Tom Brady or not."
01:03:19,060;01:03:19,900;"He's convinced--"
01:03:19,900;01:03:21,060;"- I feel like we should all do that."
01:03:21,060;01:03:23,380;"- I'll do that, I'm definitely fast, too."
01:03:23,380;01:03:24,700;"- So I have to--"
01:03:24,700;01:03:27,540;"- You said it earlier, and it's like 5.2 or something like that?"
01:03:27,540;01:03:30,020;"- It was like 5.2.8, yeah, something like that."
01:03:30,020;01:03:31,620;"I think I've got that."
01:03:31,620;01:03:33,420;"- It's all about the start."
01:03:33,420;01:03:34,740;"- Yeah, there's no way I have that."
01:03:34,740;01:03:36,100;"- We're having scary too."
01:03:36,100;01:03:39,260;"- That was the word on the street, but yeah."
01:03:39,260;01:03:41,620;"- All right, I have one more note."
01:03:41,620;01:03:44,580;"All right, I have an apology to make,"
01:03:44,580;01:03:46,860;"specifically to Steve."
01:03:46,860;01:03:48,900;"I listened to the sum of the episodes"
01:03:48,900;01:03:49,860;"from the middle of the summer,"
01:03:49,860;01:03:52,740;"and I was being a dick to you."
01:03:52,740;01:03:54,740;"(both laughing)"
01:03:54,740;01:03:56,920;"I want you to know that I listened to it,"
01:03:56,920;01:04:00,360;"And I was being an asshole and I apologize, Steve."
01:04:00,360;01:04:01,320;"I wasn't mad at you."
01:04:01,320;01:04:03,000;"I was mad at myself, okay?"
01:04:03,000;01:04:07,400;"I was struggling through quarantine and I'm sorry."
01:04:07,400;01:04:10,240;"That being said, there it is."
01:04:10,240;01:04:13,120;"I was like, ""Really, shoot a drop."""
01:04:13,120;01:04:16,720;"I asked for a timestamp in the week eight game"
01:04:16,720;01:04:21,120;"against the Broncos at 45 minutes into that episode."
01:04:21,120;01:04:23,600;"You made the claim that Ryan Tannehill"
01:04:24,600;01:04:27,020;"and Josh Allen were terrible quarterbacks."
01:04:27,020;01:04:29,060;"And I said, we're gonna give weekly updates"
01:04:29,060;01:04:30,780;"once the NFL started."
01:04:30,780;01:04:31,620;"So,"
01:04:31,620;01:04:37,260;"we check our notes here, Steve."
01:04:37,260;01:04:38,100;"- Look out."
01:04:38,100;01:04:40,460;"- Week one, NFL."
01:04:40,460;01:04:44,380;"Ryan Tanhill, 29 of 43 for 249 yards,"
01:04:44,380;01:04:47,860;"two touchdowns and no picks, 97.9 or 18,"
01:04:47,860;01:04:51,820;"including a game winning drive in the fourth quarter."
01:04:51,820;01:04:54,140;"Josh Allen. - 16 points."
01:04:54,140;01:05:01,920;"Josh Allen, 33 of 46 for 312 yards, two touchdowns, no peaks and a 104.6 rating in a win for"
01:05:01,920;01:05:02,920;"the Buffalo Bills."
01:05:02,920;01:05:03,920;"Who do they be?"
01:05:03,920;01:05:04,920;"Against the Jets."
01:05:04,920;01:05:05,920;"The case is not closed."
01:05:05,920;01:05:09,180;"I will admit that, but I will update every week."
01:05:09,180;01:05:11,680;"It seems like you're losing the argument after week one though."
01:05:11,680;01:05:13,720;"I feel I'm pretty confident."
01:05:13,720;01:05:16,140;"Less so in Josh Allen, more so in Ryan's hand."
01:05:16,140;01:05:18,440;"I'm on Team Greg for sure."
01:05:18,440;01:05:19,440;"Both those guys are solid."
01:05:19,440;01:05:21,000;"Do you have them on your fancy team?"
01:05:21,000;01:05:22,000;"I don't."
01:05:22,000;01:05:23,960;"I just like them."
01:05:23,960;01:05:26,160;"Josh Allen, I think is the truth."
01:05:26,160;01:05:28,440;"- He threw 300 yards, I think he could be good."
01:05:28,440;01:05:30,280;"- He's a roller coaster, he can be really good or really bad."
01:05:30,280;01:05:31,400;"I think Tanya Hill sucks."
01:05:31,400;01:05:32,520;"And then we all know Tanya Hill sucks."
01:05:32,520;01:05:34,240;"We watched him in the office for years."
01:05:34,240;01:05:35,720;"- I think Steve might be able to throw"
01:05:35,720;01:05:37,920;"for 300 yards against the Jets, though."
01:05:37,920;01:05:38,760;"- Yeah."
01:05:38,760;01:05:39,920;"- It's just based on pure anger alone."
01:05:39,920;01:05:41,400;"(laughs)"
01:05:41,400;01:05:42,760;"- But like we were saying in that--"
01:05:42,760;01:05:44,240;"- That was so much shitty."
01:05:44,240;01:05:45,080;"- Yeah."
01:05:45,080;01:05:47,760;"- In that episode, we were saying that it's very circumstantial"
01:05:47,760;01:05:48,960;"of how good a quarterback is."
01:05:48,960;01:05:51,640;"Like you're on a bag organization."
01:05:51,640;01:05:52,480;"- Yeah."
01:05:52,480;01:05:54,780;"And we've only seen Tanahil on the dolphin."
01:05:54,780;01:05:58,140;"So it could be a product of being on a shitty team."
01:05:58,140;01:05:59,440;"- That's true."
01:05:59,440;01:06:01,380;"- I mean, I'm darn old, six out of one."
01:06:01,380;01:06:04,460;"- Nick Foles is only good in the playoffs somehow."
01:06:04,460;01:06:06,340;"So I don't get that at all."
01:06:06,340;01:06:08,380;"- I can't hurt a bunch of different coaches too though."
01:06:08,380;01:06:09,580;"He had a bunch of different systems"
01:06:09,580;01:06:11,500;"to try and succeed in, but."
01:06:11,500;01:06:12,700;"- Right, Tanahil?"
01:06:12,700;01:06:13,740;"- Yeah."
01:06:13,740;01:06:14,580;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:06:14,580;01:06:19,580;"- I get a question, a theoretical question."
01:06:20,740;01:06:26,020;"Who's career would you rather have Nick Foles or Ryan Fitzpatrick?"
01:06:26,020;01:06:27,020;"Nick Foles."
01:06:27,020;01:06:27,780;"Yeah, Foles for sure."
01:06:27,780;01:06:28,580;"Foles."
01:06:28,580;01:06:29,900;"Yeah, definitely."
01:06:29,900;01:06:32,860;"I mean, just just compare nicknames."
01:06:32,860;01:06:35,580;"I think that kind of answered your question."
01:06:35,580;01:06:37,220;"No, it's magic is."
01:06:37,220;01:06:38,500;"That's an awesome."
01:06:38,500;01:06:39,780;"It's a lot of it."
01:06:39,780;01:06:42,740;"But it's also it's tragic."
01:06:42,740;01:06:46,580;"I may be a better comparison to be like Doug foodie or if it's magic, I feel"
01:06:46,580;01:06:47,540;"they're pretty similar."
01:06:48,820;01:06:53,580;"I think I think he made Fitzpatrick made more money."
01:06:53,580;01:06:56,260;"If it's Fitzpatrick and Doug."
01:06:56,260;01:06:58,940;"It's Patrick because I like to reach things on the top shelf."
01:06:58,940;01:07:04,860;"I don't have that because he did that drop kick."
01:07:04,860;01:07:08,380;"He seemed to play a little bit more than just quarterback on shit teams forever."
01:07:08,380;01:07:09,060;"He did."
01:07:09,060;01:07:10,060;"He also played for the Patriots."
01:07:10,060;01:07:12,180;"So that's a plus."
01:07:12,180;01:07:16,100;"Also, I don't know if you know this, but both of them super good for the bills."
01:07:17,140;01:07:18,580;"Fitzpatrick went to Harvard."
01:07:18,580;01:07:19,820;"So that's pretty sad."
01:07:19,820;01:07:22,620;"You did."
01:07:22,620;01:07:24,540;"Why doesn't anybody ever say that?"
01:07:24,540;01:07:25,780;"People forget that."
01:07:25,780;01:07:27,140;"Who would guess that?"
01:07:27,140;01:07:29,780;"Oh, fuck."
01:07:29,780;01:07:33,580;"I actually wrote a blog about this."
01:07:33,580;01:07:34,620;"You did?"
01:07:34,620;01:07:36,540;"Which one?"
01:07:36,540;01:07:39,620;"You don't read my blogs that I put on our website, Andy."
01:07:39,620;01:07:40,380;"I do."
01:07:40,380;01:07:42,740;"But you haven't written one in so long, I've forgotten them."
01:07:42,740;01:07:43,780;"Sir."
01:07:43,780;01:07:45,620;"Let's see here."
01:07:45,660;01:07:48,600;"I broke it down by a few different categories."
01:07:48,600;01:07:54,060;"Off the field reputation, I gave it to Falls for the big dick, Nick."
01:07:54,060;01:07:55,000;"Fair."
01:07:55,000;01:08:01,020;"Legacy, I gave it to Nick Falls because he won a Super Bowl."
01:08:01,020;01:08:01,580;"Yep."
01:08:01,580;01:08:05,260;"Money fits Patrick has made more."
01:08:05,260;01:08:09,900;"He made 58 million compared to 30 for Nick Falls."
01:08:09,900;01:08:10,980;"Nick Falls is younger."
01:08:10,980;01:08:11,540;"That was me."
01:08:11,540;01:08:12,940;"So we still got a few years on him."
01:08:12,940;01:08:13,740;"Yeah."
01:08:13,740;01:08:14,220;"Yeah."
01:08:14,220;01:08:15,820;"I noticed this Patrick though."
01:08:15,820;01:08:16,820;"Might change."
01:08:16,820;01:08:19,520;"Future prospects."
01:08:19,520;01:08:25,180;"I think if you're talking about who could have like who could make the next step"
01:08:25,180;01:08:27,460;"like into the booth, it's definitely Fitzpatrick, right?"
01:08:27,460;01:08:28,460;"Definitely."
01:08:28,460;01:08:28,980;"I am."
01:08:28,980;01:08:29,860;"I'm a charisma."
01:08:29,860;01:08:31,260;"Yeah, he's a high rate guy."
01:08:31,260;01:08:32,700;"He's probably smart."
01:08:32,700;01:08:35,100;"He got a 49 on the fucking."
01:08:35,100;01:08:37,340;"Oh, I wonder like it on the wonder like."
01:08:37,340;01:08:38,500;"What a dick."
01:08:38,500;01:08:41,620;"And then finally I based them on sex appeal."
01:08:41,620;01:08:44,660;"And I mean, it's pretty clear that Fitzpatrick wins that one."
01:08:44,660;01:08:45,660;"That's true."
01:08:45,660;01:08:46,660;"Oh, yeah."
01:08:46,660;01:08:47,660;"It was the beard."
01:08:47,660;01:08:48,660;"Is this a new blog poster?"
01:08:48,660;01:08:49,660;"This is what he had."
01:08:49,660;01:08:52,500;"No, I wrote it back when he was when he was on Tampa Bay."
01:08:52,500;01:08:56,540;"And remember he showed up at that press conference with sunglasses and the chest hair coming"
01:08:56,540;01:08:57,540;"out?"
01:08:57,540;01:09:00,500;"That's what I wrote it because I was like, Oh, man, this guy is fucking killing it right"
01:09:00,500;01:09:01,500;"now."
01:09:01,500;01:09:05,540;"Yeah, that was that was peak Fitzpatrick, wasn't because he didn't come in for Winston and"
01:09:05,540;01:09:07,540;"throw like four touchdowns or something."
01:09:07,540;01:09:08,540;"Yeah."
01:09:08,540;01:09:09,540;"Yeah."
01:09:09,540;01:09:10,540;"Just towards somebody."
01:09:10,540;01:09:15,800;"that the Patriots sign in for like one year as a backup. Like Brian Horan moves on. Stick"
01:09:15,800;01:09:16,800;"Fitzpatrick back there."
01:09:16,800;01:09:23,560;"I don't know if they could afford them. I found it back up. I found an Eagles fan that has"
01:09:23,560;01:09:33,680;"a tattoo of it says it's an Eagle perched on a Lombardi with a Brady jersey in its hand"
01:09:33,680;01:09:35,800;"And it says big dick neck over it."
01:09:35,800;01:09:42,440;"As you do imagine, get so Philadelphia to get it."
01:09:42,440;01:09:45,920;"Completely forgetting about the first one."
01:09:45,920;01:09:50,160;"So just another man's penis tattooed on you, essentially."
01:09:50,160;01:09:54,360;"But just think what would happen."
01:09:54,360;01:09:58,920;"Just think of the tattoos that will come out of a Buffalo bills, Super Bowl victory."
01:09:58,920;01:10:00,040;"Oh, yeah."
01:10:00,040;01:10:02,520;"They've been like full back tattoos."
01:10:02,640;01:10:05,680;"Yeah, in that same vein, which is great."
01:10:05,680;01:10:11,760;"I didn't realize that I get it on me, but the music city miracle was the year before"
01:10:11,760;01:10:15,040;"was like 99, right? Yep. Yeah."
01:10:15,040;01:10:20,960;"So that's the last time Buffalo was kind of in the playoffs and relevant."
01:10:20,960;01:10:25,760;"They were at least not won a home playoff game since then, right?"
01:10:25,760;01:10:28,000;"Didn't they win the week before and then that happened?"
01:10:28,000;01:10:30,160;"Something like that might be right."
01:10:30,160;01:10:32,200;"I don't know how card route though. It was like the"
01:10:32,200;01:10:36,920;"Division or something like that. Yeah, there was that was the year that flute"
01:10:36,920;01:10:41,820;"He started like all the games and got into the playoffs and then they put Rob Johnson in in the 2017"
01:10:41,820;01:10:45,200;"And he lit it up so they started him in the playoffs"
01:10:45,200;01:10:52,280;"Well, didn't they put flute back in and he brought it back and then the day and then the miracle happened did for dog"
01:10:52,280;01:10:54,520;"It Buffalo hasn't won a home playoff game since"
01:10:54,520;01:10:57,720;"Whatever before that was since Jim Kelly"
01:10:57,720;01:10:58,220;"Kelly."
01:10:58,220;01:10:59,220;"Yeah."
01:10:59,220;01:11:00,820;"That's tough."
01:11:00,820;01:11:01,620;"Not good."
01:11:01,620;01:11:04,940;"Still rugby bills and lines."
01:11:04,940;01:11:06,500;"Yeah, that was eye opening."
01:11:06,500;01:11:08,700;"Listening to Alliance fan talk about."
01:11:08,700;01:11:14,860;"And then watching week one where they just got absolutely"
01:11:14,860;01:11:18,900;"wrecked at the end was mad on the group chat."
01:11:18,900;01:11:19,700;"I'm surprised."
01:11:19,700;01:11:21,300;"I feel like he'd be numb to that by now."
01:11:21,300;01:11:23,660;"But I guess he was so pissed."
01:11:23,660;01:11:26,100;"He was yelling at all us."
01:11:26,100;01:11:30,740;"you're complaining about for not like the Celtics losing or something stupid like that."
01:11:30,740;01:11:34,340;"Yeah, whatever. That was pretty bad though."
01:11:34,340;01:11:44,420;"That classic lions. What's the next terrible way that they're going to lose like what's worse?"
01:11:44,420;01:11:48,260;"Like how can they lose worse? What's happening? Well, they'll find a way. Don't put limits on"
01:11:48,260;01:11:54,500;"their creativity Scott. They'll be. Yeah, that's fair. Like they'll fumble it on like a kneel to"
01:11:54,500;01:11:55,700;"Run the clock out."
01:11:55,700;01:11:57,660;"That'd be a good thing."
01:11:57,660;01:11:59,860;"Throw it over his head by accident."
01:11:59,860;01:12:01,660;"They'll return it for a touchdown."
01:12:01,660;01:12:03,700;"Sorry, Trevor."
01:12:03,700;01:12:05,060;"I did see."
01:12:05,060;01:12:08,180;"I have some blog post or something back in the day."
01:12:08,180;01:12:12,580;"Some guy, a Browns fan ranked all the Browns losses by how heartbreaking they were."
01:12:12,580;01:12:16,380;"Starting with the like the most heartbreaking all the way through."
01:12:16,380;01:12:18,340;"And it was like hundreds of them."
01:12:18,340;01:12:21,740;"And they were just like, you know, a couple lines for each game."
01:12:22,420;01:12:28,540;"And just the way that the Cleveland Browns can lose football games will blow your absolute mind."
01:12:28,540;01:12:29,940;"I really incredible."
01:12:29,940;01:12:33,700;"She looked that up and attached to this show notes."
01:12:33,700;01:12:36,540;"OK, yeah, every Browns lost since 1999 ranked."
01:12:36,540;01:12:39,180;"How many are there?"
01:12:39,180;01:12:44,380;"It's got to be a 186."
01:12:44,380;01:12:46,220;"Oh,"
01:12:46,220;01:12:50,620;"Alex, 86, 186 through 138."
01:12:50,620;01:12:51,940;"These aren't that bad."
01:12:52,300;01:12:54,300;"[laughter]"
01:12:54,300;01:12:58,280;"Yeah, let's just pick one random."
01:12:58,280;01:12:59,780;"- That was the first."
01:12:59,780;01:13:04,540;"- Number 67 at Baltimore 2004, week nine, 27 to 13."
01:13:04,540;01:13:07,500;"In a game that included a seven yard punt by the Browns,"
01:13:07,500;01:13:10,380;"the typical interception by Ed Reed in his own end zone"
01:13:10,380;01:13:13,380;"was returned to 160 yards for the game ceiling touchdown."
01:13:13,380;01:13:15,900;"[laughter]"
01:13:15,900;01:13:18,380;"- And that was what, number 67?"
01:13:18,380;01:13:20,380;"What's number one? - 67."
01:13:20,380;01:13:21,700;"- Got out."
01:13:21,700;01:13:23,700;"All right, really?"
01:13:23,700;01:13:29,460;"Maybe let's wait for the Cleveland game free throw them and then do that. Okay. All right. We'll save some of these"
01:13:29,460;01:13:35,640;"We could do a browns on brands just on this post browns on brands on brands. Yeah, this is"
01:13:35,640;01:13:40,460;"This bad. It's 2001 was the number one game"
01:13:40,460;01:13:44,540;"You want"
01:13:44,540;01:13:48,060;"These are bad. Oh the the loss against New England where they were up"
01:13:49,060;01:13:55,340;"26 14 and then we came back with the on-site's kick. Yeah, that's number six mark for our"
01:13:55,340;01:14:00,340;"day was at that game and left early and had to listen to it in the parking lot"
01:14:00,340;01:14:03,760;"never leave a game early. Yeah,"
01:14:03,760;01:14:07,660;"Patriots scored touchdown with 61 seconds left recover the on-site's kick and then"
01:14:07,660;01:14:15,740;"score another touchdown 30 seconds later to win 27 20 six. Oh, yeah, that was number six."
01:14:15,740;01:14:17,960;"That's not even top five not even top five"
01:14:17,960;01:14:22,520;"All right, let's save it for the Browns all right"
01:14:22,520;01:14:25,600;"Titans I don't think I have anything else on the Titans"
01:14:25,600;01:14:29,920;"You can call them the tits which is really cool. Oh"
01:14:29,920;01:14:33,660;"The Titans of industry"
01:14:33,660;01:14:37,580;"All right boys"
01:14:37,580;01:14:39,580;"What do we have next week?"
01:14:39,580;01:14:44,560;"Next week we are at home against the Jets in a game that has playoff implications"
01:14:44,900;01:14:46,900;"Yeah, I just skip through I see"
01:14:46,900;01:14:56,620;"A little bit yeah, I don't think we're gonna want to talk about the chess game, but yeah"
01:14:56,620;01:15:01,620;"Greg remember remember when we were at the Titans game Greg and"
01:15:01,620;01:15:09,740;"We were just getting the doors blown off. This is like two years ago. We went to nationally peel it money and"
01:15:10,900;01:15:12,980;"And then it's got the shit kicked out of us."
01:15:12,980;01:15:14,260;"I was wearing your starter jacket."
01:15:14,260;01:15:16,100;"And I want to leave and you're like,"
01:15:16,100;01:15:18,740;"you got to sit and take your lumps."
01:15:18,740;01:15:21,540;"So I think it's the Jets episode next week."
01:15:21,540;01:15:22,540;"That's true."
01:15:22,540;01:15:23,040;"That's right."
01:15:23,040;01:15:25,740;"I think you should get blind drunk for it though."
01:15:25,740;01:15:26,540;"Who are we playing?"
01:15:26,540;01:15:27,260;"The Jets?"
01:15:27,260;01:15:30,940;"The Jets at home with playoff implications."
01:15:30,940;01:15:32,620;"I don't think I'm saying anything when I tell you,"
01:15:32,620;01:15:34,900;"it doesn't go great."
01:15:34,900;01:15:37,220;"All right."
01:15:37,220;01:15:38,580;"I'll be there."
01:15:38,580;01:15:40,140;"I'm not going to talk about the game though."
01:15:40,140;01:15:41,140;"That's my promise."
01:15:41,140;01:15:45,140;"It's like I'll show up, but I'm going to make a mockery of the pot."
01:15:45,140;01:15:46,540;"So how is this?"
01:15:46,540;01:15:47,940;"Any different from any other."
01:15:47,940;01:15:48,940;"Let me guess."
01:15:48,940;01:15:53,620;"You're not going to watch the game either."
01:15:53,620;01:15:54,940;"What do you want me to research, Andy?"
01:15:54,940;01:15:57,380;"I'll find something that's completely unrelated."
01:15:57,380;01:15:58,380;"I'll give you something."
01:15:58,380;01:16:02,060;"You gave us a great story about Steve McNair."
01:16:02,060;01:16:03,980;"I've heard about David Buster's waitresses."
01:16:03,980;01:16:04,980;"Yeah."
01:16:04,980;01:16:05,980;"Not everything."
01:16:05,980;01:16:10,100;"That's my niche here is I'm the research guy, not the watch guy."
01:16:10,100;01:16:16,020;"I like that. Yeah. You're the derailer. Yes. That is well."
01:16:16,020;01:16:22,820;"Uh huh. So if you have any, uh, any comments about any of the Brown brothers, what are we saying?"
01:16:22,820;01:16:29,380;"Uh, tell us who is your least favorite Wyatt, Steve, and buy how much? You can, uh, go, you can"

01:16:41,580;01:16:43,340;"I'll just get Trevor to give me a really nice one."

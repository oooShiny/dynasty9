00:40,180;00:42,180;"Where do you think Greg does on vacation?"
00:42,180;00:45,540;"Fat shitload of nothing"
00:45,540;00:47,540;"He hates doing nothing though"
00:47,540;00:52,120;"He's probably sitting there right now being like, you know shit. I should have gone on the podcast"
00:52,120;00:54,700;"I sure brought my my convocation with me"
00:55,180;00:59,640;"But he did break because he's still up north and last week we recorded"
00:59,640;01:04,600;"The episode yeah when when he and I were together so we have it"
01:04,600;01:10,020;"That sounds about right for Greg taking like five weeks off. Yeah, exactly"
01:10,020;01:13,220;"Including from the podcast. Yep"
01:13,220;01:15,260;"so"
01:15,260;01:16,820;"speaking of"
01:16,820;01:19,020;"Taking time off this week is"
01:20,220;01:25,940;"No, not the bye week. I didn't really work. No, I was trying to figure out how to integrate that. I don't know so you could have be an"
01:25,940;01:28,220;"vacation. I think"
01:28,220;01:30,420;"Dante call pepper where she was"
01:30,420;01:37,820;"Like not gonna still reach now. Not your not your best apparently I'm still on vacation to you. How about that?"
01:37,820;01:47,100;"Yeah, so this is as I've alluded to badly a few times the Viking is coming to town 2002 week 12"
01:47,100;01:50,060;"week Tom Brady"
01:50,060;01:56,380;"I feel like we never play the Vikings. This is one of the teams that you just don't see."
01:56,380;02:00,220;"It's yeah, it's true. I was thinking that when I was watching, like, how many games"
02:00,220;02:04,700;"could there possibly be against the Vikings? Can't even think of another Vikings game."
02:04,700;02:11,700;"I can think of one. Oh, not this. I think this is before the Tom Brady era, the one"
02:11,700;02:15,300;"I'm thinking of where the Vikings had the best run defense. The Patriots came out"
02:15,300;02:16,300;"Let's look at it."
02:16,300;02:17,900;"I don't know."
02:17,900;02:19,300;"So I got nothing."
02:19,300;02:20,540;"Let's see."
02:20,540;02:22,620;"Um, Minnesota Vikings."
02:22,620;02:25,380;"Let's go to the Patriots dynasty info."
02:25,380;02:25,580;"Yeah."
02:25,580;02:27,140;"Pages that I've ever."
02:27,140;02:29,700;"Slash search slash games."
02:29,700;02:32,100;"Patriots have played the Vikings."
02:32,100;02:34,100;"Six times."
02:34,100;02:34,740;"What?"
02:34,740;02:36,780;"Including 2000."
02:36,780;02:38,980;"So the year before we started doing this."
02:38,980;02:40,380;"They played them."
02:40,380;02:44,340;"And then this year no two and then you're every four years."
02:44,340;02:44,900;"So that makes sense."
02:44,900;02:50,420;"So six or 10, 2010, 2010 to any 14, 2018."
02:50,420;02:53,420;"Oh, I remember 2018, not this past season, the season before."
02:53,420;02:54,940;"Yeah, I don't remember this at all."
02:54,940;02:56,580;"I remember games have been closed."
02:56,580;02:57,900;"You remember Kirk cousins?"
02:57,900;02:58,500;"Nope."
02:58,500;03:01,300;"I mean, I remember when he was in the Redskins."
03:01,300;03:02,140;"Yeah, no, I remember."
03:02,140;03:05,100;"I don't remember the game because the Patriots"
03:05,100;03:06,700;"unleashed their--"
03:06,700;03:09,980;"There's so many names for it, like the Amoeba defense,"
03:09,980;03:12,140;"where nobody lines up like with their hand down"
03:12,140;03:13,540;"on the ground."
03:13,540;03:16,340;"and they were just kind of milling around so the and the offense can't figure out"
03:16,340;03:18,220;"who's rushing"
03:18,220;03:21,300;"and they did it against Kirk Cousins and he had no answer for it because that was"
03:21,300;03:22,540;"the year I think Adam"
03:22,540;03:26,540;"Thelen was like leading the league and touchdown receptions and he had like"
03:26,540;03:30,340;"one catch in that game or something ridiculous you know typical Patriots game"
03:30,340;03:33,540;"like I'm not debating that they played it I just don't remember this at all"
03:33,540;03:36,780;"I don't remember any other Vikings game I don't even remember this one"
03:36,780;03:38,780;"no I don't remember this one at all"
03:38,780;03:40,700;"and those big names in this too"
03:40,700;03:42,340;"What was, what's your Lombardi score?"
03:42,340;03:45,620;"Yeah, three, maybe."
03:45,620;03:48,420;"Yeah, I'm on a three, two and three quarters."
03:48,420;03:51,740;"I don't even know if it's quite a three, because the first half is great."
03:51,740;03:55,340;"First half is where the Patriots scored all the points and the second half is"
03:55,340;03:57,500;"where the Vikings tried to do that."
03:57,500;03:59,980;"I mean, the first three drives where they scored them all."
03:59,980;04:05,340;"But yeah, I mean, if you watch, yeah, like the second quarter, mainly."
04:05,340;04:06,820;"That was exciting."
04:06,820;04:10,580;"But, uh, yeah."
04:10,620;04:12,020;"Let's talk about the score."
04:12,020;04:15,140;"They scored it and Patre's 24 Viking 17."
04:15,140;04:16,780;"The Patre's win this one."
04:16,780;04:19,460;"Improved to six and five."
04:19,460;04:22,420;"And the Vikings would drop to, I think it was three and eight"
04:22,420;04:23,500;"on the season."
04:23,500;04:25,460;"Yeah."
04:25,460;04:28,140;"Which for a team-- let's talk about these Vikings."
04:28,140;04:32,140;"There were some big names on this team for them to be three"
04:32,140;04:32,860;"and eight."
04:32,860;04:36,100;"I only got one big name, Randy Moss."
04:36,100;04:37,780;"Michael Bennett."
04:37,780;04:38,980;"I don't remember the state at all."
04:38,980;04:40,900;"I had no idea who this dude was."
04:40,900;04:43,140;"- Really, I remember him, 'cause he was..."
04:43,140;04:44,140;"- They said he was leading the league"
04:44,140;04:46,020;"and rushing at this point, and I don't know."
04:46,020;04:47,380;"- Right, who?"
04:47,380;04:49,280;"- Yeah, see how it'll see Hawkes guy?"
04:49,280;04:51,660;"- No, right, yeah."
04:51,660;04:53,340;"I didn't even put that together, Jesus."
04:53,340;04:54,780;"- That's also what I was like, first thought."
04:54,780;04:57,580;"I was like, is he related to the Bennett brothers?"
04:57,580;05:00,740;"- He can't be."
05:00,740;05:01,580;"I don't know."
05:01,580;05:04,060;"- I don't know either."
05:04,060;05:04,980;"I'm gonna say no."
05:06,740;05:11,100;"And does their parents were that sick and twisted that they named two of their sons,"
05:11,100;05:13,820;"Michael, who and the other one, not Michael."
05:13,820;05:16,140;"So yeah, I don't think it was."
05:16,140;05:22,980;"But I mean, Dante, call pepper, rainy moss that connection alone is in like every"
05:22,980;05:27,300;"late nineties, early 2000s highlight real video you ever see, right?"
05:27,300;05:31,540;"Like rainy moss catching deep bombs from Dante, call pepper."
05:32,500;05:39,760;"Sure sure because I mean this Vikings team was this the same one that basically in"
05:39,760;05:43,020;"One of these year"
05:43,020;05:47,700;"98 all right. Well, it's a little further away. They went 15 and one"
05:47,700;05:53,460;"And then lost in the playoffs to I think you Michael Vick Falcon you think I'm an actor"
05:53,460;05:57,080;"This is before Michael Vick we just saw Mike Vick last week or last year"
05:57,080;06:02,080;"Make his debut. That's true. Yeah, so who is oh is the dirty bird packers"
06:02,080;06:04,080;"Oh, Falcons. That's who it was."
06:04,080;06:04,580;"Oh, yeah."
06:04,580;06:06,080;"Trim all Williams."
06:06,080;06:11,920;"Yeah, but this team was, I think, was that his 1998 was, yeah, that was Randy Moss's rookie"
06:11,920;06:20,240;"year. And he had, he just went off. 1,300 yards, 17 touchdowns. Fucking ridiculous."
06:20,240;06:22,400;"Randy Moss, I mean, like, yeah."
06:22,400;06:27,200;"What you're gonna do on the other side when you catch the ball, you know, your butt hole"
06:27,200;06:28,200;"would pucker up."
06:28,200;06:29,720;"Oh, my God. Yeah."
06:29,720;06:32,880;"He was one of those guys that was like, yeah,"
06:32,880;06:35,240;"like watching Barry Sanders or someone like that,"
06:35,240;06:36,240;"or Michael Vick."
06:36,240;06:38,080;"- Well, I had just watched the hockey"
06:38,080;06:39,680;"in the basketball right before this game."
06:39,680;06:42,640;"So it's like when you're clinging to a one goal lead,"
06:42,640;06:45,840;"you know, and they're passing around your offensive,"
06:45,840;06:48,640;"in their offensive zone, you're just like holding on."
06:48,640;06:49,760;"That's what it was like when Randy Moss"
06:49,760;06:52,000;"was catching the ball in the open field."
06:52,000;06:53,320;"- Yeah, exactly."
06:53,320;06:58,240;"But as good as this team was on paper,"
06:59,280;07:04,780;"I mean, the Vikings had, I think Randy Moss went to the Pro Bowl,"
07:04,780;07:06,440;"as did Michael Band the running back."
07:06,440;07:10,800;"Uh, call Pepper through for almost 4,000 yards, 18 touchdowns,"
07:10,800;07:18,520;"23 interceptions. Uh, Michael Bandit ran for almost 1300 yards and five touchdowns."
07:18,520;07:23,600;"And Randy Moss had 1300 yards receiving and seven touchdowns,"
07:23,600;07:25,800;"which like on paper, that sounds really good."
07:25,800;07:28,400;"Those are some solid stats. Yeah."
07:28,920;07:39,320;"I think though the reason that they were had such a good stats in the three and eight was because they couldn't stop turning the ball over."
07:39,320;07:41,520;"It feels like the modern day jets, you know?"
07:41,520;07:45,520;"Or the, you know, Brett Favre led Packers."
07:45,520;07:47,320;"Exactly."
07:47,320;07:51,920;"He's making the Pro Bowl throwing more interceptions and touchdowns because he sucks."
07:51,920;07:52,920;"But, um,"
07:52,920;07:56,920;"Well, they mentioned Brett Favre and the Packers a couple of times in this game."
07:56,920;08:00,080;"I guess the Vikings had just beat Brett Favre."
08:00,080;08:01,640;"Yeah, the week before."
08:01,640;08:04,080;"Did you look up that game?"
08:04,080;08:05,080;"I didn't."
08:05,080;08:05,480;"Did you?"
08:05,480;08:08,560;"I just did look it up like how Brett Favre did."
08:08,560;08:10,720;"I think he threw like three interceptions in that game."
08:10,720;08:13,320;"That's not great."
08:13,320;08:17,640;"So they beat him 31 21."
08:17,640;08:22,240;"In Minnesota and from what they were talking about, it sounded like."
08:22,240;08:26,720;"The Packers couldn't stop or any moss."
08:26,720;08:32,520;"And the Vikings defensive line gave Brett fire a ton of trouble"
08:32,520;08:37,960;"Which yeah through three interceptions and telling you how many times he was sacked"
08:37,960;08:42,320;"Probably a lot and only two for ten"
08:42,320;08:46,400;"And then they were talking up the"
08:46,400;08:51,840;"Tampa Bay game next week where I was like right after this game. It was the Tampa Bay"
08:51,840;08:52,840;"Brett and"
08:52,840;08:56,600;"Yeah, cuz this game was on Fox. So obviously Fox was big into the"
08:56,600;08:59,600;"The NFC and it was the the"
08:59,600;09:05,480;"Whoever won that game would have the best record in the NFL. So it was a war in sap in the Buccaneers"
09:05,480;09:07,640;"against"
09:07,640;09:13,800;"Brett Favre and the Packers any guesses on how many interceptions he threw in that game three four"
09:13,800;09:19,060;"Yeah"
09:19,060;09:24,300;"21 7 I actually wrote down that this game feels like a prolonged ad for the Packers Bucks game"
09:24,300;09:27,060;"Yeah, they're different"
09:27,060;09:29,220;"It had a little break"
09:29,220;09:31,500;"Wild Wild West"
09:31,500;09:34,820;"32nd video yeah, and then at the end they had another one that was like"
09:34,820;09:39,860;"Because the commentators weren't the 18 me there was Kenny Albert and Tim Green"
09:39,860;09:44,420;"And the only reason I recognize named Tim Green is because that was a childhood friend of mine"
09:44,420;09:47,780;"Yes, yeah, Timmy Green"
09:48,260;09:50,260;"But they weren't"
09:50,260;09:51,580;"Good"
09:51,580;09:54,780;"But they also weren't worth my time to write down anything they said"
09:54,780;10:01,060;"Except for when they were going into because they you they did they had like a couple like 30 second"
10:01,060;10:07,980;"Promos I guess for the coming game and it sounded like cuz at the end they were talking about who made them"
10:07,980;10:13,100;"And they would give them all this credit and I thought I don't think I'd want that credit if I had made those"
10:14,620;10:18,940;"But the first one was like a Western one the second was like a supposed to be like an old school monster movie"
10:18,940;10:26,260;"And it was just like clips of both teams but set to like old school horror movie"
10:26,260;10:31,260;"Music and I"
10:31,260;10:38,500;"Think the commentator was supposed to like talk over but they didn't and so it was just"
10:38,500;10:41,980;"unbelievably awkward"
10:41,980;10:45,500;"Because like and because you could tell that like they were supposedly into it because"
10:45,500;10:52,720;"Tim green was like the game coming up next reminds me of a monster movie and then they like cut into the clip and then he just sat there"
10:52,720;10:53,940;"Didn't say anything"
10:53,940;10:58,980;"Is that where they like circled Lauren sapph is like oh, he's scary right at the end. Yeah. Yeah"
10:58,980;11:05,540;"Doing is like he was yelling because he's got a sack of breath hours. Yeah, like oh look at that. That's a monster face. I"
11:05,540;11:10,680;"Had some other things. I want to talk about the commentators. All right. Yeah, let's get into it"
11:10,680;11:12,280;"I like this. I'm rubbing off on you."
11:12,280;11:17,800;"Well, I don't know if this is them. I think this is more of the media as a whole,"
11:17,800;11:22,200;"but it's like, I wrote down there's a lot of talk about Glovegate going on."
11:22,200;11:23,400;"Oh my god."
11:23,400;11:27,240;"Because I guess at this time, people were dissecting Tom Brady's performance with"
11:27,240;11:28,520;"and without gloves."
11:28,520;11:31,480;"Yeah, so I was actually going to look that up in the globe and then I thought, you know what?"
11:31,480;11:35,640;"I've been driving more this week than I have normally."
11:35,640;11:42,160;"And so I've had, I tried to get back into sports talk radio and I couldn't do it."
11:42,160;11:46,720;"I'm like, I can't, I can't do that to myself for my mental health."
11:46,720;11:48,540;"So I didn't go back and you'll be absolutely right."
11:48,540;11:55,840;"They talked a ton about Brady's cause, because last week against the Raiders,"
11:55,840;12:00,200;"they were talking about it about how he was wearing them on his throwing hand."
12:00,200;12:02,640;"And he started the game without wearing it."
12:02,640;12:06,520;"then he put it on in the second half and he played better and he had it on this game"
12:06,520;12:09,240;"and he started off really good."
12:09,240;12:11,240;"I just like that."
12:11,240;12:14,760;"I don't even think that was ever a thing though, you know, I've never thought about"
12:14,760;12:16,960;"Tom Brady's performance with him without gloves."
12:16,960;12:21,240;"I've certainly talked about it in weather, you know, yeah, you know, who has it."
12:21,240;12:23,240;"That shit just has died out."
12:23,240;12:25,440;"You know what else hasn't talked about it?"
12:25,440;12:27,760;"Everybody fucking Brady."
12:27,760;12:30,240;"Like because they were like, oh, but Tom Brady says it."
12:30,240;12:31,760;"It doesn't matter."
12:31,760;12:34,160;"But maybe it does because he just threw a touchdown."
12:34,160;12:37,480;"Like no, it doesn't matter."
12:37,480;12:38,960;"I'm gonna tell you right now."
12:38,960;12:41,240;"Knowing what's coming."
12:41,240;12:42,640;"It doesn't matter."
12:42,640;12:47,360;"They also insinuated that Richard"
12:47,360;12:50,640;"seemed more faked an injury to get a timeout when he didn't"
12:50,640;12:53,600;"play another snap in the game, which was fucked up."
12:53,600;12:54,800;"Oh, that's right."
12:54,800;12:55,400;"He didn't do you think?"
12:55,400;12:58,640;"Yeah, because the Vikings are all about no huddle in the second half."
12:58,640;12:59,800;"And he got hurt."
12:59,800;13:04,000;"And then they're like, oh, you know, sometimes when you see that, it's faking it."
13:04,000;13:04,720;"Yeah."
13:04,720;13:08,000;"And it was also the other guy who was down was, um, lawyer,"
13:08,000;13:14,040;"Malloy, who like legit left the game in the end of the first half, like"
13:14,040;13:16,640;"due to injury and he got lit up on that play too."
13:16,640;13:19,280;"Cause he had an Antoine Harris sighting, which was awesome."
13:19,280;13:21,480;"Shout out to Twan."
13:21,480;13:22,360;"Yeah."
13:22,360;13:23,360;"Antoine Harris,"
13:23,360;13:24,200;"a rally to a career."
13:24,200;13:26,360;"I've actually had it on there from Raleigh."
13:26,360;13:27,400;"I did."
13:27,400;13:28,000;"Yeah."
13:28,080;13:29,580;"Oh, so in the head of the little bio."
13:29,580;13:30,940;"That's when we got subbed in."
13:30,940;13:35,780;"But speaking of Richard Seymour, I want to bring this up because we, I don't think"
13:35,780;13:41,160;"we touched on it last week, but he, one of the few highlights from the week before"
13:41,160;13:44,040;"was that he, he blocked a field goal."
13:44,040;13:46,620;"And then he did it again this week."
13:46,620;13:49,120;"And this is like no gimmicks of it."
13:49,120;13:51,420;"Not, not like you see, uh, who was it?"
13:51,420;13:56,060;"Like Cassius Marshall and the fucking name was jumping over the, the center to get the block."
13:56,900;13:59,500;"That's James Collins. But yeah, oh, Jamie Collins did it too."
13:59,500;14:00,500;"I think cash the market."
14:00,500;14:02,100;"You may have someone like that."
14:02,100;14:03,700;"Yeah."
14:03,700;14:05,000;"Until they outlawed that."
14:05,000;14:09,540;"Um, but no, this was just like him getting stuck in there,"
14:09,540;14:13,100;"getting his massive frame straight up and putting upon."
14:13,100;14:16,300;"And I'm pretty sure there's more than these two."
14:16,300;14:17,400;"I can remember a few."
14:17,400;14:22,800;"So I'm wondering, has there ever been someone better at blocking field goals?"
14:22,800;14:23,900;"I mean, it's got to be."
14:24,900;14:27,260;"Is that a time to go block leader?"
14:27,260;14:28,900;"That's how you guessed that."
14:28,900;14:34,900;"Oh, Akim Elozhawan with 3,830 blocks."
14:34,900;14:38,820;"- I'm gonna say that doesn't quite work."
14:38,820;14:39,660;"- It'd be fair."
14:39,660;14:42,500;"Gary Anderson did like barely kick it above the line, no."
14:42,500;14:45,260;"- Yeah, oh yeah, this is,"
14:45,260;14:48,340;"fucking Gary Anderson."
14:48,340;14:50,900;"Probably towards the end of his career, I have to thank."
14:50,900;14:52,660;"Right?"
14:53,500;14:54,780;"Yeah, I mean, I don't know."
14:54,780;14:56,420;"He looked like he was playing in the 1950s"
14:56,420;14:59,660;"with that single bar face mask way low."
14:59,660;15:01,620;"Yeah, so he's like half his forehead."
15:01,620;15:03,500;"Yeah, just the one."
15:03,500;15:05,980;"At that point, it's like, dude, just take it off."
15:05,980;15:07,860;"Like you don't need a face mask."
15:07,860;15:09,460;"It's not gonna do anything."
15:09,460;15:11,620;"Probably more harm than good."
15:11,620;15:13,860;"But he only played till 2004."
15:13,860;15:16,220;"You wanna guess when he started kicking field goals?"
15:16,220;15:18,140;"74."
15:18,140;15:19,980;"Jesus, no."
15:19,980;15:22,340;"It's not 100."
15:23,300;15:25,940;"The year before I was born 1982."
15:25,940;15:26,940;"- Cheese."
15:26,940;15:28,940;"- So I played 13 years since I kicked her."
15:28,940;15:31,820;"- And I just looked it up, Ted Hendricks."
15:31,820;15:35,420;"- That's not true."
15:35,420;15:38,140;"- 10 punt blocks and 14 kick blocks."
15:38,140;15:39,500;"- Holy shit."
15:39,500;15:40,420;"- Yes."
15:40,420;15:43,260;"- In 1974 he had seven combined blocks."
15:43,260;15:45,260;"That's insane."
15:45,260;15:46,300;"- Cool Lord."
15:46,300;15:49,180;"- When did he play?"
15:49,180;15:50,900;"Did he tell you what years?"
15:50,900;15:52,340;"- Was this back in like the 50s?"
15:52,340;15:58,940;"I mean, it's 74 so probably, you know, 1969 to 1983."
15:58,940;16:03,420;"Oh, by the way, Gary just didn't play for 23 years, not 13."
16:03,420;16:06,580;"It was 13 with the Steelers before he moved on."
16:06,580;16:07,580;"That's bananas."
16:07,580;16:09,780;"All right, well, I guess it's not."
16:09,780;16:10,780;"Not Richard Seymour."
16:10,780;16:12,340;"Yeah, I'm going through this top list."
16:12,340;16:13,340;"He's not on here, bud."
16:13,340;16:14,340;"Sorry."
16:14,340;16:16,340;"Well, I guess blocking kicks was easier."
16:16,340;16:20,180;"Julius Peppers has 12 field goals on a PAT."
16:20,180;16:21,580;"Damn, I didn't know."
16:21,580;16:22,300;"I mean, it makes sense."
16:22,300;16:22,420;"True."
16:22,420;16:23,500;"The peppers is massive."
16:23,500;16:29,740;"Still, I wouldn't have expected other teams to put those caliber guys on special teams"
16:29,740;16:32,820;"like you do with like about speaking a turnover."
16:32,820;16:37,580;"So how about this new so Viking's team fumble city."
16:37,580;16:42,140;"So they came into like this is this is just like a great team to watch."
16:42,140;16:48,860;"I think they came into the game having the top ranked rushing offense, which"
16:49,060;16:52,340;"or the 2002 page of defense should be a bad sign."
16:52,340;16:52,860;"Yeah."
16:52,860;16:53,400;"Yeah."
16:53,400;16:56,660;"I mean, they've had other team room for 200 yards with not"
16:56,660;16:57,260;"the time."
16:57,260;17:01,100;"They had the third ranked offense overall."
17:01,100;17:04,860;"But they also had the 31st ranked defense."
17:04,860;17:06,540;"Not good."
17:06,540;17:09,060;"They were also the most penalized team in the league,"
17:09,060;17:11,620;"averaging nine penalties a game."
17:11,620;17:14,100;"I don't think they quite got that high in this game, did they?"
17:14,100;17:17,660;"They were on a good pace, but they've cropped it."
17:17,660;17:19,380;"They had eight penalties for 74 yards."
17:19,380;17:21,420;"So, bow right, you're almost average."
17:21,420;17:28,300;"They also were the worst team in the NFL"
17:28,300;17:30,300;"in turnover differential."
17:30,300;17:32,880;"Coming into the game, it was minus 16."
17:32,880;17:36,060;"In 11 games."
17:36,060;17:36,900;"- That's pretty good."
17:36,900;17:39,260;"- Maybe 10 games, depending on, yeah,"
17:39,260;17:41,900;"'cause they were three and seven."
17:41,900;17:45,760;"So yeah, in 10 games, they had a minus 16."
17:47,580;17:50,580;"So they were almost minus two every game."
17:50,580;17:55,020;"In this one, they were worse than that."
17:55,020;17:58,660;"They had four fumbles over the last three."
17:58,660;18:00,340;"And a block field goal."
18:00,340;18:03,140;"And a block field goal, which--"
18:03,140;18:06,460;"I mean, they had three not--"
18:06,460;18:08,420;"three fumbles and then not two fumbles"
18:08,420;18:10,860;"in the field goal block before like mid-second goal."
18:10,860;18:14,220;"Yeah, by the end of the first half--"
18:14,220;18:15,460;"so basically, the way the game went"
18:15,460;18:18,180;"is the Vikings would drive straight down the field"
18:18,180;18:19,860;"and then fuck something up."
18:19,860;18:21,060;"So they got the ball to start."
18:21,060;18:22,620;"First it drives right down the field,"
18:22,620;18:25,780;"get inside the New England 10-yard line"
18:25,780;18:29,900;"and then Dante Culpepper pulls what I would"
18:29,900;18:32,260;"generously say as a Drew Bledsoe."
18:32,260;18:35,420;"And they're trying to do a screen that gets blown up."
18:35,420;18:39,660;"So he just backpedals straight backwards for 14 yards"
18:39,660;18:41,260;"and then throws it out of bounds,"
18:41,260;18:43,020;"but because he's still in the tackle box,"
18:43,020;18:44,860;"it's intentional grounding."
18:44,860;18:46,700;"He's been throwing towards anybody."
18:46,700;18:48,420;"So that backed him out of,"
18:48,420;18:50,620;"it turned into a long field goal."
18:50,620;18:51,780;"- There was a weird column that though,"
18:51,780;18:52,860;"where they put it,"
18:52,860;18:54,740;"to put the ball where he threw it from,"
18:54,740;18:56,020;"I suppose, 10 yards."
18:56,020;18:57,300;"I didn't know that's the thing."
18:57,300;18:59,460;"- Yeah, it's either 10 yards or,"
18:59,460;19:00,380;"- Really?"
19:00,380;19:03,900;"- Yeah, or where it was from, whichever is further back,"
19:03,900;19:04,740;"which is crazy."
19:04,740;19:08,300;"But then, so that field goal blocked"
19:08,300;19:12,300;"because it's now like a like 46 or 48 yard or something"
19:12,300;19:14,820;"like that instead of what would have been a chip shot."
19:14,820;19:18,340;"Um, so the page to get the ball back drives right down Brady,"
19:18,340;19:19,100;"those types of four."
19:19,100;19:23,860;"And then Minnesota,"
19:23,860;19:28,740;"puns it New England gets the ball back and drive all the way."
19:28,740;19:30,740;"Again, another four a touchdown from Brady."
19:30,740;19:36,980;"And then call pepper gets the ball misses Randy Moss deep,"
19:36,980;19:41,980;"like really badly misses him by like 10 yards, which I think is hard to do."
19:41,980;19:46,460;"hard to do with Rainy Moss just by the fact that's what you're supposed to do with Rainy"
19:46,460;19:47,460;"Moss."
19:47,460;19:49,220;"Yeah, just throw it with them 10 yards."
19:49,220;19:50,220;"Some by 10 yards."
19:50,220;19:52,060;"So he must have missed some by 20."
19:52,060;19:53,860;"Exactly."
19:53,860;19:57,620;"And so it's third and long because Minnesota actually started the drive off, fall starting"
19:57,620;19:58,620;"twice."
19:58,620;19:59,620;"Yeah."
19:59,620;20:00,620;"In a row."
20:00,620;20:01,620;"In a row."
20:01,620;20:02,620;"Yeah."
20:02,620;20:05,540;"Which they would do again later in the game."
20:05,540;20:07,700;"It's towards the end of the game."
20:07,700;20:08,700;"That'll have it."
20:08,700;20:09,700;"Yeah."
20:09,700;20:16,660;"And Cole Pepper tries to, I don't think it's supposed to be a QB draw, but he was, he was"
20:16,660;20:18,500;"doing a lot of running in this game."
20:18,500;20:20,900;"So he dropped back in the middle of the field open up."
20:20,900;20:24,460;"So he tried to take off, but he dropped the ball where he got it knocked out of his hand."
20:24,460;20:27,220;"Pages recover and it turned around."
20:27,220;20:28,900;"Brady throws his third touchdown."
20:28,900;20:33,180;"We're basically like 10 minutes into the, we're like five minutes into the second quarter"
20:33,180;20:34,180;"of this point."
20:34,180;20:36,180;"Pages throws another touchdown to Troy Brown this time."
20:36,180;20:38,540;"So now it's 21 nothing."
20:38,540;20:41,940;"Mike Tyson's over there booking love boats. He's like get me out of here"
20:41,940;20:45,460;"Exactly"
20:45,460;20:50,320;"I think it wasn't either coach of the team. Where was the loveboat? I don't remember"
20:50,320;20:55,980;"I don't eat honestly. I don't even know what the love boat is. I just know that really if I can say I'm gonna"
20:55,980;21:00,540;"I'll pissed off Steven. Oh Fred Smoot. Oh 2005. I"
21:00,540;21:03,540;"Don't think I"
21:03,540;21:05,700;"Don't think you boy. Oh no, he was I"
21:06,860;21:13,340;"I was so sick of Mike Tyson my head was loved though. Yeah, and this actually according to Wikipedia"
21:13,340;21:20,740;"Which led to the firing of head coach Mike Tyson was replaced by Brad Childress"
21:20,740;21:26,140;"Who would lead the team to the 2009 NFC Championship game? I don't get it. What do they do?"
21:26,140;21:29,140;"It's on a boat and go like in October in 2005"
21:29,140;21:33,580;"What happened is so this is October right so middle of the season"
21:34,220;21:39,560;"Right September October 2005 and the alleged sex party occurred on Lake Minnetonka with"

22:02,700;22:05,980;"We're gonna have to we're gonna have to come back to that. I think it's some point"
22:05,980;22:13,820;"Troy Williamson Travis Taylor Kevin Williams lance Johnson mo Williams and will he offered we see mo Williams in this game"
22:13,820;22:17,780;"This is also Brian McKinney's like first start"
22:17,780;22:23,260;"There's definitely a year. Yeah, cuz I had some notes on him too. Well, got to him and mo Williams"
22:23,260;22:28,220;"I think was the leading rush of this year to at least with touchdown. Yeah, he was the uh the touchdown back"
22:28,220;22:31,700;"He was the guy that you hated if you were in Phoenix. I wasn't anything yet"
22:32,220;22:38,780;"So here's what happened two house boats were rented and some but not all of the players performed sexual acts in front of crew members"

22:43,820;22:46,620;"He's gonna be 90 people on the two boats"
22:46,620;22:49,460;"90 people on two boats and"

23:39,820;23:43,980;"He referred this act as running through the orca patch."
23:43,980;23:45,580;"Ocrab patch."
23:45,580;23:47,420;"Oh, my goodness."
23:47,420;23:51,340;"Smoot was the alleged ringleader of the entire operation."
23:51,340;23:54,060;"He said to have been the one who hired the boats for the crews."
23:54,980;23:59,100;"uh... smooth whoever is not denied that he was on the boat that night"
23:59,100;24:03,180;"smooth allegedly held a double-headed dildo inserted into the vagina's of two"
24:03,180;24:06,180;"women who are laying on the floor in the lounge area"
24:06,180;24:08,820;"after one woman woman left he continued to"
24:08,820;24:11,860;"quote unquote manipulate the dildo"
24:11,860;24:15,660;"inside the other woman in front of the crew"
24:15,660;24:16,760;"i need to read that"
24:16,760;24:19,740;"friend suit a_m_a_"
24:19,740;24:21,560;"yeah i think if we can find it"
24:21,560;24:23,160;"Oh yeah, it's right there to quick Google."
24:23,160;24:23,960;"Yeah, it is."
24:23,960;24:25,460;"All right, we'll have to link this in the--"
24:25,460;24:27,160;"What's the love bow worth it?"
24:27,160;24:28,360;"That's the first one."
24:28,360;24:31,360;"[LAUGHING]"
24:31,360;24:34,460;"Man, everybody asks you something about that damn boat."
24:34,460;24:35,660;"No shit, buddy."
24:35,660;24:39,660;"[LAUGHING]"
24:39,660;24:40,760;"I don't know if I'd say it was worth it,"
24:40,760;24:42,760;"but I wouldn't change Anthony my past."
24:42,760;24:44,760;"[LAUGHING]"
24:44,760;24:45,960;"Oh, man."
24:45,960;24:48,360;"This guy is--"
24:48,360;24:50,960;"but Jermaine Wiggins, wiggy, was in there."
24:50,960;24:54,240;"I did not even really played for the Vikings."
24:54,240;24:57,040;"- Yeah, I think you left the,"
24:57,040;24:58,800;"the pages this current season."
24:58,800;25:00,360;"Like after 2000."
25:00,360;25:01,800;"- Yeah, should have stuck around"
25:01,800;25:03,280;"when it comes to having more rings."
25:03,280;25:05,880;"- Yeah, and steady ended up on the love boat."
25:05,880;25:06,800;"The smooth boat."
25:06,800;25:09,120;"- The smooth boat."
25:09,120;25:10,720;"Smooth, smooth, all aboard."
25:10,720;25:14,160;"(laughing)"
25:14,160;25:16,880;"- Gone to the Orkra patch later."
25:16,880;25:20,320;"- The Okra patch, the Orkra."
25:20,320;25:21,320;"Whatever."
25:21,320;25:23,480;"Whole different meaning."
25:23,480;25:26,160;"Some sort of like squid or something, right?"
25:26,160;25:27,000;"OK, no."
25:27,000;25:27,800;"OK, it's like a--"
25:27,800;25:30,880;"I know."
25:30,880;25:33,560;"I'm not to Google that."
25:33,560;25:34,280;"I don't get it."
25:34,280;25:37,720;"Doesn't look like a pussy at all."
25:37,720;25:39,600;"How are you running through?"
25:39,600;25:40,640;"OK, Padra."
25:40,640;25:42,680;"I don't know."
25:42,680;25:44,320;"Maybe we should ask your main wiggens."
25:44,320;25:49,360;"Yeah, at least probably not enough."
25:49,360;25:52,200;"about to come on"
25:52,200;25:54,940;"speaking of uh... michael bennett"
25:54,940;25:57,500;"go back to the game is his turn to fuck up the storm second"
25:57,500;25:59,240;"quarter"
25:59,240;26:02,480;"and at this point minnesota realizes"
26:02,480;26:05,480;"they have to abandon their game plan so they're in the no-huddle"
26:05,480;26:08,540;"which apparently is one of the reasons they were able to beat"
26:08,540;26:10,840;"greek and we before"
26:10,840;26:12,880;"run the no-huddle and it actually worked"
26:12,880;26:14,120;"pretty well in this game"
26:14,120;26:16,320;"they started running it"
26:16,320;26:20,320;"four drives into the second quarter, because they're already down three touchdowns,"
26:20,320;26:27,080;"drive straight down the field into like the new in the red zone yet again."
26:27,080;26:31,360;"This time, Michael Bennett is one of the fumbles doing the recovers."
26:31,360;26:34,240;"And these were all like really nonchalant fumbles too."
26:34,240;26:38,560;"Like I didn't catch them in real time until the Patriots players were like"
26:38,560;26:41,520;"piling on the ground pointing in their direction. Yeah."
26:41,520;26:42,640;"So then"
26:46,080;26:47,340;"Pages don't do anything."
26:47,340;26:48,900;"Viking get the ball back."
26:48,900;26:53,260;"And this time it is Randy Moss's turn to get as the action where he"
26:53,260;26:55,380;"fumbles newing the recovers."
26:55,380;27:02,140;"And that was almost the end of the half three three turnovers in that one"
27:02,140;27:03,260;"one quarter."
27:03,260;27:07,100;"Pages couldn't capitalize again, even though they were pretty good field"
27:07,100;27:08,100;"position."
27:08,100;27:12,760;"They go three and out and they're in like that area of the field where"
27:12,760;27:14,220;"ballot checkers likes to go for it anyway."
27:14,220;27:17,100;"Regardless of what it is because it's too far for a field goal not worth hunting"
27:17,100;27:21,800;"But Brady gets sacked on fourth down so that didn't work the way they expected and"
27:21,800;27:25,340;"Then right the end and this is like with"
27:25,340;27:29,860;"Like two minutes left. So Minnesota gets the ball back"
27:29,860;27:35,000;"I think under two minutes and they drive straight down the field again this time actually score a touchdown pass"
27:35,000;27:40,820;"Cold pepper so we go going to halftime at twenty one seven. So if you're gonna watch the game, you could just stop it there"
27:40,820;27:42,900;"probably yeah"
27:42,900;27:44,900;"I was like, another."
27:44,900;27:46,900;"Yeah, I'll put the girls on the touch."
27:46,900;27:47,900;"Second half was two."
27:47,900;27:48,900;"Yeah."
27:48,900;27:49,900;"Yeah, I call."
27:49,900;27:52,900;"Everyone throws another touchdown and then the team's true field goal."
27:52,900;27:54,900;"Sorry, I was really busy reading the Fred."
27:54,900;27:55,900;"Food at AMA."
27:55,900;27:56,900;"Nothing really juicy in there."
27:56,900;27:59,900;"I didn't even see the scandals comment."
27:59,900;28:01,900;"No, it was right at the top."
28:01,900;28:08,900;"Wasn't that first comment right on that same, like when the Patriots kind of got sacked on."
28:08,900;28:16,240;"The and that driver the very end of the first half. Yeah, do you see Chris Hovin talking shit to Brady?"
28:16,240;28:19,280;"Down 21 nothing"
28:19,280;28:24,060;"Bro and apparently he had gotten fined the week before for"
28:24,060;28:29,400;"Talking about that for a sec like bro read the room. I"
28:29,400;28:32,740;"You're you're fucking"
28:32,740;28:34,340;"three and seven"
28:34,340;28:38,500;"You're committing most penalties and in the NFL you're losing"
28:38,500;28:44,540;"the turnover battle they had they came in the game with 30 turnovers and so I"
28:44,540;28:47,700;"wrote now they have 31 turnovers worse than the NFL they had to cross that out"
28:47,700;28:52,900;"and had put 32 turnovers and had to cross that out and put 30 so we had 33 turnovers"
28:52,900;29:01,260;"I remember him I don't really wait 2000 to 2009 he looked very familiar yeah he"
29:01,260;29:07,060;"maybe I'm just confusing him with little Romanowski he's like a poor man's"
29:07,060;29:14,280;"Roman house. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, because he was quality. But this guy although he did say he played at"
29:14,280;29:21,640;"The college BC yeah with Danny and Woody you not quite fit you played on the end of Woody was a center"
29:21,640;29:25,040;"But apparently they used to go at it in practice back in college"
29:25,040;29:29,340;"There was one comment to about"
29:29,340;29:33,420;"The commentators made and I don't know if you picked up on"
29:34,860;29:41,820;"With them being wrong again Andy God. Oh, yeah, what are they wrong about? They were talking about Troy Brown"
29:41,820;29:46,380;"And they were wrong about Brown. Yeah, of course"
29:46,380;29:53,060;"They're like, oh what a great duty is he's like oh, it's like he's preparing for life at football"
29:53,060;29:55,060;"He wants to be a broadcaster which"
29:55,060;30:03,500;"What wrong about I said he's he's never gonna coach. He says you consider coaching, but there's too many long hours"
30:03,980;30:09,040;"Like whoops whoops, it's like he changed his mind on that one, huh?"
30:09,040;30:15,740;"Can't stay away, baby happens to the best of us. So do you have a?"
30:15,740;30:23,620;"There was a Adrian Clem sighting. Oh, yeah, because the right time with two ends. Yeah"
30:23,620;30:31,480;"He turned out to be pretty good, right? I don't think so. I thought you did. I thought you excited on Super Bowls and stuff"
30:32,360;30:38,260;"No, I don't I don't think he was kind of like mill around better than Kenyatta Jones"
30:38,260;30:45,600;"I'm so five years with the Patriots appearing in 26 games at 10 starts. Maybe I just like them cuz he has a great last name"
30:45,600;30:48,760;"Yeah, there's a bakery in"
30:48,760;30:52,640;"Windham you're sure it's named after him"
30:52,640;30:55,920;"Yeah, we'll say this fuck it"
30:56,480;31:04,920;"Maybe he's named after the baker who knows he's not born in England California, so probably not you know you don't know that that's true. I"
31:04,920;31:09,840;"Don't know. I don't think people win them would name their bakery after a black guy"
31:09,840;31:17,200;"You're not wrong. It's very conservative. Yes"
31:17,200;31:22,520;"But yeah, that's that enough. It's about it I"
31:23,200;31:29,520;"I never know here. It took me forever like way longer than you think to realize the Viking helmets were horns."
31:29,520;31:32,560;"I realize this now."
31:32,560;31:34,880;"Okay, so you're not saying you realize it today?"
31:34,880;31:38,080;"No, but within the last couple years."
31:38,080;31:40,240;"Really?"
31:40,240;31:41,040;"Yeah."
31:41,040;31:42,320;"What did you think they were?"
31:42,320;31:44,800;"I had no idea that they're just like Nike swoosh's."
31:44,800;31:47,600;"Oh, Steve."
31:47,600;31:48,720;"I didn't quite get it."
31:48,720;31:50,720;"I just thought they were kind of dumb helmets."
31:50,720;31:52,960;"Now that I realize their horns, I think they're a lot cooler."
31:52,960;31:55,940;"Oh, man."
31:55,940;31:58,600;"So I might be about to blow your mind."
31:58,600;32:01,600;"But you know, that's what was on the Rams helmet."
32:01,600;32:03,140;"Those are horns."
32:03,140;32:03,660;"I got that."
32:03,660;32:05,100;"And that's how it's going to sense me."
32:05,100;32:09,880;"Maybe not when we were watching the Super Bowls, but by the time the second"
32:09,880;32:11,700;"Rams Super Bowl came around, I'd figured that out."
32:11,700;32:12,940;"Oh, that's good."
32:12,940;32:16,500;"So you're, uh, I guess you're learning."
32:17,980;32:20,780;"All the learnings are I think realizing."
32:20,780;32:25,320;"Yeah, do you, uh, what are the odds that Greg knows this?"
32:25,320;32:27,220;"Hmm."
32:27,220;32:31,980;"He wouldn't know it, but he would shit on me pretending that I he already knew it"
32:31,980;32:33,820;"and calling me a fucking idiot for not knowing it."
32:33,820;32:38,900;"And in his back of his mind, he'd be like, fuck, those are horns."
32:38,900;32:40,620;"That makes so much sense."
32:40,620;32:46,140;"Well, speaking of stupid headwear, I think when we get Greg back on, we need"
32:46,140;32:51,140;"to find out an update on his hat that he bought."
32:51,140;32:53,120;"- Yes."
32:53,120;32:55,320;"- Yeah, the chicken wing hat."
32:55,320;32:57,320;"- I'm trying to get my friends to place a bet"
32:57,320;32:59,160;"on the chicken wing hat."
32:59,160;33:00,000;"- What kind of thing?"
33:00,000;33:03,700;"- Loser has to buy a pair of Zubaz or the chicken wing hat."
33:03,700;33:10,100;"They're debating the merits of Singletary versus Zachmos"
33:10,100;33:11,760;"for fantasy this year, so."
33:11,760;33:14,780;"- One, one side."
33:14,780;33:16,060;"- What happens if you're real fantasy this year?"
33:16,060;33:17,660;"Yeah, now, right?"
33:17,660;33:19,620;"Well, it would be a couple of games and then--"
33:19,620;33:20,700;"- So then what happens to fantasy?"
33:20,700;33:24,260;"Do you, whoever has got the most points wins?"
33:24,260;33:25,100;"- Probably."
33:25,100;33:27,540;"I haven't really thought about it at all."
33:27,540;33:29,180;"- No, I'm in here."
33:29,180;33:31,060;"- Which is crazy, 'cause it starts in like three weeks."
33:31,060;33:31,900;"- Supposed to, yeah."
33:31,900;33:36,420;"At least when we're recording this on the 20th of August,"
33:36,420;33:40,060;"but we'll see how that goes."
33:40,060;33:40,900;"- I'm in."
33:40,900;33:41,740;"- I'm actually starting to--"
33:41,740;33:45,580;"- Full on playoff Bruins and Celtics mode right now."
33:45,580;33:50,500;"Which is a weird time to be late August. Yeah, it sure is. It's just a weird time for all of it"
33:50,500;33:54,900;"I know this is it's a very strange. I don't know what'll make this year better though"
33:54,900;33:58,980;"What's that if Troy Brown finds out who we are?"
33:58,980;34:03,520;"I think I'm gonna say if Greg shows up next week with his fucking hat on"
34:03,520;34:09,780;"That'll only be a marginal thing. I want to really move the needle here. I'm with you"
34:09,780;34:14,460;"I am really like pressure Tanya to reach out to him on our behalf yet. I mean come on we not"
34:14,460;34:16,300;"Yeah, I think we probably should."
34:16,300;34:18,340;"We'll have to lay the groundwork for that."
34:18,340;34:20,780;"We need to get some, we need to call in some favors,"
34:20,780;34:22,420;"either do whatever we can."
34:22,420;34:23,580;"Yeah."
34:23,580;34:28,100;"Because, I mean, life isn't complete without Troy Brown in it."
34:28,100;34:31,660;"I know we've talked a lot about doing a brown zone, brown zone, browns."
34:31,660;34:32,660;"Mm-hmm."
34:32,660;34:37,260;"We should just do a brown zone, brown zone, brown and spend the whole thing talking about Troy Brown."
34:37,260;34:39,740;"That's how we get noticed."
34:39,740;34:42,660;"You know, we would actually probably get more content out of that."
34:42,660;34:48,260;"Then we what if we talk about the Cleveland Browns? Well Greg's thing was the Browns on Browns on Browns on Browns"
34:48,260;34:55,860;"While taking a shit doing on the toilet right? Yeah talking about Jim Brown and I guess that's probably the only other"
34:55,860;34:58,660;"Brown that's ever played for the no I looked it up"
34:58,660;35:02,720;"There was like seven or eight of them really Jim Brown's the only real famous one. Yeah"
35:02,720;35:09,020;"Yeah, I don't think we'd have a lot to talk about with them compared to talk about it. It's just not advancing my cause here"
35:10,860;35:16,740;"Well, that will tell time. Yeah, we'll do a special episode with Troy the Browns on Brown"
35:16,740;35:18,580;"Yeah"
35:18,580;35:22,740;"Brown's on all the all the browns talking to Troy Brown about Troy Brown"
35:22,740;35:26,020;"Yeah, do you think you want to talk about himself though?"
35:26,020;35:28,540;"No, but I do so"
35:28,540;35:34,500;"Well, maybe wait whoa whoa whoa, I'm on to something here. What if you do Browns on Browns on Browns on Browns"
35:35,060;35:39,960;"Hey, get Troy Brown on to talk about Jim Brown. I bet he'd love to talk about or"
35:39,960;35:46,420;"Troy Brown on to talk about us talking about Jim Brown while we're all taking a shit. I don't know how many browns on Browns"
35:46,420;35:52,180;"That is this brown on Browns on Browns on Browns on Brown Brown on Brown"
35:52,180;36:02,420;"And then if we all wear brown it could be in Brown at the end yeah brown on Browns on Browns on Browns on Brown in Brown"
36:02,420;36:09,400;"I don't think I own any brown though. Yeah khakis maybe I don't compare myself with poop boom"
36:09,400;36:17,520;"Trust you to take it so"
36:17,520;36:25,060;"Now we don't have Greg here. I thought I'd be a good opportunity to actually talk about some more football instead of"
36:25,060;36:29,380;"Like if we've already covered the poop topic, which is usually where he goes. Yeah"
36:30,540;36:38,220;"And I don't have any drug stories. So I was reading this week because I didn't have access to television"
36:38,220;36:44,860;"But you know access to a TV at the beginning of the week. Yeah, I'm not I was up in"
36:44,860;36:46,580;"Well, it's like a third world country"
36:46,580;36:51,400;"Second world country. Yeah, they have toilets, but it'll flush you know, I mean"
36:51,400;36:54,860;"It's a second world country"
36:54,860;36:57,700;"According to our father that's your words to"
36:58,740;37:04,320;"Okay, that's true laundry in the kitchen. What are they doing? Fridges the size of a keg raider"
37:04,320;37:07,100;"Yeah"
37:07,100;37:13,420;"Doesn't even go to my nipples. How am I gonna fit my 30 rack in there? That's what I'm saying. They don't have 30 racks or pickup trucks"
37:13,420;37:20,900;"What are they doing? Oh fucking country sub Venus throw all of Europe in there probably I drink their beer warm and"
37:20,900;37:24,780;"Their coffees garbage. Yeah, so let's say I was in England this week, right?"
37:25,620;37:28,620;"They didn't have real television."
37:28,620;37:39,800;"So I was reading a book, a war room by Michael Holly, who is probably my favorite Boston sports"
37:39,800;37:45,660;"guy because he's like the only one that succeeded in the industry without being a hot take artist,"
37:45,660;37:47,700;"which I am very impressed."
37:47,700;37:51,820;"He's a thoughtful dude, doesn't rely on the hot takes on stuff."
37:51,820;37:55,180;"I like Mike Reese, but he's not really like an opinion guy."
37:55,180;37:55,840;"Right."
37:55,840;37:56,340;"Exactly."
37:56,340;37:58,780;"And Michael Holly is, but he's like measured opinion."
37:58,780;38:02,660;"So it's actually, he's like the voice of reason and all these talk shows."
38:02,660;38:03,620;"I like him for that."
38:03,620;38:05,420;"Um, but he wrote this book."
38:05,420;38:08,340;"It's about the legacy of Bill Belichick in the art of building the perfect team."
38:08,340;38:12,540;"Written in 2011, I believe it was."
38:12,540;38:17,140;"So you could probably rewrite this a whole second time, but based the same"
38:17,140;38:20,260;"stuff, but it's cooler because it's like behind the scenes about how Bill"
38:20,260;38:22,520;"I'll check like builds a team, runs a team."
38:22,520;38:25,280;"So I actually just got to the part about,"
38:25,280;38:28,680;"and by just got to, I'm like 10, 40 pages in."
38:28,680;38:33,920;"Talking about the pages, one there, 2001 Super Bowl,"
38:33,920;38:36,160;"and now they're going in 2002."
38:36,160;38:38,600;"And I found some interesting tidbits"
38:38,600;38:39,440;"that I don't like what I found"
38:39,440;38:40,600;"if we hadn't been doing this."
38:40,600;38:42,880;"I thought this would be a good time to share them."
38:42,880;38:43,720;"All right."
38:43,720;38:44,560;"But the first thing was--"
38:44,560;38:46,120;"- Before you go on to this,"
38:46,120;38:47,960;"can I just say I can't believe"
38:47,960;38:49,880;"you're outing yourself like this?"
38:49,880;38:50,800;"What as a reader?"
38:50,800;38:51,360;"Yeah."
38:51,360;38:52,520;"For the loser."
38:52,520;38:56,360;"Everyone knows reading sort of fucking losers, Andy."
38:56,360;38:57,680;"God."
38:57,680;38:58,760;"You know what?"
38:58,760;39:01,440;"If you're the mom would be very proud of you."
39:01,440;39:04,080;"Oh, Andy reads all the time, Steve."
39:04,080;39:06,760;"Yeah, but I'm not a fucking loser, mom."
39:06,760;39:11,880;"If you don't know by this point, after the website and the podcast"
39:11,880;39:15,680;"and just listening to me talk for a season and a half that I'm a fucking nerd,"
39:15,680;39:17,160;"that's on you, not me."
39:17,160;39:18,880;"Oh, I know."
39:18,880;39:21,600;"I'm not talking about you."
39:21,600;39:23,520;"Fucking."
39:23,520;39:23,920;"Yeah."
39:23,920;39:26,160;"So mom knows to Andy."
39:26,160;39:27,840;"Oh, yeah, she's already known."
39:27,840;39:30,120;"That's why I'm the golden child."
39:30,120;39:31,120;"Sure."
39:31,120;39:32,840;"All right."
39:32,840;39:33,200;"Later."
39:33,200;39:34,160;"I mean, what did this stupid?"
39:34,160;39:35,200;"Don't say so."
39:35,200;39:38,240;"So hey, don't you call Michael Holly stupid."
39:38,240;39:39,160;"We like him."
39:39,160;39:40,360;"Who's we?"
39:40,360;39:43,160;"You're speaking for all of us now, huh?"
39:43,160;39:45,840;"No, it's the royal way of saying for myself in the real term."
39:45,840;39:48,200;"Um, so."
39:48,480;39:49,800;"The basic he was talking about, like,"
39:49,800;39:51,840;"this is just after Super Bowl,"
39:51,840;39:56,840;"and it was kind of a happy accident they won."
39:56,840;39:59,920;"And so he was asked how many players on the Super Bowl champs"
39:59,920;40:02,000;"would have to be replaced before you could call them"
40:02,000;40:04,160;"perennial championship threats."
40:04,160;40:06,600;"He didn't hesitate about 20."
40:06,600;40:10,520;"Ballachak coming off of the biggest upset,"
40:10,520;40:13,760;"well, one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history,"
40:13,760;40:16,360;"turns around, like, all right, so for this to continue,"
40:16,360;40:18,480;"How many people do you think you need to replace?"
40:18,480;40:21,880;"And like immediately it's like 20 give or take."
40:21,880;40:27,180;"So you can kind of see that in this 2002 season, I think, right?"
40:27,180;40:29,320;"Like you've..."
40:29,320;40:32,160;"- It's not a lot of big changes, I don't think."
40:32,160;40:34,740;"- On defense more than offense, I think."
40:34,740;40:39,000;"All right, like the front, the defensive line"
40:39,000;40:40,440;"has gone through a bunch of guys"
40:40,440;40:42,520;"'cause they can't stop the run."
40:42,520;40:46,540;"They brought in Victor Green who hasn't played as"
40:46,540;40:50,920;"Like like they're they're two corners and two safes are the same"
40:50,920;40:55,080;"Their receivers are the same except the addition of Dion"
40:55,080;40:59,000;"They definitely turned the tie down position over"
40:59,000;41:01,680;"Yeah, the line's pretty"
41:01,680;41:07,240;"Is not great still I think like this juggle last week and"
41:08,280;41:12,440;"And I thought they did a bit better this week, but both"
41:12,440;41:19,280;"Tackle linebackers are pretty similar year to year. Yeah, but the tackles get played. Oh, I'm not saying they perform"
41:19,280;41:24,760;"I'm just saying personnel. Oh, one to two thousand two. It's very similar to I mean we watch the Raiders"
41:24,760;41:30,080;"Turn over ten people on defense, which is fun starters. Yeah, which is yeah"
41:30,080;41:33,240;"Their entire defense is new except for Woodson"
41:34,240;41:37,760;"Right so but basically this goes on to talk about how"
41:37,760;41:43,480;"The reason they did as well as they did 2001 is because all the"
41:43,480;41:46,840;"Like the guys that they took chances on hit"
41:46,840;41:52,320;"So Bobby Hamilton hit Roman Viper hit right like all of these guys who are"
41:52,320;41:57,840;"Who were supposed to be just like kind of like roll guys just kind of played out of their minds"
41:57,840;42:02,260;"Like rabble same same sort of they did their job is what you're saying"
42:03,200;42:10,160;"You could say that but it was more than just doing their job like they actually like killed it. They did their job well. Yeah"
42:10,160;42:15,280;"So yeah, so everything I was starting a defensive end, but the problem is like those guys"
42:15,280;42:22,120;"No, I'm about to read be the book Andy. I don't god. I'm not gonna get secondhand loser from you"
42:22,120;42:24,640;"Listen asshole. You are the second-hand loser. I"
42:24,640;42:27,520;"Can do that on my own"
42:27,520;42:32,480;"I don't even help to be a loser. Thank you very much"
42:32,480;42:40,500;"But basically the gist of it is, so I'll fucking read, is that guys like Anthony Pleasant and"
42:40,500;42:45,680;"Bobby Hamilton, that they brought in as kind of like one year stop gaps and killed it in"
42:45,680;42:46,680;"2001."
42:46,680;42:49,940;"Right at this point, we're kind of over the hill."
42:49,940;42:54,680;"And then the guys that they brought in this year that they tried to use as the guys like"
42:54,680;42:59,080;"that, like Victor Green, they realized not so great."
42:59,080;43:04,840;"And the target, there's a story about, um, they brought him to Steve Martin, who was"
43:04,840;43:08,080;"supposed to be, I think, exactly."
43:08,080;43:11,320;"Yeah, that doesn't mean an actor."
43:11,320;43:15,760;"Among other things, apparently he's also defensive tackle, but he was supposed to be like that"
43:15,760;43:20,520;"run stopping like space eating Vince Willfork type of guy in the middle."
43:20,520;43:21,520;"Yep."
43:21,520;43:29,460;"And apparently he was so bad that they, like his technique was so bad, the Belichick would"
43:29,460;43:34,480;"put people like Bobby Hamilton and who was 40 pound lighter than him to show him the"
43:34,480;43:37,520;"correct way to do things that guy still couldn't figure it out."
43:37,520;43:41,000;"And so he got cut halfway through the season, which I think is probably why the beginning"
43:41,000;43:44,880;"of the season you saw those 200-yard games, because that guy couldn't get a shit to go."
43:44,880;43:51,000;"And so it just kind of showed the, like how on the edge the Patriots were in these first"
43:51,000;43:55,760;"few seasons. And the fact that they wanted 2001 was basically"
43:55,760;43:59,560;"almost a fluke. Even though Belljack was building that system,"
43:59,560;44:01,920;"which eventually would turn into like, Oh, three and oh, four,"
44:01,920;44:05,760;"which we'll see in the next 20 years. Right, right, right. But"
44:05,760;44:10,560;"at that time, winning in a one was just like blind luck almost."
44:10,560;44:15,920;"But I think that can happen, right? The Giants, Joe Flacco,"
44:15,920;44:18,960;"I mean, there's all sorts of fluke shit like that. That's true."
44:19,360;44:21,360;"I think it's a big part of its luck."
44:21,360;44:23,260;"Yeah, I think so."
44:23,260;44:27,520;"But I think the difference between them and this team"
44:27,520;44:32,720;"is that the Patriots, they get lucky here and there."
44:32,720;44:36,480;"You know, that you have like, you know,"
44:36,480;44:39,360;"one against the Bills where was it?"
44:39,360;44:43,360;"Patton, they got knocked out, but he was touching the ball"
44:43,360;44:44,760;"and he was touching the sideline."
44:44,760;44:46,360;"So it was really, really nice."
44:46,360;44:47,480;"You got lucky like that."
44:47,480;44:51,360;"or maybe even the Edelman catch in the Super Bowl against the Falcons."
44:51,360;44:56,960;"That's like, yeah, you know, it's a good play, but it's still kind of lucky."
44:56,960;44:58,280;"Just the way to bounce everything."
44:58,280;44:58,960;"It didn't hit the ground."
44:58,960;45:05,360;"And, um, but the pages are able to put themselves in that position so many more"
45:05,360;45:08,080;"times just based on the foundation that they have."
45:08,080;45:08,400;"Right."
45:08,400;45:08,760;"Right."
45:08,760;45:08,760;"Right."
45:08,760;45:10,640;"They get you there and then luck gets you over the hump."
45:10,640;45:11,480;"Yeah."
45:11,480;45:11,920;"Yeah."
45:11,920;45:15,280;"And I think for a lot of teams, like that's what you almost have to bank on."
45:16,440;45:19,340;"But the pages just continue to get to that point all the time."
45:19,340;45:21,640;"Eventually, there's like the luck will happen to them."
45:21,640;45:22,280;"And when it does,"
45:22,280;45:23,480;"I've averages will win out yet."
45:23,480;45:24,640;"Yeah, exactly."
45:24,640;45:26,640;"Same as the way that they draft, I think, too."
45:26,640;45:30,600;"Do you can we bring this back to like something, you know, cooler?"
45:30,600;45:31,240;"All right."
45:31,240;45:31,840;"How about this?"
45:31,840;45:33,040;"I have a snow."
45:33,040;45:34,440;"But you got fine."
45:34,440;45:36,160;"You can do your cool thing from the book, Andy."
45:36,160;45:37,800;"No, this isn't from the book."
45:37,800;45:38,800;"Fuck it."
45:38,800;45:39,800;"I'll give you a cool step."
45:39,800;45:42,720;"It's probably from the book."
45:42,720;45:44,760;"No, it's from this game."
45:44,760;45:47,160;"But I read it off the screen so you can fucking eat a dick."
45:47,160;45:54,800;"Kevin Falk is the only player in the league of the seas, I assume,"
45:54,800;45:57,680;"with rushing, receiving and kick return touchdown."
45:57,680;46:01,040;"I guess that's cool. Pretty fucking cool."
46:01,040;46:03,320;"Do you think Tom Brady is good at Madden?"
46:03,320;46:06,760;"Um, like how good is he at Madden?"
46:06,760;46:13,560;"That's like, see, I was obviously he can read the defense like no other."
46:14,000;46:17,040;"See, well, I was officially going to dismiss that and say that he just doesn't play it at all."
46:17,040;46:19,880;"But he probably doesn't have time for video games."
46:19,880;46:20,320;"Yes."
46:20,320;46:25,520;"He brought us a read either because he actually does not read unless it's a scouting report."
46:25,520;46:27,280;"He'll read a scouting report, but that's it."
46:27,280;46:28,200;"I don't know."
46:28,200;46:35,040;"I think if Tom Brady played Peyton Manning and Madden, who would win?"
46:35,040;46:37,360;"Has this ever been done?"
46:37,360;46:40,400;"I think Tom Brady was playing Madden against each other."
46:40,400;46:42,400;"Here's why I say I think it's Tom Brady."
46:42,960;46:48,320;"because Tom Brady was on the cover of Matt back in two or three years ago."
46:48,320;46:53,960;"And because he was on the cover, I bet he learned how to play it."
46:53,960;46:56,920;"And because it's Tom Brady, he's not going to play something."
46:56,920;46:57,480;"He's not good at it."
46:57,480;46:58,960;"So he will get good at Matt."
46:58,960;47:01,360;"It's on 18 and 12."
47:01,360;47:03,360;"Cool."
47:03,360;47:05,360;"His long hair Tom Brady in 12."
47:05,360;47:06,560;"Really, I don't remember."
47:06,560;47:11,640;"And he's on PlayStation original NFL game day, 2003, baby."
47:11,640;47:12,720;"I remember that one."
47:12,720;47:14,320;"Yeah, I didn't know it was on Madden 12."
47:14,320;47:18,000;"I mean, if this thing was legit, yeah."
47:18,000;47:19,920;"I don't know that it was."
47:19,920;47:21,880;"I thought."
47:21,880;47:23,440;"Eighteen."
47:23,440;47:27,120;"Um, I asked because I've been playing."
47:27,120;47:32,280;"It's 2012, coincidentally, a college triple game with my friends."
47:32,280;47:35,840;"And I really fucking really fucking bad at it."
47:35,840;47:39,960;"See, I got I can't I can't read a defense to save my content."
47:39,960;47:41,880;"I just started to have the supposed to go to that."
47:41,880;47:43,440;"I throw interceptions all the time."
47:43,440;47:44,280;"I don't read a defense."
47:44,280;47:45,760;"I just go, it's going to that guy."
47:45,760;47:46,560;"It's going to that guy."
47:46,560;47:48,380;"And I'm like half the time it works."
47:48,380;47:48,840;"Maybe."
47:48,840;47:52,640;"- You stare him down and stare him down."
47:52,640;47:52,980;"- Yep."
47:52,980;47:54,360;"- I don't read shit."
47:54,360;47:55,920;"Am I one coworker?"
47:55,920;47:57,040;"The guy's going to be on next week."
47:57,040;47:59,440;"He's like, he played quarterback in high school."
47:59,440;48:01,120;"He's like, oh, yeah, I gotta read this."
48:01,120;48:02,680;"I'm like, no, no."
48:02,680;48:03,520;"This guy's getting the ball."
48:03,520;48:04,480;"It says right in the place."
48:04,480;48:05,680;"I think."
48:05,680;48:06,960;"- Yeah, that's why he's highlighted."
48:06,960;48:07,800;"That's why he's hit."
48:07,800;48:09,160;"- Yes."
48:09,160;48:11,720;"- Which, going back to what we talked about for"
48:11,720;48:16,720;"why I play my games on easy because I'll rookie that that's a completion 90% of the time."
48:16,720;48:21,840;"That's true. I get picked off. So Tom Brady is going to complete 80% of his passes."
48:21,840;48:28,000;"Yeah, what it was. One coworker we played Madden and he's like, don't play against each"
48:28,000;48:32,720;"other. I was like, no, I don't want to play against each other. And so he played as the"
48:32,720;48:36,160;"Patriots against the Jets on easy mode and just destroyed."
48:36,160;48:41,040;"It just feels so good. I know that he got ragged on by things Greg and Connor at the"
48:41,040;48:49,120;"time. But like, I don't play video games for the challenge. I play video games to cosplay"
48:49,120;48:54,240;"as a fucking superhero. Like, I'm doing shit that I can't do in real life."
48:54,240;48:58,200;"I brought the whole box of beers to my room with me for this podcast, because I couldn't"
48:58,200;49:00,720;"walk away and get another one."
49:00,720;49:05,800;"That's some real forward thinking freeze. You know, I don't want to leave you by yourself,"
49:05,800;49:09,560;"Andy, although you probably could have just read out of your book to our audience. You"
49:09,560;49:15,720;"You know what? I'm gonna. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna try find a way to have"
49:15,720;49:23,020;"people vote on this. But nobody does. Fuck it. Now I'm in the right here. Sure. I am."
49:23,020;49:27,640;"I am bringing new information to our audience. You're sitting there fucking talking about"
49:27,640;49:34,880;"boxes of beers and how you suck at Madden and the best name in the whole game. Maybe even"
49:34,880;49:43,720;"and Madden in 2002. No. He played in this game. He was there full back."
49:43,720;49:48,680;"Was there a full back? I don't know who was it? Yeah, Jim Klein's"
49:48,680;49:58,420;"saucer. spelling for all of you out there. Hey, L E I N S A S S E R."
49:58,420;50:02,600;"Hell yeah. He looks like he looks like a Klein saucer."
50:04,280;50:06,520;"I think that's exactly just a really fancy t set."
50:06,520;50:10,920;"Just the first Google image result becomes that is the best."
50:10,920;50:12,020;"What is it?"
50:12,020;50:14,260;"Talk, walk me through it with your words."
50:14,260;50:18,260;"He's wearing a Vikings jersey with a nice patch."
50:18,260;50:25,400;"And it looks like he's taking a shit by looking off to the right somehow."
50:25,400;50:26,440;"He's not looking right at the cane."
50:26,440;50:27,700;"He's looking off to the right."
50:27,700;50:29,100;"He's taking a shit."
50:29,100;50:30,640;"So it's almost like a candid photo."
50:30,640;50:33,680;"Yeah, you can see like his teeth, his top row teeth, his gums."
50:33,680;50:37,480;"like biting his lip and he's a lot of pleasure."
50:37,480;50:38,320;"- It's a lot of pleasure."
50:38,320;50:39,680;"- His face is all scrunched out."
50:39,680;50:42,320;"Like he's pooping."
50:42,320;50:45,160;"- So not a pleasurable sort of thing."
50:45,160;50:47,840;"- Yeah, full on uniform poop."
50:47,840;50:48,680;"- Nice."
50:48,680;50:50,680;"- That's right."
50:50,680;50:52,440;"- Oh, I have,"
50:52,440;50:58,520;"I think we have criminally under talked about,"
50:58,520;51:01,040;"and that's a phrase that people say."
51:01,040;51:02,560;"- Yes."
51:02,560;51:05,640;"in books they read it"
51:05,640;51:08,000;"we have criminally under talked about"
51:08,000;51:12,480;"your boy michael dandy randy moths"
51:12,480;51:16,200;"and i don't know if you've got this at the beginning of the game"
51:16,200;51:18,880;"but it was almost like it because they had like the"
51:18,880;51:21,320;"the pregame a little bit the fox pregame"
51:21,320;51:23,240;"and then which is awful"
51:23,240;51:25,120;"ends the same fox"
51:25,120;51:27,520;"that they're still and and it's not yet"
51:27,520;51:29,840;"and it's just them talking over each other about"
51:29,840;51:31,500;"and they have the robot of zucin"
51:31,500;51:33,900;"How they had no innovation there?"
51:33,900;51:38,260;"I mean, that's the NFL."
51:38,260;51:40,660;"Fox throw their money at them anyway."
51:40,660;51:42,060;"It's Fox."
51:42,060;51:45,860;"They had like, you know, like after they cut to that, before they go to the actual"
51:45,860;51:50,340;"games, they have like, wait, wait, wait, before we get off this, before we get off this."
51:50,340;51:51,060;"All right."
51:51,060;51:54,820;"There was one innovation that they got rid of, which I really liked."
51:55,980;52:04,680;"When they'd score, like the, they would make that like sound and then score would change and like change to the colors of your team, you know, I don't remember that."
52:04,680;52:08,020;"It did it happen in this game."
52:08,020;52:14,300;"Yeah. And I really remember it from the Super Bowl and in the Rams."
52:14,300;52:22,180;"We go and add and take kicks that field goal and it makes that like sound like machine noise kind of sound."
52:22,180;52:22,820;"Yeah, it's like."
52:24,540;52:31,180;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. I know you talk about it. Subtle. Yeah. But I was just so"
52:31,180;52:36,540;"seated that sound with us winning and that's the only thing they took away"
52:36,540;52:42,620;"and it left fucking all those fucks in the pregame show just talking over each"
52:42,620;52:48,380;"other. I left the robot and the robot, which mama Brown hates."
52:50,220;52:53,820;"And so what we did like with a passion."
52:53,820;53:01,740;"Uh, so what we did is when they were trying to, they had a contest to name that robot."
53:01,740;53:02,980;"No, really?"
53:02,980;53:04,220;"Yeah."
53:04,220;53:08,540;"So I submitted a lot of submissions to name it."
53:08,540;53:09,060;"Christine."
53:09,060;53:11,820;"Didn't work."
53:11,820;53:12,380;"Come on."
53:12,380;53:14,060;"And I got to name our robot, Christine."
53:14,060;53:16,580;"That's a pretty good name for a robot."
53:17,700;53:19,300;"if you're in like a horror movie."
53:19,300;53:20,620;"It's Fox bro."
53:20,620;53:22,700;"But yeah, so back to my point."
53:22,700;53:24,940;"Well, yeah."
53:24,940;53:26,460;"They were just ending the pregame show"
53:26,460;53:28,140;"and they were doing like the mic'd up around the league."
53:28,140;53:31,460;"You know, they did with this like the hype up huddle."
53:31,460;53:35,100;"And they had our Blurady Moss."
53:35,100;53:35,940;"Mike."
53:35,940;53:39,580;"Ooh, they got some mosses coming out here, dog."
53:39,580;53:42,540;"They got some big Super Bowl champion mosses coming out here."
53:42,540;53:46,300;"Decorated in that blue and gray."
53:46,300;53:48,360;"They got some Super Bowl MOS is coming out."
53:48,360;53:50,220;"That he's in that blue and gray."
53:50,220;53:52,560;"And for those who can't see it, he's doing the classic"
53:52,560;53:55,540;"where it's his gloves in his face mask."
53:55,540;53:58,220;"Like they're like fangs."
53:58,220;54:01,460;"Yeah, like he's just got to like like velcroed onto the bottom"
54:01,460;54:02,660;"of the face mask."
54:02,660;54:04,780;"He's got his face like a little bit too high up."
54:04,780;54:06,540;"So you can't really see him."
54:06,540;54:10,580;"Randy Moss is one of my favorite characters in the NFL."
54:10,580;54:13,780;"I think he's good."
54:13,780;54:14,980;"Oh, for sure."
54:14,980;54:18,780;"I remember there was some and I'll look it up when we get to that point of"
54:18,780;54:22,260;"like when he joins the team and we talk about him in depth."
54:22,260;54:27,620;"There was some article about him how he lived in like an over 50s, like"
54:27,620;54:28,540;"gated community."
54:28,540;54:31,780;"Just because he wasn't like a pirate or anything."
54:31,780;54:36,620;"He liked the, like he got along with all the neighbors and like the, the,"
54:36,620;54:39,100;"like quietness of it all and everything."
54:39,100;54:41,740;"Like that's crazy."
54:41,740;54:42,580;"Cool. Yeah."
54:42,580;54:44,340;"Just like I misunderstood, dude."
54:44,340;54:47,340;"I know he grew up in the brand of West Virginia."
54:47,340;54:48,340;"Yeah."
54:48,340;54:50,340;"In the middle of nowhere."
54:50,340;54:53,340;"I mean, all of West Virginia is the middle of nowhere, buddy."
54:53,340;54:54,340;"That's true."
54:54,340;54:59,340;"Did you know West Virginia was the only state that was created during the Civil War?"
54:59,340;55:00,340;"Cool."
55:00,340;55:02,340;"Did you read that in a book?"
55:02,340;55:03,340;"No."
55:03,340;55:04,340;"Maybe I did."
55:04,340;55:07,340;"I didn't read a book about the Civil War."
55:07,340;55:09,340;"I may have made that up, though, actually."
55:09,340;55:11,340;"It sounds good."
55:11,340;55:12,340;"Yeah."
55:12,340;55:13,340;"Yeah."
55:13,340;55:18,940;"I thought it was something where like most of Virginia wanted to be part of the south"
55:18,940;55:20,580;"and that looks up for the western part of the state."
55:20,580;55:22,300;"They're like, no, if it doesn't make any sense now."
55:22,300;55:24,700;"Why not?"
55:24,700;55:26,700;"That's what's Virginia's where all the races are."
55:26,700;55:27,980;"I suppose that's true."
55:27,980;55:30,340;"What is Virginia where most of the races are too?"
55:30,340;55:34,220;"No, too many people up here in DC."
55:34,220;55:37,460;"Yeah, well, they're all races as well."
55:37,460;55:39,220;"You're all races."
55:39,220;55:42,020;"Anything sell to Connecticut's races, boy."
55:42,020;55:43,300;"Oh, right."
55:43,300;55:45,900;"You're a southern and Amie Steve."
55:45,900;55:46,900;"Uh huh."
55:46,900;55:50,300;"Yeah, because people who am sure aren't racist at all."
55:50,300;55:58,300;"That's why that's why Wyndham's bakery named their named themselves after a black guy."
55:58,300;56:01,300;"They don't call us the south of the north for nothing."
56:01,300;56:11,300;"Uh, being a Virginia though, um, a boy Randy Moss after the game, the like the first thing"
56:11,300;56:15,940;"they shot to you like after Brady took the knee to end it and everybody came in the field was"
56:15,940;56:22,020;"Randy Moss talking to our one and only love of the podcast Troy Brown."
56:22,020;56:23,860;"Yes, I did so."
56:23,860;56:29,060;"I'm going to to put it out now. I'm the first one to put it on record."
56:29,060;56:31,860;"I think Troy Brown is responsible for getting Randy Moss on the Patriots."
56:31,860;56:34,900;"I'll believe it. I'll cosign that and they never played together though."
56:34,900;56:36,420;"Right. Doesn't matter."
56:36,420;56:40,740;"They're pretty close though. Yeah, they were overlapping."
56:40,740;56:43,460;"I went to Troy Brown retire."
56:43,460;56:45,900;"I'm also like five or six."
56:45,900;56:49,020;"Yeah, I'm gonna say in that general sanity."
56:49,020;56:49,940;"Troy Brown, see that."
56:49,940;56:52,500;"That's probably 2005 2007."
56:52,500;56:57,900;"You know, he's played one game in 2007, but had no stats."
56:57,900;57:00,780;"So he was on the team with Randy Moss."
57:00,780;57:02,220;"Yeah."
57:02,220;57:05,780;"So that is lending more credence to here."
57:05,780;57:09,900;"This would have been one game you had."
57:09,900;57:12,700;"six-punt returns."
57:12,700;57:18,260;"And, and where did they both go to college?"
57:18,260;57:20,460;"Marshall. Yeah."
57:20,460;57:21,860;"They're both marshall guys."
57:21,860;57:23,900;"See, it's all coming together."
57:23,900;57:26,180;"Steve, we're putting this together on the fly."
57:26,180;57:27,660;"Oh, I love it."
57:27,660;57:28,660;"All right. All right."
57:28,660;57:33,700;"Fucking a these, these from South Carolina, though,"
57:33,700;57:36,140;"Troy Brown, which is not too far."
57:36,140;57:38,780;"It's in the general vicinity of West Virginia."
57:39,620;57:43,920;"So maybe if we get Troy Brown on, he'll get his best friend, Randy Moss, come with him."
57:43,920;57:47,660;"Oh, no, that'll put us on the goddamn map."
57:47,660;57:48,960;"I don't really care about that though."
57:48,960;57:52,500;"No, I just want Troy Brown on, but I'd love to talk to Randy Moss."
57:52,500;57:54,040;"I bet he's a fan of the dude."
57:54,040;57:55,760;"For sure."
57:55,760;57:58,460;"Cause apparently like he knows his shit too."
57:58,460;58:00,500;"Like he was teaching right."
58:00,500;58:02,600;"The Patriots shit about how offense worked."
58:02,600;58:03,200;"Yeah."
58:03,200;58:05,520;"Bell check said that many times."
58:05,520;58:06,160;"Yeah."
58:07,040;58:07,960;"Just not in this game."
58:07,960;58:11,240;"Because in this game, the first quarter, the first quarter of the game before"
58:11,240;58:14,880;"against the Packers, you had four catches for 67 yards and this gave"
58:14,880;58:19,000;"me had one for 17 and he didn't finish with many catches in general."
58:19,000;58:20,640;"And Tyler, they they fumble."
58:20,640;58:21,440;"Yeah."
58:21,440;58:23,680;"They were all about stopping Randy."
58:23,680;58:24,880;"They were not going to let Randy beat him."
58:24,880;58:25,760;"Yeah."
58:25,760;58:26,360;"Yeah."
58:26,360;58:28,120;"They had a lot of safety at the time."
58:28,120;58:29,080;"They doubled them."
58:29,080;58:29,400;"Yep."
58:29,400;58:34,120;"So what do you think his, uh, the stat line was?"
58:36,000;58:38,000;"You've had maybe like five catches"
58:38,000;58:48,140;"Yardage not more than pay it but a 120 yard one a couple tens of run off 15 yards catch"
58:48,140;58:51,600;"Now how many yards do you have total?"
58:51,600;58:57,600;"It's 15 times 5 Andy. I don't know I didn't come here to do math buddy. I don't know either"
58:57,600;59:00,680;"75"
59:00,680;59:03,920;"He actually had eight catches for 92 yards"
59:03,920;59:10,880;"That's more than I thought yeah, he didn't like you impact the game like that though. No, he's a little"
59:10,880;59:15,720;"Yeah, the longest of 19. This is the last play of the game where he just didn't do it"
59:15,720;59:19,160;"I was gonna say yeah, like he just at the comic. She was like well"
59:19,160;59:23,400;"He knew it wasn't coming to him like yes still to be fair. What the fuck would I make you say it there?"
59:23,400;59:29,840;"I'm like there 40. Yeah, and it was fourth and ten and they threw it to Jim Klein's roster"
59:29,840;59:33,260;"Yeah, like what he lined up in the slot"
59:33,260;59:35,520;"Like 20 seconds left"
59:35,520;59:39,640;"They were just trying to get another first down and like clearly ran you heard that call in the huddle"
59:39,640;59:43,920;"And then just walk like they snap the ball and he walked off the line scrimmage. Yeah"
59:43,920;59:48,920;"Why is the fuck are you not just throwing me a goddamn jump ball?"
59:48,920;59:55,780;"Also, all the other plays before that were deep bombs to not rainy moss and even the commentator was like"
59:56,480;59:58,200;"You're gonna throw that in a double coverage."
59:58,200;01:00:00,000;"You may as well throw it to Moss anyway."
01:00:00,000;01:00:02,960;"He was shitin' all over Mike Tyson for those goals."
01:00:02,960;01:00:03,960;"Yeah."
01:00:03,960;01:00:04,960;"Yeah, this is not."
01:00:04,960;01:00:05,960;"I don't know."
01:00:05,960;01:00:07,360;"I don't know what you're doing."
01:00:07,360;01:00:11,640;"But I mean, you can't really complain too loudly about Mike Tyson."
01:00:11,640;01:00:18,720;"When his team is after this 16, 17, 18, minus 19,"
01:00:18,720;01:00:21,840;"and the turnover differential, still the most penalized team"
01:00:21,840;01:00:23,920;"in the league averaging nine penalties a game."
01:00:24,520;01:00:27,520;"Like he obviously doesn't have a handle on shit at all, right?"
01:00:27,520;01:00:31,000;"Well, he laughs on the left and the love boat is what did him in."
01:00:31,000;01:00:31,840;"Right."
01:00:31,840;01:00:34,560;"I didn't even get there."
01:00:34,560;01:00:39,720;"I mean, did he have decent records?"
01:00:39,720;01:00:40,720;"Nope."
01:00:40,720;01:00:43,360;"He, oh, that's right."
01:00:43,360;01:00:51,880;"He, uh, he finished his career, his five year career."
01:00:52,760;01:00:54,860;"Uh, one game under 500."
01:00:54,860;01:00:56,840;"32 and 33."
01:00:56,840;01:00:59,680;"He went six and 10 in 2002."
01:00:59,680;01:01:01,080;"So this year he would go six and 10."
01:01:01,080;01:01:04,040;"And then nine and seven, eight, nine and seven."
01:01:04,040;01:01:05,000;"Yeah."
01:01:05,000;01:01:07,800;"Like 100% mediocre."
01:01:07,800;01:01:11,920;"He's like Jeff Fisher, but not as good."
01:01:11,920;01:01:14,960;"Yeah, that Jeff Fisher was good."
01:01:14,960;01:01:18,760;"Jeff Fisher was really good at being mediocre for a really fucking long time."
01:01:18,760;01:01:19,440;"Yeah."
01:01:19,440;01:01:20,760;"This isn't that."
01:01:21,680;01:01:31,280;"But they showed some stat in this game where Mike Tyson was the coach with the longest, like, tenure in the NFL as a player."
01:01:31,280;01:01:35,140;"Like he'd played for 14 years or something like that before."
01:01:35,140;01:01:37,240;"Because I thought, well, I guess that doesn't translate."
01:01:37,240;01:01:45,980;"Let's do you have any other interesting tidbits that a couple left guard for the Vikings?"
01:01:45,980;01:01:48,300;"Maybe the left tackle, no McKinney."
01:01:48,300;01:01:50,820;"He I think it's his rookie year."
01:01:51,440;01:01:53,580;"was and there was shit all over him."
01:01:53,580;01:01:56,920;"They said he was six foot eight three hundred and something pounds."
01:01:56,920;01:01:58,920;"The big man."
01:01:58,920;01:02:03,660;"And they were saying he had to start out of a two point stance on every play"
01:02:03,660;01:02:07,200;"instead of a three point stance because he's too slow getting out of a three"
01:02:07,200;01:02:09,140;"point stance because he's six eight three hundred something."
01:02:09,140;01:02:14,860;"Like Grog's like six nine two seventy."
01:02:14,860;01:02:17,540;"I like honestly like these days is not that big."
01:02:17,540;01:02:20,040;"I know his nickname was Mount McKinney, right?"
01:02:20,780;01:02:26,540;"I think it was. Yeah. Which isn't like, I didn't seem by today's standards that"
01:02:26,540;01:02:28,260;"fucking big, but I guess he was back then."
01:02:28,260;01:02:33,980;"And Rock was dude, six six. He was there for a long time. I remember he was like,"
01:02:33,980;01:02:35,940;"legit fuck for a long time."
01:02:35,940;01:02:39,980;"I thought he was yeah, a bit of a stalwart. Yeah. Yeah, he definitely was."
01:02:39,980;01:02:46,100;"Bryant McKinney left tackle was there from 2002 to 2013."
01:02:46,100;01:02:47,380;"Yeah."
01:02:47,380;01:02:49,620;"Which is pretty good."
01:02:50,340;01:02:56,980;"Started pretty much 16 games every year except for 2008 we started 12 Pro Bowl. Oh nine want a seat for ball"
01:02:56,980;01:02:59,540;"Yeah"
01:02:59,540;01:03:05,220;"Wait, what a super bowl. Yes. No, we do. Oh, you must have won it with bolts and more. Yep"
01:03:05,220;01:03:09,220;"Ravens and the Niners"
01:03:09,220;01:03:16,300;"Lights went out. That was a shit super. No, it's one. I was rooting for the lights to go out and they did so I turned the game off"
01:03:16,300;01:03:19,860;"You laugh like I'm kidding"
01:03:19,860;01:03:25,420;"I can't say in the hardball says coaches like screaming until their face turns right with all the fucking veins"
01:03:25,420;01:03:28,220;"You tell them Andy you should write them a strongly word letter"
01:03:28,220;01:03:31,100;"You know I might you know what I can do that"
01:03:31,100;01:03:35,620;"Fucking read cuz I read books. Yeah, but they're not gonna read it cuz they're not fucking losers"
01:03:35,620;01:03:41,180;"Goddamn it"
01:03:41,180;01:03:43,180;"Where's Greg to shit on when you need him?"
01:03:43,180;01:03:49,260;"Give me give me a fun fact about Greg"
01:03:49,260;01:03:55,500;"something embarrassing fun fact about Greg yeah something we can show name it"
01:03:55,500;01:03:58,620;"sounds like you have one that you want to say I don't I'm trying to think of"
01:03:58,620;01:04:04,260;"one off top my head geez oh I got one back when he was little probably about"
01:04:04,260;01:04:09,300;"the time we were watching these games maybe before he used to cry when the"
01:04:09,300;01:04:13,620;"patients would lose I have one that he's not gonna be happy that we share so we"
01:04:13,620;01:04:14,940;"- Yeah, I'll be sure it."
01:04:14,940;01:04:16,980;"- All right, let's go."
01:04:16,980;01:04:18,180;"- He was wrestling Danny."
01:04:18,180;01:04:19,060;"Danny's our neighbor."
01:04:19,060;01:04:20,820;"He's in between me and Greg's age, so."
01:04:20,820;01:04:22,900;"- Yeah, he's like an extra brother."
01:04:22,900;01:04:27,020;"- Right, and Danny had him in like a half guard"
01:04:27,020;01:04:29,140;"or a flutter from what the fucking MMA term is,"
01:04:29,140;01:04:33,060;"but like, you know, on their back with their arms pinned."
01:04:33,060;01:04:33,900;"- Yeah."
01:04:33,900;01:04:35,020;"- So Greg couldn't get up,"
01:04:35,020;01:04:37,760;"and Danny's like kind of straddling him."
01:04:37,760;01:04:42,140;"And Greg leans up and kisses Danny right on the lips"
01:04:42,140;01:04:43,460;"to get out of the hold."
01:04:43,460;01:04:44,940;"(laughs)"
01:04:44,940;01:04:46,360;"I witnessed the whole thing."
01:04:46,360;01:04:50,580;"- This coming from the man who invented the term,"
01:04:50,580;01:04:51,900;"the best part about wrestling"
01:04:51,900;01:04:53,980;"is only one person has to want to wrestle."
01:04:53,980;01:04:54,820;"- Right."
01:04:54,820;01:04:56,380;"- That's who would jump on you and try to wrestle you."
01:04:56,380;01:04:58,420;"- And then I guess he kisses you too."
01:04:58,420;01:04:59,780;"(laughs)"
01:04:59,780;01:05:01,620;"- Which is honestly,"
01:05:01,620;01:05:04,180;"- Ductill's right into wrestling, so totally okay."
01:05:04,180;01:05:05,580;"(laughs)"
01:05:05,580;01:05:07,580;"- Oh boy, I love it."
01:05:07,580;01:05:10,740;"- All right, so I'm done here."
01:05:10,740;01:05:11,940;"- We probably should, yeah."
01:05:11,940;01:05:15,180;"Just a sh- And probably you two, 'cause he knows all your secrets."
01:05:15,180;01:05:19,060;"Well, next week, is that Lions Week?"
01:05:19,060;01:05:24,820;"Well, we haven't done our best and worst, but I can tell you that yes, it is."
01:05:24,820;01:05:25,900;"Nice."
01:05:25,900;01:05:30,540;"I believe Thursday, I think this is Thanksgiving day game."
01:05:30,540;01:05:31,620;"It is."
01:05:31,620;01:05:33,100;"How about that?"
01:05:33,100;01:05:34,380;"Thursday, I have a 28th."
01:05:34,380;01:05:36,740;"We have a very, we have a special guest coming for that one."
01:05:36,740;01:05:37,620;"We do."
01:05:37,620;01:05:38,300;"That's good to know."
01:05:38,300;01:05:39,300;"Uh-huh."
01:05:39,300;01:05:41,100;"And I talked to him this week."
01:05:41,100;01:05:46,100;"We're going to make turkey and stuffing sandwiches."
01:05:46,100;01:05:47,780;"- Okay."
01:05:47,780;01:05:48,620;"- For dinner."
01:05:48,620;01:05:49,460;"We're going to go all out around,"
01:05:49,460;01:05:50,620;"but Thanksgiving dinner."
01:05:50,620;01:05:53,860;"- Wait, didn't the candy corn people just come out with"
01:05:53,860;01:05:56,300;"Thanksgiving flavored candy corn?"
01:05:56,300;01:05:57,120;"- What?"
01:05:57,120;01:05:59,660;"That sounds as good as--"
01:05:59,660;01:06:00,820;"- Did I start her?"
01:06:00,820;01:06:01,980;"- That was disgusting."
01:06:01,980;01:06:04,700;"- Candy corn."
01:06:04,700;01:06:05,620;"- Stat check."
01:06:05,620;01:06:09,180;"Brock's turkey dinner candy corn."
01:06:09,180;01:06:10,820;"New to store shelves."
01:06:10,820;01:06:15,820;"A full course meal presented in a unique mix of candy corn flavors."
01:06:15,820;01:06:17,820;"Oh, each one's different."
01:06:17,820;01:06:22,740;"Brock's turkey dinner includes all of the traditional Thanksgiving favorites from roasted turkey,"
01:06:22,740;01:06:28,260;"green beans, and stuffing to ginger glazed carrots, cranberry sauce, and sweet potato pie."
01:06:28,260;01:06:29,260;"Flavors and green beans."
01:06:29,260;01:06:35,180;"It's like each corn, a different flavor, and you just scoop them all up and eat them to"
01:06:35,180;01:06:39,340;"get a mix, whereas each corn, all the flavors mixed."
01:06:39,340;01:06:43,900;"I'm going to say each individual corn is a flavor from the look."
01:06:43,900;01:06:45,020;"You could get like a handful."
01:06:45,020;01:06:46,900;"It's just all green beans and disgusting."
01:06:46,900;01:06:49,500;"I think it's going to be disgusting either way."
01:06:49,500;01:06:51,460;"It's available at your local Walgreens."
01:06:51,460;01:06:53,380;"So maybe we'll have to do that."
01:06:53,380;01:06:57,220;"I'm going to actually make like a, I could really go for like a."
01:06:57,220;01:07:01,100;"Turkey and stuffing sandwich."
01:07:01,100;01:07:01,780;"Yeah."
01:07:01,780;01:07:03,300;"That's the best."
01:07:03,300;01:07:04,340;"Yeah."
01:07:04,340;01:07:07,500;"But that won't be nearly as funny as a suffering through a bag of"
01:07:07,500;01:07:10,320;"Brock's turkey dinner candy corn, would it?"
01:07:10,320;01:07:14,560;"Look, he's gonna have to suffer through watching the lions lose."
01:07:14,560;01:07:16,180;"Yeah, but he's used to that."
01:07:16,180;01:07:18,240;"He's not used to turkey dinner candy corn, is he?"
01:07:18,240;01:07:20,460;"Well, it's not like violent on the poor guy."
01:07:20,460;01:07:24,040;"We're piling on just by having them on the first place because it's"
01:07:24,040;01:07:24,960;"suffer through us."
01:07:24,960;01:07:31,760;"Speaking of suffering, give me your best and worst."
01:07:35,960;01:07:39,580;"I feel like we've talked about I think the best was Charlie Weiss's play calling"
01:07:39,580;01:07:43,880;"Especially in the first half. He had he's calling a great game"
01:07:43,880;01:07:51,040;"They even outers they and they they likened the defense to like a boxer on his heels not knowing where it's coming from like the"
01:07:51,040;01:07:52,580;"second"
01:07:52,580;01:07:57,800;"4a TD was like not only was he open but Daniel Graham was right behind was open like everybody was"
01:07:59,240;01:08:06,980;"Yeah, it was it was literally just nothing but quick passes which was to slow down the defensive line basically"
01:08:06,980;01:08:11,560;"No, it's just like I don't know they're cadence and then they just kept everybody off balance"
01:08:11,560;01:08:16,720;"It was really good playcon and then the worst was how the Vikings used Randy Moss like I don't think you got one"
01:08:16,720;01:08:22,540;"Outside of that terrible throw by Culpepper. They didn't take a single deep shot with Randy right?"
01:08:22,540;01:08:26,120;"Which like I don't care if he is double-covered. Let's throw it up there. Oh, yeah"
01:08:26,600;01:08:33,800;"Brady's done it a bunch of third down. It's a pick. You know, might as well be a punt. Yeah"
01:08:33,800;01:08:37,640;"All right, my best was"
01:08:37,640;01:08:41,400;"Tom Brady on I"
01:08:41,400;01:08:49,580;"Think it was in the second quarter after Bennett fumbled the pages got the ball like inside their own 10 yard line"
01:08:49,580;01:08:52,320;"and it's third and seven"
01:08:52,320;01:08:55,080;"And the pages kind of like need to get out of their own end"
01:08:56,280;01:08:58,280;"Because at this point the"
01:08:58,280;01:09:00,560;"Kind of starting to drive"
01:09:00,560;01:09:03,920;"so what Brady does is he"
01:09:03,920;01:09:08,720;"Runs the hard count which draws the defensive line off sides"
01:09:08,720;01:09:11,680;"So then he knows he's got a free place we take the deep shot"
01:09:11,680;01:09:16,160;"Which then draws a path interference and they get the ball like the 40-yard line. They're out of danger"
01:09:16,160;01:09:22,120;"Oh, yeah, and this is like year two Tom Brady like that's some fucking that's some veteran shit right there. That was awesome"
01:09:24,400;01:09:28,560;"We talked about Richard Seymour blocking field goes that was great Roman Fyfer. I think"
01:09:28,560;01:09:33,520;"We haven't talked enough about him this year. He's he's still been one of the bright spots on"
01:09:33,520;01:09:37,600;"the defensive like up front there that front seven and"
01:09:37,600;01:09:40,720;"He actually forced two of the fumbles in this first half"
01:09:40,720;01:09:43,520;"he forced the I"
01:09:43,520;01:09:50,560;"Think it was the Bennett fumble and the Moss fumble both caused by him nice. Yeah, he's been solid"
01:09:50,560;01:09:54,040;"Yeah, I feel like he has been too. You know, yeah"
01:09:54,040;01:10:00,440;"But he's the guy that like never misses a tackle right always where it needs to be always around the ball doing things like that"
01:10:00,440;01:10:04,000;"And"
01:10:04,000;01:10:05,760;"Then there's also a"
01:10:05,760;01:10:08,760;"Kind of what Greg was on here that we can show him for this but"
01:10:08,760;01:10:14,960;"Belichick calling a timeout right at the end of the first quarter so the Vikings have to punt into the wind"
01:10:14,960;01:10:23,120;"So didn't build that check yeah, even the house is actually pays up on which I know 26 yard punt I think"
01:10:23,320;01:10:28,420;"Yeah, I have an order here 26 here putt daddy big leg. Yeah. It was garbage plenty of the wood"
01:10:28,420;01:10:34,660;"So that worked out and I think the page that I'm scoring a touch out on that in suing drive to which is great"
01:10:34,660;01:10:38,200;"my worst"
01:10:38,200;01:10:40,600;"Outside of Gary Anderson's face mask"
01:10:40,600;01:10:46,100;"Was probably I don't really want to say don't take cold pepper"
01:10:47,080;01:10:53,400;"Oh, I've a word for you. He was just not good. You ever worse for oh, no, you know what my words is real quick is"
01:10:53,400;01:10:58,640;"Fucking fox can't afford the yellow first download fucking scrubs"
01:10:58,640;01:11:01,920;"I haven't really seen it yet. Oh"
01:11:01,920;01:11:08,760;"Yeah, no, it's I think it's a national league games. Yeah, I think it's at the point where it's ESPN so owns the rights to it"
01:11:08,760;01:11:11,080;"but"
01:11:11,080;01:11:19,040;"Tom Brady got stoned on the fourth down sneak. He did he had a couple that ended up leading to another to the touchdown"
01:11:19,040;01:11:21,080;"Yeah"
01:11:21,080;01:11:25,600;"Right in the house, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you never see that I"
01:11:25,600;01:11:28,480;"Know what I can't remember the last time"
01:11:28,480;01:11:35,400;"We sneaked and not made it. Yeah, that was like 90 something percent and I think that was the first time it didn't work"
01:11:35,400;01:11:38,480;"Yeah, because they were talking about how before"
01:11:39,400;01:11:46,160;"With like less than three yards to go he picked it up 100% of the time so that may have been the first time he felt it"
01:11:46,160;01:11:50,700;"Yeah, that's a great one. So yeah, I think that does it for this game. I don't have any other"
01:11:50,700;01:11:53,120;"interesting things"
01:11:53,120;01:11:57,160;"I'm gonna read more of my books so that I can have something to annoy you about later"
01:11:57,160;01:12:01,260;"All right, I'm fine. I don't care what you do with your time you're deal"
01:12:01,260;01:12:07,920;"Firmly entrenched in loser value my love build the house. Yeah, I mean I'm gonna bring you down with me though. So yeah"
01:12:08,960;01:12:11,560;"So I guess is the point in the show where we should"
01:12:11,560;01:12:14,560;"ask for feedback, yeah"
01:12:14,560;01:12:19,400;"You keep nobody seems to be I don't nobody seems to be leaving any feedback"
01:12:19,400;01:12:24,840;"So I feel like we need to kind of sweeten the pot. Do you have any ideas? They can come on the show"
01:12:24,840;01:12:29,800;"If they leave feedback. Yeah, or fuck it anybody"
01:12:29,800;01:12:33,840;"Yeah, or we'll say whatever they want on and on the air"
01:12:35,440;01:12:37,680;"Fuck it. We'll do it live. Well, read it live."
01:12:37,680;01:12:43,600;"But I love it. All right. Yeah. I think how about this? We will say anything."
01:12:43,600;01:12:48,440;"Any feedback that we get any review that we get."
01:12:48,440;01:12:49,960;"Well, we have that one guy."
01:12:49,960;01:12:51,800;"That's a dot com shut up."
01:12:51,800;01:12:56,240;"Rate this podcast dot com slash pat's pod and that'll take you to whatever."
01:12:56,240;01:13:04,240;"Whatever thing that you use those in the podcast and a way that you can leave a review easily."
01:13:05,080;01:13:08,560;"You're not like encouraging reviews by saying nobody's reviewing us Andy."
01:13:08,560;01:13:11,000;"And now no one's going to want to review us because they don't want to be first."
01:13:11,000;01:13:12,200;"They're not first."
01:13:12,200;01:13:17,200;"We have, we have, I think three or four reviews already, but I just wanted to"
01:13:17,200;01:13:19,320;"know one guy that messaged us."
01:13:19,320;01:13:19,840;"Yeah."
01:13:19,840;01:13:22,200;"And we're going to have him on exactly."
01:13:22,200;01:13:22,600;"And soon."
01:13:22,600;01:13:22,960;"Yeah."
01:13:22,960;01:13:24,360;"That could be you."
01:13:24,360;01:13:27,440;"You could message us and then we're so desperate for guests."
01:13:27,440;01:13:28,240;"We bring you on."
01:13:28,240;01:13:29,440;"So here, how about this?"
01:13:29,440;01:13:30,120;"How about we do this?"
01:13:30,120;01:13:33,320;"Any feedback we get we're going to read on the podcast."
01:13:33,320;01:13:33,640;"Yeah."
01:13:33,640;01:13:34,760;"Sure."
01:13:34,960;01:13:36,560;"So if you if you want to hear a"
01:13:36,560;01:13:37,080;"lesson,"
01:13:37,080;01:13:39,560;"or a voice unless it's slandering me and"
01:13:39,560;01:13:41,280;"then it's not especially if it's"
01:13:41,280;01:13:43,000;"slandering you know if it's"
01:13:43,000;01:13:44,240;"slandering you and have Greg read it."
01:13:44,240;01:13:45,920;"And if it's slandering Neil have you"
01:13:45,920;01:13:46,360;"read it."
01:13:46,360;01:13:49,320;"And if I think it's maybe it's more"
01:13:49,320;01:13:50,480;"like the mean tweets where you have to"
01:13:50,480;01:13:51,840;"read your own slanderous."
01:13:51,840;01:13:54,320;"Oh, that's even better."
01:13:54,320;01:13:55,400;"I love it."
01:13:55,400;01:13:56,280;"All right."
01:13:56,280;01:13:59,080;"So if yeah, if you have anything"

01:14:01,440;01:14:02,880;"you will read it on here."
01:14:03,440;01:14:13,200;"And how about at the end of or if we if we find them, we like, especially if you got some like cool inside or something like that, we will have you on the podcast if you want to come on."
01:14:13,200;01:14:14,480;"How's that sound?"
01:14:14,480;01:14:16,240;"No, I'm glad you're excited for it."
01:14:16,240;01:14:16,880;"Awesome."
01:14:16,880;01:14:17,360;"Thanks."
01:14:17,360;01:14:24,640;"You know, I don't even fuck what people say what they think except you, mom."
01:14:24,640;01:14:25,920;"I think I care."
01:14:25,920;01:14:30,320;"Well, mom is one of our reviews."
01:14:30,320;01:14:33,240;"She she didn't know she was leaving a review."
01:14:33,240;01:14:38,240;"But for her, so we're stuck in balance something."
01:14:38,240;01:14:39,840;"So I made a review."
01:14:39,840;01:14:40,760;"- Oh yes."
01:14:40,760;01:14:41,880;"- Posted it on Twitter."
01:14:41,880;01:14:44,000;"- Did it include burbling along?"
01:14:44,000;01:14:45,000;"- It did, yes."
01:14:45,000;01:14:45,840;"That's burbling along."
01:14:45,840;01:14:46,680;"- That's been--"
01:14:46,680;01:14:47,520;"- Burble for mom real quick."
01:14:47,520;01:14:49,920;"Burble, burble, burble, burble, burble, burble, burble, burble."
01:14:49,920;01:14:53,320;"- She does enjoy the podcast though."
01:14:53,320;01:14:54,680;"- She loves it."
01:14:54,680;01:14:55,840;"- Made it so cool."
01:14:55,840;01:14:57,880;"- We've been taking it for a while,"
01:14:57,880;01:14:59,480;"but maybe we'll have her on the podcast."
01:14:59,480;01:15:00,520;"- Maybe that's our niche,"
01:15:00,520;01:15:07,520;"did six year old ladies who love quilting and Patriots. Yeah. And Greg being an asshole."
01:15:07,520;01:15:13,360;"I don't know if she loves that. He does say that she's learned a lot about Gregory. Yeah."
01:15:13,360;01:15:21,480;"Yeah. Probably to his detriment out of me. I can't wait for Christmas. Awkward dinner table."
01:15:21,480;01:15:28,880;"I'm going to make it awkward. Wine fix is all those problems. Don't worry, Andy. It's Christmas."
01:15:28,880;01:15:32,680;"Yeah, maybe we'll have to have some Audrey Bloodsaw wine for Christmas."
01:15:32,680;01:15:34,680;"There you go!"
01:15:34,680;01:15:36,680;"Mom loves bloodsaw."
01:15:36,680;01:15:38,480;"Mom loves wine."
01:15:38,480;01:15:39,480;"Boom."
01:15:39,480;01:15:41,480;"Don, I know what you should get for Christmas."
01:15:41,480;01:15:42,480;"Don't tell her."
01:15:42,480;01:15:44,280;"Mom, don't listen to this part."
01:15:44,280;01:15:45,280;"Fuck."
01:15:45,280;01:15:47,480;"We just won't release until after Christmas."
01:15:47,480;01:15:52,440;"No, I don't think that's possible."
01:15:52,440;01:15:54,480;"But all right, you got anything else, Steve?"
01:15:54,480;01:15:55,480;"I'm Gagey."
01:15:55,480;01:16:02,600;"Or can we take this episode out back and and put a bullet through its head? Yeah, let's do that. All right, so"

00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,400;"I am not your mother."
00:18,400;00:27,680;"Welcome back to the Patre's Dinesy Podcast."
00:27,680;00:31,240;"I am your host, Andy Brown, with me are the brothers Brown,"
00:31,240;00:35,000;"fresh off of a, I think our experiment"
00:35,000;00:40,000;"into other fan bases was a short one, short lived"
00:40,000;00:45,400;"from our Browns on Browns podcast earlier."
00:45,400;00:48,400;"- I thought it was, I think I stunk up the joint."
00:48,400;00:50,560;"- Yeah."
00:50,560;00:51,560;"- No."
00:51,560;00:54,680;"- C minus."
00:54,680;00:55,520;"- I was trying to think of a group."
00:55,520;00:56,840;"- Very naughty."
00:56,840;00:59,240;"I think it was poop joke."
00:59,240;01:01,360;"Yeah, so we didn't end up dropping the Browns off"
01:01,360;01:02,920;"at the pool."
01:02,920;01:05,000;"Jump off that then."
01:05,000;01:09,080;"So yeah, but I think going from watching"
01:09,080;01:11,480;"all of these Cleveland Brown losses,"
01:11,480;01:14,040;"even though that was just the highlights,"
01:14,040;01:18,760;"the shift from that to the game we're talking about this week,"
01:18,760;01:22,400;"Greg, you want to introduce us to what this game is?"
01:22,400;01:25,560;"Yeah, can we just play that the clash song?"
01:25,560;01:28,920;"I fought the law and the love one."
01:28,920;01:32,080;"I fought the law and the law one."
01:32,080;01:34,280;"I'll see if I can fit that in here in the post."
01:34,280;01:37,080;"That describes this game."
01:37,080;01:38,280;"So what was it?"
01:38,280;01:41,480;"The single greatest."
01:41,480;01:46,200;"Single defensive player game in Patriots history."
01:46,200;01:48,440;"Okay."
01:48,440;01:51,160;"And we want to argue that."
01:51,160;01:53,680;"William, I'll come for you."
01:53,680;01:59,840;"throw. Well, it did set the league record in sacks in the playoff game once."
01:59,840;02:04,480;"Does that count? That's pretty good. I couldn't think of any on top of my head."
02:04,480;02:09,440;"What year was that Andy? It'll be a couple years after then. I got five or six something."
02:09,440;02:20,160;"I guess the JAG whatever game that was. But yeah, I would say that I mean, if this isn't"
02:20,160;02:29,600;"Number one, it's one in one A, you know, 2003 AFC conference game, Patriots versus the Colts,"
02:29,600;02:36,320;"Peyton Manning coming to town in the snowish sleep. It's more like it was slushing."
02:36,320;02:41,520;"Anybody who's from doing the long stand that term, it's it's snow, but just barely is right"
02:41,520;02:45,440;"on the edge of rain. And so it hits you and it melts immediately and you just get soaking wet,"
02:45,440;02:46,440;"even though it's snowing."
02:46,440;02:47,880;"Hmm."
02:47,880;02:48,840;"Saw you out there."
02:48,840;02:49,240;"Yeah."
02:49,240;02:52,000;"From all the all the fans that you saw out there just standing there just"
02:52,000;02:53,680;"they were soaked."
02:53,680;02:54,680;"Yeah."
02:54,680;02:58,360;"What they weren't covered in snow and it wasn't really accumulating."
02:58,360;03:01,200;"Like it was kind of like that had that like, you know, when you get"
03:01,200;03:03,360;"the slush on his eye walk, it was like that on the field."
03:03,360;03:03,840;"Yeah."
03:03,840;03:04,880;"Perfect football weather."
03:04,880;03:06,640;"That's what Virginia winter is."
03:06,640;03:08,320;"That's how it smells here."
03:08,320;03:09,600;"Yeah."
03:09,600;03:11,880;"So another reason not to go to move to Virginia."
03:11,880;03:12,320;"Sounds great."
03:12,320;03:13,160;"You're right."
03:13,160;03:15,460;"They were probably wishing for snow at that point in that stadium."
03:15,460;03:17,160;"They're like, how do I have snow right now?"
03:17,160;03:17,860;"Yep."
03:17,860;03:20,120;"Yeah, all or nothing."
03:20,120;03:20,720;"That's what you need."
03:20,720;03:21,920;"Um, yeah."
03:21,920;03:25,460;"I mean, there's got to be so much hype going around this game."
03:25,460;03:27,960;"Oh, going into this game."
03:27,960;03:32,280;"I, because this is like a, even if you're not a Patriots fan or Colts fan,"
03:32,280;03:34,860;"this is like an NFL fans dream."
03:34,860;03:35,480;"Yeah."
03:35,480;03:39,700;"It's the best offense versus the best defense in the league."
03:40,520;03:44,320;"playing about as well as those units can play too."
03:44,320;03:46,000;"Yeah, so let's talk about the Colts,"
03:46,000;03:50,160;"because I think that was the kind of the big storyline"
03:50,160;03:52,360;"is that coming into this game, the Colts"
03:52,360;03:55,640;"were as hot as you can be for an offense."
03:55,640;03:56,960;"So hot right now."
03:56,960;04:00,680;"So hot right now."
04:00,680;04:03,440;"So because I-- all right, so I don't know"
04:03,440;04:04,920;"if any of you have the stats for this,"
04:04,920;04:08,320;"but I know one of them was that in the Colts' first two"
04:08,320;04:10,440;"playoff games, they had not punted."
04:10,440;04:12,440;"They hadn't punted once."
04:12,440;04:15,440;"We'll get to the other defining part of this game for me."
04:15,440;04:16,440;"Yeah, we'll get there."
04:16,440;04:17,440;"But let's talk."
04:17,440;04:19,440;"I mean, what else?"
04:19,440;04:22,440;"What else was happening with these Colts coming into this game?"
04:22,440;04:28,440;"Well, if we want to back up a step to put it in historical context of the Colts right there."
04:28,440;04:34,440;"Pretty bad for a while until they drafted Payton and first overall."
04:34,440;04:35,440;"Yeah."
04:35,440;04:36,440;"Yeah."
04:36,440;04:37,440;"First overall."
04:37,440;04:38,880;"ball. He's their savior."
04:38,880;04:40,320;"He's like, our boss to be."
04:40,320;04:41,320;"Remember that?"
04:41,320;04:42,320;"Yeah."
04:42,320;04:43,320;"Yeah."
04:43,320;04:44,320;"Yeah."
04:44,320;04:47,680;"So he's like coming into his own."
04:47,680;04:50,320;"This is his fifth season in the NFL."
04:50,320;04:53,800;"He's he puts up a lot of Gody numbers."
04:53,800;04:56,840;"But he's but they can't get over the hump of the playoffs."
04:56,840;05:01,280;"So he's only three in the playoffs prior to getting to this season."
05:01,280;05:02,280;"Which is good."
05:02,280;05:04,800;"It's jets last year or something."
05:04,800;05:05,800;"Maybe the playoffs three."
05:05,800;05:06,800;"Yeah."
05:06,800;05:09,760;"blown off 41 nothing by the Jets last year. Yeah, yeah, yeah."
05:09,760;05:14,080;"But I mean, the fact that they made three playoffs in, you know, five years, pretty good."
05:14,080;05:15,200;"Four years, right? Yeah, that one."
05:15,200;05:23,760;"So then this year rolls around. They go 12 and four. He's a co-NVP. He's the NFL passing"
05:23,760;05:30,160;"lead area is like 4,200 yards on the season through the year, which in 2003 is ridiculous."
05:30,160;05:36,160;"29 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions. Yeah, they're averaging a shade under 30 points a game,"
05:36,160;05:43,360;"the offense, their second in points, third in yards in the NFL. They get the"
05:43,360;05:50,320;"division or the wild card because the other coin VP that we just beat last week, right,"
05:50,320;05:53,360;"see back there. So then all they do in that is they"
05:53,360;06:02,400;"shit stomp the Broncos 41 to 10 in the Annapolis. I got the drive chart in front of me."
06:02,960;06:09,960;"This is the cold drive chart touchdown touchdown touchdown touchdown field goal touchdown field goal fumble downs. That's it."
06:09,960;06:17,860;"Yeah, it wasn't paid Manning. Didn't you have like almost a perfect quarterback rating in that?"
06:17,860;06:21,340;"If one of the two, I think it was. Yeah. So paid Manning stats in that game."
06:21,340;06:25,440;"Twenty two of twenty six, three hundred seventy seven yards, five touchdowns, no picks."
06:25,440;06:28,820;"Fuck. One fifty eight point three rating. Perfect rating. Yeah."
06:28,820;06:32,700;"So those last two weren't even Manning. The the fumble down."
06:32,700;06:34,780;"So every time man is in there, garbage time."
06:34,780;06:35,060;"Yeah."
06:35,060;06:35,980;"Touchdown or field go?"
06:35,980;06:36,380;"Touchdown."
06:36,380;06:37,860;"They score, they score touchdowns."
06:37,860;06:38,180;"Yeah."
06:38,180;06:38,700;"Jesus."
06:38,700;06:39,140;"All right."
06:39,140;06:43,140;"So then they go to the Chiefs who had a great season as well."
06:43,140;06:43,900;"Yeah."
06:43,900;06:46,220;"They were all undefeated for like week nine or something."
06:46,220;06:46,940;"Yeah."
06:46,940;06:49,260;"Want to hear their drive chart from that game?"
06:49,260;06:49,900;"Yes, please."
06:49,900;06:55,380;"Touchdown, touchdown, touchdown, and to half field goal, touchdown, touchdown downs."
06:55,380;07:01,980;"So this was on like 80%."
07:02,100;07:06,260;"So that was a 38 to 35 or 38 31."
07:06,260;07:09,180;"In Kansas City. Yeah."
07:09,180;07:11,100;"Cause that was yeah, that was a shoot out. That's right."
07:11,100;07:12,560;"Because it was. Um."
07:12,560;07:16,380;"That was priest Holmes's chiefs too."
07:16,380;07:18,240;"Correct. Yeah. They were."
07:18,240;07:19,540;"A bunch of things."
07:19,540;07:25,380;"There you might see. Yep. Yep. And manning stat line 22 of 30,"
07:25,380;07:28,040;"304 yards, three touchdowns, no picks."
07:28,040;07:31,120;"138.7 only."
07:31,120;07:42,120;"Yeah, so coming into this, he is just torching defenses, leaving dead defenses in his wake."
07:42,120;07:46,120;"Yeah, he's got 12 incompletions in two games and eight touchdowns."
07:46,120;07:51,120;"So it's about as good as Manny gets."
07:51,120;07:55,120;"Yeah, you can't really get any better in the playoffs."
07:55,120;07:56,120;"Yeah."
07:56,120;08:00,120;"So you got to think Colts fans are going, OK, this is the year we got over that playoff"
08:00,120;08:03,920;"And then V.P. we are unstoppable."
08:03,920;08:05,400;"We're a wagon right now."
08:05,400;08:07,160;"We're going to the Super Bowl."
08:07,160;08:08,160;"Yeah."
08:08,160;08:10,720;"On Kansas City, that's a tough place to win."
08:10,720;08:11,720;"Arrowhead."
08:11,720;08:12,720;"Right."
08:12,720;08:14,640;"Into Arrowhead, stomp them."
08:14,640;08:19,840;"And so that kind of segues into one of the quotes that the commentators talked about."
08:19,840;08:26,440;"I think it was Bernie on the, um, Bonnie on the sidelines talking about before the game,"
08:26,440;08:31,040;"uh... pain man himself was coming in with a lot of"
08:31,040;08:34,680;"with the cults trailing new england by fourteen pain manning was right about"
08:34,680;08:37,960;"one thing and wrong about another he was right when he called the paper it's"
08:37,960;08:38,520;"quote"
08:38,520;08:42,160;"a different animal he said there's sound on both sides of the ball will have to"
08:42,160;08:43,320;"work for everything"
08:43,320;08:45,520;"he was wrong when he said if we lose this"
08:45,520;08:47,440;"it won't be because they confuse me"
08:47,440;08:49,760;"four interceptions great speaks for itself"
08:49,760;08:53,080;"first four interceptions of the post season for him"
08:53,080;08:56,840;"So if they lose this, it's not going to be because this page was defense confused."
08:56,840;08:58,480;"Yeah."
08:58,480;09:05,820;"That's the problem, which to me as at the time, probably a bigger"
09:05,820;09:07,520;"Peyton Manning hater than I am now."
09:07,520;09:12,540;"Um, wasn't a huge fan of him when he played, but he's grown on me now."
09:12,540;09:13,200;"He's retired."
09:13,200;09:18,200;"Um, I would say that's that, that almost sounds a little bit like, uh,"
09:18,200;09:19,800;"him throwing his kicker under the bus."
09:20,080;09:22,900;"It's like, well, if we lose, it's not going to be because of me, obviously."
09:22,900;09:29,220;"So it's almost like he was kind of building in some other excuses as to why"
09:29,220;09:31,660;"this team might lose maybe defensively."
09:31,660;09:33,360;"They're going to give up too many points or whatever."
09:33,360;09:37,060;"Yeah, which makes sense after the previous week when it gave up 31."
09:37,060;09:37,760;"Yeah."
09:37,760;09:38,100;"Pro."
09:38,100;09:41,700;"He's like all of the new and scoring touchdowns because their defense wasn't great."
09:41,700;09:43,180;"That's true."
09:43,180;09:45,940;"Did you see that stat about the punts too?"
09:45,940;09:48,700;"No, about punless games."
09:48,700;09:54,680;"say they point out. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think I take a picture of it. Yeah. It was what"
09:54,680;10:02,020;"do I have it? NFL postseason all time games with zero punts Colts this year two games all"
10:02,020;10:11,100;"other teams three games out of three hundred ninety one possible games. That's pretty crazy."
10:11,100;10:15,580;"Yeah. And so you were thinking this was like I think a lot of people going into this would"
10:15,580;10:19,620;"thing is going to be a shootout because that's what it was in Indianapolis when the Patriots"
10:19,620;10:22,660;"went there earlier in the season, right?"
10:22,660;10:25,780;"Right, which was like an all time regular season game."
10:25,780;10:29,700;"So that's adding to the hype this too of like, okay, they went to Indy."
10:29,700;10:35,980;"There was a last minute play to win the game after a furious like 21 point comeback."
10:35,980;10:39,420;"So like throw that in the mix of getting hype about this."
10:39,420;10:40,420;"Oh, absolutely."
10:40,420;10:41,420;"Yeah."
10:41,420;10:42,420;"That works."
10:42,420;10:43,620;"It's like, I'm gonna just match up."
10:43,620;10:45,580;"It's like, I'm gonna match up."
10:45,580;10:47,020;"- Yeah, it's a wet dream."
10:47,020;10:51,500;"He got Brady who's like the winning quarterback"
10:51,500;10:54,340;"that's young that like, oh, he could be pretty good."
10:54,340;10:56,500;"Manning who's like the highly touty,"
10:56,500;10:58,860;"like his first round pick and a seventh round pick"
10:58,860;10:59,700;"going at it."
10:59,700;11:02,540;"They're both like really good earlier in their careers."
11:02,540;11:04,420;"Like that dynamic's awesome."
11:04,420;11:06,340;"- Yeah."
11:06,340;11:09,340;"- The Belichick Manning dynamic is there."
11:09,340;11:11,460;"- Yeah, they've been going at it for years at this point"
11:11,460;11:14,820;"since 2000 and Belichick is often not always,"
11:14,820;11:18,260;"but often got Manning's number."
11:18,260;11:20,500;"McManning doesn't always have great games against them."
11:20,500;11:23,540;"- So I think Manning was like one in six"
11:23,540;11:25,940;"against Belichick to this point, Miss Career."
11:25,940;11:27,300;"- Something like five."
11:27,300;11:28,140;"- Yeah."
11:28,140;11:28,980;"- This might have been the sixth one."
11:28,980;11:29,820;"- I think so."
11:29,820;11:33,460;"- Yeah, 'cause that was an early narrative, right?"
11:33,460;11:35,540;"It wasn't so much Belichick versus Manning,"
11:35,540;11:38,420;"or Brady Manning, it was Belichick Manning."
11:38,420;11:40,700;"'Cause Belichick was the defensive mastermind."
11:40,700;11:45,120;"Can you come up with something to, to confuse Peyton and"
11:45,120;11:47,360;"Beethoven's over here being like, Nah, he ain't going to confuse me."
11:47,360;11:51,700;"If we lose any because I was confused."
11:51,700;11:55,100;"So the four INT said buddy."
11:55,100;11:55,660;"Yeah."
11:55,660;12:01,140;"And then I would, I would say, uh, you know, Peyton Manning faces a very"
12:01,140;12:02,980;"recognizable meme."
12:02,980;12:07,140;"I would have to say this game was probably its apex."
12:07,420;12:18,140;"Pete all time Manning face just from the get go from the first interception he threw they cut to him and he did the triple shrug"
12:18,140;12:27,420;"There's no less than 15 Manning faces in this game. Oh, at least some of those ones you see in memes now are in this game and like it's just"
12:27,420;12:29,980;"Full of great Manning face"
12:29,980;12:33,100;"In all's grouchy he was grouchy"
12:34,380;12:35,800;"Oh, he's reason to be"
12:35,800;12:39,140;"a bitch. He looked war torn."
12:39,140;12:42,540;"So he he fought the law"
12:42,540;12:45,340;"and the law won. Okay."
12:45,340;12:48,140;"It really did."
12:48,140;12:50,080;"All right. So do you want to kind of get into this game then?"
12:50,080;12:54,880;"Yeah, sure. Because yeah, I mean, we won't go drive by drive."
12:54,880;12:58,720;"But I think there's a lot of like I have a I let's go quarter by quarter."
12:58,720;13:00,680;"All right. You have a thought, Steve?"
13:00,680;13:04,000;"Yeah. And then it shows up pretty early in this game too is"
13:04,000;13:09,000;"the law. Remember we had that poster of the law in the lawyer, you know?"
13:09,000;13:15,000;"This is the first law that don't have lawyer and they swapped him in for Rodney Harrison."
13:15,000;13:17,000;"Yes. And he balled out in this game."
13:17,000;13:21,000;"He did. Yeah. Awesome. Awesome game. I think it was correct."
13:21,000;13:23,000;"Or stumble in the first quarter."
13:23,000;13:26,000;"Well, no, yeah, the interception. The game starts."
13:26,000;13:30,000;"The Patriots go out and, um,"
13:30,000;13:36,360;"Like his first drive, I think it's like midfield or something and they, they go for it on"
13:36,360;13:41,320;"fourth and one was like, yeah, at the Colts 40 and it's like a Brady sneak as it always"
13:41,320;13:45,920;"is. But like that almost set the tone of like, this is going to be one of those games where"
13:45,920;13:49,720;"we're just going to like, we're not playing it safe. We're going to pull out all the stops"
13:49,720;13:52,360;"and it started literally the first drive going for them fourth and one."
13:52,360;13:53,680;"It was the first series."
13:53,680;13:58,040;"Yeah, and then it ends with Brady throwing"
13:58,040;14:05,720;"One of my favorite of his touchdowns. I think it's one of those ones that I I always forget about but when I watch I'm like"
14:05,720;14:11,320;"Oh, that is one of the greatest play calls and like execution of it as well where it was"
14:11,320;14:13,800;"Brady he had"
14:13,800;14:15,800;"given down on the wing and"
14:15,800;14:21,920;"He faked the wide receiver screen to him so the defensive back comes up and then give him just runs past"
14:21,920;14:26,160;"We just like lobbed it to him in the end zone wide open perfect. We'll such a great play call"
14:26,160;14:28,000;"They're only the seven right that's a perfect"
14:28,000;14:32,800;"That's a tough peaches run that play all the time of just get it to wide receiver on you know inside the five"
14:32,800;14:35,760;"You're not even you can make a miss and he's got a touchdown if you can right"
14:35,760;14:39,840;"And the dude bid on it so hard because they pump it and he's given so"
14:39,840;14:44,720;"It was such a good play. I don't think I've ever seen them really run that again that I can remember it's true"
14:44,720;14:49,600;"But like that's your first like touchdown play call is that which is great"
14:50,000;14:52,000;"Do you even have four catches on that drive?"
14:52,000;14:54,960;"Yeah, you did really do much else after that, but"
14:54,960;14:57,600;"it's all right"
14:57,600;15:02,640;"And then yeah, and then of course like the Colts as they would do kind of almost all game"
15:02,640;15:05,760;"just kind of"
15:05,760;15:07,760;"moves straight down the fields with"
15:07,760;15:12,720;"Relative ease. I don't know about ease. I mean, I think the page made them work for it, but they were still"
15:12,720;15:16,320;"moving the ball successfully"
15:16,320;15:19,120;"get down to"
15:19,760;15:21,680;"inside the new England like five yard line."
15:21,680;15:23,360;"None on third down."
15:23,360;15:26,600;"Many gets confused for the first time of the day"
15:26,600;15:29,400;"and throws an interception to Rodney Harrison."
15:29,400;15:32,520;"And I thought if you looked at the play,"
15:32,520;15:36,240;"I think it's so much Tony Pollard, the tight end."
15:36,240;15:37,360;"He was."
15:37,360;15:39,200;"And Marcus Paul, sorry."
15:39,200;15:40,000;"Yeah."
15:40,000;15:44,160;"And he looked wide open at the beginning, which he may have been."
15:44,160;15:46,560;"But then all of a sudden, Rodney Harrison kind of like the whole"
15:46,560;15:50,040;"defense like shifts as the play is happening and like rotates"
15:50,040;15:50,540;"almost."
15:50,540;15:53,080;"All of a sudden Ronnie's just he's just there."
15:53,080;15:55,720;"There's a bad throw."
15:55,720;15:56,720;"It was not a good throw."
15:56,720;15:58,240;"He's thrown off his belt."
15:58,240;15:59,840;"But is it a bad pedaling?"
15:59,840;16:00,720;"Is he throwing it?"
16:00,720;16:02,720;"It's the read and then tried to still do it anyways."
16:02,720;16:06,680;"And Ronnie's instincts took over, peeled off his guy and victimized"
16:06,680;16:07,440;"him in the end zone."
16:07,440;16:08,120;"Yeah."
16:08,120;16:13,000;"And then we said, oh, I first paid Manning face where he goes,"
16:13,000;16:15,760;"he's like, oh, yeah, does his little shrug thing."
16:15,760;16:17,240;"he's looking at. That was the triple."
16:17,240;16:19,520;"You know, how he's looking at like what?"
16:19,520;16:23,160;"Yeah. You know, who you're trying to blame that that was all on you, bud."
16:23,160;16:27,920;"Like Paul was wide over from the from the get go and you just missed the read"
16:27,920;16:28,960;"until you found it too late."
16:28,960;16:33,280;"Yeah, anyone interested go to 19 minutes in the YouTube video?"
16:33,280;16:34,200;"I wrote him down."
16:34,200;16:39,440;"Dude, I started I started writing down manning faces and then I had to start"
16:39,440;16:42,640;"abbreviating MF, which I thought was funny because motherfucker."
16:43,520;16:45,400;"And then I just gave up because there's so many."
16:45,400;16:46,840;"I was like, I can't keep doing this."
16:46,840;16:49,040;"It's just, yeah, I wouldn't even like write them down."
16:49,040;16:50,120;"Just just watch the whole thing."
16:50,120;16:52,640;"Cause you'll, you'll get a sprinkling of them in there."
16:52,640;16:57,320;"You could, you can legit go to the YouTube, which is two hours long and just click randomly"
16:57,320;17:00,760;"in the fire and you'll see one within about a minute and a half."
17:00,760;17:01,280;"Yeah."
17:01,280;17:01,600;"Oh, yeah."
17:01,600;17:01,800;"Yeah."
17:01,800;17:01,800;"Yeah."
17:01,800;17:02,720;"You'll get there real quick."
17:02,720;17:03,760;"Won't take you long."
17:03,760;17:05,080;"Yeah."
17:05,080;17:08,600;"Just just just watch random plays of the Colts on offense and you'll get there."
17:08,600;17:12,520;"So that was basically the first quarter."
17:12,520;17:15,820;"Both those drives took quite a lot of time."
17:15,820;17:19,560;"So Patriots up seven nothing, first quarter."
17:19,560;17:21,400;"And I remember, I think--"
17:21,400;17:22,400;"- Before we move on."
17:22,400;17:23,240;"- Huh?"
17:23,240;17:24,080;"- Yeah."
17:24,080;17:24,900;"- And I stand right before through the interception"
17:24,900;17:26,000;"on third down in the red zone"
17:26,000;17:28,460;"about how in the playoffs he'd been 13 for 13"
17:28,460;17:29,440;"on third down."
17:29,440;17:30,760;"(laughs)"
17:30,760;17:34,360;"- And also there was another one where they were"
17:34,360;17:37,800;"another stat 10 touchdowns in the last 13 red zone drives."
17:37,800;17:39,080;"- The Colts offense."
17:39,080;17:40,160;"- Love that."
17:40,160;17:41,000;"- Oops."
17:41,000;17:50,160;"Oh, and also on the Colts opened their offensive play, like when they got the ball back, their"
17:50,160;17:52,640;"first offensive play was a false start."
17:52,640;17:56,240;"And it was the first penalty on offense the whole postseason for them."
17:56,240;17:58,520;"117 players as the first one they did."
17:58,520;18:01,680;"And it was literally the first play of the game for them."
18:01,680;18:02,680;"That was nice."
18:02,680;18:03,680;"All right."
18:03,680;18:07,320;"So first quarter over seven nothing."
18:07,320;18:13,680;"And so I was thinking about this today where like some of these games like I remember a"
18:13,680;18:22,460;"lot about them or you know for a lot of like Boston sports moments you know you remember"
18:22,460;18:25,120;"where you were and that sort of thing."
18:25,120;18:28,880;"In this game I didn't remember where I was when I watched or anything like that but I"
18:28,880;18:35,380;"remembered the feeling that I had when I watched originally when I was watching it again this"
18:35,380;18:36,380;"week."
18:36,380;18:37,420;"What do you mean?"
18:37,420;18:38,420;"Because it--"
18:38,420;18:40,660;"[LAUGHTER]"
18:40,660;18:42,100;"Because it was a rouse for me."
18:42,100;18:46,500;"It was that but also fear in there too of fear."
18:46,500;18:49,340;"We're going to be able to keep this up."
18:49,340;18:50,740;"And once we get in the second quarter,"
18:50,740;18:52,660;"this is where it kind of hit."
18:52,660;18:55,380;"This whole second quarter and the way it all played out,"
18:55,380;18:57,980;"like, wait, we could actually do this."
18:57,980;19:01,740;"If we keep doing this in the second half,"
19:01,740;19:04,660;"we can pull this off without Brady throwing any more"
19:04,660;19:09,460;"touch chance. Well, they they dominated, but they weren't"
19:09,460;19:11,560;"dominant on the scoreboard. I think that's what I'm saying."
19:11,560;19:15,140;"Yeah. Yeah. Because they're red zone offense was atrocious."
19:15,140;19:18,300;"Ben and Terry goes five or five on field goals. We were just"
19:18,300;19:21,580;"shitting on the double overtime game last week where they went"
19:21,580;19:24,820;"five or five for Carolina. But I could have kicked those. You"
19:24,820;19:26,900;"know what I'm saying? They're all from like within the 10."
19:26,900;19:30,500;"Right. I've been all year. They'd had shit red zone offense. And"
19:30,500;19:33,780;"it's like, if they had just scored a couple touchdowns, and"
19:33,780;19:38,340;"games over and they're just kind of hanging in. I get that fear too Andy, I remember that."
19:38,340;19:45,940;"Yeah. But they were doing just enough on like every drive it felt like. I think because"
19:45,940;19:51,060;"I think they went out, they went three and out twice and they were both in the fourth quarter."
19:51,060;19:56,260;"So they were kind of still like moving the ball while the Patriots were."
19:56,260;20:00,580;"Yeah. A lot of like five wide in the snow as you do."
20:01,700;20:04,020;"But Brown and clutch spots."
20:04,020;20:04,500;"Yeah."
20:04,500;20:06,540;"Yeah, a lot of Troy Brown when you absolutely needed him."
20:06,540;20:08,500;"I think he didn't convert another fourth down."
20:08,500;20:09,300;"He did."
20:09,300;20:11,380;"He come fourth in like a third and 10."
20:11,380;20:16,940;"He was and also on the first drive, the second quarter and the page is driving again."
20:16,940;20:22,820;"There he had like two huge catches and then Brady almost throws an interception."
20:22,820;20:25,820;"But Troy Brown knocks out of the defender's hand."
20:25,820;20:28,060;"So they were able to kick a field goal on that first drive."
20:28,060;20:30,700;"Um, right."
20:30,820;20:38,780;"Yeah. And so that was like a huge turning point to because I mean, it's three points, but it kind of all like mattered at the end. So."
20:38,780;20:42,540;"So yeah, Pat's were up, what, 10, nothing at this point."
20:42,540;20:46,700;"Right. So after the turnover, they marched down, they kick a field goal."
20:46,700;20:48,620;"It's 10, nothing passed."
20:48,620;20:49,500;"Yeah."
20:49,500;20:51,820;"Peyton in the start of the second quarter."
20:51,820;20:54,060;"So like Peyton's getting a little frisky."
20:54,060;20:55,900;"He's like, I got to do something here."
20:55,900;20:58,580;"And a 60 yard kickoff return."
20:58,580;21:00,020;"No, I understand."
21:00,020;21:03,580;"Sorry. First offensive play."
21:03,580;21:07,700;"You tried to. Yeah."
21:07,700;21:13,220;"He tries to stick one on the corner on the corner out and Ty Law, who is,"
21:13,220;21:16,380;"who's over there. He jumps off his guy."
21:16,380;21:20,180;"You guys will remember this play where he starts floating back and he just does"
21:20,180;21:24,660;"the one hand scoop catch as he's sliding down."
21:24,660;21:27,740;"Probably the best of his three picks of the game, I would say."
21:27,740;21:31,540;"Whenever I hear the name Troy Brown,"
21:31,540;21:34,180;"a tie log, that's the play I think of."
21:34,180;21:36,500;"That's the first play that pops into my mind."
21:36,500;21:38,180;"- This might be his best interception ever."
21:38,180;21:39,820;"- Yeah, I would agree."
21:39,820;21:43,100;"- He's most athletic, I mean, that was a one-handed step."
21:43,100;21:44,100;"- One-handed step."
21:44,100;21:45,100;"- Yeah."
21:45,100;21:46,180;"- Perfect catch."
21:46,180;21:47,180;"- Amazing catch."
21:47,180;21:49,660;"- Well, it was just indicative of how tie-law plays."
21:49,660;21:53,700;"He's proactive rather than reactive, right?"
21:53,700;21:55,380;"I think you get a lot of cornerbacks in the league"
21:55,380;22:00,380;"that they're decent players, but they're always just"
22:00,380;22:03,200;"trying to not get beat."
22:03,200;22:04,040;"- Yeah."
22:04,040;22:06,640;"- Where Tylol would try and beat you."
22:06,640;22:07,560;"- Yeah, absolutely."
22:07,560;22:09,760;"- You know, he'd be like, I in quarterbacks,"
22:09,760;22:11,160;"he'd be trying to jump routes,"
22:11,160;22:13,680;"he'd be doing all the stuff that's like,"
22:13,680;22:15,440;"I don't know, he just felt like a competitor"
22:15,440;22:18,560;"that was trying to make plays every time he was out there."
22:18,560;22:19,400;"- I agree."
22:19,400;22:20,220;"- I agree."
22:20,220;22:22,720;"- He does the same thing and more does the same thing."
22:22,720;22:24,480;"Those two guys also were--"
22:24,480;22:25,320;"Who?"
22:25,320;22:26,160;"Gilmore."
22:26,160;22:27,000;"Gilmore."
22:27,000;22:28,780;"They're like baked quarterbacks into throws"
22:28,780;22:30,760;"and like read them and set them up"
22:30,760;22:32,800;"and just like they are trying to beat you."
22:32,800;22:35,640;"And I agree with that."
22:35,640;22:39,640;"And it almost feels like they know not just"
22:39,640;22:41,560;"what their responsibility is on the field,"
22:41,560;22:44,320;"but like what the defenders around them need to be doing too."
22:44,320;22:47,480;"So like on that play, especially like that,"
22:47,480;22:51,160;"like you said, that wasn't the guy Tylol was covering,"
22:51,160;22:52,000;"but he dropped off of that"
22:52,000;22:53,640;"'cause you saw Peyton Manning's going deep"
22:53,640;22:56,440;"and the commentators I was talking about,"
22:56,440;22:58,540;"like how many meetings, Tyler was like,"
22:58,540;22:59,880;"""I don't need to be in all these meetings."
22:59,880;23:02,800;"We have meetings all the goddamn time."""
23:02,800;23:05,720;"And they're like, ""Well, I mean, this is what you get"
23:05,720;23:07,520;"from those meetings is that you recognize"
23:07,520;23:10,440;"that if this is the route combination,"
23:10,440;23:14,720;"there's a chance to be able to see what Tyler says about that."""
23:14,720;23:16,000;"- Like, what do you think he is like,"
23:16,000;23:18,000;"I bet they're feeling it a little bit"
23:18,000;23:19,320;"and they're gonna try and take a deeper shot"
23:19,320;23:21,200;"than the safer underneath stuff."
23:21,200;23:22,520;"- That's what I'm wondering, yeah."
23:22,520;23:24,920;"- Or just like reading a quarterback's eyes."
23:24,920;23:25,840;"- Yeah."
23:25,840;23:27,360;"- And like body language."
23:27,360;23:30,320;"You know, I feel like he was like an instinct player,"
23:30,320;23:33,000;"but then you'd think he'd get beaten more often"
23:33,000;23:33,920;"trying to do stupid shit."
23:33,920;23:36,320;"- That's what I'm thinking, yeah."
23:36,320;23:39,640;"- I'd love to hear him talk like X is a nose to see what,"
23:39,640;23:42,840;"how much of it is like game prep shit"
23:42,840;23:44,600;"versus how much he's just like,"
23:44,600;23:46,040;"he's going with the flow of the game"
23:46,040;23:48,320;"and just reacting to what he sees."
23:48,320;23:49,960;"- All right, hang on, I'm writing it down right now."
23:49,960;23:52,480;"I'm going to go see if we can get Tyler on the podcast just for you."
23:52,480;23:53,000;"Okay."
23:53,000;23:56,600;"Dude, Tyler also rules just as a person."
23:56,600;23:57,680;"He's the best."
23:57,680;23:58,420;"I'm not going to lie."
23:58,420;24:00,220;"I tried to find some of his vodka."
24:00,220;24:05,220;"I tried really hard to get to miss vodka for this, but I, you can't get it anywhere."
24:05,220;24:09,480;"Dude, I'm recording from a trampoline right now in honor of Tyler."
24:09,480;24:12,160;"It's trampoline parks that he sold."
24:12,160;24:14,380;"It is no longer a part of, but yes."
24:14,380;24:16,520;"I got notes on Tyler though."
24:16,520;24:17,800;"We'll save that for the end."
24:17,800;24:18,560;"Oh, yeah."
24:18,560;24:19,440;"I think we should."
24:19,440;24:21,560;"about his life, personal life."
24:21,560;24:23,040;"I think he's going to come up with a bit more."
24:23,040;24:24,840;"Just his career in general."
24:24,840;24:25,280;"We've got."
24:25,280;24:25,640;"All right."
24:25,640;24:30,440;"So the pages don't do much with that."
24:30,440;24:32,280;"Take another field goal."
24:32,280;24:33,520;"Yeah, get it down to the seven."
24:33,520;24:35,160;"Kick a field goal classic."
24:35,160;24:36,320;"Just let me did last drive."
24:36,320;24:41,120;"And I think that on some of these field goals,"
24:41,120;24:45,320;"the last couple, I think it was, they actually"
24:45,320;24:48,720;"had some good play calls, but Christian Fourier dropped."
24:48,720;24:57,720;"two touchdowns. Yeah, you did. Both hit him like in both hands catches that he's made another games. So I don't some like good play calls to."
24:57,720;25:06,720;"But I think if he had caught either one of those, this game looks very different. This game isn't nearly as close as it was at the end."
25:06,720;25:09,800;"Patriots kind of walk away and laugh are almost."
25:09,800;25:12,560;"Yeah, normally you're adding, but eight points"
25:12,560;25:14,480;"so they're lead at halftime."
25:14,480;25:15,960;"Right, yeah, exactly."
25:15,960;25:18,800;"And so, yeah, so you're more than two touchdowns."
25:18,800;25:24,460;"And yeah, I think things might look a little different."
25:24,460;25:29,460;"How did they get to that big 15-nothing halftime lead?"
25:29,460;25:31,360;"Well, yeah, 'cause right now it's 13-nothing,"
25:31,360;25:36,240;"which means if my math is correct, we're two points away."
25:36,240;25:41,680;"safety in this game. I don't remember safety. Steve, do you remember what this is?"
25:41,680;25:45,680;"I mean, obviously the tie-law picks, everyone, those are the high-down team I was seeing,"
25:45,680;25:50,320;"but I remember this very clearly. And it like embodied the buildup and all that, like Greg"
25:50,320;25:54,160;"was talking about earlier. They showed that stat of how they haven't unpunted and like"
25:54,160;25:56,880;"nobody else ever knows, hasn't ever punted in the playoffs."
25:56,880;26:02,000;"And apparently like all the Indianapolis media was giving the punter a whole bunch of shit"
26:02,000;26:04,200;"about how he's like not earning his paycheck."
26:04,200;26:06,600;"- And the commentators are talking about like,"
26:06,600;26:09,080;"""Oh, it's a lot of money for just holding,"
26:09,080;26:12,240;"just being a holder, I paid so much."""
26:12,240;26:14,760;"- Also, I just want to point out"
26:14,760;26:18,960;"that the fact that the name,"
26:18,960;26:20,600;"the punter's name is Hunter Smith"
26:20,600;26:22,680;"and nobody called him Hunter the Punter."
26:22,680;26:24,640;"- I was just thinking that in my head."
26:24,640;26:26,280;"- Such a myth."
26:26,280;26:29,200;"I mean, for like a Phil Sims type of guy too,"
26:29,200;26:31,280;"who's like, we talked about last week"
26:31,280;26:36,280;"about how fucking work appropriate joke shit he does."
26:36,280;26:38,600;"Like you're gonna miss the Hunter the Punter joke?"
26:38,600;26:39,440;"- Yeah."
26:39,440;26:40,960;"And like they're saying his whole name every time"
26:40,960;26:41,880;"like it's Troy Brown."
26:41,880;26:43,880;"- Yeah, Hunter Smith."
26:43,880;26:45,600;"As if there's another Hunter on the team."
26:45,600;26:47,160;"- Yeah."
26:47,160;26:49,480;"- It's very millennial name too, Hunter."
26:49,480;26:50,400;"- Yeah. - Oh yeah."
26:50,400;26:51,840;"- Yeah."
26:51,840;26:53,560;"- He wears skinny jeans."
26:53,560;26:55,320;"- Oh, for sure."
26:55,320;26:56,360;"Yeah."
26:56,360;26:57,960;"- He loves dancing on TikTok."
26:57,960;27:00,280;"- If our last name was green instead of brown,"
27:00,280;27:02,280;"I'd name my first born hunter."
27:02,280;27:04,280;"Hunter green."
27:04,280;27:05,280;"I like that."
27:05,280;27:07,280;"Because that's all you can wear, though."
27:07,280;27:09,280;"You can name him not."
27:09,280;27:11,280;"Not brown."
27:11,280;27:12,280;"Yeah."
27:12,280;27:13,280;"Hazel."
27:13,280;27:15,280;"I don't know."
27:15,280;27:16,280;"No, it doesn't work."
27:16,280;27:17,280;"Dark light."
27:17,280;27:18,280;"A pachino."
27:18,280;27:19,280;"Yeah, light dark."
27:19,280;27:20,280;"I don't know."
27:20,280;27:21,280;"Your coffee nerd."
27:21,280;27:23,280;"You know, you'll think of something."
27:23,280;27:24,280;"I'll come up with something."
27:24,280;27:25,280;"Mocha."
27:25,280;27:30,880;"feces hot brown hot brown"
27:30,880;27:33,640;"first name hot middle name hot last name brown"
27:33,640;27:35,640;"you can have hot garbage"
27:35,640;27:38,840;"nap on this to the hunter the punter was hot garbage"
27:38,840;27:43,560;"oh and also speaking of of perfect names for that"
27:43,560;27:48,640;"that that punt in general the long snapper's name Justin Snow"
27:48,640;27:53,600;"just Justin Snow does he snap the ball"
27:53,600;27:55,600;"two feet over the punter's head"
27:55,600;28:00,160;"Hunter the punter was not ready for it"
28:00,160;28:07,920;"Look at you see for surprise goes over his head the best part was hunter the punter is wearing two receiving gloves still can't catch the ball"
28:07,920;28:12,840;"You barely get the hand on it. Yeah, he gets like a half a finger on it. Yeah"
28:12,840;28:20,760;"He's run after it. Yeah, so he's running after it and I think his his kick on that"
28:20,760;28:23,960;"the base. What he does is he takes it from like great play from the"
28:23,960;28:28,160;"turn line. Just like just belts it out the back of the end zone."
28:28,160;28:31,240;"Just kicks very heads up play. It was hilarious. Like it's kind of"
28:31,240;28:33,960;"it's probably really hard to kick a bouncing football on like a"
28:33,960;28:37,880;"frozen grass that's all in the snow. Yeah. Yeah. It's the first"
28:37,880;28:42,320;"time top corner. Right Greg? Dude, I'd say he's the best player"
28:42,320;28:45,920;"in the Colts in the first half. Yeah, you might be right. He saved"
28:45,920;28:49,440;"them five points. Yeah. Yeah. And they got a penalty out of it"
28:49,440;28:52,880;"see which I thought was hilarious that they gave him the pants. Did you see they like zoomed"
28:52,880;28:58,480;"in on Hunter 2 when he was just like, yeah, yeah. I did what I did the best I could in this"
28:58,480;29:03,360;"situation. I don't want to understand that guy rules. Yeah, doesn't pond for two games, comes in"
29:03,360;29:08,800;"good snap over his head and then just boots it off the back. You know, electric playoffs. Yeah,"
29:08,800;29:14,880;"I was amazing. That was like his only appearance. Yeah. Yeah. Did another good punt later, I think."
29:14,880;29:19,280;"Yeah, I think he punted once more. But so you had like two snaps the entire play"
29:19,280;29:23,940;"offs. One over is that 15 rows deep."
29:23,940;29:27,180;"Now money kicks off 50 and one he kicks 50 yards."
29:27,180;29:30,580;"Yeah. Yeah. I'd be like, yeah, fucking suck it. Make"
29:30,580;29:34,740;"up my money now. Are you? It seems you five points in a playoff"
29:34,740;29:37,620;"game. You know, who maybe you should have been bitching out? Yeah,"
29:37,620;29:42,060;"fucking Justin Snow Justin over there. Yeah, you never to like"
29:42,060;29:44,460;"Stocks in snow. Oh, shit."
29:44,460;29:50,460;"I just that whole, this is, they're still fucking good in every one."
29:50,460;29:52,060;"And then like, okay, then I have to pun."
29:52,060;29:53,420;"Now you know why?"
29:53,420;29:54,540;"That's not gonna last forever."
29:54,540;29:56,380;"And like special things break down."
29:56,380;29:57,980;"Even though it's not the game, right, Greg?"
29:57,980;30:00,060;"That's right."
30:00,060;30:01,100;"Third of the game, that's right."
30:01,100;30:07,660;"And so, I mean, I feel like this is kind of similar again to the first Colts game,"
30:07,660;30:10,620;"the Pats played in Indianapolis where"
30:10,620;30:18,380;"there. Watching this, it felt like there was a lot of opportunity for the Patriots to like"
30:18,380;30:22,780;"just step on the throat of the Colts and just like put this game away. Because you know,"
30:22,780;30:27,300;"you just you just got to safety on what we should have been upon. So you get two points"
30:27,300;30:31,380;"and they're kicking the ball right back to you. And I think the kickoff return was actually"
30:31,380;30:37,100;"pretty good. So you got the ball like almost midfieldish, I think. Yeah, your own 40 something"
30:37,100;30:43,300;"like that. And three plays in. Bevel Johnson fumbles the ball."
30:43,300;30:47,340;"Culture cover like well fuck like that. We could have just like put the"
30:47,340;30:50,140;"game away right there. Get any sort of points out of that. And now"
30:50,140;30:56,540;"it's three touchdowns a hour and a half. But instead you've given any"
30:56,540;31:00,260;"and apples a ball back with two minutes around midfields. And this is a"
31:00,260;31:05,820;"team that we've seen can score quickly. Like real quick. And"
31:06,580;31:10,260;"They move it. Yeah. And so they, they, they drive inside New England 20."
31:10,260;31:15,060;"And of course they score a touchdown in going to the, oh, wait, no,"
31:15,060;31:21,700;"Rodney pops his head up again."
31:21,700;31:25,540;"He had a ball, but monster game. Yeah."
31:25,540;31:31,540;"And I think this is a game. This is, this is a Harrison on Harrison crime. Marvin Harrison"
31:31,540;31:33,640;"and catch the ball over the middle."
31:33,640;31:36,320;"And Rodney de-cleats him."
31:36,320;31:41,160;"Like I think if Marvin Harrison had any fillings,"
31:41,160;31:43,180;"they were loosened by this hit."
31:43,180;31:45,300;"- No, it wasn't like, I don't know."
31:45,300;31:46,680;"Like that he got him like kind of low,"
31:46,680;31:48,040;"but he got him right on the ball."
31:48,040;31:50,100;"Like Harrison was like bracing for the hit."
31:50,100;31:52,060;"Rodney went even lower when he got into the ball"
31:52,060;31:53,920;"and just kind of wasn't like a..."
31:53,920;31:56,480;"- Stop him squaring. - Hit him square."
31:56,480;31:59,620;"- We're glancing, but his hit was square on the ball."
31:59,620;32:00,940;"- Hit him square."
32:00,940;32:05,940;"Paul pops out a boy Tyrone pool who they mentioned."
32:05,940;32:09,680;"You used to play for the Colts, which I did not remember."
32:09,680;32:12,580;"- Yeah. - The Rangers."
32:12,580;32:14,180;"- I remember him playing for the Panthers for a while."
32:14,180;32:16,620;"I didn't know he played for the Colts."
32:16,620;32:20,140;"So found himself on the right side of the coin on this game,"
32:20,140;32:22,620;"including that fumble recovery."
32:22,620;32:25,860;"So the Patriots kind of escape a bit of like a,"
32:25,860;32:28,620;"what could have been some, like a swing in points,"
32:28,620;32:29,660;"a swing of momentum."
32:29,660;32:37,100;"And they realize that and decide to run the clock three runs and kneel to an half"
32:37,100;32:40,180;"Or two runs in a deal"
32:40,180;32:42,220;"So halftime is 15 nothing"
32:42,220;32:48,700;"And this is where I'm thinking like this defense is is fucking killing it with the turnovers"
32:48,700;32:55,660;"And if the offense can just do like one more thing like we have this game in hand and things feel pretty good"
32:56,300;33:02,460;"And pay money you want to come up with life their drive chart after those drive charts from yeah"
33:02,460;33:04,940;"Yeah, we're gonna play us because it was what was yeah"
33:04,940;33:10,420;"It was the first half touch first half drives in the other games were touched on touch on touch down touch down and of half right"
33:10,420;33:13,980;"Right basically and in this game. What was it?"
33:13,980;33:18,220;"interception interception fumble safety fumble"
33:18,220;33:26,140;"God damn so they haven't had a drive that didn't end in a turnover or points for the other team"
33:26,140;33:28,540;"still haven't punted yet though."
33:28,540;33:31,340;"They have not punted yet."
33:31,340;33:34,940;"These best things still alive, maybe maybe not real games."
33:34,940;33:38,340;"You can have three the rest of the NFL can have three."
33:38,340;33:41,540;"So they literally punt once in this game."
33:41,540;33:44,340;"Right. So like what you're saying, I mean, it's like you're,"
33:44,340;33:49,340;"you dominate this first half, dominate, but."
33:49,340;33:54,140;"They were a couple of plays away from it to be in a one score game going at the halftime,"
33:54,140;34:01,500;"which is scary in itself, especially how the game earlier in the season went when you blew a 21.0"
34:01,500;34:07,340;"and leading six minutes. And their cults are no for this too. They were down two touchdowns"
34:07,340;34:12,460;"too. It was the Bucks earlier in the season on Monday night. Three, three touchdowns less than"
34:12,460;34:17,340;"five minutes. They actually mentioned it. Yeah. Three touchdowns with about five minutes left."
34:17,340;34:23,900;"And they won that game. So being up 15, nothing at halftime, it's nice, but it doesn't quite"
34:23,900;34:33,100;"feel like enough, especially when, uh, in the starts, the second half with, first of all,"
34:33,100;34:38,780;"a kick return to midfield on the opening kickoff, then they converted fourth on one."
34:38,780;34:45,260;"And then this drive was like almost all runs as well. There was no real pain manning in this."
34:45,260;34:50,060;"And Egrin, there's just like, Egrin James down there throat and he ends up running it in from"
34:50,060;34:54,680;"like the three. So now it's 15, 70 and thinking, Oh, God, damn it."
34:54,680;35:00,880;"Um, which is a year ago. You were a couple of plays away from being a one point"
35:00,880;35:06,440;"game. If they got a touch of that half, right. Or if it doesn't like strip that"
35:06,440;35:09,240;"guy of the ball on the interception, they don't get those three points, then"
35:09,240;35:10,520;"you could be down to right now."
35:10,520;35:15,200;"Yeah. So this game is still very much in the balance. Um,"
35:16,560;35:19,680;"And then Patriots again, settle for another field goal."
35:19,680;35:23,760;"Even though they get into the 15 from the nine, our line,"
35:23,760;35:24,360;"kick a field goal."
35:24,360;35:25,280;"Yeah."
35:25,280;35:26,820;"Actually, you know, we're on the fourth."
35:26,820;35:28,920;"The good delay of game and then kicked it from the nine."
35:28,920;35:29,400;"Right."
35:29,400;35:30,040;"Exactly."
35:30,040;35:33,480;"Uh, but then Indianapolis, they're only three and out."
35:33,480;35:35,040;"They're only punts of the game."
35:35,040;35:38,840;"So you're kind of like, okay, we're, we're maybe like that first drive."
35:38,840;35:39,600;"Maybe it's a fluke."
35:39,600;35:40,120;"That's great."
35:40,120;35:43,920;"Maybe this defense is, is ready to, to hold again."
35:44,520;35:47,520;"Um, and then New England just starts running the ball."
35:47,520;35:49,320;"Like Antoine Smith in this game."
35:49,320;35:51,920;"I think we said it."
35:51,920;35:55,800;"It's the last game or maybe it was like the last game of the season against the."
35:55,800;36:00,840;"The the bills where they ran it all down the throat and he looked like he was"
36:00,840;36:02,360;"running like it was 2001 again."
36:02,360;36:03,720;"Same in this game."
36:03,720;36:05,760;"I don't think it's like saving his legs or something."
36:05,760;36:07,840;"No, it's the shit feels."
36:07,840;36:10,560;"It must be, but it doesn't have a lot of moves."
36:10,560;36:11,080;"Why?"
36:11,080;36:14,160;"But this, yeah, this offensive line played amazing too."
36:14,160;36:16,640;"I could I could have ran for 75"
36:16,640;36:17,840;"of God since he came for sure."
36:17,840;36:20,240;"Yeah. And that's that's that's"
36:20,240;36:21,840;"what being tackled by the first guy to touch you."
36:21,840;36:24,720;"Yeah. Like the the offensive line."
36:24,720;36:25,920;"They were even mentioned it somewhere."
36:25,920;36:27,680;"It might have actually been right around here"
36:27,680;36:30,160;"on some of these big Antoine Smith runs"
36:30,160;36:32,440;"where the commentators are talking about how"
36:32,440;36:34,760;"the Patriots offensive lineman were high"
36:34,760;36:36,160;"fighting after the play"
36:36,160;36:38,800;"because they had blocked it so well."
36:38,800;36:41,800;"Yeah, Phil, that was good common commentary."
36:42,000;36:45,360;"It was like, it's never good when the offensive lines high five."
36:45,360;36:46,680;"Exactly."
36:46,680;36:48,320;"Yeah, it was funny."
36:48,320;36:49,240;"It wasn't it, Andy?"
36:49,240;36:50,040;"Did you like it?"
36:50,040;36:51,120;"Did it make you giggle?"
36:51,120;36:53,040;"No, fucking hated it."
36:53,040;36:53,760;"Yeah."
36:53,760;36:54,720;"Thanks, Ben."
36:54,720;36:58,080;"Um, we went to runs."
36:58,080;37:01,840;"We went from our 30 yard line to their 30 just back to back Anton."
37:01,840;37:03,400;"Yeah."
37:03,400;37:05,280;"And it was gaping to your drill."
37:05,280;37:06,720;"Yeah."
37:06,720;37:08,880;"Tractor trailer through those things."
37:08,880;37:11,160;"So then they kick another field goal, right?"
37:11,640;37:15,640;"from the three from the three yard line kick field from the three yard line."
37:15,640;37:20,200;"Yeah. As you do. Just like any of these turn into touchdowns."
37:20,200;37:24,840;"This game is an absolute blowout. That's exactly what I'm talking about."
37:24,840;37:28,040;"But yeah. Oh, Antoine Smith, 22 carries 100 yards even."
37:28,040;37:33,000;"Nice day on the ground. I'll stat checking myself."
37:33,000;37:40,920;"Yeah. So so the Patriots, you know, have answered that touchdown with"
37:40,920;37:43,640;"two long drives, but six points."
37:43,640;37:46,440;"So now we're up 21 seven."
37:46,440;37:49,320;"And Cole's got the ball back again."
37:49,320;37:51,840;"And Greg, you want to walk us through this drive?"
37:51,840;37:53,760;"Oh, yeah."
37:53,760;37:55,560;"And then you're in place."
37:55,560;37:58,600;"He hasn't thrown his required interception"
37:58,600;38:00,680;"for every quarter of this game yet."
38:00,680;38:03,280;"True."
38:03,280;38:07,680;"Well, and Peyton gets a little happy feet."
38:07,680;38:09,840;"You could tell he starts like forcing it."
38:10,040;38:10,880;"Oh, yeah."
38:10,880;38:11,800;"Times of this game."
38:11,800;38:17,080;"Because a lot of these pigs came when you could tell it was just like a frustration."
38:17,080;38:17,760;"Yeah."
38:17,760;38:19,000;"And he's on the move."
38:19,000;38:21,680;"He's like, this one especially is getting flushed out of the pocket."
38:21,680;38:23,040;"He's like rolling out to the side."
38:23,040;38:24,600;"So it gets sacked to play before."
38:24,600;38:25,800;"It's a second and 17."
38:25,800;38:26,800;"He's got nothing."
38:26,800;38:29,800;"There's your down 24, 21, seven."
38:29,800;38:31,280;"End of the third quarter."
38:31,280;38:33,880;"And he's just like, we."
38:35,320;38:39,040;"tries to flick when out in the flat when there's a guy directly in his face,"
38:39,040;38:43,160;"overthrows him and then tie law again, just like following the play."
38:43,160;38:44,600;"Not the guy he was covering."
38:44,600;38:50,360;"Fucking scoops in behind and just snags it as he rolls out of bounds."
38:50,360;38:51,560;"Second pick of the game."
38:51,560;38:55,040;"I think Pete was more surprised about this interception than the first one."
38:55,040;38:57,400;"He thought he had thrown it away safely."
38:57,400;38:59,680;"Even if the guy's not going to catch you, he thought he threw it out of bounds."
38:59,680;39:01,920;"And there's time law diving and picking off."
39:01,920;39:04,520;"Good luck leaning out on somebody, Peyton."
39:04,520;39:08,000;"like, Oh my. Yeah, that one could not have been more paid manning's fault."
39:08,000;39:10,800;"48 minute manning face if you're at if you're"
39:10,800;39:21,920;"so yes, that's a basketball 26 yard line up 21 7 and the third quarter."
39:21,920;39:26,480;"Yep. Game's over. Right. Yeah. And New England, like"
39:26,480;39:31,560;"has a go territory as that third half ends and the first fourth quarter begins."
39:33,040;39:36,040;"Like New England's drive and they're inside the Indianapolis five."
39:36,040;39:38,260;"And this is where four a drops."
39:38,260;39:40,820;"He had another one of his, what should have been a touchdown."
39:40,820;39:43,600;"No, he hits him in the hands and just goes straight through him."
39:43,600;39:51,100;"Like it wasn't an easy catch, but it's an easy catch for an NFL player."
39:51,100;39:54,580;"It's something he's caught before drops it."
39:54,580;40:00,220;"And then the drive ends with Brady throwing an interception in the end zone,"
40:01,260;40:05,180;"which is his first interception at home."
40:05,180;40:06,980;"Ball season."
40:06,980;40:10,420;"It's a horrendous time to throw it to."
40:10,420;40:11,420;"In fact, yes."
40:11,420;40:14,740;"Not having a pick a couple of times in this game, but this one wasn't as"
40:14,740;40:15,580;"false."
40:15,580;40:17,340;"Deacher board running the slam."
40:17,340;40:19,100;"I wasn't his fault, dude."
40:19,100;40:20,100;"Fuck that."
40:20,100;40:21,420;"Why did he throw the ball?"
40:21,420;40:22,500;"It's 217."
40:22,500;40:23,540;"You're on the five yard line."
40:23,540;40:24,300;"It's 30."
40:24,300;40:29,140;"A field goal buries this game and he tries to stick one into coverage to"
40:29,140;40:32,420;"a deep board? What are you doing?"
40:32,420;40:35,700;"With that guy inside? I don't give a shit. You don't"
40:35,700;40:39,020;"forget ball. There's someone within five yards of Steve."
40:39,020;40:42,620;"It was not a great throw, but it was also very, very badly run"
40:42,620;40:46,420;"route. So this is his first word. And I guess not like"
40:46,420;40:50,460;"blame him. Like why? He's a neat player. Okay, he's neat. He"
40:50,460;40:53,140;"was a neat pickup. So you shut your goddamn off."
40:53,140;40:57,820;"If you if you ever writes, if you ever writes an autobiography"
40:57,820;40:59,180;"on the back of it will be great."
40:59,180;41:02,380;"The neat player, Greg Brown,"
41:02,380;41:04,380;"just a quote on the back of it."
41:04,380;41:06,780;"It wasn't me, it was Tom, yeah."
41:06,780;41:07,620;"(laughs)"
41:07,620;41:10,820;"Greg Brown via Phil Stems via Tom Brady."
41:10,820;41:13,180;"(laughs)"
41:13,180;41:14,700;"We'll just have you all quoted each other."
41:14,700;41:17,180;"What a neat pickup that guy has been for us."
41:17,180;41:18,020;"He's neat."
41:18,020;41:19,740;"(laughs)"
41:19,740;41:21,300;"So, not that neat."
41:21,300;41:22,660;"Not neat anymore."
41:22,660;41:27,500;"But this is Tom Brady's first interception at home"
41:27,500;41:29,940;"since 2002 versus Miami."
41:29,940;41:31,300;"That's a long fucking time."
41:31,300;41:34,660;"That's like the December before, long as time ago."
41:34,660;41:39,060;"It was his first interception home"
41:39,060;41:41,660;"in the last 330 passes"
41:41,660;41:43,340;"and his first interception in the playoffs"
41:43,340;41:45,420;"in the last 165 passes."
41:45,420;41:48,260;"- You knew he was gonna throw one though"
41:48,260;41:50,300;"when they put up a stat earlier in the game"
41:50,300;41:52,020;"and said, ""Oh, he's hit 300 passes"
41:52,020;41:53,820;"""without throwing a 90 at home."""
41:53,820;41:56,820;"- Yeah, it's like saying they didn't punt the whole game."
41:56,820;41:57,820;"Yeah."
41:57,820;41:59,420;"They have a punter for two games."
41:59,420;42:01,220;"Yep."
42:01,220;42:03,540;"Or Adam and Terry has it missed all season."
42:03,540;42:04,340;"Yeah."
42:04,340;42:09,380;"Or Peyton Manning's QB rating is one fifty eight point three."
42:09,380;42:10,380;"Yeah."
42:10,380;42:13,820;"Yeah."
42:13,820;42:19,740;"So again, had a chance to step on the on the Colts next and just didn't."
42:19,740;42:20,820;"Big."
42:20,820;42:22,660;"They're really bad turnover."
42:22,660;42:23,420;"Yeah."
42:23,420;42:26,620;"And then on the next place, the Colts get the ball to 20."
42:26,620;42:32,420;"The next play, the referee's missed the delay a game by like two or three seconds."
42:32,420;42:35,020;"I don't know you're going to bitch about that."
42:35,020;42:40,620;"I watched that and I was going to be like, well, let me let me predict your next statement."
42:40,620;42:44,820;"You're going to bitch and fill sins for being like, Oh, yeah, if there's a one second difference,"
42:44,820;42:46,820;"the refs aren't going to call it, right?"
42:46,820;42:49,420;"No, you fucking prove it."
42:49,420;42:51,420;"You have that written down in your nuts."
42:51,420;42:54,820;"Yeah, we have like it's going to be commentator, the anti-commentator section."
42:54,820;42:58,900;"Yeah. I will show you the commentator section."
42:58,900;43:05,740;"The only thing that makes Andy more mad that a missed call is when the commentator agrees"
43:05,740;43:08,540;"with the missed call."
43:08,540;43:10,220;"Shit on the shit."
43:10,220;43:11,740;"Combinator section."
43:11,740;43:12,740;"Empty."
43:12,740;43:13,740;"Oh, com empty."
43:13,740;43:14,740;"Empty."
43:14,740;43:15,740;"I have something for the company."
43:15,740;43:16,740;"You just deleted that."
43:16,740;43:17,740;"I don't believe that."
43:17,740;43:18,740;"No."
43:18,740;43:19,740;"Control Z."
43:19,740;43:20,740;"What?"
43:20,740;43:21,740;"Oh, yeah."
43:21,740;43:22,740;"I fixed the typo."
43:22,740;43:25,100;"That was the last thing I've touched."
43:25,100;43:28,740;"I have something for the commentator section while we're on it."
43:28,740;43:31,100;"Well, hang on."
43:31,100;43:37,540;"Just to go back to Greg's point, what I was going to say is everybody bitching about how"
43:37,540;43:40,740;"the Patriots and Tom Brady always got all the calls."
43:40,740;43:41,740;"You did."
43:41,740;43:42,740;"Come on Andy."
43:42,740;43:45,860;"Is it the layer game on their own 20?"
43:45,860;43:47,820;"That's no relevance to this."
43:47,820;43:52,260;"But no, instead they get a like 11 yard game off of it first down."
43:52,260;43:56,220;"the ball already. Yeah, fucked. The other the other two drives"
43:56,220;43:59,660;"that they started without it, they didn't score. So how did"
43:59,660;44:04,300;"this drive end up? They didn't score. How did karma? That's"
44:04,300;44:09,980;"why Steve. Oh, karma for cheating. You've never catch the"
44:09,980;44:14,460;"Patriots cheating. So Peyton Manning, the cheater that he is"
44:14,460;44:17,860;"will pay the price for this. Well, back in up a step. Did you see"
44:17,860;44:23,660;"Yeah, Tyler and Harrison getting a little feisty on the sidelines when Brady threw that pick."
44:23,660;44:24,660;"No."
44:24,660;44:25,660;"Yeah."
44:25,660;44:27,180;"They showed it to even before."
44:27,180;44:30,020;"I think it's actually the drop by 40."
44:30,020;44:33,620;"Those two are on the sidelines like Huffin and Puffin being like, yeah, okay."
44:33,620;44:34,620;"Yes."
44:34,620;44:35,620;"That's what it was."
44:35,620;44:36,620;"Yeah."
44:36,620;44:38,260;"I thought that was like pretty interesting."
44:38,260;44:39,260;"Yeah."
44:39,260;44:40,500;"It was almost like the defense."
44:40,500;44:45,700;"It's like it felt like they realized that this game was on them to win."
44:45,700;44:46,700;"Yeah."
44:46,700;44:53,420;"After that after that like end of that series the end of that drive and they made they had already made enough"
44:53,420;44:58,660;"Plays to win the game at all just on the first half alone. Yeah, right like any points there"
44:58,660;45:01,980;"Mm-hmm here, and it's over. Yeah, sir"
45:01,980;45:05,440;"See in star cruising. Yeah, we just gave a rescore game"
45:05,440;45:09,620;"Give you the ball the 31 yard line and then you turn that into zero points"
45:09,620;45:13,140;"Like a net 11 yards like what the fuck exactly?"
45:13,820;45:15,820;"What are you gonna say about the commentator Steve?"
45:15,820;45:17,820;"Well, I'll save that for my best."
45:17,820;45:18,820;"Okay."
45:18,820;45:20,820;"All right, let's drive."
45:20,820;45:25,820;"Might be my favorite defensive drive in in Patriots history."
45:25,820;45:26,820;"Yeah."
45:26,820;45:31,820;"So you've been teasing a Eugene Wilson game."
45:31,820;45:34,820;"I told you guys."
45:34,820;45:35,820;"This is your Eugene Wilson."
45:35,820;45:40,820;"This is the one I told you ages ago."
45:40,820;45:44,940;"So the best part is I didn't know it was coming."
45:44,940;45:46,040;"Wait, wait, wait."
45:46,040;45:53,280;"So you're telling me that the reason you bought a Eugene Wilson Jersey is from the,"
45:53,280;45:55,760;"which was the time I was the time I was driving."
45:55,760;45:56,280;"Yes."
45:56,280;45:59,520;"Well, I already had the 04 dialogue."
45:59,520;46:00,680;"Pro Bowl Jersey."
46:00,680;46:03,480;"So I, which you are currently wearing for our listeners."
46:03,480;46:04,080;"You can't see you."
46:04,080;46:04,480;"Yes."
46:04,480;46:04,780;"Yeah."
46:04,780;46:08,360;"That Jersey is pretty dead."
46:08,360;46:15,320;"But the interest I I I I I've been looking for these these plays for"
46:15,320;46:18,880;"multiple years, maybe a decade."
46:18,880;46:24,840;"And they don't exist on YouTube except for embedded in this two hour."
46:24,840;46:30,640;"They will just find there's no Eugene Wilson highlight package because it's"
46:30,640;46:34,280;"no one even knows who you will send is we will we will make that package."
46:34,280;46:38,320;"We're going to be distinctly remember like two huge hits."
46:38,320;46:43,160;"It's in the snow against Indy, but I convinced myself by this point, I was like, that must"
46:43,160;46:46,120;"have been next year's A of C conference game."
46:46,120;46:47,720;"Yeah, no, no."
46:47,720;46:50,320;"Yeah, I confuse those two because I thought there was a Teddy Bruce."
46:50,320;46:53,200;"He played in this game and it wasn't."
46:53,200;46:54,360;"It's in the next one."
46:54,360;46:55,360;"Right."
46:55,360;47:01,560;"So Brandon Stokely coming over the middle and I audibly gassed."
47:01,560;47:02,560;"I did too."
47:02,560;47:04,400;"It was like he catches."
47:04,400;47:07,320;"He's the most defenseless receiver you've ever seen."
47:07,320;47:11,880;"almost like a shirt as he turns his head. You know, Brad Stuckley too. He looks like a fucking"
47:11,880;47:16,920;"last milker. He looks like a public account. He looks like a podcaster is what he looks like."
47:16,920;47:24,120;"And he just gets absolutely demolished. This is like a jattier teeth."
47:24,120;47:31,560;"Yeah, this is this is one of but it was like shoulder directly to the the middle of your chest."
47:31,560;47:36,920;"Yeah. Yeah, no flag. No, this is perfect. Especially back then. I mean, I think"
47:36,920;47:39,920;"Now it would have been a flag just from the defensive receiver perspective"
47:39,920;47:43,360;"Immediate flag in today's NFL. Yeah"
47:43,360;47:48,960;"That one went ahead snaps like that because he got that that whiplash head effect"
47:48,960;47:52,920;"Right where you hit him the shoulder directly in the chest, but still clean his head goes"
47:52,920;47:59,200;"Dry it was all paint. He was the one who threw that ball. He let him right into the safety. Yeah"
47:59,200;48:05,840;"Which even kind of doing yeah, he's all day. Yeah, then he's forcing he's down. He's like mustard"
48:05,840;48:06,840;"He's confused."
48:06,840;48:07,840;"Yeah, he's confused."
48:07,840;48:14,200;"He's making late reads and he's fucking forcing balls and almost took his head off."
48:14,200;48:15,560;"So he's separate?"
48:15,560;48:18,000;"No less than two plays later."
48:18,000;48:19,800;"What happens?"
48:19,800;48:24,440;"He's got Marvin Harrison going down the sidelines and he does one of those like try and drop"
48:24,440;48:26,160;"it in the bucket throws."
48:26,160;48:28,960;"Or it was Reggie Wayne."
48:28,960;48:33,040;"And Reggie Wayne does that little like, I'm going to catch it, seize out of the corner"
48:33,040;48:34,800;"of his eye what was going on."
48:34,800;48:41,500;"T-Rex art is it yeah, and then Eugene Wilson just comes in and absolutely topples him"
48:41,500;48:48,980;"Buckles of it that one might have been harder than the first one and it was like and it was midair"
48:48,980;48:53,460;"Massive hits within three plays and it was just like holy shit"
48:53,460;48:59,220;"So for like if we have like new listeners who haven't seen this game like maybe they became page experience afterwards or something"
48:59,220;49:01,680;"just think of any"
49:02,060;49:07,660;"Launching penalty you've seen in the NFL on defense. It was that minus the flag"
49:07,660;49:11,680;"To the point where the commentators are even like arguing about whether it should be"
49:11,680;49:14,660;"Was clean because well, he didn't use his head"
49:14,660;49:21,340;"He used his shoulder. He got him kind of like right on the collarbone area. Yeah, so the hit location was clean"
49:21,340;49:24,980;"But he was defenseless like he just yeah both of them. Yeah"
49:24,980;49:27,540;"Yeah, and actually cuz like"
49:27,540;49:31,460;"Sims was arguing like oh no that was definitely clean like he didn't he didn't use his hat"
49:31,460;49:36,740;"he uses shoulder his heads like way out of the way. And then what's his name? The other"
49:36,740;49:40,980;"guys like, yeah, but I think they were talking about that it was the receiver was defenseless"
49:40,980;49:46,940;"and he goes, Oh, I think you could only move on to the next play. And he could hit one."
49:46,940;49:51,340;"You couldn't hit him in the head though. You hit it. It was a shoulder directly in the"
49:51,340;49:57,420;"face mask. Yeah, it was that right. And he launched into it. It was just like, but I"
49:57,420;50:00,940;"I mean, to Reggie Wayne's credit, he popped right back up,"
50:00,940;50:03,100;"but Jesus, I don't think I would have."
50:03,100;50:03,940;"I would have just been like,"
50:03,940;50:06,180;"""Just dig me a grave here, I'm not moving."""
50:06,180;50:08,580;"It was."
50:08,580;50:09,940;"- Stokely comes back too."
50:09,940;50:10,940;"'Cause he was in it."
50:10,940;50:12,300;"Stokely immediately was like, ""Get me out."""
50:12,300;50:14,140;"- Yeah, Stokely needed a break."
50:14,140;50:17,260;"- Like sometimes when you see those ones now,"
50:17,260;50:19,060;"though like the helmet to helmet ones,"
50:19,060;50:21,700;"it's like not cool."
50:21,700;50:23,020;"- These were cool."
50:23,020;50:24,300;"- Yeah, I'll say it."
50:24,300;50:25,460;"- These weren't injuries."
50:25,460;50:30,380;"It might not be cool to say this, but it was cool."
50:30,380;50:34,100;"Watch this would be called targeting in in college for"
50:34,100;50:34,860;"Bali's days."
50:34,860;50:37,700;"He would have been able to make the second one because he would have been"
50:37,700;50:38,020;"a jacket."
50:38,020;50:40,860;"Well, in his offense, he's playing within the rules of the time."
50:40,860;50:41,620;"True. Oh, yeah."
50:41,620;50:42,060;"Absolutely."
50:42,060;50:43,060;"He was coached that way."
50:43,060;50:44,020;"And that's the way the game was."
50:44,020;50:46,860;"And you're playing the Marvin Harrison Reggie Wayne"
50:46,860;50:49,060;"Peyton Manning Colts, right?"
50:49,060;50:51,220;"And that's like why your game plan is be physical."
50:51,220;50:51,820;"Right."
50:51,820;50:52,180;"Yep."
50:52,180;50:54,380;"Is to make them pay for anything, which is what you"
50:54,740;50:58,140;"Did ever since like the 2001 Super Bowl where you did it with the"
50:58,140;50:58,660;"all game."
50:58,660;51:01,540;"It's very physical."
51:01,540;51:01,820;"Yeah."
51:01,820;51:04,300;"And the Colts receivers have been getting very frustrated."
51:04,300;51:07,500;"Um, they're very decapitated."
51:07,500;51:11,340;"I'm very oatmeal-brained."
51:11,340;51:14,060;"Just watch it again."
51:14,060;51:14,700;"It's awesome."
51:14,700;51:20,140;"But it's literally one of those plays that make you go, oh, yeah."
51:20,140;51:23,220;"When you're watching real time, like, oh, I didn't see him coming."
51:23,900;51:25,180;"Because he comes out of nowhere."
51:25,180;51:26,220;"I did."
51:26,220;51:27,340;"I audibly gassed."
51:27,340;51:28,660;"Yeah, I did on both of those."
51:28,660;51:30,820;"That I was like, the alarm is a Lordy."
51:30,820;51:33,940;"Goodness."
51:33,940;51:37,340;"Good grief as dad would say."
51:37,340;51:37,940;"Goodness."
51:37,940;51:43,020;"So after after Eugene's finished"
51:43,020;51:47,420;"depleting wide receivers, many get sacked on third, which pushes them out of field goal range."
51:47,420;51:51,100;"And so now it's fourth and the country mile."
51:52,460;51:55,620;"And there's no country strong boys co MVPs in this game."
51:55,620;51:59,020;"So Peyton Manning on fourth down Greg, do you want to walk us through this?"
51:59,020;52:04,260;"Yeah, I think this is this might be my favorite of the three."
52:04,260;52:04,780;"Really?"
52:04,780;52:05,540;"On her sepsion."
52:05,540;52:06,220;"I'm not going to ask you."
52:06,220;52:08,300;"I mean, it's fourth down."
52:08,300;52:12,500;"And he's kind of like trying to stick with it in there, but and it's like a."
52:12,500;52:14,820;"He's going to the corner, right?"
52:14,820;52:18,020;"It's like a inseam to out corner for Harrison."
52:18,020;52:18,420;"Yeah."
52:18,420;52:20,540;"And Tyler Law has got his back to Manning."
52:21,780;52:24,140;"And then the throws coming like right by his shoulder"
52:24,140;52:27,580;"and he like whips his head around and just like immediately reacts to the ball."
52:27,580;52:31,620;"I think it was that's like his true ball skills come into play there."
52:31,620;52:35,220;"And he just snags it, turns around, starts doing his typical"
52:35,220;52:37,820;"tie a lot thing where he runs around for like 30 seconds and get"
52:37,820;52:39,900;"falling over himself without getting touched yet."
52:39,900;52:45,420;"Did you see in on the replay where it looked like he was passing off"
52:45,420;52:48,060;"more of an he was like pointed to this to the safety?"
52:48,060;52:48,820;"Yeah, to the safety."
52:48,820;52:49,500;"Oh, yeah."
52:49,500;52:49,500;"Yeah."
52:49,500;52:51,300;"He turns his head around, sees the ball, is coming."
52:51,300;52:52,860;"I was like, well, walk that."
52:52,860;52:53,860;"Yeah."
52:53,860;52:55,100;"Yeah."
52:55,100;52:57,340;"Yeah, because he knew that the ball was coming that way,"
52:57,340;53:00,260;"but he thought it could be up and over him."
53:00,260;53:00,760;"Yeah."
53:00,760;53:03,500;"So he completes his hat, Rick, third of the night,"
53:03,500;53:06,260;"fourth for Manning overall."
53:06,260;53:10,140;"All three pretty nice interceptions."
53:10,140;53:13,700;"And the best part is Marvin Harrison"
53:13,700;53:19,300;"has three receptions, 19 yards, and a fumble in this game."
53:19,300;53:28,180;"the guy who had 94 catches for 1300 yards and 10 touchdowns in the season as three catches as many as"
53:28,180;53:30,940;"Tyler. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
53:30,940;53:32,020;"Yeah."
53:32,020;53:40,460;"We are in that too. Marvin Harrison three catches 19 yards. Tyler three catches 26 yards. There you"
53:40,460;53:48,060;"go. That's awesome. Troy Walters who will touch on in a minute three catches 30 yards. Probably"
53:48,060;53:52,000;"I should have had 31 if you won those games continue, but we'll get a lot better offensive"
53:52,000;53:53,540;"player than Marvin Harrison."
53:53,540;53:54,540;"Notably."
53:54,540;53:56,300;"Yeah, I would agree."
53:56,300;54:02,300;"Yeah, he's a more favorite painting target."
54:02,300;54:04,580;"Same catches, more yards, no funbles."
54:04,580;54:05,580;"It's pretty clear."
54:05,580;54:06,580;"Yeah, I would say so."
54:06,580;54:11,700;"So this comes right off the heels that have pretty bad interception where the cult starts"
54:11,700;54:15,940;"storming down and then you get Eugene Wilson huge hit."
54:15,940;54:17,780;"Eugene Wilson huge hit."
54:17,780;54:18,660;"Tyler pick."
54:18,660;54:19,020;"Yeah."
54:19,020;54:23,060;"And it's just like that is just as a kid who is like those are my two"
54:23,060;54:25,900;"favorite players on this team was Eugene Wilson and Tyler."
54:25,900;54:27,660;"That is heaven."
54:27,660;54:29,220;"That drive is your one dream."
54:29,220;54:30,540;"Heaven."
54:30,540;54:34,300;"Mom, mom, I need a Eugene Wilson jersey."
54:34,300;54:36,140;"Exactly."
54:36,140;54:38,820;"You got the pro bowl one, Greg."
54:38,820;54:40,460;"Well, Santa."
54:41,100;54:45,820;"Yeah, right. And I was like, what do you mean, Santa can't get me Eugene Wilson, Jersey,"
54:45,820;54:49,660;"saying his magic? Why doesn't he just fucking make one in his workshop, mom?"
54:49,660;54:50,060;"Yeah."
54:50,060;54:51,020;"Going to the college."
54:51,020;54:52,820;"It's a sense. Yeah."
54:52,820;54:55,740;"Yeah. Oh, Jesus."
54:55,740;55:01,020;"Yeah. And so, yeah, the patrons don't do much."
55:01,020;55:03,740;"Kind of on offense, the rest of this game."
55:03,740;55:06,740;"They go through and out after this."
55:06,740;55:09,660;"But at this point, they're almost like starting to try and run clock."
55:09,660;55:14,200;"So there's like running the ball, whatever they can with whoever they have left."
55:14,200;55:16,080;"Antoine Smith, Kevin Falk doesn't matter."
55:16,080;55:21,580;"And the Colts managed to put together a touchdown drive."
55:21,580;55:23,180;"They're in desperation with this point."
55:23,180;55:24,860;"They're down 21."
55:24,860;55:27,420;"So down 21 seven."
55:27,420;55:29,880;"Yeah, it's like not desperation."
55:29,880;55:30,260;"Yeah."
55:30,260;55:31,080;"Six."
55:31,080;55:33,140;"Well, no, cause yeah, there's like five minutes left and"
55:33,140;55:34,320;"Peyton's getting battered."
55:34,320;55:36,900;"Um, and they're running the hurry up."
55:36,900;55:39,400;"Like no, Huddle just like and Manning's not like"
55:39,460;55:42,820;"doing all his like movement stuff. He's like getting the line,"
55:42,820;55:45,860;"snapping the ball as quickly as he can and just like going for it."
55:45,860;55:47,900;"So they eventually managed to score a late touchdown,"
55:47,900;55:50,220;"Manning and Pollard. Um,"
55:50,220;55:53,340;"it wasn't easy and took a lot more time than I think they wanted it to."
55:53,340;55:56,700;"Cause this little Steve to Steve's point was where they started talking about how,"
55:56,700;56:00,500;"oh, remember that game when they were down three touchdowns with five minutes"
56:00,500;56:02,300;"left and they still came back and won it."
56:02,300;56:05,700;"And so they're trying to do that here and they just can't. Um,"
56:05,700;56:08,540;"it was shaky. It was touching. Yeah."
56:08,620;56:11,440;"So at this point, but now it's 21 14."
56:11,440;56:12,180;"Yes."
56:12,180;56:12,500;"Yeah."
56:12,500;56:13,900;"With two and a half minutes left."
56:13,900;56:14,380;"Yeah."
56:14,380;56:19,140;"But, uh, for a kind of redeems himself a little bit, I would say,"
56:19,140;56:22,180;"by recovering the on-size kick, caught it clean."
56:22,180;56:25,660;"And this last I was kicked."
56:25,660;56:29,100;"It felt very like typical Vanderjacked,"
56:29,100;56:31,500;"who was like, oh, I'm so much smarter than these guys."
56:31,500;56:33,020;"I'm going to, I'm a trick 'em."
56:33,020;56:37,180;"Cause so they all like huddled and you could tell the Patriots knew what was"
56:37,180;56:41,340;"because instead of doing like, you know, when you usually see an on-sized kick"
56:41,340;56:45,260;"right, like everybody spreads out within like five yards, but all the way across"
56:45,260;56:50,940;"the field, they were all huddled like inside the, uh, inside the hash marks,"
56:50,940;56:53,940;"like everybody except for too deep guys."
56:53,940;56:56,820;"Like it was Troy Brown and Kevin Faulk or someone deep."
56:56,820;57:00,460;"And everybody else was just like kind of milling around right in the middle of field."
57:00,460;57:05,140;"And what that cult decided to do was, uh,"
57:05,140;57:08,620;"If energy actors like broke out of the huddle and just kicked it right at the"
57:08,620;57:12,900;"Patriots and it kicked it right at for you who just caught it and fell to the"
57:12,900;57:15,700;"ground. Like no, bounce. No, no, just kick it right at them."
57:15,700;57:18,540;"And the Patriots recovered the on-site kick."
57:18,540;57:21,420;"Let's try to outsmart them sell. I don't know."
57:21,420;57:23,940;"Yeah, you got to try a shit like that on-site's cake."
57:23,940;57:25,740;"Yeah, that shit only works in the Browns, though."
57:25,740;57:27,940;"Yeah. Yeah."
57:27,940;57:30,460;"But like you could tell that they knew it was coming."
57:30,460;57:31,700;"So just be like, all right, you know what?"
57:31,700;57:32,500;"Fuck this."
57:32,500;57:34,060;"Let's just do the regular on-site's cake."
57:34,180;57:35,640;"Like I'm sure they practice that too."
57:35,640;57:38,620;"But I would agree."
57:38,620;57:38,880;"Yeah."
57:38,880;57:39,460;"Try that shit."
57:39,460;57:41,220;"Have you seen the guy?"
57:41,220;57:42,060;"The."
57:42,060;57:48,780;"The fat, like Spanish looking guy that is, uh, he's like all these viral videos of him."
57:48,780;57:51,420;"Doing his special on side's kick."
57:51,420;57:52,660;"No."
57:52,660;57:55,900;"And he keeps being like, yo, hire me NFL."
57:55,900;58:01,060;"He's, he's this guy that has figured out a way to like he kicks it directly at the"
58:01,060;58:02,380;"ground right in front of them."
58:02,460;58:04,220;"And it takes like a huge hop."
58:04,220;58:04,680;"Yeah."
58:04,680;58:09,180;"And enough that he can just keep running forward and like catch the ball."
58:09,180;58:10,700;"You turn yards down field."
58:10,700;58:15,840;"So he's got all these videos of him like, you'll kick it, you'll run, he'll open a"
58:15,840;58:18,620;"car door and the ball go into the car door and then he'll close it."
58:18,620;58:22,580;"And he'll be like, yo, Eagles sign me."
58:22,580;58:27,000;"All these, they're actually like they got me thinking."
58:27,000;58:27,940;"All right."
58:27,940;58:29,500;"Maybe we should sign this guy."
58:29,500;58:30,380;"Got him."
58:30,380;58:31,140;"This guy for sure."
58:31,140;58:38,140;"It's not an ad love. I love kicker kick off trick shot videos. They're the best. Yeah."
58:38,140;58:45,140;"And if you're talking about an on-sides kick, it's like the same skill every time, right?"
58:45,140;58:50,140;"If you could figure out like one that works, that's pretty valuable."
58:50,140;58:57,540;"Yeah. Although I have to imagine you could probably get somebody like a Gostowski or a"
58:57,540;59:00,780;"or a Vinateri, do you like, all right, see what this guy's"
59:00,780;59:04,380;"doing in video? How long it'll take you to learn that a week"
59:04,380;59:08,260;"makes me wonder what they haven't done. Maybe they've tried it"
59:08,260;59:11,540;"doesn't work as well as it looks. I don't know. I know he's"
59:11,540;59:12,420;"pre-sack."
59:12,420;59:15,900;"This guy's hit a half core basketball shot with an on"
59:15,900;59:17,580;"sides kick here. Damn."
59:17,580;59:20,700;"All right, I'll have some of the video. We'll put in the show"
59:20,700;59:24,220;"notes. Let's get this guy on the fuck. Get him on the pod."
59:24,980;59:28,180;"He looks like a real great interview, too."
59:28,180;59:31,400;"He does, right?"
59:31,400;59:32,500;"He looks like a good spot."
59:32,500;59:37,980;"Well, Cole stuck up, didn't hire him."
59:37,980;59:40,500;"He was like, ""You're probably going to get a little kid at this point, too."""
59:40,500;59:42,100;"Yeah, so the page gets the ball."
59:42,100;59:46,660;"And New England, again, just starting to run it down the cold throat,"
59:46,660;59:48,420;"trying to waste as much time as possible."
59:48,420;59:51,860;"Actually, they don't think."
59:51,860;59:52,940;"No, they don't remember."
59:53,700;59:58,660;"Oh, yeah. Okay. On this drive. Yeah. Because suspect a little bit suspect."
59:58,660;01:00:04,140;"And two and a half minutes left. So you got it on there. 44."
01:00:04,140;01:00:04,580;"Yeah."
01:00:04,580;01:00:08,460;"But the call took three time out. Right."
01:00:08,460;01:00:13,780;"So you run it first down, throw it second down, which gets batted down, third down."
01:00:13,780;01:00:17,260;"Great throw to Troy Brown down the seam"
01:00:17,260;01:00:22,220;"who's lined up against the linebacker, but the linebacker makes an incredible play"
01:00:22,220;01:00:23,420;"and just knocks out his hands."
01:00:23,420;01:00:25,340;"Oh, as a drop Troy did have it."
01:00:25,340;01:00:25,980;"For sure."
01:00:25,980;01:00:27,940;"Now that I think that defender made a great play."
01:00:27,940;01:00:29,580;"He did bring it up."
01:00:29,580;01:00:30,740;"Great play for the situation."
01:00:30,740;01:00:32,540;"And then the Troy Adam beat and he should have had that."
01:00:32,540;01:00:34,100;"Yeah, not a great throw."
01:00:34,100;01:00:37,060;"Not a great throw."
01:00:37,060;01:00:38,300;"Yeah, there's a lot of Brady."
01:00:38,300;01:00:41,140;"Definitely one Troy Brown."
01:00:41,140;01:00:42,940;"Yeah, if you want anybody to believe the"
01:00:42,940;01:00:47,620;"to be a bear, then that was that play was on Troy."
01:00:47,620;01:00:50,980;"Even Troy Brown himself would say that was his fault."
01:00:50,980;01:00:52,860;"No, of course he would say that about everything."
01:00:52,860;01:00:55,560;"even if it was exactly. I'm sure you would. But this one wasn't"
01:00:55,560;01:00:58,420;"down right. Troy knows that's his fault. No, that's this"
01:00:58,420;01:00:59,940;"one wasn't. I disagree."
01:00:59,940;01:01:05,100;"And you know, it's and you know what? I will I will I will not"
01:01:05,100;01:01:07,820;"take Troy Brown slander on this podcast from either of you."
01:01:07,820;01:01:11,500;"I'm not gonna play like that. I am just these are the facts."
01:01:11,500;01:01:15,460;"They're flyable. It's liable. Right. It's not liable. This is"
01:01:15,460;01:01:16,180;"slander."
01:01:16,180;01:01:21,900;"Andy, you realize that you're like, you're like the people that"
01:01:21,900;01:01:26,700;"show up at the fucking Capitol trying to break in and still in the center, right?"
01:01:26,700;01:01:27,820;"You're like, what?"
01:01:27,820;01:01:30,360;"I've doesn't matter what the truth is."
01:01:30,360;01:01:34,060;"I believe what my brain wants me to believe."
01:01:34,060;01:01:36,420;"And that's the end of the matter."
01:01:36,420;01:01:37,900;"You're absolutely wrong."
01:01:37,900;01:01:39,780;"Same thing with anti mask."
01:01:39,780;01:01:45,540;"And you were just, I was actually used to hear everything like pro mask."
01:01:45,540;01:01:46,340;"You're like, Nope."
01:01:46,340;01:01:47,540;"That's just fake."
01:01:47,540;01:01:48,040;"No."
01:01:48,040;01:01:51,060;"They're the fact that I am created in my head."
01:01:51,300;01:01:53,460;"See, now I would agree with you on this point."
01:01:53,460;01:01:57,620;"If the garbage that was being spewed wasn't coming from the two of you"
01:01:57,620;01:02:01,580;"who have if he traveled in general, like if this was coming from,"
01:02:01,580;01:02:04,780;"if Bill Bellachette came out and said, you know what, that was on Troy."
01:02:04,780;01:02:05,820;"Be like, yeah, all right, fine."
01:02:05,820;01:02:08,500;"If Troy came out and said, you know what, that was on me."
01:02:08,500;01:02:09,580;"I'm like, you're not Troy."
01:02:09,580;01:02:10,500;"I believe you."
01:02:10,500;01:02:15,260;"He brought you to a view to you, a guy received Brown star of this, this"
01:02:15,260;01:02:17,860;"podcast being like, Oh, no, these commentators are great."
01:02:17,860;01:02:18,540;"And now look at you."
01:02:18,540;01:02:18,780;"Yeah."
01:02:18,780;01:02:19,220;"Okay."
01:02:19,660;01:02:21,580;"And Greg Brown, I say there's good, but they're good."
01:02:21,580;01:02:24,140;"And they're the first game you've watched in the season and a half."
01:02:24,140;01:02:26,460;"Now all of a sudden you're an expert on, on each individual."
01:02:26,460;01:02:26,960;"What?"
01:02:26,960;01:02:27,700;"Why you said it?"
01:02:27,700;01:02:32,020;"It's like your worldview of setting to you."
01:02:32,020;01:02:33,940;"No, you're safe space."
01:02:33,940;01:02:34,700;"You snowflake."
01:02:34,700;01:02:35,460;"This is what I'm saying."
01:02:35,460;01:02:36,900;"This is not a challenge."
01:02:36,900;01:02:39,500;"Snowflake anything because it's coming from you to you."
01:02:39,500;01:02:42,500;"You soy boy, you fucking cock, baby."
01:02:42,500;01:02:45,100;"You'll live turd."
01:02:45,100;01:02:46,340;"Well, it's hard."
01:02:46,340;01:02:47,900;"Oh, go."
01:02:47,900;01:02:53,980;"beep that. Is that okay? Very naughty. Sometimes a naughty boy."
01:02:53,980;01:02:58,420;"That that is big naughty. We like to say half of words like that."
01:02:58,420;01:03:03,940;"I don't think so. What about this? Is this okay? No. No,"
01:03:03,940;01:03:08,180;"very naughty. Very naughty. Mom, what do you think? Just"
01:03:08,180;01:03:13,460;"know that naughty boy. That was hilarious in a visual medium."
01:03:13,460;01:03:25,860;"what I just did. Yeah. I never see the line of death. So after I don't even know what we're talking about. Yeah, so the Patriots."
01:03:25,860;01:03:35,560;"Patriots get the ball after after the. Oh, we're talking about Troy Brown dropping the rock in conversion. Potter fingers brown over there."
01:03:36,140;01:03:41,700;"Blowing the game for the Patriots. Oh, it goes out and punt for the second time in the game"
01:03:41,700;01:03:45,180;"This is what it's a tie log out of intercept another one for a man D"
01:03:45,180;01:03:49,300;"Is that what's gonna happen? It does he no he doesn't know so"
01:03:49,300;01:03:52,740;"Yeah, I called at this point have the ball back"
01:03:52,740;01:04:00,100;"At their own 20 with two minutes left like exactly two minutes left. They go the elusive for an out"
01:04:00,100;01:04:04,700;"Yeah, I believe they don't get any yards. Yeah, it's for in completions"
01:04:05,020;01:04:10,300;"To the patient star in the whole time about Marcus Paul are being held because he goes in twice on third and fourth"
01:04:10,300;01:04:11,940;"and it was"
01:04:11,940;01:04:17,900;"But they could even call it out of it a soft call because it was contact, but it was 50/50"
01:04:17,900;01:04:22,180;"I'm sure Greg disagrees. I don't give a fuck. They've been letting go all game. Yeah"
01:04:22,180;01:04:27,180;"And then so the pages start the 20"
01:04:27,180;01:04:31,500;"Run it three times the third time is"
01:04:32,860;01:04:34,860;"Tom Brady naked bootleg"
01:04:34,860;01:04:40,720;"Gets sniffed out Tom Brady tries to juke the the one defender that's out there with him"
01:04:40,720;01:04:44,580;"Falls over and almost fumbles the ball away"
01:04:44,580;01:04:53,000;"So I had a huge problem the the slant in the end zone. Okay with that. Yeah"
01:04:53,000;01:04:55,320;"The naked boot"
01:04:55,320;01:04:59,320;"Inside the 20 when you all you need to do is kick a fucking field goal to win this game"
01:05:00,120;01:05:03,400;"With Tom fucking Brady. What are you? What are you doing?"
01:05:03,400;01:05:11,000;"My problem with it is that Tom Brady doesn't go down like a sack of potatoes as soon as that defender goes out"
01:05:11,000;01:05:16,000;"He does though. I mean, we see from the fumble because he goes down like a sack of potatoes"
01:05:16,000;01:05:22,040;"Well, no, I mean like without like he should have just like fallen down slid taking the the loss and that's it"
01:05:22,040;01:05:27,920;"But instead he tries to beat the guy should have been in a position taken down and then the ball gets ripped out"
01:05:27,920;01:05:30,920;"but luckily, isn't he was down already because he's such a bad runner."
01:05:30,920;01:05:32,840;"Yeah, he was saved by that."
01:05:32,840;01:05:37,240;"That would have been if Peyton gets that ball, he's taking that to the house."
01:05:37,240;01:05:38,080;"Right."
01:05:38,080;01:05:39,520;"Cause it's still a seven point game."
01:05:39,520;01:05:41,600;"Five seconds left on his 15 yard line."
01:05:41,600;01:05:42,960;"Doesn't matter if he has timeouts or not."
01:05:42,960;01:05:46,000;"He's going to take that and score a touchdown and tie this game up."
01:05:46,000;01:05:46,920;"Yeah."
01:05:46,920;01:05:50,160;"So instead of the page, they're able to kick a field goal."
01:05:50,160;01:05:52,080;"So now they're up 10 and the six yard line."
01:05:52,080;01:05:52,560;"Right."
01:05:52,560;01:05:54,360;"This game's over games over."
01:05:55,040;01:06:03,540;"But it ends, I think, in a perfect way because the Colts are driving, trying to, I don't know, put garbage time score up or something."
01:06:03,540;01:06:06,560;"You're not going to give up because it's a playoffs and you're still like."
01:06:06,560;01:06:08,100;"You never know."
01:06:08,100;01:06:08,920;"Right."
01:06:08,920;01:06:09,560;"You never know."
01:06:09,560;01:06:17,100;"But on fourth down, Manning completes a fourth and 10 and Manning completes a pass to Troy Walters."
01:06:17,100;01:06:19,940;"For like, it was like a five yard completion."
01:06:19,940;01:06:22,220;"Troy Walters has enough room to go get the first down."
01:06:22,840;01:06:27,040;"But instead steps out of bounds, a yard short of the line to game."
01:06:27,040;01:06:31,840;"And so he gains nine yards on fourth and 10 and his turnover and dance."
01:06:31,840;01:06:35,280;"Game over the perfect way to end this game."
01:06:35,280;01:06:35,480;"Yeah."
01:06:35,480;01:06:36,600;"It's bonehead."
01:06:36,600;01:06:42,240;"But when everybody in the stadium thought the game was over, including the"
01:06:42,240;01:06:46,880;"people who are like wheeling on the stage to present the AFC Championship trophy."
01:06:46,880;01:06:50,120;"And the Patriots still had to run one more player to kneel to actually"
01:06:50,120;01:06:52,280;"officially end it because it was like three seconds left."
01:06:52,720;01:06:59,620;"So everybody around the field and they had to like move everybody off and you could tell Belichick was like piss because he's the only one that recognized what was going on."
01:06:59,620;01:07:07,720;"He's like dragging people off the field and stuff, but a great way to end the"
01:07:07,720;01:07:15,580;"This this season, the going undefeated at home. They went 10 and 0 at home, these New England Patriots."
01:07:15,580;01:07:19,900;"Which is a pretty impressive stat. What else."
01:07:21,340;01:07:27,260;"Adam Minnitary tied the playoff record for five field goals in a playoff game."
01:07:27,260;01:07:29,500;"Tylolide three interceptions."
01:07:29,500;01:07:31,700;"Yeah."
01:07:31,700;01:07:35,700;"Tied for seconds in the NFL with three interceptions in a playoff game."
01:07:35,700;01:07:38,940;"David Givens had four who's recognized."
01:07:38,940;01:07:42,860;"David Givens continues his NFL streak of playoff games with a touchdown."
01:07:42,860;01:07:44,380;"Does he?"
01:07:44,380;01:07:45,100;"Yeah."
01:07:45,100;01:07:45,620;"Okay."
01:07:45,620;01:07:48,340;"He doesn't have like a super long streak of playoff games with TDs."
01:07:48,340;01:07:49,780;"Like seven."
01:07:49,780;01:07:50,260;"I don't know."
01:07:50,260;01:07:50,860;"Maybe."
01:07:50,940;01:07:51,940;"Let us up."
01:07:51,940;01:08:01,100;"Christian Fourier continues his, it continues the Patriots streak of dropped passes by New"
01:08:01,100;01:08:03,100;"England tight ends."
01:08:03,100;01:08:04,100;"Okay."
01:08:04,100;01:08:05,100;"Are you the worst Danny?"
01:08:05,100;01:08:07,180;"Are we doing best and worse here?"
01:08:07,180;01:08:08,180;"I guess so."
01:08:08,180;01:08:11,260;"No, that's that can't be my worst because I always start off on the positive note."
01:08:11,260;01:08:15,660;"Remember this house drops QBR rating of over 100 points."
01:08:15,660;01:08:16,660;"Yeah."
01:08:16,660;01:08:18,260;"Well, what did he finish with Greg?"
01:08:18,260;01:08:21,500;"23 of 47 237 yards."
01:08:21,500;01:08:26,740;"One touchdown four picks for sacks rating of 35.5."
01:08:26,740;01:08:30,500;"35."
01:08:30,500;01:08:31,480;"Day."
01:08:31,480;01:08:35,500;"Um, he was bad."
01:08:35,500;01:08:37,300;"He was really bad."
01:08:37,300;01:08:41,300;"Harrison three catches 19 yards."
01:08:41,300;01:08:45,740;"No one really on the receiving court again."
01:08:45,740;01:08:46,780;"I think they should have."
01:08:46,780;01:08:48,980;"- The baller did all right, but."
01:08:48,980;01:08:52,300;"- Adrian James was like, they like had that one driver"
01:08:52,300;01:08:54,140;"that he was running really well."
01:08:54,140;01:08:57,140;"I think right at the beginning of the second half."
01:08:57,140;01:09:00,220;"And then they just didn't give him the ball again."
01:09:00,220;01:09:01,060;"- Yeah."
01:09:01,060;01:09:02,260;"- Some of those sloppy like grind it out kind of games"
01:09:02,260;01:09:04,820;"in the playoffs like, Adrian James was really good"
01:09:04,820;01:09:07,820;"and he's definitely getting some space there."
01:09:07,820;01:09:09,300;"- Me and two Smarfers are good though."
01:09:09,300;01:09:10,860;"Wanted to force the ball."
01:09:10,860;01:09:13,460;"Fucking thing is, he's able to drive or a bunch of picks."
01:09:13,460;01:09:15,660;"- Absolutely."
01:09:15,660;01:09:18,740;"All right, do you want to do best and worst?"
01:09:18,740;01:09:20,860;"- Well, can we talk about Thai law?"
01:09:20,860;01:09:21,900;"- Oh, you want to talk about Thai?"
01:09:21,900;01:09:22,740;"Yeah, give it to me."
01:09:22,740;01:09:25,540;"- This is a Thai law honorary episode here, you know?"
01:09:25,540;01:09:26,380;"- It's true."
01:09:26,380;01:09:29,680;"- We never really gone too far into depth about Thai law."
01:09:29,680;01:09:30,520;"- We haven't."
01:09:30,520;01:09:34,860;"- So I said, let's give him a little historical context."
01:09:34,860;01:09:38,860;"- How many pages do you have here before?"
01:09:38,860;01:09:40,700;"- 'Cause it's on the right deck."
01:09:40,700;01:09:42,520;"- It doesn't have to go."
01:09:42,520;01:09:45,600;"on a cold snowy day in December 1985."
01:09:45,600;01:09:46,600;"(laughing)"
01:09:46,600;01:09:48,080;"- No."
01:09:48,080;01:09:52,200;"- He's from Alikippa, Alikippa, Pennsylvania."
01:09:52,200;01:09:54,600;"Ian, who else went to his high school?"
01:09:54,600;01:09:56,000;"- That sounds familiar."
01:09:56,000;01:09:58,880;"- Oh, I've used to know this funny stat."
01:09:58,880;01:10:00,840;"- Multiple people."
01:10:00,840;01:10:02,480;"Randy Moss, one of them?"
01:10:02,480;01:10:03,840;"- No."
01:10:03,840;01:10:08,840;"Mike Dica, who Tony Doris said, ""Endorrel Rivas."""
01:10:08,840;01:10:11,320;"- Oh, ""Dorrel Rivas,"" yes."
01:10:11,320;01:10:14,760;"Impressed Maravich Pete Paravich. Oh, yeah, yeah"
01:10:14,760;01:10:20,000;"So he went he I grew up in Pennsylvania went to Michigan"
01:10:20,000;01:10:25,760;"Was an all-American at Michigan 23rd overall picked by the Patriots in"
01:10:25,760;01:10:28,680;"1995"
01:10:28,680;01:10:31,160;"he"
01:10:31,160;01:10:34,680;"So he played I mean he's part of that original"
01:10:34,680;01:10:40,360;"Throwback team all the blood so teams he went to the Super Bowl against the Packers"
01:10:40,360;01:10:44,240;"- Yep. - Five time pro bowler,"
01:10:44,240;01:10:49,080;"two time all pro, he had 53 career interceptions,"
01:10:49,080;01:10:50,680;"seven touchdowns."
01:10:50,680;01:10:53,480;"He's in the Patriots Hall of Fame"
01:10:53,480;01:10:56,800;"and the pro football Hall of Fame as of a couple of years ago."
01:10:56,800;01:10:58,120;"- Is he in the Jets Hall of Fame?"
01:10:58,120;01:11:00,440;"- No. - Nope."
01:11:00,440;01:11:04,720;"- We should induct Remus into ours though."
01:11:06,800;01:11:12,100;"So I got a list of quarterbacks that Tyler intercepted."
01:11:12,100;01:11:12,900;"Okay."
01:11:12,900;01:11:16,400;"Cause you guys spanned multiple generations."
01:11:16,400;01:11:19,400;"So he's this and sick names on here."
01:11:19,400;01:11:22,100;"So can we guess how many are on that, Steve?"
01:11:22,100;01:11:22,800;"You and me?"
01:11:22,800;01:11:25,700;"Oh, I only have the notables."
01:11:25,700;01:11:26,300;"Oh, all right."
01:11:26,300;01:11:27,200;"All right."
01:11:27,200;01:11:29,000;"Give me the give me the notable names then."
01:11:29,000;01:11:29,500;"Never mind."
01:11:29,500;01:11:30,100;"All right."
01:11:30,100;01:11:32,600;"First career interception was Jim Kelly."
01:11:32,600;01:11:33,700;"Damn."
01:11:33,700;01:11:34,500;"Good one."
01:11:34,500;01:11:35,100;"Start your career."
01:11:35,900;01:11:46,220;"Dan Marino, of course. Steve Young, Troy Eggman, Boomer Sizing, Steve McNair, Phil Revers,"
01:11:46,220;01:11:53,100;"Peyton, obviously. And of course, Tom Brady and Drew Bloodsow."
01:11:53,100;01:12:01,980;"Yes. Oh, beautiful. He loved picking off Peyton."
01:12:01,980;01:12:03,480;"Oh, God. How many did he have?"
01:12:03,480;01:12:08,780;"He had a career total of nine interceptions of Peyton Manning."
01:12:08,780;01:12:10,660;"He wants his favor."
01:12:10,660;01:12:13,140;"Is the event five of which are in the playoffs."
01:12:13,140;01:12:13,940;"Oh my God."
01:12:13,940;01:12:15,460;"And how many are there for touchdowns?"
01:12:15,460;01:12:17,100;"At least one. I can remember."
01:12:17,100;01:12:21,180;"He may be off of Peyton for touchdowns."
01:12:21,180;01:12:24,260;"Yeah, I don't know."
01:12:24,260;01:12:28,540;"So he actually had to when he was on the Chiefs and oh six."
01:12:28,540;01:12:29,620;"If you remember that."
01:12:29,620;01:12:30,700;"Oh, that's right."
01:12:30,700;01:12:31,060;"Yeah."
01:12:31,060;01:12:32,380;"I think it's a wild car game."
01:12:32,380;01:12:32,860;"Yeah."
01:12:32,860;01:12:34,300;"Yeah, it's getting old."
01:12:34,300;01:12:36,180;"Picked them off twice and the playoffs again."
01:12:36,180;01:12:37,300;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:37,300;01:12:39,940;"They got 25."
01:12:39,940;01:12:43,980;"Peyton has 25 career postseason interceptions."
01:12:43,980;01:12:46,260;"Five of them are from Taiwan."
01:12:46,260;01:12:51,700;"How many of them are from Patriots?"
01:12:51,700;01:12:54,420;"I wonder just in general, because obviously you got another one with."
01:12:54,420;01:12:56,860;"Don Harrison."
01:12:56,860;01:13:00,180;"Well, Greg just said some of those were when he's with the Chiefs."
01:13:00,180;01:13:08,220;"against Dayton. That's true to you. Yep. Still great. He picked off both the"
01:13:08,220;01:13:12,300;"co MVPs this year, right? Because he got McNair in the regular season then so"
01:13:12,300;01:13:20,660;"he had four picks against the two MVPs in one season. Not bad. When Belichick"
01:13:20,660;01:13:25,620;"was asked about him, we said, yeah, I mean, a guy that has a that has a rule"
01:13:25,620;01:13:29,180;"named after him is probably pretty good. The Tylot."
01:13:29,180;01:13:31,860;"kind of like a result of this game."
01:13:31,860;01:13:33,580;"This specific game, yeah."
01:13:33,580;01:13:33,940;"Mm."
01:13:33,940;01:13:36,580;"Because Bill Paulian thought that"
01:13:36,580;01:13:38,180;"Tyler was getting a little too"
01:13:38,180;01:13:40,580;"handy with his with his babies"
01:13:40,580;01:13:43,140;"and decided to institute a royal that you"
01:13:43,140;01:13:45,020;"couldn't do that anymore because of the"
01:13:45,020;01:13:48,060;"post five yards contact thing, right?"
01:13:48,060;01:13:49,340;"Just not allowed anymore."
01:13:49,340;01:13:50,140;"Yep."
01:13:50,140;01:13:51,660;"That's an awesome quote from the other"
01:13:51,660;01:13:52,860;"Yeah."
01:13:52,860;01:13:54,300;"It really is."
01:13:54,300;01:13:56,220;"And also like"
01:13:56,420;01:14:03,460;"About how he's just like a cool dude. I got watched a bunch of interviews of them and he's just like he's funny"
01:14:03,460;01:14:06,020;"He's he's like cocky, but not"
01:14:06,020;01:14:12,500;"It's not a dick about it. He's a cocky. You know, yeah, he's not why you're just like cocky. Yeah"
01:14:12,500;01:14:19,780;"Yeah, he he's sold Brady his first home before Brady was a starter. Yep, because they were both Michigan boys"
01:14:19,780;01:14:21,380;"so he"
01:14:21,380;01:14:28,760;"When Brady moved here, he'd sold him home and he was like, yeah, I probably took like a hundred thousand dollar bath on it"
01:14:28,760;01:14:32,940;"Because if I gave it to him furnished, but he's like, guys, it's a Michigan boy. What are you gonna do?"
01:14:32,940;01:14:38,300;"That's awesome. Yeah, he told a good story to about"
01:14:38,300;01:14:42,140;"After the"
01:14:42,140;01:14:47,120;"The snowball last year against the Raiders. He's good buddies with Charles Woodson"
01:14:47,120;01:14:52,120;"And him and Charles used to meet up after every game they played each other."
01:14:52,120;01:14:57,120;"And he said he went looking for him by the bus after that game."
01:14:57,120;01:14:59,120;"And what's it wasn't there?"
01:14:59,120;01:15:00,120;"He was like already on the bus."
01:15:00,120;01:15:04,120;"So, Tyla went into the Raiders' bus after the Snowball."
01:15:04,120;01:15:07,120;"He was like, ""Yo, what's up buddy?"""
01:15:07,120;01:15:10,120;"And he was like, ""Nah, I ain't about that shit tonight."""
01:15:10,120;01:15:11,120;"Not tonight."
01:15:11,120;01:15:13,120;"And he was like, ""Yes, because you got your ass whooped."""
01:15:13,120;01:15:16,480;"that's whooped and he's like, and then I ran my ass off that bus as fast as I could."
01:15:16,480;01:15:25,440;"Oh, beautiful. Yeah, I think, um, Brian Morrie, who we had on the podcast a while ago,"
01:15:25,440;01:15:30,240;"the guy from the, uh, Peter Tallafame, right? He does his patch from the past podcast. And I"
01:15:30,240;01:15:35,120;"think they had Tyler on there as well. And it was, uh, it was really good interview. I think I"
01:15:35,120;01:15:41,840;"should tell that story on it. Yeah. It's fantastic. Yeah. He's just a legend. Just a, like, a cool"
01:15:41,840;01:15:49,440;"guy played with so much swag like that's what like jumps out at me is like yeah just just"
01:15:49,440;01:15:54,480;"oohs is confidence of why he's playing and that's what I think he was like my fair player is like"
01:15:54,480;01:15:59,040;"every part of the game too like he wasn't afraid he could tackle with the best of them"
01:15:59,040;01:16:04,240;"he can cover with the best of them his instincts never seem to fail him like he never seems to make"
01:16:04,240;01:16:11,440;"a wrong decision. And he's just the way he plays to, you know,"
01:16:11,440;01:16:17,360;"trying the biggest moments like this game is a huge game. Huge game. It's the best quarterback."
01:16:17,360;01:16:22,000;"It's three picks. This Super Bowl. You use a pick six like yeah, every time you need a"
01:16:22,000;01:16:28,480;"tie a lot of make play made a play. And like a big play to like. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the Tom Brady"
01:16:28,480;01:16:34,160;"right? Tom Bray is that same thing is when you need to play, you can trust Bray."
01:16:34,160;01:16:38,680;"It always exceeds your expectations rather than like let me down in a big"
01:16:38,680;01:16:42,160;"moment. And Tyla was always like that for me too. I agree."
01:16:42,160;01:16:44,160;"All right."
01:16:44,160;01:16:50,920;"Nick, Nick, Nick, they need T. Leasy. I hope not. I saw this like zoom thing."
01:16:50,920;01:16:56,120;"I like, you know, as your name on there, like before you log on, it just said"
01:16:56,120;01:16:57,040;"tea lazy."
01:16:57,040;01:16:59,160;"Hi, laws."
01:16:59,160;01:17:00,080;"Yeah."
01:17:00,080;01:17:05,800;"What tea leaves tea lazy boy."
01:17:05,800;01:17:10,800;"All right."
01:17:10,800;01:17:12,360;"Let's do best and worse."
01:17:12,360;01:17:14,120;"I've been going for quite a while here."
01:17:14,120;01:17:15,640;"Steve, you want to go first?"
01:17:15,640;01:17:16,960;"Yeah."
01:17:16,960;01:17:18,920;"Shall I go negative since or no?"
01:17:18,920;01:17:20,160;"Do what you want."
01:17:20,160;01:17:21,400;"First in the house."
01:17:21,400;01:17:22,440;"You do what you want."
01:17:22,440;01:17:22,920;"Your house."
01:17:22,920;01:17:25,000;"My commentator won that I said earlier."
01:17:25,000;01:17:25,720;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:25,720;01:17:26,560;"- Yeah."
01:17:26,560;01:17:27,560;"- You know I've been on this crusade"
01:17:27,560;01:17:32,240;"about Phil Simms sexually harassing Armand Cataean?"
01:17:32,240;01:17:33,320;"- Yes."
01:17:33,320;01:17:34,440;"- He does it again in this game."
01:17:34,440;01:17:35,360;"I don't know if you caught it."
01:17:35,360;01:17:36,680;"- I did, I missed it."
01:17:36,680;01:17:38,440;"- Is there a kickoff?"
01:17:38,440;01:17:40,440;"- Yeah, he said, I think those coaches got Armand"
01:17:40,440;01:17:41,680;"a little fired up."
01:17:41,680;01:17:44,920;"You know?"
01:17:44,920;01:17:46,520;"- And like, in a vacuum,"
01:17:46,520;01:17:48,000;"doesn't sound that creepy, you know?"
01:17:48,000;01:17:50,240;"But he says it like after the kickoff's already happening"
01:17:50,240;01:17:52,240;"and he like, and your checks it right at the end."
01:17:52,240;01:17:54,400;"And just all like the feet things you've been talking about"
01:17:54,400;01:17:56,120;"I was like, what do you mean fired up?"
01:17:56,120;01:17:58,280;"- Dude, I noticed one too."
01:17:58,280;01:17:59,600;"- Oh, you heard another one about it?"
01:17:59,600;01:18:00,680;"- Well, I think it was that one."
01:18:00,680;01:18:02,520;"I can't remember the exact wording,"
01:18:02,520;01:18:05,440;"but I remember thinking like the way he said it"
01:18:05,440;01:18:07,400;"like was so suggestive."
01:18:07,400;01:18:08,240;"- Yes."
01:18:08,240;01:18:10,360;"- And then Armin like didn't respond to it."
01:18:10,360;01:18:11,360;"It was like, what?"
01:18:11,360;01:18:13,040;"- Oh God, this is weird."
01:18:13,040;01:18:13,880;"- This is weird."
01:18:13,880;01:18:14,720;"- And they keep the ball off."
01:18:14,720;01:18:16,520;"And then he's like sitting there thinking about it."
01:18:16,520;01:18:18,680;"He just like makes a weird sexual--"
01:18:18,680;01:18:19,680;"- It's like stewing in it."
01:18:19,680;01:18:22,080;"Yeah, it's like, it felt like sexual tension."
01:18:22,080;01:18:22,920;"- Yeah."
01:18:22,920;01:18:24,840;"(laughs)"
01:18:24,840;01:18:26,560;"- Something going on."
01:18:26,560;01:18:28,920;"It's nice."
01:18:28,920;01:18:30,920;"- And then my best was,"
01:18:30,920;01:18:35,160;"I don't know which of the coaches it was"
01:18:35,160;01:18:36,320;"that you saw on the sideline,"
01:18:36,320;01:18:39,720;"but one of the current coaches,"
01:18:39,720;01:18:41,560;"the Steve and Brian,"
01:18:41,560;01:18:43,240;"gave like Bell check a hug right after"
01:18:43,240;01:18:44,440;"'cause he like picks them off."
01:18:44,440;01:18:45,440;"(laughs)"
01:18:45,440;01:18:46,960;"And they're like, ""I'll celebrate on the sideline."""
01:18:46,960;01:18:47,800;"He's like, I don't know,"
01:18:47,800;01:18:49,400;"he must be like 13 maybe in this game."
01:18:49,400;01:18:50,800;"- Yep, yep, probably."
01:18:50,800;01:18:52,400;"- He's young, maybe even younger."
01:18:52,400;01:18:53,280;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:18:53,280;01:18:55,280;"I'm probably your guy's age at that time."
01:18:55,280;01:18:57,320;"There's a feature coach."
01:18:57,320;01:18:57,920;"That's right. Yeah."
01:18:57,920;01:18:59,720;"Now he's coaching the defensive."
01:18:59,720;01:19:00,800;"I don't know if you watched it."
01:19:00,800;01:19:02,920;"He's the defensive play caller."
01:19:02,920;01:19:04,680;"It's fantastic."
01:19:04,680;01:19:05,680;"It's really cool."
01:19:05,680;01:19:08,440;"All right. Greg, do you even want to do best and worse?"
01:19:08,440;01:19:11,400;"I just got three best."
01:19:11,400;01:19:15,720;"I wonder what my third best was Tyler's second interception"
01:19:15,720;01:19:17,840;"and the overthrow that he scooped."
01:19:17,840;01:19:18,160;"Yeah."
01:19:18,160;01:19:20,760;"My second best was his first interception,"
01:19:20,760;01:19:25,640;"the one handed one where he's coming back towards the zone and my best was his third"
01:19:25,640;01:19:28,040;"interception that's been around."
01:19:28,040;01:19:29,840;"Boop right in his thing."
01:19:29,840;01:19:30,840;"All right."
01:19:30,840;01:19:33,000;"Game sealer."
01:19:33,000;01:19:37,120;"And was your worst not knowing how to find the Eugene Wilson hits?"
01:19:37,120;01:19:39,600;"It doesn't exist."
01:19:39,600;01:19:40,600;"It doesn't exist."
01:19:40,600;01:19:43,080;"It does on the website multiple times."
01:19:43,080;01:19:45,080;"It will on the website."
01:19:45,080;01:19:46,080;"Yeah."
01:19:46,080;01:19:47,080;"Yeah."
01:19:47,080;01:19:48,080;"But up to that point."
01:19:48,080;01:19:49,080;"It's true."
01:19:49,080;01:19:50,080;"Well, that's why we're here."
01:19:50,080;01:19:54,840;"Exactly. We are doing the whole world of favor here."
01:19:54,840;01:19:57,200;"All right."
01:19:57,200;01:19:59,240;"Now I was my background for ages."
01:19:59,240;01:20:01,080;"That's why I knew that play exists."
01:20:01,080;01:20:05,320;"It was the second hit where he's like, he's crushing Wayne."
01:20:05,320;01:20:10,040;"That was like, that was my background on my computer for like a long ass time."
01:20:10,040;01:20:12,080;"Just like first computer."
01:20:12,080;01:20:13,960;"That's a great. Yeah."
01:20:13,960;01:20:14,960;"Hell yeah."
01:20:14,960;01:20:15,760;"All right."
01:20:15,760;01:20:21,340;"My best was Charlie Weiss's halftime show because Armand"
01:20:21,340;01:20:28,540;"Contain was given permission to sit in on the halftime--"
01:20:28,540;01:20:30,740;"Which is the patron's halftime locker room."
01:20:30,740;01:20:33,540;"Which is what made the other comment later creepy too?"
01:20:33,540;01:20:34,260;"That was like--"
01:20:34,260;01:20:36,660;"A little bit."
01:20:36,660;01:20:39,160;"But apparently, Charlie Weiss at halftime"
01:20:39,160;01:20:43,500;"said we have to give them no reason for hope on offense,"
01:20:43,500;01:20:47,260;"which didn't work on offense, but on defense, it absolutely did."
01:20:47,260;01:20:51,140;"I just thought that felt and kind of like went back to all the things we were"
01:20:51,140;01:20:54,500;"saying, like they need to just like step on their neck and try to"
01:20:54,500;01:20:57,180;"wife recognize it, but we have to give them no reason for hope."
01:20:57,180;01:20:59,100;"It's such a great coach."
01:20:59,100;01:21:03,220;"They were the defensive players are so hot and bothered on the sideline because"
01:21:03,220;01:21:06,060;"he said that in the locker room, they had the chance and I throw the interception."
01:21:06,060;01:21:09,820;"Maybe you pick inside the red zone and you turn that interception in the red"
01:21:09,820;01:21:10,820;"end zone."
01:21:10,820;01:21:12,100;"Like you can't give him any hope."
01:21:12,100;01:21:13,100;"They're giving him hope now."
01:21:13,100;01:21:17,460;"And even like Tom Brady's attempting to fumble it on the naked bootleg would have given him hope"
01:21:17,460;01:21:24,180;"They did for a second until the Cleggard overturned. Yeah. Yeah, this game was just should have been a blowout. Yeah, I agree"
01:21:24,180;01:21:30,060;"And my worst was Dwight Frini who oh yeah"
01:21:30,060;01:21:34,640;"I read that you heard his name when they were announcing the rosters and not again"
01:21:34,640;01:21:38,660;"Yeah compared to like in the last game where they played so honestly"
01:21:38,660;01:21:43,660;"It's got to be a terra and he was a run and pass people on the turf and they were talking about how"
01:21:43,660;01:21:50,220;"Even before the game they he was Dwight Frini was already frustrated because he I think he knew what kind of game"
01:21:50,220;01:21:55,180;"Is it gonna be because like you said it's gonna be on the sloppy field ready gets rid of the ball really quickly"
01:21:55,180;01:21:58,260;"So he's like I don't have a chance like you can't get to a quarterback like that"
01:21:58,260;01:22:00,820;"And we're gonna run the ball at you and make you play"
01:22:00,820;01:22:04,060;"Yeah, which is exactly what he doesn't want to do"
01:22:04,940;01:22:09,460;"And then lastly, I'm gonna put this in the show notes, but I"
01:22:09,460;01:22:13,660;"Don't know if either of you caught this but the comment is actually made a"
01:22:13,660;01:22:20,680;"They made a comment about it because they when they cut to like the fans that was like coming back from"
01:22:20,680;01:22:26,620;"Come back from commercial something like that and they showed this one dude and"
01:22:26,620;01:22:33,260;"They're making a comment. We're like, oh you should wear that, but this is the picture guys. I'll be caught this"
01:22:33,460;01:22:38,140;"Yeah, but it's like it's supposed to look like you know like a bear skin or something on your head"
01:22:38,140;01:22:42,240;"But it looks literally like this guy has like skinned his own dog"
01:22:42,240;01:22:47,020;"It is wearing that like the the look of on this face of this animal that he's wearing"
01:22:47,020;01:22:51,540;"Where it looks like his dog is just like he's like holding this dog a backpack"
01:22:51,540;01:22:55,300;"Yeah, it could actually be his dog. Yeah, he's like all right dog"
01:22:55,300;01:22:58,560;"It's time to keep me warm get on my back and put your head on top of my head"
01:22:58,560;01:23:01,720;"But that whole face with everything with the ears and all of it. It's just"
01:23:01,720;01:23:08,640;"just perfect like new England person for this game with the with the shitty weather. And"
01:23:08,640;01:23:12,380;"it's like, you know what? I think the weather's gonna suck. So I'm gonna wear the dog out"
01:23:12,380;01:23:18,140;"of life's like, you can't wear that on public. You might even get on TV. And then like this"
01:23:18,140;01:23:23,080;"dude's on TV and the commentary talking about what he's wearing is like, Oh, you poor bastard."
01:23:23,080;01:23:28,240;"Love it. Did you spot the clouds corner banner in the end?"
01:23:28,240;01:23:31,120;"I saw that. I was like, what the hell?"
01:23:31,120;01:23:32,240;"Let's get my cloud."
01:23:32,240;01:23:33,680;"Maybe my cloud."
01:23:33,680;01:23:37,200;"Yeah. I thought I love the banner to him, but come on."
01:23:37,200;01:23:39,920;"Let's get a little more creative with that with that name, you know,"
01:23:39,920;01:23:40,640;"cloud nine."
01:23:40,640;01:23:42,480;"Something. Yeah."
01:23:42,480;01:23:44,400;"Anything over in clouds corner."
01:23:44,400;01:23:47,120;"Let's get cloud as would have been mine, obviously."
01:23:47,120;01:23:47,760;"Yeah, we know."
01:23:47,760;01:23:50,240;"All right."
01:23:50,240;01:23:54,080;"Hey, you, you get off my cloud."
01:23:55,520;01:23:56,360;"- There we go."
01:23:56,360;01:24:00,440;"- That was a Chris Berman."
01:24:00,440;01:24:01,440;"(laughing)"
01:24:01,440;01:24:02,600;"- He's a BC guy though, right?"
01:24:02,600;01:24:03,960;"That's why he probably liked him"
01:24:03,960;01:24:06,560;"'cause he didn't do anything next year."
01:24:06,560;01:24:08,960;"- Now he had two games where he ran"
01:24:08,960;01:24:10,040;"for a couple touchdowns each game."
01:24:10,040;01:24:10,880;"- That was it."
01:24:10,880;01:24:13,360;"- I thought he looked really good."
01:24:13,360;01:24:14,200;"- Yeah."
01:24:14,200;01:24:15,440;"- I was getting cloudy."
01:24:15,440;01:24:21,440;"- But that's it for the 2003 AFC Championship Game"
01:24:21,440;01:24:23,800;"against the Indianapolis Colts."
01:24:23,800;01:24:26,120;"or what's left of them after this beat down."
01:24:26,120;01:24:30,200;"So next week, the page will return to the Super Bowl"
01:24:30,200;01:24:33,880;"for the second time under Bill Belichick in three years."
01:24:33,880;01:24:37,540;"The makings of a dynasty, according to Phil Sims."
01:24:37,540;01:24:40,440;"So we will see what happens then."
01:24:40,440;01:24:41,280;"Where are we going?"
01:24:41,280;01:24:42,160;"Where are we traveling?"
01:24:42,160;01:24:45,640;"Next week, the Browns are taking this podcast"
01:24:45,640;01:24:46,640;"to the Super Bowl."
01:24:46,640;01:24:48,760;"Steve."
01:24:48,760;01:24:50,120;"See what I did there?"
01:24:50,120;01:24:51,440;"I did it."
01:24:51,440;01:24:53,200;"We are heading to Reliance Stadium."
01:24:53,200;01:24:54,040;"- Gregory."
01:24:54,040;01:24:56,600;"- Houston."
01:24:56,600;01:24:57,760;"- Hi, Houston."
01:24:57,760;01:25:00,360;"- Oh, Houston sucks."
01:25:00,360;01:25:03,120;"- Right, the last time we were in Houston,"
01:25:03,120;01:25:07,320;"the Patriots were getting a little bit manhandled"
01:25:07,320;01:25:10,320;"by the upstart Texans who were not good up this season."
01:25:10,320;01:25:12,280;"- Speaking of getting manhandled to Houston,"
01:25:12,280;01:25:14,960;"how about that Deshawn Watson stuff going around?"
01:25:14,960;01:25:16,120;"(laughing)"
01:25:16,120;01:25:17,280;"- Sometimes a naughty boy."
01:25:17,280;01:25:18,800;"(laughing)"
01:25:18,800;01:25:20,360;"- Carry naughty."
01:25:20,360;01:25:22,120;"- All right, so we've muted Greg."
01:25:22,120;01:25:24,920;"(laughing)"
01:25:24,920;01:25:26,160;"- Very naughty."
01:25:26,160;01:25:27,480;"Very naughty."
01:25:27,480;01:25:29,480;"Very naughty."
01:25:29,480;01:25:30,960;"- No, I literally muted you."
01:25:30,960;01:25:32,760;"We can't hear what you're saying, Greg."
01:25:32,760;01:25:34,080;"(laughing)"
01:25:34,080;01:25:34,920;"- This is nice."
01:25:34,920;01:25:37,760;"- Let's go there."
01:25:37,760;01:25:39,600;"- I was saying, you gotta have me fucking mute finger"
01:25:39,600;01:25:40,520;"quick on me."
01:25:40,520;01:25:41,760;"- Yeah, no shit."
01:25:41,760;01:25:44,240;"God damn it."
01:25:44,240;01:25:45,960;"- All right, well on that note,"
01:25:45,960;01:25:47,120;"I have some editing to do,"
01:25:47,120;01:25:50,480;"and while I do that, we will see you later."
01:25:51,800;01:25:53,960;"Feel it. Feel it."

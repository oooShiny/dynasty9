00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,680;"I am not your mother."
00:19,680;00:29,200;"Alright, welcome again to the Patriots Dinesie Podcast."
00:29,200;00:36,760;"with me are the three amigos Mr. Mellow Mike how you doing? Pretty darn good I"
00:36,760;00:40,360;"would say. I'm glad to hear it. It sounds like you're recording from the beach so I"
00:40,360;00:48,400;"love that. Oh man it's the the concrete beach of Los Angeles. Oh baby. Yes. Great"
00:48,400;00:52,760;"you're you're not on fire at the moment are you? No everyone's actually that noise"
00:52,760;00:57,080;"you're hearing is people trying to leave the city but I decided to stay and do"
00:57,080;00:59,360;"this thing. So you're well."
00:59,360;01:01,320;"We appreciate your commitment. Thank you very much."
01:01,320;01:02,280;"And got it."
01:02,280;01:06,760;"And also, with us, we have Steve Brown."
01:06,760;01:11,480;"How's it going, Steve? Good. We'll miss you on future podcast, Mike."
01:11,480;01:14,320;"Thank you. And that means a lot."
01:14,320;01:26,000;"And we also with us in a very Halloween mood today have Greg Brown."
01:26,000;01:26,880;"How's it going, G?"
01:26,880;01:30,160;"Going great. Best day of the year."
01:30,160;01:32,360;"Yeah, is this your favorite holiday?"
01:32,360;01:34,760;"No, but I love Halloween."
01:34,760;01:36,960;"Alright, what is your favorite holiday?"
01:36,960;01:38,360;"Bookey today, boys."
01:38,360;01:42,920;"Oh, great."
01:42,920;01:47,080;"And I believe Greg is actually carving a pumpkin as we speak."
01:47,080;01:50,560;"So with a bowl full of candy sitting right next to me."
01:50,560;01:54,640;"Have you had any of you guys had any trick-or-treaters this year?"
01:54,640;02:02,960;"one. No, we had one. We had two. And they are the first ones we've ever had in the 12"
02:02,960;02:11,040;"years of living in our house. No kidding. Yeah. So I don't think they're very excited."
02:11,040;02:14,680;"I don't think there are kids in Los Angeles. I don't see them. Yeah, I don't think there"
02:14,680;02:20,800;"are either. Yeah. So the child actors aren't already doing drugs anyway instead of. Hey,"
02:20,800;02:24,480;"Whoa, we're not doing that."
02:24,480;02:26,040;"- We already did, it's fine."
02:26,040;02:30,780;"All right, so this week we're talking about"
02:30,780;02:34,920;"week three of the 2001 NFL season,"
02:34,920;02:37,320;"where like Colts came to visit,"
02:37,320;02:38,360;"I almost said Gillette Stadium,"
02:38,360;02:41,520;"but it's not Gillette Stadium, it's Foxboro Stadium."
02:41,520;02:44,200;"This Gillette Stadium is still being built in the background."
02:44,200;02:48,000;"And this is notable because it is Tom Brady's"
02:48,000;02:50,640;"first ever NFL start."
02:50,640;02:52,880;"after Drew Bledsoe's injury."
02:52,880;02:55,080;"The, was it they hit her around the world?"
02:55,080;02:56,840;"Is that what we called it last week?"
02:56,840;02:57,960;"The last episode."
02:57,960;03:02,960;"And as we talk about, we kind of put together"
03:02,960;03:07,600;"some bossing globe articles from before the game"
03:07,600;03:08,600;"and after the game."
03:08,600;03:13,600;"And pretty much the entire week's worth of sports section"
03:13,600;03:17,720;"from the week up to this was all about"
03:17,720;03:19,800;"nothing but the Bledsoe injury."
03:19,800;03:25,600;"and how they actually decided that Brady was gonna be the starter instead of any of the"
03:25,600;03:27,080;"more experienced quarterbacks."
03:27,080;03:34,720;"I was wondering what you guys thought of that because they actually picked up, what was"
03:34,720;03:35,720;"the name, Freeze?"
03:35,720;03:37,720;"What's his first name?"
03:37,720;03:39,120;"Doug or something like that?"
03:39,120;03:40,440;"Was it John?"
03:40,440;03:44,240;"John Freeze, yeah, something like that."
03:44,240;03:48,520;"And they actually the pages went out and picked him up but still ended up starting Brady"
03:48,520;03:55,180;"anyway for reasons I think they were unbeknownst to at least the Boston sports"
03:55,180;04:01,800;"media at the time but became relatively evident pretty quickly even in this game"
04:01,800;04:07,880;"the Boston sports meet is still complaining about Brady this is this is"
04:07,880;04:12,160;"true I don't think that'll ever stop but now they're they're complaining that he's"
04:12,160;04:14,460;"he's got a leave instead of that he's here."
04:14,460;04:18,000;"So it's a refreshing difference."
04:18,000;04:20,640;"Bunch of haters."
04:20,640;04:22,880;"Animals."
04:22,880;04:23,840;"This is true."
04:23,840;04:28,280;"Do you any of you guys actually get to hear any Boston sports media these days?"
04:28,280;04:31,160;"No, I have to search for it."
04:31,160;04:32,000;"Yeah."
04:32,000;04:33,200;"Yeah, I have to search for it."
04:33,200;04:35,720;"But what I do find, I mean, the national media is intolerable."
04:35,720;04:40,480;"So I don't know how it is locally, but I mean, you get the CNA Smiths kind of ranting."
04:40,480;04:42,320;"you get the max Kellerman's doing their thing."
04:42,320;04:44,040;"But I feel like it's tired."
04:44,040;04:46,960;"They've been doing this for what, five, six years now."
04:46,960;04:49,360;"And the stuff that they're talking about now"
04:49,360;04:52,240;"with selling homes and we'll find out,"
04:52,240;04:54,040;"I guess, where this all heads,"
04:54,040;04:58,160;"but it seems like a pretty far reach nowadays."
04:58,160;04:59,760;"So I don't know how it is for you guys."
04:59,760;05:02,120;"- Yeah, I mean, for me, I'm still living in it"
05:02,120;05:04,120;"and it's actually worse here."
05:04,120;05:08,560;"It feels like Boston Sports Talk radio especially"
05:09,800;05:17,040;"sports Twitter, all of the big names. It feels like they're actively rooting"
05:17,040;05:20,920;"against, not even just the page, but doing Lynn's sports scene in general."
05:20,920;05:25,640;"Well, that's why we're doing this, right? To give a fresh perspective of real"
05:25,640;05:30,560;"homerism. That's exactly right. Yeah, if you want to break from all that"
05:30,560;05:36,800;"negativity, this is the place to be. Put on your Patriots footy pajamas and"
05:36,800;05:40,800;"come spend some time in our bedroom of a Patriots love."
05:40,800;05:44,320;"I think my girlfriend thinks it's weird how handsome I think he is."
05:44,320;05:46,520;"There's nothing wrong with that."
05:46,520;05:50,240;"No, I mean, maybe she should be less judgmental."
05:50,240;05:53,040;"A dude recognizing the handsomeness of another dude."
05:53,040;05:54,320;"I don't see anything wrong with it."
05:54,320;05:54,760;"It's 20."
05:54,760;05:56,400;"Especially when he's that handsome."
05:56,400;05:57,880;"I mean, Tom Brady."
05:57,880;06:00,600;"It's he's just he ages like a fine wine."
06:00,600;06:02,280;"That's true."
06:02,280;06:03,720;"Long hair Brady though."
06:03,720;06:05,080;"Bring that back."
06:05,920;06:09,920;"All I know is I have insider info here."
06:09,920;06:17,520;"I know a gentleman who has dated several women who have been with intimately Tom Brady"
06:17,520;06:19,680;"and Aaron Rodgers."
06:19,680;06:22,520;"So I can't think of a luckier guy than that."
06:22,520;06:23,520;"Who is he?"
06:23,520;06:24,520;"Name name name."
06:24,520;06:26,720;"I can't reveal this information."
06:26,720;06:31,400;"Come on."
06:31,400;06:33,520;"Would you bang him?"
06:33,520;06:34,520;"Who my friend?"
06:34,520;06:35,520;"Yes."
06:35,520;06:37,520;"the"
06:37,520;06:38,520;"the"
06:38,520;06:43,000;"That's funny. I'll run the topic. It's like an Eskimo brothers. What a thing, right? I"
06:43,000;06:48,200;"Look, I can't talk about this gentleman. I'm sorry"
06:48,200;06:57,100;"That's because it's him boys. It's it's him. It is not it is not like I said I would be I would feel honored"
06:57,100;07:02,960;"Well, I've got quickly got off track to that that took like 30 seconds"
07:04,760;07:11,560;"But no, but to the question, Andrew, I thought that it could be broken down to two things."
07:11,560;07:16,560;"What you were asking about this game and, you know, the blood so situation and also Brady."
07:16,560;07:23,640;"I mean, the quicker part of it, I do think it's interesting that Brady was chosen considering"
07:23,640;07:27,960;"that Damon Hubert was technically ahead of him at the beginning of the season."
07:27,960;07:31,560;"And I didn't know that he was a career five and one quarterback at that time."
07:31,960;07:35,720;"So I mean, Belichick was pretty bold to throw in a guy who threw in what,"
07:35,720;07:37,920;"like two or three professional passes before that."
07:37,920;07:38,840;"Yep."
07:38,840;07:41,760;"So I thought that was pretty interesting."
07:41,760;07:42,480;"Yeah."
07:42,480;07:47,400;"I think pretty stats before this he had thrown three passes and completed one"
07:47,400;07:51,560;"of them for six yards in a blowout the year before on Thanksgiving against the"
07:51,560;07:52,920;"Lions."
07:52,920;07:53,240;"Yeah."
07:53,240;07:56,840;"Well, I mean, that doesn't count the passes he threw when bloods are got hurt"
07:56,840;07:57,640;"in the Jets game."
07:57,640;07:58,720;"He looked pretty good in that game."
07:58,720;07:59,280;"Oh, that's true."
07:59,280;08:00,080;"Yeah."
08:00,080;08:01,200;"I mean, yeah."
08:01,200;08:05,760;"I that's the one thing that stuck out to me and this was, we'll just start talking about Brady, I guess."
08:05,760;08:16,000;"Just how Brady like he looked. I mean, he wasn't as accurate and he wasn't like the results weren't quite there,"
08:16,000;08:19,840;"but he just looked like Tom Brady. He walked in there just looking like he owned the place."
08:19,840;08:24,720;"Like he'd been the starter for 20 years already. Had complete control of the huddle."
08:25,920;08:32,640;"And then his first play from screamer, she ran into a sack and his first pass attempt, he"
08:32,640;08:40,480;"chucked it 20 yards over the head of some wide open receiver, but it was like vintage Brady from"
08:40,480;08:46,560;"the beginning. Yeah, it was also interesting kind of looking back at those articles and seeing how"
08:46,560;08:51,840;"he was because I mean, now he sort of, you know, he's earned his confidence, I guess he could say."
08:53,840;08:56,240;"but in reading how he spoke."
08:56,240;08:58,920;"And I guess I kind of remember this a little bit back then,"
08:58,920;09:02,360;"but it obviously was in a thing until maybe years later."
09:02,360;09:06,480;"But I mean, he was pretty confident with the media."
09:06,480;09:08,880;"He was pretty confident with Robert Kraft."
09:08,880;09:11,520;"And we all know the story about how, you know,"
09:11,520;09:13,760;"he approached Robert Kraft after he drafted him"
09:13,760;09:15,920;"and basically told him that it was the best decision"
09:15,920;09:16,760;"he ever made."
09:16,760;09:20,200;"Well, that sort of carried through to like the rest of the media."
09:20,200;09:22,840;"I mean, everything that I read was this guy"
09:22,840;09:26,940;"who was claiming he wasn't nervous, he was ready, he was underestimated."
09:26,940;09:28,960;"And this was like even before his first start."
09:28,960;09:34,160;"So I mean, that was pretty, I don't know if it's impressive or what, but the guy"
09:34,160;09:36,440;"obviously knew who he was."
09:36,440;09:37,640;"Oh, absolutely."
09:37,640;09:43,280;"I will say the one difference that I noticed, the biggest difference was, um,"
09:43,280;09:47,520;"how much of a hard we was on the, uh, the snap cadence."
09:47,520;09:50,920;"Like he was barking out signals back then."
09:51,640;09:53,360;"I don't know if that was just like an overcompensation thing,"
09:53,360;09:55,440;"but now he like, he still yells at people"
09:55,440;09:58,040;"and is not the same, you know, like he's just trying"
09:58,040;09:59,480;"to get the ball in his hands."
09:59,480;10:03,960;"But back then he was like, or maybe it was just the audio"
10:03,960;10:05,040;"the way it was different back then,"
10:05,040;10:07,800;"but it just sounded like he was putting a whole bunch"
10:07,800;10:12,440;"of extra oomph into snapping that football."
10:12,440;10:15,720;"- I mean, I might play into, I also read that"
10:15,720;10:21,600;"he felt like he always did whatever he wanted to do."
10:21,600;10:26,040;"Team wise to get them motivated, but as a backup you sort of don't have any leverage"
10:26,040;10:31,560;"So he felt that by being a starter for the first time people actually would listen to what he was barking out"
10:31,560;10:33,560;"So it might have played into that"
10:33,560;10:35,760;"Yeah, I could see that"
10:35,760;10:42,280;"The other part of the thing that you that you had brought up that I was referring to was yeah"
10:42,280;10:46,480;"The the Bledto injury, but I actually thought it was interesting and again"
10:46,480;10:48,480;"I didn't think anything of it back then"
10:48,480;10:49,440;"but"
10:49,440;10:55,320;"There was a so along with his punctured lung and the internal bleeding"
10:55,320;11:01,700;"I guess he might have or might have not blacked out for you know a number of seconds and"
11:01,700;11:04,280;"in costs"
11:04,280;11:06,040;"you know and"
11:06,040;11:08,480;"Bella check kind of talk openly about it"
11:08,480;11:13,960;"Which you obviously wouldn't today because talking about how he regretted throwing drew out there because he wasn't quite himself"
11:13,960;11:19,420;"And a lot of articles were actually addressing you know creating a concussion protocol or something"
11:19,420;11:25,980;"like that. That was obviously years out. But that was pretty interesting to see and kind"
11:25,980;11:28,820;"of see where Drew was at at that time as well."
11:28,820;11:36,180;"Yeah. Yeah, no, that was, yeah, because that was before the whole. Like even before, I"
11:36,180;11:44,420;"think concussions were talked about as part of football too. Because the one thing that"
11:44,420;11:48,860;"I've noticed about watching these games in general is just how much harder the hits"
11:48,860;11:53,860;"seem and how there's a whole lot more like head contact in all these hits."
11:53,860;11:58,620;"I mean, I think the defensive star of this game that we'll get to eventually is"
11:58,620;12:04,420;"Brian Cox and he was just laying the wood on people, but he felt like he was"
12:04,420;12:06,140;"leaving with his head the entire time."
12:06,140;12:10,660;"And like just like the offensive receiver thing, not a thing."
12:10,660;12:11,540;"Oh, yeah."
12:11,540;12:13,340;"Just laying out receivers."
12:13,340;12:17,060;"There was a one kickoff return where, uh, to Bucky Jones,"
12:17,060;12:21,700;"Basie just closed line the, the kicker turner and got a penalty for it,"
12:21,700;12:24,300;"but was still taunting the entire time they were like calling the penalty."
12:24,300;12:25,620;"You still like jacked up about it."
12:25,620;12:28,020;"It was, it was like a straight clothesline."
12:28,020;12:28,540;"Yeah."
12:28,540;12:31,820;"Just straight up, just, just got us right across the neck."
12:31,820;12:33,540;"Like, Oh no, he's beat me."
12:33,540;12:34,940;"Not a stick bar."
12:34,940;12:37,060;"This guy."
12:37,060;12:40,940;"It was, it was a bit brutal and, and they called it a face masking like that."
12:40,940;12:41,860;"That wasn't a face map."
12:41,860;12:45,500;"He just just mash that guy's throat with his forearm."
12:45,500;12:47,660;"I'm in place for like loving it too."
12:47,660;12:48,700;"Yeah."
12:48,700;12:51,380;"Well, that was just a tone here."
12:51,380;12:54,820;"Do you see how we'll lead to this head?"
12:54,820;12:55,660;"What a great hit."
12:55,660;12:56,500;"Yeah."
12:56,500;12:56,980;"Oh, yeah."
12:56,980;13:02,740;"Um, but before we get too far, let's, uh, let's talk about the Colts."
13:02,740;13:04,740;"Cause we probably should have started with that."
13:04,740;13:10,060;"Um, so this cult team coming in was two and O they had blown the doors off"
13:10,060;13:12,400;"of the Dolphins and the Bills, I believe."
13:12,400;13:20,020;"Um, and the week before, like they, like, put up 40 something points on the, on the"
13:20,020;13:23,960;"Bills, they didn't punt the entire game was, you know, typical Peyton"
13:23,960;13:27,180;"mating Colts offensive performance."
13:27,180;13:32,960;"Um, I think their first four or five drives of the half were touchdowns"
13:32,960;13:35,320;"of the first half in, in that game."
13:36,160;13:42,960;"So I looked it up and the Cole Tuchy favored by 11 and a half in this game coming in."
13:42,960;13:48,480;"Yeah, coming into Fox Row Stadium against a team that actually"
13:48,480;13:56,880;"had a bell check had given Manning trouble in the past, like the year before, I think the pages"
13:56,880;14:06,640;"to beat them once. But this was not the Colts best year actually. This is when they're still"
14:06,640;14:13,560;"in the AFC East. They would finish the season 6 and 10, even after starting 2 and 0. And"
14:13,560;14:21,800;"they would finish 4th in the AFC East out of like 5 teams, I want to say. And they were"
14:21,800;14:23,800;"one"
14:23,800;14:27,560;"The AFC East actually sent three teams to the playoffs this year"
14:27,560;14:31,600;"And they were one of the ones that weren't it was them and the bills didn't make it"
14:31,600;14:35,640;"But it was the past dolphins and jets often AFC East made the playoffs"
14:35,640;14:42,340;"Here's an interesting morsel for you boys you can put this in your little"
14:42,340;14:45,520;"Halloween basket"
14:45,520;14:51,120;"The hard coach was Jim Mora who is actually a different Jim Mora than the one who coached the Falcons"
14:51,120;14:53,640;"I didn't realize there was two of them."
14:53,640;14:55,600;"- Are they related?"
14:55,600;14:58,520;"- Yeah, wow, it's candy when you have that."
14:58,520;15:00,720;"- That's what I mean, that's a tasty morsel."
15:00,720;15:03,720;"I don't know if early, I couldn't find anything"
15:03,720;15:06,840;"in the 30 seconds of googling I did,"
15:06,840;15:11,040;"but I just, I got super confused trying to find out"
15:11,040;15:12,160;"which one was which."
15:12,160;15:14,080;"- Yeah, isn't it Jim were a junior?"
15:14,080;15:16,480;"Again, I don't know if there's a relation or not,"
15:16,480;15:19,480;"but I also was very sad and looking over everything"
15:19,480;15:24,480;"everything and realizing that it was Jim Morris, the Colts, Jim Morris last season as a coach."
15:24,480;15:27,580;"And that guy was a character and I miss him dearly."
15:27,580;15:28,240;"Yeah."
15:28,240;15:29,840;"Who was the playoffs guy?"
15:29,840;15:30,520;"Yeah."
15:30,520;15:31,120;"Oh, hell yeah."
15:31,120;15:32,480;"Yeah."
15:32,480;15:34,400;"I'm off playoffs."
15:34,400;15:37,680;"Talk about playoffs."
15:37,680;15:41,760;"And I think what I just want to win a game."
15:41,760;15:42,840;"So that's rare."
15:42,840;15:44,920;"That could have been killed."
15:44,920;15:45,200;"Yeah."
15:45,200;15:49,280;"That sounds like it might have been this season because they did finish six and 10 and missed the playoffs."
15:49,280;15:50,560;"How was it this year?"
15:50,560;15:51,680;"Hey, it could have been."
15:51,680;15:53,520;"Oh, man, that's great."
15:53,520;15:59,760;"The other coach of note in this game was their defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio."
15:59,760;16:08,960;"We might recognize from being a horrendous flaco Lebronko's team this year."
16:08,960;16:11,840;"And he is in charge of that dumpster fire."
16:11,840;16:16,080;"Although they're not flaco anymore, they're flaco less, right?"
16:16,080;16:16,720;"Because he's out."
16:16,720;16:17,760;"Yeah, that's right."
16:17,760;16:22,480;"Yeah, he just got hurt. So I'm sure I'm sure they'll turn around the second half of the season without. Oh, yeah"
16:22,480;16:28,920;"Well, John always great at drafting quarterback. So this is a done. I was gonna say which which one I'll last to you"
16:28,920;16:30,920;"know, is it Vic or is it away?"
16:30,920;16:35,960;"I don't think Denver will ever get rid of"
16:35,960;16:40,200;"Just on"
16:40,200;16:44,360;"Did you see the the story about how he"
16:45,800;16:52,120;"Had all the boxes checked for drafting Russell Wilson except for the height one and so he passed on him"
16:52,120;16:59,280;"That's so John Elway he loves him some big white quarterbacks with massive arms"
16:59,280;17:06,520;"All right, I thought so we'll go to the players"
17:06,520;17:11,840;"I don't know if we can can any of you name anybody on the defense"
17:12,840;17:16,680;"Oh, I recognize the same guy calls. Yeah, but I called"
17:16,680;17:19,920;"I recognize one guy I"
17:19,920;17:24,920;"Recognize one name and it was Jack Burris and I remembered him as a Buffalo bill"
17:24,920;17:28,480;"I didn't even know he played for the Colts. I don't remember him being particularly good"
17:28,480;17:30,560;"I think I just had his football card growing up"
17:30,560;17:34,040;"That was literally what I recognize which"
17:34,040;17:37,600;"Makes a lot of sense when you see how this game ended"
17:37,600;17:42,760;"I love the talk of the commentators about how the cults were feeling disrespected"
17:42,760;17:48,360;"because the offense was so good and everybody was talking shit about the the cult's defense and"
17:48,360;17:51,480;"Then the Patriots came in and just dominated them"
17:51,480;17:55,400;"Offends had a lot more"
17:55,400;17:57,960;"No names. Obviously quarterback Peyton Manning"
17:57,960;18:02,020;"he threw for over 4,000 yards a season and"
18:02,020;18:07,480;"26 touchdowns, but he also had 23 picks and I think most of those came against the Patriots"
18:07,480;18:13,480;"Did they count? I'm assuming they don't count pick sixes as touchdowns thrown, right?"
18:13,480;18:15,480;"For the quarterback now."
18:15,480;18:16,480;"For the quarterback now."
18:16,480;18:18,480;"Yeah. Because I mean, that would give them an extra couple."
18:18,480;18:21,480;"I mean, if that was the case, the Dolphins would be like, ""Lead don't elite this here."""
18:21,480;18:27,480;"I think Fitzpatrick would lead league every year. The hammer James Winston."
18:27,480;18:30,480;"James is definitely James."
18:30,480;18:35,480;"And then for wide receivers, they had obviously Marvin Harrison,"
18:35,480;18:40,520;"Who hang on where's my note for this? I wrote this down. I thought it was funny"
18:40,520;18:45,800;"So I'm gonna beat you over there with it Marvin Harris. It was drawing balls in this like he drops bodies"
18:45,800;18:54,360;"I thought that wasn't going and there was also rettea rain was actually on the team"
18:54,360;18:59,040;"This was his rookie season, but I don't think he caught a ball in this game. At least not one that I noticed"
18:59,040;19:03,920;"I'll drum here. He was an effect. Yeah, the yeah Jerome pathon who was leading the"
19:05,000;19:08,720;"leading the team in receptions, which was baffling."
19:08,720;19:12,160;"Cause I don't, I kind of recognized the name,"
19:12,160;19:14,240;"but I don't remember him playing for the Colts for some reason."
19:14,240;19:19,040;"I do. I feel like he was like, once Reggie Wayne came to, he was like a solid number three guy."
19:19,040;19:20,200;"Yeah, maybe."
19:20,200;19:25,120;"I don't know, but he, he didn't have a great game either."
19:25,120;19:29,000;"Um, once because the right cause taken his head off every time he touched."
19:29,000;19:31,280;"Yeah, that definitely set the tone."
19:31,960;19:33,700;"Um, so."
19:33,700;19:39,800;"Tiden was Marcus Pollard who was actually the second leading receiver on the team this"
19:39,800;19:42,240;"season behind Marman Harrison."
19:42,240;19:49,320;"Um, and then the running backs, which I want to talk about were a Dominic Rhodes,"
19:49,320;19:52,860;"who was the leading rusher apparently on the team, even though I don't remember"
19:52,860;19:53,880;"seeing him much in this game."
19:53,880;19:54,640;"Yeah."
19:54,640;19:56,040;"He's a rookie too, I think."
19:56,040;19:57,000;"Yeah."
19:57,000;19:59,320;"And then, uh, Edgar and James was here."
20:00,320;20:03,820;"And I feel like he was the leading rusher"
20:03,820;20:07,760;"for the past few years before this,"
20:07,760;20:09,720;"but I don't know if he had injuries"
20:09,720;20:10,880;"or just a bad year or whatever,"
20:10,880;20:14,320;"but he finished a distant second in rushing this year."
20:14,320;20:18,260;"And I kind of wanted to use that as a segue"
20:18,260;20:20,160;"to talk about this Patriots defense"
20:20,160;20:23,760;"'cause I thought, I don't know if they were in"
20:23,760;20:26,720;"Edgar and James's head or if he's just soft."
20:26,720;20:27,600;"I don't remember."
20:29,000;20:35,720;"I remember kind of the general feeling of the Patriots being a harder team than the Colts."
20:35,720;20:38,720;"And the Colts were always like a bit more finesse and you could kind of beat them up."
20:38,720;20:42,000;"But Edgar and James was super soft in this game."
20:42,000;20:45,960;"Did anyone else see that or am I an idiot?"
20:45,960;20:49,360;"That's the home reason we're looking for Andy."
20:49,360;20:52,560;"I don't know."
20:52,560;20:55,240;"I mean, I kind of feel like he was always like that against the Patriots."
20:55,240;20:57,760;"And I don't know if it was the type of game that they got into."
20:58,960;21:00,500;"I mean, obviously in this one, it was a little bit"
21:00,500;21:04,040;"lopsided towards the end, but I don't know."
21:04,040;21:05,680;"I feel like, didn't you have a rap"
21:05,680;21:07,880;"for being kind of soft sometimes?"
21:07,880;21:10,340;"- That's what I'm thinking."
21:10,340;21:11,800;"I know the whole team, but Edgar and James,"
21:11,800;21:14,080;"like he never seemed to finish or run."
21:14,080;21:16,480;"Every time I got hit, he just kind of went down."
21:16,480;21:18,960;"- I mean, he'd be like quite fresh of yards."
21:18,960;21:20,640;"- But-- - Oh yeah, he's great in space."
21:20,640;21:21,480;"He'd make people miss."
21:21,480;21:24,880;"He never seemed to like try to get that extra yard."
21:24,880;21:26,720;"- Yeah, I don't think that was style."
21:26,720;21:30,320;"couple of like third ones where they ran off the mail. He was like hit somebody and fell over."
21:30,320;21:34,480;"And that was it. So I don't know if it was like if you was dealing injury or what, but I mean,"
21:34,480;21:41,000;"he was kind of responsible for a lot of the mistakes on the Colts offense in this game."
21:41,000;21:43,120;"Like he had a rough game."
21:43,120;21:46,760;"I don't know. Peyton Manning threw some brutal interceptions."
21:46,760;21:55,040;"He did. And I think, I mean, this is a bill bell check defense going against the young"
21:55,040;22:02,960;"quarterback. Because let's see, Peyton Manning, how many years had he been in the league at this point?"
22:02,960;22:11,040;"Two or three? Yeah, but I mean, he was crushing it. Even in the year prior,"
22:11,040;22:17,200;"I mean, his first year was awash, but I mean, he was kind of evolving the offensive side of things"
22:18,000;22:24,120;"football wise. So I mean, yeah, he was young, but I mean, we got to give"
22:24,120;22:28,640;"Belichick credit for coming up with a game plan that he was sort of blowing"
22:28,640;22:35,360;"up other teams with. And yeah, sure, I mean, it, as he got more seasoned,"
22:35,360;22:40,560;"it was a little bit more of a chess match, but he still was a pretty"
22:40,560;22:42,240;"experienced guy at this point, I feel."
22:42,240;22:47,040;"Yeah, I mean, I've been looking at it now. His rookie year was 98. So this is"
22:47,040;22:53,000;"this fourth year in the league. Yeah, you'd thrown for his first year, you threw for 3700"
22:53,000;22:58,480;"yards and everything after that was at least 4000 yards. And in the two seasons prior to"
22:58,480;23:02,240;"this, you got 13 and three and then 10 and six. So I mean, they've been putting up numbers,"
23:02,240;23:09,680;"you've been throwing touchdowns and they were winning games. But still, he just looked lost"
23:09,680;23:13,680;"in this game. I mean, there were some mistakes that weren't necessarily his, like a couple"
23:13,680;23:17,600;"interceptions were bounced off of receivers hands, stuff like that. Like one of the ones"
23:17,600;23:23,600;"Edgar and James had a pass out of the backfield that he bobbled straight up into"
23:23,600;23:30,480;"with Roman Fife for his hands. God, so soft. So soft. And then the one where, even Edgar and James,"
23:30,480;23:37,120;"he caught a screen pass and then tried to switch the ball from one hand to another and just straight"
23:37,120;23:42,120;"dropped it. That's just soft."
23:42,120;23:50,040;"Well, and also, I mean, as we'll see as the season goes on, the way that they did play"
23:50,040;23:55,120;"defense, like Steve was talking about, they were like mauling wide receivers and that"
23:55,120;23:59,840;"was something that Peyton obviously couldn't adapt to and his receivers couldn't either."
23:59,840;24:04,400;"So it's sort of like, I think, a perfect storm for every part of that offense to kind"
24:04,400;24:05,880;"to be affected in one way or another."
24:05,880;24:10,440;"Yeah, I think the book is at that time match up really well with their"
24:10,440;24:11,960;"offenses to have a play."
24:11,960;24:13,480;"Hmm."
24:13,480;24:14,440;"Yeah."
24:14,440;24:17,760;"Yeah, they were very kind of big physical corners."
24:17,760;24:22,640;"Even Tai Law, who you don't really think of as a physical corner."
24:22,640;24:27,960;"Um, because of the time he played in was, I mean, you look at him play now and"
24:27,960;24:30,080;"he was all over people."
24:30,080;24:32,520;"I mean, to Bucky Jones closed on to do."
24:33,440;24:34,160;"Exactly."
24:34,160;24:38,960;"Let's see."
24:38,960;24:45,480;"I wanted to ask you about the so Gus Johnson and Brent Jones were the commentators"
24:45,480;24:49,920;"that you have any level of hatred towards those fellows."
24:49,920;24:54,080;"Gus Johnson was pretty dumb, but I like not."
24:54,080;24:57,200;"What's the best?"
24:57,200;25:00,160;"Yeah, no, so yeah, Brent Jones was kind of like whatever."
25:00,160;25:01,640;"I don't think he really knew he was talking about."
25:01,640;25:02,640;"No, Gus Jones is great."
25:03,080;25:04,880;"He can make anything sound exciting."
25:04,880;25:08,520;"Yeah, he's he's one of my all time favorites."
25:08,520;25:10,120;"Yeah, no Gus Johnson's great."
25:10,120;25:14,280;"He had the final four is is just music to my ears."
25:14,280;25:16,520;"From the parking lot."
25:16,520;25:21,000;"So routine from the parking lot."
25:21,000;25:22,440;"Exactly."
25:22,440;25:24,840;"But he's still with the cat much."
25:24,840;25:32,000;"But even this, you have a was the Irish road down pretty through a frozen rope."
25:32,000;25:33,000;"Yeah."
25:33,000;25:36,920;"It was like a 20 yard in."
25:36,920;25:37,920;"It was great."
25:37,920;25:42,000;"I mean, he hucked it, but he just gets so excited."
25:42,000;25:43,880;"I also liked how they were."
25:43,880;25:44,880;"He was."
25:44,880;25:45,880;"He was."
25:45,880;25:47,600;"He he bet Brent Johnson."
25:47,600;25:51,360;"He's like, I will carry a luggage for us a year if the Colts get shut out."
25:51,360;25:53,600;"A calf way through the third quarter."
25:53,600;25:57,080;"And then I had to stop and look at the score and be like, did they not?"
25:57,080;25:58,440;"I think I should have."
25:58,440;26:04,280;"And then they showed the shot of the leader of the Boston Symphony."
26:04,280;26:08,440;"And Frank goes, ""Oh, you like the Symphony Gus?"""
26:08,440;26:10,480;"And Gus is like, ""Nah, it's not my thing."""
26:10,480;26:12,120;"And then he's kind of moved on."
26:12,120;26:15,600;"Glad we brought that up, boys."
26:15,600;26:16,400;"All right."
26:16,400;26:23,440;"Yeah, before we get to the game, was there any other like, like non-football related"
26:23,440;26:25,320;"stuff that you guys noticed?"
26:25,320;26:26,520;"Because I had a couple of things."
26:27,320;26:29,920;"I noticed that Brady look goofy as hell."
26:29,920;26:31,920;"Oh, absolutely."
26:31,920;26:35,160;"And it's amazing how he could take a team and get everyone on board."
26:35,160;26:42,800;"And like, obviously, the way he is now, Mr. Model and, you know, pristine everything."
26:42,800;26:47,360;"And I feel like that sort of was that the most handsome man alive?"
26:47,360;26:49,040;"Yeah, pretty much that."
26:49,040;26:50,040;"Yeah."
26:50,040;26:52,960;"And I feel like that turned around like maybe like, oh, seven."
26:52,960;26:55,400;"So before that he was sort of like this regular guy."
26:55,400;27:00,280;"But that was just fun to kind of see this wide eyed kid who's a little dopey and like"
27:00,280;27:03,280;"goofy and he is he's such a goober."
27:03,280;27:10,680;"It's a little bit he's a he's a what is that like Andy Griffith character in Happy"
27:10,680;27:16,520;"Days whatever like Ron Howard was he reminds me of that kid."
27:16,520;27:20,440;"Opie I don't know."
27:20,440;27:22,320;"We didn't watch TV in the brown house growing up."
27:22,320;27:23,320;"It was just for."
27:23,320;27:24,320;"That's right."
27:24,320;27:25,320;"It was PBS, right?"
27:25,320;27:26,320;"Yeah."
27:26,320;27:27,320;"It was Mr. Rogers in football on Sundays."
27:27,320;27:28,320;"That was it."
27:28,320;27:29,560;"I don't think you need anything else."
27:29,560;27:30,560;"We couldn't even call it TV."
27:30,560;27:32,480;"We had to call it, you know what?"
27:32,480;27:33,480;"Oh, it's right."
27:33,480;27:37,280;"We're allowed to say the word TV because otherwise we wouldn't be allowed to get to"
27:37,280;27:38,280;"watch TV."
27:38,280;27:39,280;"Yeah."
27:39,280;27:40,280;"Especially."
27:40,280;27:42,680;"How did you guys deal with this?"
27:42,680;27:43,680;"I'm growing up."
27:43,680;27:44,680;"You know what?"
27:44,680;27:45,680;"Oh boy."
27:45,680;27:48,680;"Even that one works."
27:48,680;27:51,480;"jokes on you mom I'm addicted to Netflix."
27:51,480;27:54,080;"She did her best."
27:54,080;27:58,080;"I'm watching TV as we're doing this podcast right now."
27:58,080;27:59,080;"Good."
27:59,080;28:03,080;"Yeah, I definitely went through a phase where if a TV was on I couldn't not watch it."
28:03,080;28:05,080;"And that was a detriment."
28:05,080;28:07,080;"Oh, I can't follow things beyond."
28:07,080;28:08,080;"Oh, God."
28:08,080;28:09,080;"No."
28:09,080;28:12,080;"Did you guys notice the old school Tushion song?"
28:12,080;28:14,480;"That was one of the things I want to bring up."
28:14,480;28:15,480;"What was that?"
28:15,480;28:16,480;"Yeah."
28:16,480;28:17,480;"Hey."
28:17,480;28:22,260;"Hey, oh, yeah, yeah, I always like that one. Yeah. Yeah. I'm like, oh, why'd they get rid of it?"
28:22,260;28:24,260;"So I looked it up"
28:24,260;28:26,700;"It was written by Gary glitter who?"
28:26,700;28:35,700;"Turns out was convicted of downloading over four thousand pornographic images of children and sent to jail. Oh man"
28:35,700;28:38,900;"It was also tried to having sex with underage girl then in March"
28:38,900;28:43,620;"2006 glitter was convicted of molesting two girls age 11 and 12 in Vietnam and jail for three years"
28:43,620;28:46,460;"Wow, wait to bring it down. I know I know"
28:46,460;28:47,300;"- No."
28:47,300;28:49,640;"- As much as I like the song,"
28:49,640;28:54,400;"I kind of understand why they don't play that one anymore."
28:54,400;28:56,760;"- Yeah, give me crazy training, I'm good."
28:56,760;28:58,160;"- Yeah, but I love saying--"
28:58,160;29:00,000;"- Although, did you hear what happened"
29:00,000;29:02,040;"to Ozzy Osbourne recently?"
29:02,040;29:03,640;"- No, child porn?"
29:03,640;29:05,800;"- I don't know, I'm just throwing it up."
29:05,800;29:06,640;"- I feel like we're headed."
29:06,640;29:08,000;"(laughing)"
29:08,000;29:10,600;"I have no idea what's going on with Ozzy."
29:10,600;29:12,200;"- There's like truth to that."
29:12,200;29:15,360;"Like if you look up all those like hair metal guys"
29:15,360;29:20,360;"from the eighties almost all of them have like under age women rumors."
29:20,360;29:22,160;"Yeah, that sounds about right."
29:22,160;29:25,360;"I mean, they all dressed under seven."
29:25,360;29:29,280;"I hope they were, they were carting them."
29:29,280;29:31,480;"That's all I want. Oh, they definitely were."
29:31,480;29:33,080;"I'm sure they were checking IDs at the door."
29:33,080;29:36,800;"We're on track for a while there. Yeah, not really."
29:36,800;29:44,360;"The other thing that I do wish they kept was every time the page"
29:44,360;29:45,840;"Sean defense and it was third down."
29:45,840;29:47,840;"They had that like bell tolling."
29:47,840;29:49,640;"Oh, yeah."
29:49,640;29:55,120;"I know they have the whatever horn it is now, but that bell tolling is ominous as hell."
29:55,120;29:56,280;"You know why they stopped that?"
29:56,280;29:56,680;"Like you did."
29:56,680;29:58,920;"What is stopping like?"
29:58,920;30:08,640;"Because the guy that would ring that one thing he was caught doing things with the turtle and people were pretty upset about that."
30:08,640;30:10,280;"I don't know if you remember this or not."
30:10,280;30:12,000;"You're involved."
30:12,000;30:13,760;"Yes."
30:13,760;30:14,760;"I got the right to the Yes, you're in the future."
30:14,760;30:15,760;"You're in the future."
30:15,760;30:18,760;"No, you're I'm being serious guys."
30:18,760;30:26,760;"If you look it up Google it, just type in guy who control the fog horn for Foxboro"
30:26,760;30:30,760;"turtle and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about."
30:30,760;30:31,760;"All right."
30:31,760;30:34,760;"I'm working on a horse news to do that in Google."
30:34,760;30:35,760;"It shows up."
30:35,760;30:36,760;"It does."
30:36,760;30:51,940;"is it? No, I didn't. That's I don't like that. Great. It was. You made the lie up,"
30:51,940;31:02,920;"dude. I can't get for tonight. All right. So with that out of the way, let's talk about"
31:02,920;31:16,240;"the game itself, it was felt like it was over from the first quarter to me. And I kind of"
31:16,240;31:24,120;"forget what this feels like to be an underdog and take the lead in a game, because I couldn't"
31:24,120;31:31,200;"tell you the last time it happened, like recently. Because usually it's the other way around"
31:31,200;31:34,040;"where the Patriots are the favorite and it's an underdog beating them."
31:34,040;31:38,600;"And I know what that feels like because we had that was it last year against the Titans"
31:38,600;31:41,960;"where you kind of feel it in the first quarter."
31:41,960;31:43,400;"Like this isn't going to go well."
31:43,400;31:46,400;"If the Patriots win, it's going to be ugly and they don't deserve it."
31:46,400;31:50,080;"And the Titans just outplayed him."
31:50,080;31:52,200;"Yeah, me and Greg were there for that."
31:52,200;31:53,600;"Yeah, that's right."
31:53,600;31:56,000;"I was actually supposed to go to that game and I'm glad I didn't."
31:56,000;31:58,600;"Although at the very end, I'm glad you didn't too."
32:00,600;32:04,360;"At the very end, I was like in the fourth quarter, like five minutes left."
32:04,360;32:05,460;"I was like, Greg, let's leave."
32:05,460;32:06,520;"And he's like, Nope."
32:06,520;32:07,380;"Yeah."
32:07,380;32:09,200;"So you're like your licks, bro."
32:09,200;32:10,320;"That's right."
32:10,320;32:11,920;"True."
32:11,920;32:12,680;"Yeah."
32:12,680;32:13,500;"Yeah."
32:13,500;32:16,880;"And then the same year we woke them up in the playoffs."
32:16,880;32:18,440;"No, I didn't plan to play outside."
32:18,440;32:18,880;"You did we?"
32:18,880;32:19,440;"Yeah."
32:19,440;32:20,200;"This is last year."
32:20,200;32:20,640;"Yeah."
32:20,640;32:21,480;"This is this past year."
32:21,480;32:24,240;"But it was, it was all part of the journey."
32:24,240;32:25,640;"Yes."
32:25,640;32:30,360;"But like, yeah, I forgot what it feels like to be the underdog and take that"
32:30,360;32:36,840;"lead like into the into the first quarter because it was how's that pumpkin going Greg?"
32:36,840;32:43,000;"It sucks dude. Carbon pumpkin blows. It sounds like you're slurping on something."
32:43,000;32:46,520;"It's already coming all like shit I just gave up."
32:46,520;32:56,920;"Oh god. Not an artist. No I mean either. I'm gonna artist."
32:58,120;33:04,120;"No, you're not. But yeah, I mean, this game, like the past just came out and controlled it from the beginning. They had"
33:04,120;33:10,280;"was 103 rushing yards to the Colts 13 in the first quarter alone,"
33:10,280;33:17,960;"which was basically all Antoine Smith. Like that dude is an absolute monster."
33:17,960;33:22,040;"He reminds me of like a skinnier, legaret blunt."
33:22,040;33:23,160;"Yes."
33:24,520;33:26,040;"Like he"
33:26,040;33:31,080;"He's not the fastest guy. I mean, he was quick, but he wasn't like he wasn't gonna pull away from people"
33:31,080;33:35,240;"Like defensive backs if he's if he breaks off a run like they'll catch up to him"
33:35,240;33:37,960;"But he's gonna he's gonna make him earn that tackle"
33:37,960;33:40,920;"Well, he had a 70 yard run"
33:40,920;33:43,560;"Not in this game"
33:43,560;33:45,560;"pretty sure"
33:45,560;33:49,480;"It was like 30 or 40 yards, but yeah like in the first quarter that early one"
33:49,480;33:54,440;"I don't remember this is that man. Oh wait. Yeah, it was a it was a 39 yarder in the first quarter with"
33:54,440;33:56,400;"with a man, he stiff-armed guys."
33:56,400;33:58,080;"He was doing a sideline."
33:58,080;33:58,840;"Yeah, I remember that."
33:58,840;33:59,920;"That was awesome."
33:59,920;34:02,080;"Yeah, that stiff arm was dirty."
34:02,080;34:04,840;"And it was just very blunt to ask."
34:04,840;34:07,160;"OK, he's just-- he's like, well, I'm not going to run you,"
34:07,160;34:08,920;"but I mean, you're not going to attack on me either."
34:08,920;34:10,920;"So I'm just going to put my fist in your face"
34:10,920;34:13,160;"and we'll see what happens."
34:13,160;34:13,960;"And you have like what?"
34:13,960;34:18,520;"Like 90-plus yards and two touchdowns, I think?"
34:18,520;34:21,240;"Yeah, I think you went over 100 yards, isn't he?"
34:21,240;34:21,960;"Was he?"
34:21,960;34:22,440;"I don't know."
34:22,440;34:23,600;"I mean, he had a great game though."
34:23,600;34:25,680;"Oh, no, you're right."
34:25,680;34:26,600;"You had 94 yards."
34:26,600;34:27,720;"Wow."
34:27,720;34:28,240;"I'm surprising."
34:28,240;34:28,600;"Go over."
34:28,600;34:31,200;"It's called Chopra, Andy."
34:31,200;34:32,040;"Yeah."
34:32,040;34:37,960;"Well, I feel like between the four of us will all do like one"
34:37,960;34:40,520;"will eventually get in the right area."
34:40,520;34:42,960;"And we got there eventually, right?"
34:42,960;34:43,760;"That's good teamwork."
34:43,760;34:46,000;"Just like the Patriots off into the line."
34:46,000;34:46,720;"That's right."
34:46,720;34:48,800;"Oh, oh, and speaking of the offensive line, sorry."
34:48,800;34:50,080;"Um, that's a good point though."
34:50,080;34:52,280;"I was like, um, just looking at it."
34:52,320;34:53,640;"Like just watching the game."
34:53,640;34:58,920;"I'm like, it's amazing how many guys on the offensive line were mainstays for the team."
34:58,920;35:03,080;"Like just jotting down Matt, like Damien Woody, Joey and Druzy."
35:03,080;35:05,360;"So it was a pretty solid foundation."
35:05,360;35:06,120;"Yeah."
35:06,120;35:08,520;"And even Mike Compton was the, I mean, Oh, true."
35:08,520;35:08,880;"Yeah."
35:08,880;35:14,000;"It wasn't a long time, but he is he the only offensive lineman who war"
35:14,000;35:16,520;"advisor that was sick."
35:16,520;35:20,720;"I remember thinking that was like the coolest thing back in the day."
35:20,720;35:21,440;"I do not."
35:21,440;35:22,400;"Why do they not wear that?"
35:22,400;35:25,200;"Cause you probably get poking a fair amount down there in the trenches."
35:25,200;35:25,480;"Yeah."
35:25,480;35:25,720;"You would."
35:25,720;35:26,400;"You would play some shit."
35:26,400;35:26,900;"Yes."
35:26,900;35:31,640;"But, uh, I also noticed that I don't know if he did it in this game as much."
35:31,640;35:33,000;"Cause they didn't play the shotgun, but."
35:33,000;35:39,400;"I think there was an issue with Damien, Damien Woody's shotgun snap."
35:39,400;35:42,920;"So they were kind of switch positions."
35:42,920;35:48,320;"If the quarterback was in the shotgun and Compton would be the, the, the center"
35:48,320;35:49,800;"and would be snapping shotgun."
35:49,840;35:52,080;"Wow, that is detailed observation right there."
35:52,080;35:53,240;"I did not notice that."
35:53,240;35:53,640;"Yeah."
35:53,640;35:57,640;"So you're talking about something that's like, I know, right?"
35:57,640;36:00,240;"You say that, but I actually noticed it in the Jets game,"
36:00,240;36:01,040;"and I forgot to mention it."
36:01,040;36:03,960;"So damn."
36:03,960;36:05,720;"Much in the all 22s."
36:05,720;36:06,440;"Oh, yeah."
36:06,440;36:07,520;"I don't think they had those back then."
36:07,520;36:09,080;"But yeah, damn right."
36:09,080;36:11,160;"And I think eventually they'll talk about it"
36:11,160;36:14,840;"because I feel like it comes up like in the playoffs."
36:14,840;36:19,640;"Well, speaking of equipment, Brian Cox's,"
36:19,640;36:23,540;"whatever that thing is on the back of his neck is still the best thing in the world."
36:23,540;36:28,100;"I want to call a neck roll, but it extends above his helmet."
36:28,100;36:30,200;"So at that point, I think it's a role anymore."
36:30,200;36:30,920;"It's like a plank."
36:30,920;36:31,920;"Yeah."
36:31,920;36:35,960;"And I don't know why it looks so intimidating, but that is the best thing in the world."
36:35,960;36:37,040;"It's great."
36:37,040;36:41,040;"It looks like he ripped out the headrest of his car."
36:41,040;36:43,320;"He's stuck it down the back of his shirt."
36:43,320;36:45,440;"I don't see that very often nowadays."
36:45,440;36:49,480;"I mean, it probably like constricts you pretty well, but, and it's probably due to an"
36:49,480;36:53,320;"injury or something coming to think of it, but still a pretty bad ass."
36:53,320;36:54,920;"I mean, he wore it a lot."
36:54,920;36:56,240;"Cause that's why, uh,"
36:56,240;36:59,040;"Leighton van der Ash wears it."
36:59,040;37:00,160;"Cause he had a neck injury."
37:00,160;37:00,760;"I'm pretty sure."
37:00,760;37:01,640;"Hmm."
37:01,640;37:03,120;"After the Cowboys."
37:03,120;37:06,720;"Well, I think the main piece of it is the intimidation factor."
37:06,720;37:08,240;"Definitely helps."
37:08,240;37:10,280;"Cause a lot of the fullbacks wear them still."
37:10,280;37:13,400;"Like, um, James Devlin."
37:13,400;37:15,960;"Oh, he has that like big role."
37:15,960;37:16,560;"Yeah."
37:16,560;37:19,360;"It's not a, it's not as pronounced, but he's definitely got"
37:19,360;37:21,200;"that role. Yeah."
37:21,200;37:25,280;"So I think it's basically if you're leaning with your head into people,"
37:25,280;37:29,600;"which are basically fullbacks and run stuffing linebackers."
37:29,600;37:34,040;"It's usually what, uh, what happened to those guys though,"
37:34,040;37:36,840;"like remember like John Randall and the Vikings were you to like wear like"
37:36,840;37:38,920;"war paint on his face. Yeah."
37:38,920;37:43,000;"I feel like that that's missing. Now it is. Yeah."
37:43,000;37:45,360;"And that that's kind of that was one of my points over."
37:45,360;37:51,800;"like has there ever been a more psychotic linebacker core than Brian Cox and Teddy"
37:51,800;37:52,800;"Bruceky in the middle?"
37:52,800;37:54,880;"Yeah, that's, that's insane."
37:54,880;38:00,080;"Those two, like it just looks like they want to hit anything."
38:00,080;38:01,200;"Like it doesn't even have to be a person."
38:01,200;38:05,520;"I feel like they just like come out at the beginning, like before the game"
38:05,520;38:07,760;"and just start like running into the goalposts to warm up."
38:07,760;38:09,000;"I don't know."
38:09,000;38:12,040;"Psychotic, you could just like Vontay is perfect than anybody else."
38:12,040;38:14,640;"That's true."
38:14,800;38:18,640;"That's iconic. That's just work. Yeah. Yeah."
38:18,640;38:21,000;"I mean, this iconic. I don't know. I'm sure."
38:21,000;38:21,400;"No, I'm not."
38:21,400;38:22,760;"You was on that list."
38:22,760;38:27,080;"I feel like that guy pretty much created the present day Antonio Brown."
38:27,080;38:33,000;"Yeah, suppose. Remember that game that he like laid him out and he was unconscious for like three weeks."
38:33,000;38:35,880;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. In the playoffs. Yeah."
38:35,880;38:40,120;"I feel like Antonio Brown is slightly different since that day."
38:40,120;38:43,640;"He's never recovered. I think you're right. Yeah. That was brutal."
38:43,840;38:46,540;"Remember what a mom wrote that letter to the NFL."
38:46,540;38:48,040;"Did she?"
38:48,040;38:49,480;"Yes."
38:49,480;38:50,640;"I don't remember that."
38:50,640;38:53,300;"Um, it was a"
38:53,300;38:57,480;"it was the dolphins pull off game against the Steelers."
38:57,480;39:01,320;"Oh, back up quarterback."
39:01,320;39:01,920;"I think it was."
39:01,920;39:02,820;"It wasn't Tana Hill."
39:02,820;39:03,800;"It was like Matt Moore."
39:03,800;39:04,680;"Yeah."
39:04,680;39:08,680;"He was just like sliding and just got like blown up."
39:08,680;39:09,560;"Yeah."
39:09,560;39:12,520;"No, he was rolling out and he threw the ball away."
39:12,640;39:16,320;"Yeah, and took his fuck do pre. Yeah, took a helmet right."
39:16,320;39:17,920;"Kind of feelers. Yeah."
39:17,920;39:21,640;"Dude, mom, I was watching that game of mom."
39:21,640;39:25,080;"She legitimately sent an email to the NFL."
39:25,080;39:29,080;"Because I was also going to explain."
39:29,080;39:32,520;"Yeah, I explained the rule in college where you can review those things."
39:32,520;39:35,080;"And she's like, they need that in the fucking NFL."
39:35,080;39:37,080;"She's emailing."
39:37,080;39:39,200;"Your mom's awesome."
39:39,200;39:41,360;"Like, I remember like being at some game."
39:41,360;39:46,200;"I don't know if it was soccer game or whatever, but everyone was"
39:46,200;39:49,760;"booing and she was disgusted and yelling at everybody for having like"
39:49,760;39:50,660;"no class."
39:50,660;39:52,120;"And I thought that was pretty awesome."
39:52,120;39:54,000;"Yeah, that's that's our mother."
39:54,000;40:01,120;"Yeah, I feel like we should kind of touch on her because I think she"
40:01,120;40:06,160;"is the reason we're into football, which is unusual, especially since I"
40:06,160;40:11,040;"don't think most listeners know that she, her and dad were both born and"
40:11,040;40:16,960;"raised in England and move here when they were like 30 late 20s early 30s."
40:16,960;40:18,640;"No, it's early in that."
40:18,640;40:26,080;"It was like, uh, yeah, it was probably mid to late 20s because I was born when they were 27."
40:26,080;40:29,360;"So also, Andy, you said most listeners, we have no listeners."
40:29,360;40:33,600;"Well, we'll say, well, actually, yeah, our listeners mom anyway, so we'll talk about her."
40:33,600;40:33,960;"Yeah."
40:33,960;40:34,200;"Right."
40:34,200;40:35,440;"No, that's hurt."
40:37,720;40:51,680;"Yeah, but she the story that I was told, and I think we'll probably have to have her on to explain this in more detail, but she because dad came over for a job. So he had a green card to work and stuff, but she didn't. She just came over because she was married to him."
40:51,680;40:55,800;"So she couldn't get a job over here. So she's kind of sitting around doing nothing."
40:55,800;41:06,760;"And so she decided to learn about football. So she was watching it. But obviously, if you've come from a country that doesn't have football, you try to just like cold get into it. You have no idea what's going on."
41:07,440;41:14,840;"So what she would do is she would write down questions she would have about the game, like, you know, what's the first down or, you know, what is off sides."
41:14,840;41:23,160;"And she would send it to work with dad who would then take this piece of paper that his wife had written football questions on and give them to coworkers, American coworkers."
41:23,160;41:29,840;"And they would write down the answers for him or explain them to him and he would come back and report, you know, what off size was"
41:29,840;41:33,640;"Did your mom kind of invent Google?"
41:36,440;41:38,080;"That's what that was. That's cool."
41:38,080;41:39,040;"That's yeah."
41:39,040;41:40,840;"That's amazing."
41:40,840;41:42,600;"It's like an ass."
41:42,600;41:43,320;"Jeez, right?"
41:43,320;41:44,320;"Yeah."
41:44,320;41:47,080;"But I think it was ass ass and Mick."
41:47,080;41:47,880;"Yeah."
41:47,880;41:50,640;"So there should have been which is big about it."
41:50,640;41:53,840;"When she was like watching all the sports, like Holly and the Boston"
41:53,840;41:54,800;"teams are sick."
41:54,800;41:56,520;"The Bruins bad ass."
41:56,520;41:58,880;"The Celtics are winning like championships every year."
41:58,880;42:01,880;"That's also really good then, too."
42:01,880;42:04,240;"And the Patriots crash."
42:04,240;42:06,000;"Yeah, but that was always her thing is"
42:06,000;42:11,840;"even in England, she would always pick the shittiest soccer team to root for because she's just"
42:11,840;42:16,320;"loved the underdog. So coming here, like the Patriots fit perfectly because this was like the"
42:16,320;42:21,360;"Rod Rusted era when they're going 1 in 15 and coaches were getting electrocuted at the podium."
42:21,360;42:25,200;"So to shoot sounds like Greg moving to Raleigh and being an NC State fan."
42:25,200;42:31,760;"And same I do. Why she used to go to your soccer games in high school, Andy?"
42:31,760;42:35,920;"That's true. Yeah. We don't have any of those. She never came in last"
42:35,920;42:46,560;"games you didn't play. 14 in the country baby undefeated right my my soccer team I don't think so."
42:46,560;42:49,920;"I was on a soccer team and I don't think I played much either."
42:49,920;42:58,920;"Right. No. No. No you didn't last a long. We did play one year of football though that didn't last long either."
42:58,920;43:03,920;"Now my my parents pulled me out for four grades."
43:03,920;43:05,020;"Oh, that's right."
43:05,020;43:06,220;"Yeah, for academic reasons."
43:06,220;43:07,520;"Yeah, that's a shame."
43:07,520;43:12,220;"I think we'll you credit the end, Mike."
43:12,220;43:13,420;"I know, man."
43:13,420;43:15,320;"I remember some scrimmage."
43:15,320;43:16,720;"I almost got a sack."
43:16,720;43:17,920;"So that was pretty cool."
43:17,920;43:20,320;"I don't know what I was doing playing linebacker, but hey."
43:20,320;43:26,120;"I remember being scout team wide receiver and getting lit the fuck up."
43:26,120;43:27,820;"Brian Cox style."
43:27,820;43:34,680;"That those guys I mean football is fun to play and all but when you're like I feel like we're undersized"
43:34,680;43:41,520;"So I kind of empathize with like these David patents of the world and they really love to like light you up. I think oh"
43:41,520;43:43,800;"yeah, I"
43:43,800;43:48,840;"Remember I was I mean my helmet was too tight my my pants didn't quite fit"
43:48,840;43:55,660;"It was a disaster, but I think that was the most pain overall over the course of several months"
43:55,660;43:58,220;"I've ever been in. So props to these guys."
43:58,220;44:00,260;"Yeah, I would agree. I don't know how they do it."
44:00,260;44:03,860;"Me neither. Yeah. Now I would dominate."
44:03,860;44:06,980;"Oh, absolutely. Yeah. Now I don't feel pain."
44:06,980;44:09,540;"Right. I'm dead inside. It's beautiful."
44:09,540;44:11,980;"I put on some weight. So I'm ready to go."
44:11,980;44:18,220;"This is true. I've also put on weight, but not in a good way."
44:18,220;44:21,060;"So speaking of football, right?"
44:21,060;44:24,060;"I like how you track for like two minutes."
44:24,060;44:25,060;"It has good work."
44:25,340;44:26,340;"Yeah, we'll kill it."
44:26,340;44:29,780;"Let's see."
44:29,780;44:31,140;"We're talking about Antoine Smith."
44:31,140;44:36,940;"He was kind of the driver in the offense."
44:36,940;44:39,940;"And we talked about Brian Cox, who was the driver of the defense."
44:39,940;44:46,780;"And he was actually, he was the lead blocker on the last Patriots rushing touchdown as well,"
44:46,780;44:48,540;"which is pretty cool."
44:48,540;44:53,460;"So he was, I think he probably got the bell check game ball in this game."
44:53,820;44:54,940;"That was a physical win."
44:54,940;44:55,620;"Right."
44:55,620;45:00,300;"It was a it was it was like one of those, like how you remember the pages beating the Colts."
45:00,300;45:01,500;"Yeah."
45:01,500;45:08,940;"I mean, you look at the score and there was like a lot of points, but that team, the offense and the defense were just knocking people around."
45:08,940;45:09,660;"Yeah."
45:09,660;45:10,620;"Kind of miss it."
45:10,620;45:11,980;"Oh, yeah."
45:11,980;45:13,860;"I mean, but obviously these guys."
45:13,860;45:19,140;"Yeah, but they, I don't think they lasted as long either or maybe they did."
45:19,140;45:20,420;"And now they're all just a little."
45:20,420;45:21,540;"Yeah."
45:21,980;45:27,260;"It was longer than I fella, but meal brains not in life. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, like you Milo. Oh"
45:27,260;45:33,580;"Man, I I suffered a beating. I'm telling you my home. It was two sizes too small"
45:33,580;45:38,940;"I had like black and blue ears just by putting the helmet on my was too big. Okay, you sound like"
45:38,940;45:42,140;"Brown"
45:42,140;45:48,780;"Hey, Andy was there through it. Okay. They didn't have anything else. All right. I was like I was like third string like full back"
45:49,180;45:50,940;"Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Me too."
45:50,940;45:52,340;"They didn't care about me."
45:52,340;45:55,060;"And I was I was six to 150 pounds."
45:55,060;45:56,620;"I had me at running back."
45:56,620;45:58,660;"Get mad at it."
45:58,660;45:59,180;"What the hell?"
45:59,180;46:00,820;"I have the full."
46:00,820;46:01,740;"We got the drags."
46:01,740;46:03,780;"We got the drags of the equipment."
46:03,780;46:06,260;"Yeah, man. I just remember."
46:06,260;46:07,620;"I might have not even been 100 pounds."
46:07,620;46:08,820;"And I'm full back."
46:08,820;46:10,260;"Kind of coach was running this thing."
46:10,260;46:13,500;"You coach."
46:13,500;46:16,060;"Oh, it was did."
46:16,060;46:17,020;"Well, he was varsity."
46:17,020;46:18,100;"We were in on varsity."
46:18,100;46:18,660;"We were."
46:18,660;46:22,660;"Yeah, it was just the freshman team. That's right. He was in the vicinity."
46:22,660;46:27,220;"Was that who it was? Oh, I know. I think."
46:27,220;46:34,660;"And then there was some marine guy that was there. Oh, yeah. Whatever."
46:34,660;46:39,220;"Like I figured the kids in. I don't know. You're something like that. Yeah."
46:39,220;46:41,140;"I don't know. Do you ask me what role he's?"
46:41,140;46:45,700;"I don't think we did because I made friends with all the seniors. So."
46:46,580;46:52,820;"Oh, yeah, I'm not a watch out managed to bypass all that but we may have seen some hazing back in the day. Yeah"
46:52,820;46:58,900;"Yeah, a lot of what a lot of lot of lot of lot of petals. Yes. Yeah"
46:58,900;47:01,460;"Yeah"
47:01,460;47:08,020;"Everywhere to go to the restroom. You go to the restroom people taking crafts with like the stalls, you know wide open"
47:08,020;47:13,300;"Um, I think we were afraid to take showers. I pretty much washed up in the lake nearby"
47:14,100;47:20,660;"When we went to camp I mean yeah, oh I didn't share that whole that whole camp. I just fuck it. There's no shower"
47:20,660;47:31,460;"You don't want to be a freshman in those showers"
47:31,460;47:35,940;"Dude, I've been a freshman in showers. It's not that bro"
47:35,940;47:39,860;"These are different there are different animal. I don't know if they exist now it is"
47:40,740;47:43,580;"You just strut in there, dick hang, and you'll be fine."
47:43,580;47:45,180;"My dick was not hanging."
47:45,180;47:48,980;"It was not the way I was talking."
47:48,980;47:55,140;"Like I said, I had to put makeup on my ears so they wouldn't laugh at like my"
47:55,140;47:56,220;"bruised ears from."
47:56,220;48:01,860;"At different time."
48:01,860;48:02,620;"Yeah."
48:02,620;48:06,580;"And seeing dick is one thing, but like having a touch in you is something else."
48:06,580;48:07,460;"Whoa."
48:07,460;48:09,140;"Like was naked and self-look feminine."
48:09,180;48:10,940;"Just just right on your shoulders."
48:10,940;48:12,300;"What what happened?"
48:12,300;48:13,020;"Andy?"
48:13,020;48:14,140;"Well, what was it else?"
48:14,140;48:15,220;"But didn't."
48:15,220;48:15,780;"Oh, yeah."
48:15,780;48:16,220;"Yeah."
48:16,220;48:16,780;"No, yeah."
48:16,780;48:20,500;"There's I don't know if we should be talking about this, but no, this is this."
48:20,500;48:20,780;"You know what?"
48:20,780;48:21,860;"This should come to light."
48:21,860;48:23,660;"No, you cannot cut this."
48:23,660;48:28,860;"This is to be stated that some crazy shit was going down and we were we were"
48:28,860;48:30,740;"silenced and we let it happen."
48:30,740;48:31,140;"OK."
48:31,140;48:33,180;"So do you do you want to describe the helicopter?"
48:33,180;48:33,740;"Should I?"
48:33,740;48:35,980;"You can go for it, but I can vote for it."
48:35,980;48:37,420;"You're you're not talking about it."
48:37,420;48:37,820;"Sorry."
48:37,820;48:38,380;"Yeah."
48:38,540;48:40,140;"No, I don't think it is."
48:40,140;48:42,540;"We won't say his name, but there's a gentleman."
48:42,540;48:43,940;"I don't remember saying what I blocked it."
48:43,940;48:45,100;"All right, well, there you go."
48:45,100;48:47,620;"There's a gentleman who can do things with his balls"
48:47,620;48:51,380;"that I've never seen since then or heard of."
48:51,380;48:52,140;"Yeah."
48:52,140;48:56,020;"Yeah, he was able to twist them around the shaft multiple times."
48:56,020;48:58,100;"And they get spin like a helicopter."
48:58,100;48:58,740;"Yeah."
48:58,740;49:01,740;"And then he would release it and it would kind of rotate"
49:01,740;49:04,100;"as if it were trying to take off from his body."
49:04,100;49:07,740;"It was oddly hypnotic, I have to say."
49:07,740;49:11,180;"He would also sort of place his car."
49:11,180;49:14,540;"Well, yeah, that too, but we won't talk about that."
49:14,540;49:19,020;"He would take out his member and gently place it"
49:19,020;49:21,600;"in front of sleeping guys' faces"
49:21,600;49:23,460;"and then gently wake them up"
49:23,460;49:25,940;"so they woke up with wiener in their face."
49:25,940;49:28,100;"I believe this is called sexual harassment, guys."
49:28,100;49:28,940;"- I think so."
49:28,940;49:30,600;"- That's just boys being boys."
49:30,600;49:32,700;"(laughing)"
49:32,700;49:34,540;"But somehow, Andy and I--"
49:34,540;49:37,460;"- Love how on top of we've been this whole time."
49:37,460;49:39,540;"Yeah, football."
49:39,540;49:41,060;"This is a little say."
49:41,060;49:42,060;"Somehow."
49:42,060;49:45,340;"And I avoided to avoid it."
49:45,340;49:45,860;"Most of that."
49:45,860;49:47,780;"I don't know how, but I don't need it."
49:47,780;49:51,420;"Well, I avoided because I was friends with you and you somehow were like"
49:51,420;49:53,780;"that infiltrated right."
49:53,780;49:58,420;"The pet of all the senior offensive lineman."
49:58,420;50:01,460;"Yeah, it's a way they like they protected me."
50:01,460;50:05,260;"And then they kind of let me like, I remember one time being woken up and"
50:05,260;50:08,620;"everybody was wearing just underwear and their helmets."
50:08,620;50:12,220;"And they're like, Hey, Milo, it's a let's go bang on everybody's cabin door."
50:12,220;50:13,220;"And I thought this was insane."
50:13,220;50:14,020;"Now it's sleeping."
50:14,020;50:17,980;"So most people were forced to do it, but I was like, Nah, you"
50:17,980;50:20,220;"bind if I said this one out and they were cool with it."
50:20,220;50:21,220;"So I have no idea."
50:21,220;50:23,220;"I did not partake for the record."
50:23,220;50:26,940;"I was now part of the sexual harassment of Andy Brown or anybody else."
50:26,940;50:27,540;"Nope."
50:27,540;50:29,540;"This is true."
50:29,540;50:30,380;"I'll vouch for that."
50:30,380;50:32,420;"But this is where he got his nickname from."
50:32,420;50:33,940;"This is where Milo came from."
50:33,940;50:34,860;"That's true."
50:34,860;50:46,860;"So I can keep all kale because I was selected to do the Matthew Slater where I would have to do like the speech, you know, because they thought it was funny like this hundred five pound kid."
50:46,860;50:50,860;"It would have them like do the raw rod thing. So as I was doing it."
50:50,860;51:02,860;"Some guy, the team captain got my name wrong and he thought it was hilarious. So nobody knew who I was before. And then I became known as a guy for my mispronouncing name."
51:02,860;51:04,300;"So it was fantastic."
51:04,300;51:06,140;"He was Milo from then on."
51:06,140;51:09,580;"They, they, you know, I was friends with those guys."
51:09,580;51:11,500;"They, they were great."
51:11,500;51:12,860;"I bet you were."
51:12,860;51:13,540;"Yeah."
51:13,540;51:15,020;"All right."
51:15,020;51:16,540;"Anyway, it's moving on."
51:16,540;51:20,740;"Speaking of decks, how about the cold kicker, Mike Van der"
51:20,740;51:21,100;"jerk?"
51:21,100;51:23,140;"That guy's a dick."
51:23,140;51:25,580;"He's pretty good though."
51:25,580;51:27,540;"Um, what do you sober?"
51:27,540;51:27,820;"Yeah."
51:27,820;51:31,020;"Well, even when he was at, can you imagine kicking a little"
51:31,020;51:32,340;"smashed?"
51:32,660;51:35,160;"Uh, yeah, that would be tougher."
51:35,160;51:37,760;"Not exactly performance enhancing is that although it probably"
51:37,760;51:39,320;"common the nurse depending on how many you had."
51:39,320;51:40,420;"Oh, true."
51:40,420;51:40,960;"True."
51:40,960;51:41,220;"So."
51:41,220;51:44,120;"I mean, it's like golf, right?"
51:44,120;51:45,140;"A little swing oil."
51:45,140;51:46,460;"Yeah, exactly."
51:46,460;51:48,040;"Just a little liquid courage."
51:48,040;51:49,060;"Yeah."
51:49,060;51:51,720;"They want those nerves, Janglin."
51:51,720;51:58,020;"Uh, speaking of kickers though, I don't know why, but again, third week in a row, I've"
51:58,020;52:01,180;"have a Lee Johnson's name down with a big star next to it."
52:01,180;52:05,100;"So I thought the punting in this game wasn't that great."
52:05,100;52:06,100;"All right."
52:06,100;52:08,100;"The kicking in the end zone by like 10 yards."
52:08,100;52:13,140;"Yeah, the Colts puncher is kicking it literally out of the back of the end zone on a punt."
52:13,140;52:17,340;"Like I know it was windy, but like, come on, dude, you play for the Colts."
52:17,340;52:21,700;"They don't punt from their own side of the field ever."
52:21,700;52:23,940;"Like you should learn how to drop it inside the 20."
52:23,940;52:25,940;"I would think I'm winning."
52:25,940;52:29,380;"I don't want to spoil my best off the game, but I'm gonna alright"
52:29,380;52:35,020;"Right, okay, I'll first Mike Bribble appearance"
52:35,020;52:37,780;"Yeah, oh, that's right now"
52:37,780;52:44,300;"That was good some might say that's the first connection of braiding and fribble"
52:44,300;52:51,220;"Which the rumors have stated that if he leaves New England you could join Vribble in Tennessee"
52:51,220;52:53,940;"Well, all right 20 years later, baby"
52:53,940;52:56,820;"I don't I heard you like country music too."
52:56,820;52:59,900;"Five or eight or Brady."
52:59,900;53:00,660;"Oh Brady."
53:00,660;53:01,740;"What?"
53:01,740;53:02,740;"Yeah."
53:02,740;53:03,700;"You like you like."
53:03,700;53:05,140;"Yeah."
53:05,140;53:08,700;"Tennessee going to Nashville."
53:08,700;53:09,780;"I mean, it makes sense."
53:09,780;53:13,780;"I don't feel I don't feel that you should you should write that up, Greg,"
53:13,780;53:16,980;"and get that out there because if you don't chef or will"
53:16,980;53:20,260;"just email Felger."
53:22,420;53:23,940;"Oh, I feel like there's all the fuck over it."
53:23,940;53:25,780;"I really, I promise you that."
53:25,780;53:31,140;"So Greg, I'm a little disappointed in you that you haven't actually brought up"
53:31,140;53:31,780;"Tyler yet."
53:31,780;53:34,060;"Oh man, he's an absolute stud."
53:34,060;53:36,860;"That's better."
53:36,860;53:39,340;"He shot Marvin Harrison."
53:39,340;53:40,660;"They were like, talk, they gave his numbers."
53:40,660;53:44,060;"Like all those times he played the path before like six touchdowns and five"
53:44,060;53:44,860;"games or something."
53:44,860;53:48,020;"Ty lost steps in and just bully balls."
53:48,020;53:50,980;"You know, just shoving around the field doing"
53:50,980;53:55,620;"whatever he wanted with him. He really was. He's the best athlete in the second"
53:55,620;54:01,780;"during the path to every scene. You think so? Yeah. From like size, speed,"
54:01,780;54:07,860;"ball skills. He wasn't surprisingly. He was a good guy. Yeah. Some might say"
54:07,860;54:15,100;"he's in the hall of fame. That's true. Some could say that. Yeah. Even Otis was"
54:15,100;54:20,260;"pretty good. Yeah. Oh, TIS, baby. Although who on get his"
54:20,260;54:25,420;"Otis was end of the second quarter, the culture driving for a"
54:25,420;54:31,340;"score. And then, uh, painting through a pick to Otis Smith."
54:31,340;54:36,780;"Well, seven, eight hours. Oh my God. That could return. That's"
54:36,780;54:42,820;"moments. But who threw the, uh, the block to get Otis Smith"
54:42,820;54:44,940;"actually around the corner and into the end zone."
54:44,940;54:46,740;"Die law."
54:46,740;54:47,500;"That's right."
54:47,500;54:49,100;"The lead blocker."
54:49,100;54:50,580;"That's right."
54:50,580;54:54,420;"And then Peyton Manning getting thrown out of the club by Anthony"
54:54,420;54:56,860;"Pleasant or some defensive lineman."
54:56,860;54:59,260;"On the replay."
54:59,260;55:00,700;"They try to put the meaning."
55:00,700;55:04,180;"So we haven't even talked about that."
55:04,180;55:06,860;"Hey, dude, it's so good to see it again."
55:06,860;55:07,940;"Oh, man, I wrote that."
55:07,940;55:08,340;"Yeah."
55:08,340;55:10,900;"At least eight different times in that game."
55:11,540;55:13,200;"So many times it's so"
55:13,200;55:17,860;"where you're like, you'll throw someone like a tough pass and they won't catch it."
55:17,860;55:21,500;"And then you'll, you'll just look at him with this like mopey look on his."
55:21,500;55:23,460;"It's so perfect."
55:23,460;55:25,860;"And just kind of throws hands up."
55:25,860;55:27,900;"What are you doing?"
55:27,900;55:28,660;"Yeah."
55:28,660;55:30,500;"It's like, dude, he's a bad throw."
55:30,500;55:34,020;"It was beautiful."
55:34,020;55:38,340;"Although I have to say, I forgot how obnoxious Manning was pre snap."
55:39,100;55:49,000;"And it gave me flashbacks to playing Madden back in the day, where they had like programmed that in that he would just make audibles until the clock ran out and then he would hike the ball."
55:49,000;55:52,180;"And you're sitting there waiting like, I just just hiked the ball."
55:52,180;55:53,100;"We know what's happening here."
55:53,100;55:54,540;"I have this game on easy."
55:54,540;55:57,860;"I'm going to sack you on this play because that's why I have it on easy."
55:57,860;56:00,660;"So just fucking get over it and like call a play."
56:00,660;56:02,620;"Yeah, he was the worst."
56:02,620;56:07,980;"He, uh, it was fun to watch, but it's hard to like the guy."
56:08,980;56:13,240;"I started liking him as soon as he started making commercials."
56:13,240;56:15,100;"So he started chatting like a man."
56:15,100;56:16,600;"Yeah."
56:16,600;56:19,240;"He's got like a little YouTube series."
56:19,240;56:20,380;"So have any of you watched it?"
56:20,380;56:22,280;"No."
56:22,280;56:23,980;"Oh, is that in the clips?"
56:23,980;56:27,660;"Where you like breaks down stuff or something?"
56:27,660;56:34,240;"Yeah, because he did one on Brady's overtime drive against the chiefs and the playoffs last year."
56:34,240;56:36,160;"And it's actually really good because obviously."
56:36,160;56:37,540;"Oh, you're talking about that thing."
56:37,540;56:38,260;"Yeah."
56:38,340;56:39,820;"Because he's got a show now too."
56:39,820;56:40,580;"Really?"
56:40,580;56:43,980;"I thought that was a comedy show thing."
56:43,980;56:44,700;"Oh, really?"
56:44,700;56:47,300;"Yeah, where he goes around like interviewing"
56:47,300;56:49,460;"like famous players like Franco Harrison,"
56:49,460;56:50,460;"shit."
56:50,460;56:52,540;"Are you sure that's not a state farm commercial?"
56:52,540;56:55,180;"Well, it's fun to be."
56:55,180;56:56,300;"It could be sponsored by state."
56:56,300;56:58,300;"I can only start doing commercials."
56:58,300;57:00,140;"So like what his third year in the league."
57:00,140;57:01,100;"Right."
57:01,100;57:02,620;"I went over and did cut that meat."
57:02,620;57:04,620;"Oh, I know."
57:04,620;57:07,540;"Um, I know one of the guys in that commercial."
57:07,620;57:10,060;"He got to share some screen time with"
57:10,060;57:12,260;"pigman. I think he was the guy that was"
57:12,260;57:14,220;"asking him to sign the loaf of bread."
57:14,220;57:19,220;"You get screen credit for that?"
57:19,220;57:22,340;"I don't think so, but he probably got a good chunk of change."
57:22,340;57:24,900;"All right. All right. What's it? What's he doing now? He's"
57:24,900;57:26,780;"a lot of that was obviously like a stepping stone to start him,"
57:26,780;57:30,940;"right? He is doing some fun. His name is Jesse Gavin."
57:30,940;57:35,060;"He's doing some great videos online. He's also a successful"
57:35,060;57:37,100;"commercial actor. So shout out to Jesse Gavin."
57:37,460;57:42,220;"I actually recognize that name probably from you. I would imagine I was the guy that you banged Mike"
57:42,220;57:44,300;"Yeah, would you think that I"
57:44,300;57:49,260;"Would you have sex with a mic?"
57:49,260;57:50,820;"what I"
57:50,820;57:58,140;"Or this is not the same guy that like hook up of Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers. He's two separate people"
57:58,140;58:01,020;"Yeah, yeah, sure there. Yeah, understand"
58:01,500;58:09,560;"Well, yeah, I still like no he's been this second this day at age guys. I mean come on really come on you better than that"
58:09,560;58:17,800;"I think my girlfriend has got home, so she's not gonna like any of this so hush hush"
58:17,800;58:23,780;"Would you bang her?"
58:26,780;58:27,620;"You know, I don't want to."
58:27,620;58:28,460;"- Which beg me, mommy."
58:28,460;58:31,340;"- I don't want to hear dirty laundry,"
58:31,340;58:34,180;"but you Greg, you kind of look like Tom Brady."
58:34,180;58:35,700;"I'm not gonna lie, so."
58:35,700;58:37,620;"- My mom says it all the time."
58:37,620;58:38,460;"- Yeah."
58:38,460;58:41,300;"- So, she says it's all of us, Greg."
58:41,300;58:42,140;"- No."
58:42,140;58:43,780;"- She doesn't say it to me."
58:43,780;58:45,820;"(laughs)"
58:45,820;58:47,220;"Sorry, Steve."
58:47,220;58:48,820;"- Last thing I'll say on paid manning though,"
58:48,820;58:53,820;"is I did love how he sort of managed to bypass"
58:54,700;58:59,280;"whole HGA thing. And we never hear about it again. So kudos to him for"
58:59,280;59:03,960;"shucking the system. Yeah. Why you think he did it?"
59:03,960;59:08,560;"All right. His wife seems like she could be on HGA. I mean, I don't know. It seems"
59:08,560;59:13,040;"like a plausible story to me, right? No, no, I have a strong opinion on this."
59:13,040;59:17,960;"Okay. We can't call witch hunt for breeding the flake gate and then turn"
59:17,960;59:21,040;"around and witch hunt Manning. Okay."
59:21,240;59:23,080;"Alberism at its finest."
59:23,080;59:23,820;"All right."
59:23,820;59:24,720;"Consistent."
59:24,720;59:27,540;"Do you realize what podcast this is?"
59:27,540;59:28,280;"Yeah."
59:28,280;59:30,360;"That's what I'm trying to add."
59:30,360;59:32,200;"Some bounce."
59:32,200;59:34,080;"Oh, we'll get to the flake game, man."
59:34,080;59:35,640;"I mean, Brady is guilty."
59:35,640;59:36,240;"Oh, yeah."
59:36,240;59:37,840;"Don't get started on that shit."
59:37,840;59:39,440;"Oh, God."
59:39,440;59:41,560;"It destroyed his phone, Mike."
59:41,560;59:43,200;"Yeah."
59:43,200;59:43,720;"You don't do that."
59:43,720;59:48,880;"Evidence number one out of 352 and we'll go over every one of them."
59:50,480;59:51,320;"We could do that."
59:51,320;59:57,040;"This time, I'm pretty sure the people on this on this podcast could do that."
59:57,040;59:58,840;"I don't know."
59:58,840;01:00:03,680;"I, whatever that report was, it's been vector, the specter."
01:00:03,680;01:00:04,240;"Vector."
01:00:04,240;01:00:04,680;"Yes."
01:00:04,680;01:00:04,880;"Yeah."
01:00:04,880;01:00:06,040;"Like 500 pages."
01:00:06,040;01:00:07,400;"You should get that guy in the pod."
01:00:07,400;01:00:09,680;"Our own specter."
01:00:09,680;01:00:11,480;"Well, and who is the investigator?"
01:00:11,480;01:00:12,800;"I don't know."
01:00:12,800;01:00:13,680;"I don't know."
01:00:13,680;01:00:15,240;"We, we, we, we got him."
01:00:15,240;01:00:16,320;"I'm sure he's going to find out."
01:00:16,320;01:00:17,520;"We'll make some phone calls."
01:00:17,520;01:00:19,040;"Look, we're going to get to the bottom of this."
01:00:19,040;01:00:22,400;"Some day, parade is going to write his expose because his guilt is going to haunt him."
01:00:22,400;01:00:23,880;"He's a fucking cheater."
01:00:23,880;01:00:26,200;"He's, uh,"
01:00:26,200;01:00:31,120;"even if you do get him on the podcast, we're going to end up asking him if he can do"
01:00:31,120;01:00:31,200;"that."
01:00:31,200;01:00:32,400;"The helicopter dick thing."
01:00:32,400;01:00:34,120;"Oh shit."
01:00:34,120;01:00:37,440;"Asking if he'd fucking like everybody."
01:00:37,440;01:00:40,720;"Okay."
01:00:40,720;01:00:43,680;"So we're here to talk football and we haven't even got to the second half."
01:00:43,680;01:00:44,080;"Okay."
01:00:46,960;01:00:48,960;"Well, the third quarter didn't have much in."
01:00:48,960;01:00:50,960;"So let's just jump to the fourth quarter."
01:00:50,960;01:00:52,960;"Actually didn't watch the third quarter."
01:00:52,960;01:00:53,960;"All right, good."
01:00:53,960;01:00:54,960;"You know what?"
01:00:54,960;01:00:55,960;"The one above."
01:00:55,960;01:00:57,960;"You missed a couple turnovers now, is it?"
01:00:57,960;01:01:00,960;"Fourth quarter was where all the action happens."
01:01:00,960;01:01:04,960;"There's four touchdowns scored in the fourth quarter."
01:01:04,960;01:01:08,960;"Three of them by three, even by the Patriots did."
01:01:08,960;01:01:12,960;"I mean, well, one of them paint manning at a hand in."
01:01:12,960;01:01:16,360;"Because the cold scored at the touchdown"
01:01:16,360;01:01:20,040;"right at the end of the third quarter."
01:01:20,040;01:01:22,520;"To pull it a little bit closer, it was 23/7"
01:01:22,520;01:01:23,320;"the end of the third quarter."
01:01:23,320;01:01:25,880;"And the pages immediately went down and scored a touchdown,"
01:01:25,880;01:01:28,520;"which is very Patriot-esque."
01:01:28,520;01:01:33,360;"That was the screen pass to Antoine Smith,"
01:01:33,360;01:01:36,400;"where he rumbled for like 40, 50 yards."
01:01:36,400;01:01:38,560;"And then two players later kept him"
01:01:38,560;01:01:42,720;"fall-grained for touchdown, which you don't see very often."
01:01:42,720;01:01:46,640;"And then like two plays later, Colte of the ball, and that was the"
01:01:46,640;01:01:47,680;"title of pick six."
01:01:47,680;01:01:52,840;"And that was the game, even though Peyton would follow that up with a touchdown"
01:01:52,840;01:01:57,000;"drive of his own eventually through a touchdown on fourth down and went for two"
01:01:57,000;01:01:57,480;"missed it."
01:01:57,480;01:02:01,000;"It's now what 44 to 13 and the game was over."
01:02:01,000;01:02:03,320;"And I don't think Peyton Manning actually saw the field after that."
01:02:03,320;01:02:07,840;"They brought in, um, that was his name, Mark Rippon."
01:02:07,840;01:02:09,200;"Oh, hell yeah."
01:02:09,200;01:02:10,760;"Red Skins fame."
01:02:10,760;01:02:11,320;"Yes."
01:02:11,320;01:02:16,360;"exactly that when they said that. Yeah. Probably start on that team right now."
01:02:16,360;01:02:17,360;"Definitely could."
01:02:17,360;01:02:23,400;"Now, I'm thinking the next coach. May as well, right?"
01:02:23,400;01:02:29,400;"The London Redskins. Oh, feels nice. I feel like they probably change the"
01:02:29,400;01:02:32,400;"Redskins part. Maybe snide."
01:02:32,400;01:02:38,720;"I want to red coats. Oh, red coat. Not bad. Not bad."
01:02:38,720;01:02:47,360;"that I did find it interesting that there is video evidence out there of Bill Bellachek"
01:02:47,360;01:02:53,320;"celebrating touchdowns. I mean he's fist pumping, he's clapping. I don't know what year that"
01:02:53,320;01:02:57,960;"stopped. I mean there's rumors that he sold this soul, which I think we can all agree"
01:02:57,960;01:03:03,960;"on. But yeah, happened then. But there is evidence of him celebrating and smiling."
01:03:03,960;01:03:06,660;"Yeah, cuz I mean I remember this year"
01:03:06,660;01:03:09,680;"What's that this year?"
01:03:09,680;01:03:11,680;"2001 I"
01:03:11,680;01:03:18,120;"Don't know because he was still celebrating and right I think like I mean if we really want to like discuss when he sold this"
01:03:18,120;01:03:20,600;"So I feel like it was after 2002"
01:03:20,600;01:03:26,840;"I was gonna say after 2004 because that was when he was he was still celebrating cuz remember that was the end of the"
01:03:26,840;01:03:29,680;"Charlie Weiss"
01:03:30,000;01:03:33,840;"And Romeo Cornell like the three of them and they were like hugging at the end and like"
01:03:33,840;01:03:37,960;"Oh, right. Yeah, I was getting pissed because they poured the"
01:03:37,960;01:03:43,440;"The Kool-Aid on him and his dad like well, it's dad super old that could I kill? Yeah? Yep. I remember that"
01:03:43,440;01:03:48,600;"That's a good point actually. So I think it was after that what he didn't win for a couple of years"
01:03:48,600;01:03:50,920;"Yeah, and then sold the soul and that was 2007"
01:03:50,920;01:03:53,920;"You're right because then the culmination of that was probably oh seven"
01:03:53,920;01:03:57,760;"We saw little little signs of that and then here we are now"
01:03:58,640;01:04:00,940;"Yeah, you know, and that makes sense."
01:04:00,940;01:04:01,700;"Roger Godel."
01:04:01,700;01:04:04,380;"I never thought of it that way, but yeah, you're right."
01:04:04,380;01:04:06,440;"That was probably the last intimate moment he ever had."
01:04:06,440;01:04:09,940;"That's the devil trying to collect his spygate."
01:04:09,940;01:04:11,020;"Yeah."
01:04:11,020;01:04:15,320;"Now, if you were him, I mean, what you just say, hypothetically, the devil approaches you"
01:04:15,320;01:04:15,860;"whatever."
01:04:15,860;01:04:21,140;"And he's like, you know, giving you this deal where you're going to get, let's say eight"
01:04:21,140;01:04:24,720;"Super Bowls by the time you die, you coach until you're 85, right?"
01:04:24,720;01:04:25,640;"That's pretty good run."
01:04:25,640;01:04:26,340;"Amen."
01:04:26,340;01:04:29,540;"Um, you know, social media goes crazy."
01:04:29,540;01:04:34,100;"You're beloved, then you burn eternally, but like who cares?"
01:04:34,100;01:04:36,260;"Cause like there's no social media in hell who gives a shit."
01:04:36,260;01:04:38,100;"So would you do that?"
01:04:38,100;01:04:39,000;"Yes."
01:04:39,000;01:04:41,920;"You would 100% right."
01:04:41,920;01:04:43,340;"Depant what, what is hell?"
01:04:43,340;01:04:46,660;"Well, is hell watching?"
01:04:46,660;01:04:51,540;"Cause it, cause if hell was watching somebody else break all your records, that was suck."
01:04:51,540;01:04:53,280;"Oh fuck."
01:04:53,280;01:04:54,300;"I didn't even think about that."
01:04:54,660;01:04:56,220;"And I would eat them alive for it's"
01:04:56,220;01:04:57,060;"Yeah, man."
01:04:57,060;01:04:58,060;"Yeah."
01:04:58,060;01:04:59,940;"Man, you're bringing up great points today."
01:04:59,940;01:05:01,900;"I mean, I know this."
01:05:01,900;01:05:06,180;"You'll have to listen to our two of the podcast."
01:05:06,180;01:05:07,780;"And I started breaking and bring up good points."
01:05:07,780;01:05:08,700;"Yeah."
01:05:08,700;01:05:10,300;"Well, I mean, warmed up."
01:05:10,300;01:05:13,220;"You're definitely bringing a different perspective to the table."
01:05:13,220;01:05:15,780;"Absolutely."
01:05:15,780;01:05:16,300;"All right."
01:05:16,300;01:05:19,420;"I think that's that covers mostly games."
01:05:19,420;01:05:21,620;"Let's do some best and worse."
01:05:21,620;01:05:23,220;"And we want to go first."
01:05:23,220;01:05:24,760;"I know Steve already gave his best."
01:05:24,760;01:05:25,420;"Steve, you got to worry."
01:05:25,420;01:05:26,340;"It's what was your best again."
01:05:26,340;01:05:27,540;"I've already forgotten."
01:05:27,540;01:05:29,640;"It was like an hour ago, my variable sighting."
01:05:29,640;01:05:30,960;"Oh, that's right."
01:05:30,960;01:05:32,560;"The beginning of the Mike Bertle."
01:05:32,560;01:05:33,720;"My life at that point."
01:05:33,720;01:05:35,280;"I would think so."
01:05:35,280;01:05:36,360;"First, most people's lives."
01:05:36,360;01:05:37,980;"It's not like he played much on the Steelers."
01:05:37,980;01:05:38,840;"It's all like that."
01:05:38,840;01:05:39,600;"Do you have a worst?"
01:05:39,600;01:05:40,960;"I have another best."
01:05:40,960;01:05:41,680;"Does that count?"
01:05:41,680;01:05:42,400;"The fuck it?"
01:05:42,400;01:05:42,900;"Yeah, let's go."
01:05:42,900;01:05:44,200;"We're a patient podcast."
01:05:44,200;01:05:45,160;"As many best as you want."
01:05:45,160;01:05:49,020;"They cut to like John Bon Jovi and Robert"
01:05:49,020;01:05:49,960;"Crafts sitting together."
01:05:49,960;01:05:51,080;"Did they?"
01:05:51,080;01:05:51,680;"Yeah."
01:05:51,680;01:05:57,000;"that part. Well, that's super young. I wrote down the note that Robert craft"
01:05:57,000;01:06:03,080;"was like a man who didn't need to pay for hand jobs. I mean, you could say that"
01:06:03,080;01:06:07,320;"because his wife was sitting next to him. Okay, well, wait to make it real."
01:06:07,320;01:06:14,600;"Now, who's when you do that? Too soon. Rest in peace, my right. All right, Greg,"
01:06:14,600;01:06:20,400;"Give me your best and worst my best was man's favorite wide receiver tie-law"
01:06:20,400;01:06:26,280;"And okay my worst is drone pathans"
01:06:26,280;01:06:29,760;"Future"
01:06:29,760;01:06:32,200;"Oatmeal brain"
01:06:32,200;01:06:36,540;"And just general like you know unsteadiness and mood swings"
01:06:36,540;01:06:44,580;"You got lit up a bunch in this game like from the first play from the get I think that's a dog"
01:06:44,580;01:06:47,580;"darkest worst moment we've had."
01:06:47,580;01:06:48,580;"I don't think so."
01:06:48,580;01:06:50,580;"Last week we talked a lot about 9/11."
01:06:50,580;01:06:51,580;"Oh yeah."
01:06:51,580;01:06:52,580;"I forgot about that."
01:06:52,580;01:06:53,580;"Yeah."
01:06:53,580;01:06:55,580;"It was a twin tower joke in there somewhere."
01:06:55,580;01:06:58,580;"All right, Mike, your best or worst."
01:06:58,580;01:07:00,580;"All right, best."
01:07:00,580;01:07:04,580;"I mean, I have a few honorable mentions just quickly like the,"
01:07:04,580;01:07:05,580;"the, uh,"
01:07:05,580;01:07:06,580;"the, uh,"
01:07:06,580;01:07:08,580;"28 yard screen and the fourth."
01:07:08,580;01:07:10,580;"So Brady got like hammered."
01:07:10,580;01:07:12,580;"They kept this composure completed the pass."
01:07:12,580;01:07:18,940;"I was just picturing like Bledsoe running across the field, like closing his eyes, like throwing"
01:07:18,940;01:07:22,060;"like cross body, like tucking and rolling."
01:07:22,060;01:07:24,620;"So yeah Brady didn't do that."
01:07:24,620;01:07:25,940;"So that was pretty great."
01:07:25,940;01:07:33,540;"And even just the fact that like they sent Brady out to run a fourth and three like throwback"
01:07:33,540;01:07:39,380;"screen pass, the fourth quarter was showing the trust that they had in him even at that"
01:07:39,380;01:07:40,380;"point."
01:07:40,380;01:07:41,380;"It was pretty cool."
01:07:41,380;01:07:43,900;"And then another just quick aside,"
01:07:43,900;01:07:45,700;"I just, they threw up a graphic"
01:07:45,700;01:07:48,740;"of like what Foxborough Stadium was versus like,"
01:07:48,740;01:07:50,660;"you know, what ended up being Gillette Stadium."
01:07:50,660;01:07:54,140;"And I mean, they're like, it was a $6 million stadium."
01:07:54,140;01:07:57,180;"The new one was like 325 million."
01:07:57,180;01:08:00,820;"I mean, there's like 53,000 bench seats in Foxborough,"
01:08:00,820;01:08:02,460;"which were like cold and uncomfortable,"
01:08:02,460;01:08:06,940;"zero in Gillette, 68,000 chair backs."
01:08:06,940;01:08:09,140;"Apparently that was like the hot spot."
01:08:09,140;01:08:11,180;"- Actual chairs instead of benches."
01:08:11,180;01:08:21,680;"Yeah, yeah. So I thought that was pretty cool. And then the last honorable mention would be Brady just randomly talking on the sideline with like a line kid or whatever that was."
01:08:21,680;01:08:29,240;"He was just talking about this a random dude, not even other the Patriots team and just being a normal guy."
01:08:29,240;01:08:32,480;"He is the normal guy."
01:08:32,480;01:08:34,880;"He could have a handsome."
01:08:34,880;01:08:39,960;"Right. Well, after 2007, when he sold this hole, we could talk about that next week."
01:08:40,040;01:08:43,680;"But I think we'll have to save that."
01:08:43,680;01:08:46,000;"And then, yeah, so my best moment was actually"
01:08:46,000;01:08:50,280;"when they had a, oh man, there's too many like commentator"
01:08:50,280;01:08:53,880;"things, but I mean, the commentator, all right,"
01:08:53,880;01:08:55,000;"there's two great ones."
01:08:55,000;01:08:58,120;"One is the commentator debating through the commercial."
01:08:58,120;01:09:01,200;"Why didn't they go for two, right?"
01:09:01,200;01:09:03,520;"So they cold kick like, and they're like,"
01:09:03,520;01:09:04,360;"why don't they go for two?"
01:09:04,360;01:09:05,960;"And they're breaking down the math and they're going"
01:09:05,960;01:09:08,440;"with three touchdowns and three two-point conversions"
01:09:08,440;01:09:09,880;"they could take the lead."
01:09:09,880;01:09:12,340;"And they're legitimately talking about this."
01:09:12,340;01:09:13,500;"I thought that was fantastic."
01:09:13,500;01:09:15,740;"- Yeah, the cools are down 24 points."
01:09:15,740;01:09:17,580;"- Exactly, it was so funny."
01:09:17,580;01:09:22,020;"Another great moment that I liked was they had a poll"
01:09:22,020;01:09:24,740;"which O&2 team had the best chance of making the playoffs."
01:09:24,740;01:09:25,580;"- Yeah."
01:09:25,580;01:09:28,420;"- I agree it's a word listed in their own game."
01:09:28,420;01:09:30,660;"- That was gonna be my worst, yeah."
01:09:30,660;01:09:32,260;"- Oh, that was the best thing."
01:09:32,260;01:09:34,820;"- I have it, it was of the NFL team starting O&2,"
01:09:34,820;01:09:36,660;"which has a best shot at making the playoffs."
01:09:36,660;01:09:39,300;"Buffalo, Detroit, Kansas City, Minnesota,"
01:09:39,300;01:09:40,980;"Tennessee, or Washington."
01:09:40,980;01:09:43,180;"And then like eventually they realized,"
01:09:43,180;01:09:45,300;"wait, the Patriots aren't on this list."
01:09:45,300;01:09:46,140;"(laughs)"
01:09:46,140;01:09:46,980;"- Yeah, I remember coming through,"
01:09:46,980;01:09:48,860;"they were just like, maybe they could use it"
01:09:48,860;01:09:49,700;"and have a chip on their shoulder."
01:09:49,700;01:09:51,460;"And I could just picture like Bellachacks,"
01:09:51,460;01:09:53,620;"like, you know, after they're going out."
01:09:53,620;01:09:55,660;"Yeah, yeah, like did you guys see that CBS"
01:09:55,660;01:09:57,260;"like left us out of a pole?"
01:09:57,260;01:09:58,340;"- Oh yeah. - Right."
01:09:58,340;01:09:59,980;"So that was pretty funny."
01:09:59,980;01:10:00,820;"And then the worst moment."
01:10:00,820;01:10:03,620;"- I guess that was up on the bulletin board."
01:10:03,620;01:10:05,300;"- Oh hell yeah. - Super Bowl week."
01:10:05,300;01:10:09,060;"- Loder Malloy would be ranting and raving."
01:10:09,060;01:10:10,860;"- Oh, God yeah."
01:10:10,860;01:10:13,580;"- And then the worst moment for me was just seeing Pete"
01:10:13,580;01:10:15,740;"and run up the middle for 10 yards in a touchdown"
01:10:15,740;01:10:17,220;"'cause how does that even happen?"
01:10:17,220;01:10:18,580;"- Yeah, that was tough."
01:10:18,580;01:10:20,420;"But it's a pretty spry."
01:10:20,420;01:10:21,260;"- He was quick."
01:10:21,260;01:10:22,300;"If Peyton's running for touchdowns,"
01:10:22,300;01:10:24,620;"you know you're doing something right though."
01:10:24,620;01:10:26,420;"'Cause that ain't his thing."
01:10:26,420;01:10:27,420;"- That's right."
01:10:27,420;01:10:29,140;"- I like those."
01:10:29,140;01:10:30,700;"All right, my best."
01:10:32,580;01:10:37,620;"following a failed third down conversion where a paid manning thought they got it."
01:10:37,620;01:10:42,500;"Manning right over to the referee and was like trying to convince him that the spot was wrong."
01:10:42,500;01:10:46,580;"And Brian Cox is standing in the sideline waving at him, waving goodbye."
01:10:46,580;01:10:47,380;"That was awesome."
01:10:47,380;01:10:48,260;"Oh, you catch that?"
01:10:48,260;01:10:52,340;"He was so in Manning's head."
01:10:52,340;01:10:54,260;"Brian Cox had himself a fucking game."
01:10:54,260;01:10:56,340;"So that was definitely my best."
01:10:58,740;01:11:03,540;"honorable mentor be the fact that you saw the Patriots run Troy Brown on the jet sweep"
01:11:03,540;01:11:07,820;"That like as he's coming in motion. They just hike it real quick turn on a hand as well"
01:11:07,820;01:11:14,540;"And it wasn't as smooth as you see it nowadays, but like you know can bell check ahead of the game as always"
01:11:14,540;01:11:21,560;"My worst was gonna be the the oh and two graphic but"
01:11:21,560;01:11:24,580;"Instead I will say it's the"
01:11:26,100;01:11:32,420;"audio from this from the old Foxverse stadium where it sounded like we were listening to a high school football game."
01:11:32,420;01:11:39,140;"But you could hear the stadium announcer announcing the results of the play."
01:11:39,140;01:11:42,180;"Like Aaron Swan Smith up the middle for two yards."
01:11:42,180;01:11:45,780;"Like as you hear the announcer saying the same thing."
01:11:45,780;01:11:52,820;"And then you could actually get out of this on headphones and I could hear like a lot of fan chatter."
01:11:53,540;01:11:55,700;"And so I wrote down a few that I heard."
01:11:55,700;01:12:00,900;"One of the cheers was way to go. Oh, I'm looking good so far."
01:12:00,900;01:12:06,340;"This was that one. It was probably like three plays into the first drive."
01:12:06,340;01:12:09,940;"Yeah, which was great. I heard that too. It was like super."
01:12:09,940;01:12:19,220;"The all on. Yeah. Yeah. And then another one was it's okay, Peyton, which I don't know if it came"
01:12:19,220;01:12:25,460;"from a Colts fan. Um, and then there was another one. Don't walk away from me, you idiot."
01:12:25,460;01:12:34,500;"And then there was the guy repeating, I have as repeating five times, get me more cheeseburgers."
01:12:34,500;01:12:37,780;"You just kept repeating that as just like,"
01:12:37,780;01:12:43,540;"I'm painting going on. Yeah. And then like towards the end of the game,"
01:12:43,540;01:12:47,780;"like, I, uh, he must have been talking shit to a Colts fan. Cause he's like,"
01:12:47,780;01:12:51,700;"like, are you guys gonna lose in the first round again for the third year in a row?"
01:12:51,700;01:12:58,700;"Like that's, that's the, uh, the taunting of a guy who has never been there before."
01:12:58,700;01:12:59,500;"Yeah."
01:12:59,500;01:13:00,260;"Who just has the."
01:13:00,260;01:13:00,780;"Hey, thank you."
01:13:00,780;01:13:02,100;"So fucking time."
01:13:02,100;01:13:03,780;"Yeah, exactly."
01:13:03,780;01:13:05,900;"To a cult fan."
01:13:05,900;01:13:08,420;"It's like, well, you're going to get the playoffs and lose again."
01:13:08,420;01:13:10,100;"How that must suck, huh?"
01:13:10,100;01:13:12,100;"One of the playoffs feel like."
01:13:14,540;01:13:17,740;"Now that was a it was a"
01:13:17,740;01:13:25,440;"So I think my worst is probably the Gary glitter fact the fact they stopped playing that song because he's a kitty didler. I"
01:13:25,440;01:13:29,340;"Have worse. I just thought of it. What's that? I?"
01:13:29,340;01:13:36,180;"Had always thought Brady's first start was that game in Indianapolis that we're gonna watch later. Oh"
01:13:38,940;01:13:44,820;"game. Pat was pretty patent for Rose runs. Oh, yeah. Yeah."
01:13:44,820;01:13:49,100;"I was fully expecting to turn that game on and I was like, wait, it's in Fox"
01:13:49,100;01:13:50,100;"bro."
01:13:50,100;01:13:55,380;"I understood yourself a good game to watch though. It was he was pretty"
01:13:55,380;01:14:01,580;"steady. You know, no mistakes. Nothing flashy. Just solid Brady."
01:14:01,580;01:14:06,180;"I did. I was a little disappointed that his first touch and didn't go to Kevin"
01:14:06,180;01:14:07,840;"on that screen pass though."
01:14:07,840;01:14:11,620;"'Cause he was a shoestring tackle at like a three-yard line."
01:14:11,620;01:14:16,820;"And that was the fourth and three screenplay too."
01:14:16,820;01:14:17,660;"- Right."
01:14:17,660;01:14:19,260;"- So that would have been a hell of a first touch out throw,"
01:14:19,260;01:14:22,100;"but we're gonna have to wait for that for next week."
01:14:22,100;01:14:26,100;"So that's what in the game, that's what we call a teaser."
01:14:26,100;01:14:27,340;"We're gonna tease that."
01:14:27,340;01:14:28,180;"- That's a teaser."
01:14:28,180;01:14:29,020;"- We're at Teasing. - What are we teasing?"
01:14:29,020;01:14:30,340;"- That's a teaser."
01:14:30,340;01:14:32,700;"- We're teasing Tom Brady's first touch out pass."
01:14:32,700;01:14:35,380;"- Oh, and who are we teasing?"
01:14:35,380;01:14:40,540;"with that. Oh, yeah, we're teasing our mom. Oh, hi, Mrs."
01:14:40,540;01:14:44,540;"Brand. So as I shall tune in next week and listen to us talk"
01:14:44,540;01:14:49,000;"about the Patriots at the Chargers at the Chargers, home"
01:14:49,000;01:14:52,740;"versus Chargers. Find out the other. It's called a"
01:14:52,740;01:14:58,420;"teaser. We're real good at teasing. And the best part is"
01:14:58,420;01:15:03,260;"that's not next week next week is at the dolphins. Well, this"
01:15:03,260;01:15:05,820;"is just all right. I'm done."
01:15:05,820;01:15:12,340;"All right, on that note, we will see everybody next time on the"
01:15:12,340;01:15:13,820;"page as I as the podcast."

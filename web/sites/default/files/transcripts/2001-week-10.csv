00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,160;"I am not your mother."
00:19,160;00:20,160;"Welcome back."
00:20,160;00:29,240;"You are still with us, and welcome for the first time if this is your first episode,"
00:29,240;00:32,120;"if it is, that's kind of weird that you're starting at week 10, but we forgive you."
00:32,120;00:36,880;"Uh, like I said, this is week 10 of the 2001 NFL season."
00:36,880;00:40,800;"But stood upon us by our Lord and savior Thomas Patrick,"
00:40,800;00:41,720;"a Dr. Brady Jr."
00:41,720;00:43,280;"Did I get that right?"
00:43,280;00:46,280;"I can never remember the order of the middle."
00:46,280;00:46,880;"I think so."
00:46,880;00:48,800;"I think you should be the third."
00:48,800;00:49,880;"It just sounds better."
00:49,880;00:51,120;"Yeah."
00:51,120;00:53,560;"Thomas was a third."
00:53,560;00:56,280;"Wasn't there a player who's who is the second?"
00:56,280;00:58,920;"Yeah, a garden Minshew, the second."
00:58,920;01:01,640;"Yes. And Philip Dore said, right?"
01:01,640;01:10,340;"I thought he was the third. I don't know. I think he's the third, which makes sense, but you don't often see the second. But apparently it's because"
01:10,340;01:16,980;"it's not his father's name. It's his grandfather's name. So he's technically not a junior, but he is the second."
01:16,980;01:19,200;"Hmm. Yeah."
01:19,200;01:23,020;"That's from the block. Yes, that's right. That's where I learned it from."
01:24,260;01:28,260;"So yeah, if you want to learn more about Gardner Flintman shoe, is that right?"
01:28,260;01:33,220;"Mille and Flint Brownbrosports.com and read"
01:33,220;01:35,060;"Gregory's perusing about it."
01:35,060;01:37,260;"Love it."
01:37,260;01:41,380;"But today we're going to be talking about what I'm going to"
01:41,380;01:45,180;"pause it as the most important loss of the page."
01:45,180;01:46,020;"It's dynasty."
01:46,020;01:48,260;"Whoa, that's a bold statement."
01:48,260;01:51,620;"I think that's right."
01:51,620;01:53,180;"I'm coming out to shoot hot boys."
01:53,700;01:54,700;"Why do you say that?"
01:54,700;01:55,700;"Wow."
01:55,700;02:02,840;"Um, because this game, uh, we have actually introduced you against where the greatest"
02:02,840;02:09,380;"show on turf visited old Foxboro stadium, uh, coming in red, hot eight and one against"
02:09,380;02:12,300;"the Pats who just over 500 at five and four."
02:12,300;02:15,740;"Uh, this was the game."
02:15,740;02:21,180;"I think that gave the Patriots the confidence that they could compete at a high level, even"
02:21,180;02:22,580;"though they didn't win the game."
02:22,580;02:27,860;"I think that took away from it that they were able to hang with the elite of the NFL."
02:27,860;02:30,420;"You disagree, Greg?"
02:30,420;02:32,420;"Why?"
02:32,420;02:33,460;"Isn't it?"
02:33,460;02:37,180;"You don't, you don't lose games and be like, that's a good loss."
02:37,180;02:44,660;"Oh, isn't that what I said in the, uh, yeah, the, the after what the fuck?"
02:44,660;02:46,580;"The post game locker room stuff."
02:46,580;02:50,060;"But I think definitely not congratulating them for losing this game."
02:50,060;02:50,300;"But,"
02:50,300;02:58,460;"Greg, do you remember the Kansas City game where the team basically lost their spirit"
02:58,460;03:03,100;"and then that last drive where Gronk got a touchdown and whatnot turned the whole season"
03:03,100;03:05,900;"around because Belichick said that he saw fire in the team?"
03:05,900;03:07,100;"That was a good loss."
03:07,100;03:09,740;"The we're on to Cincinnati game. That's a good one too."
03:09,740;03:10,220;"Yeah."
03:10,220;03:11,580;"That's all ****."
03:11,580;03:16,380;"Okay, I agree. But let's give it to the listeners, okay?"
03:17,100;03:21,660;"It's all a hindsight, you know, because there's plenty of teams over the years that have lost terribly."
03:21,660;03:22,700;"Oh, okay."
03:22,700;03:23,420;"Fine."
03:23,420;03:25,740;"Every loss sucks."
03:25,740;03:28,860;"Jesus Christ."
03:28,860;03:30,460;"Forget about the story."
03:30,460;03:32,300;"Every loss sucks."
03:32,300;03:35,900;"Oh, you are a rare mood."
03:35,900;03:36,620;"Good God."
03:36,620;03:39,340;"And I told you, sorry, guys."
03:39,340;03:41,500;"Do I have a mute button for Mike?"
03:41,500;03:41,900;"I do."
03:41,900;03:42,220;"Okay."
03:42,220;03:42,700;"Just checking."
03:42,700;03:44,220;"You should use it frequently today."
03:44,220;03:45,660;"I might."
03:45,660;03:46,860;"It's a good one."
03:46,860;03:53,420;"All right, let's talk about the Rams then, who I will still--"
03:53,420;03:56,620;"I'm going to stick with my take out of the bat."
03:56,620;04:00,260;"I think this was a positive in the long run"
04:00,260;04:03,860;"in terms of the direction of the pages dynasty."
04:03,860;04:06,980;"So put them on the right direction."
04:06,980;04:07,980;"What?"
04:07,980;04:11,540;"I'm sticking with my take too, the your take is stupid."
04:11,540;04:12,300;"Well, that's fun."
04:12,300;04:13,860;"Nobody really cares what you do."
04:13,860;04:18,500;"I like the story of it, but Greg won me over every loss blows."
04:18,500;04:20,660;"And there's no good that can come from it ever."
04:20,660;04:23,780;"What about people that lose in life?"
04:23,780;04:24,980;"Yeah, they're losers."
04:24,980;04:31,340;"Was it 2004? Oh, actually, here's a better one."
04:31,340;04:39,460;"The Patriots lose in '06 in the A/C Championship game to the Colts."
04:40,220;04:44,660;"And that opens up opens the eyes of the coaching staff that Brady needs help."
04:44,660;04:46,580;"And they go out and get."
04:46,580;04:50,700;"Well, go or moss and light the league on fire."
04:50,700;04:53,900;"Was not a blessing nothing at the same time was."
04:53,900;04:58,100;"Well, I wouldn't say nothing is accomplished exactly everything."
04:58,100;05:00,380;"Sour spot there."
05:00,380;05:03,180;"See again, scratch this from the podcast."
05:03,180;05:07,220;"I'm just going to delete your entire audio from this."
05:07,220;05:08,500;"And I think it's fine."
05:08,500;05:10,700;"Can I just hang back and drink my rum?"
05:10,700;05:11,700;"Do it."
05:11,700;05:12,500;"OK."
05:12,500;05:18,700;"So yeah, speaking of the Rams, they will finish the season 14 and two."
05:18,700;05:24,020;"First in the NFC West, obviously, they're only only losses this season."
05:24,020;05:27,740;"We're to the seven and nine Saints randomly in week seven."
05:27,740;05:31,260;"And then against the nine and seven bucks"
05:31,260;05:35,260;"and week 11, which is directly after this game."
05:35,300;05:40,700;"So I think this may have also led to the loss directly"
05:40,700;05:43,540;"after this, this game, which is because how hard it was played."
05:43,540;05:44,780;"Now, close it was."
05:44,780;05:47,860;"I'm sticking with you."
05:47,860;05:48,900;"I'll give you that."
05:48,900;05:53,420;"That makes sense to me unless Greg can sway me on that."
05:53,420;05:55,020;"I'm sure he'll try."
05:55,020;05:56,300;"Are those divisional games?"
05:56,300;05:57,860;"What division were they in?"
05:57,860;06:00,860;"NFC West."
06:00,860;06:02,300;"That's a good question, because that"
06:02,300;06:04,580;"was before the realignment."
06:04,580;06:10,580;"Yeah, because I feel like I don't know why I always think they're in the same division as the Falcons."
06:10,580;06:16,780;"So they yeah, so that NFC West back then was Rams 49ers, Saints, Falcons, Panthers."
06:16,780;06:24,580;"And so the final standings Rams obviously 14 and two, like we said, 49ers, 12 and four."
06:24,580;06:29,980;"Then nobody else about 500 Saints were seven and nine Falcons, seven and nine Panthers, one and 15,"
06:29,980;06:33,500;"which we will see them later in the podcast."
06:34,300;06:43,420;"Oh, yeah. Yeah. So this was like we touched on before part of the greatest show on turf era."
06:43,420;06:49,420;"And the offense was scored 503 points this year, which was seventh most all time at the time,"
06:49,420;06:57,740;"which was I think more impressive because this was before the explosion of offensive production."
06:57,740;07:03,660;"You can see, you know, rookie quarterback sees a throne for 50 touchdowns, but back then that"
07:03,660;07:10,620;"was unheard of. So, but as part of this, you know, greatest show on turf, the reason it was called"
07:10,620;07:16,380;"that is because the year before this, they put up 540 points, which was third all time at the time."
07:16,380;07:21,820;"And the year before that, in '99, they put up 526 points, which was fourth all time at the time."
07:21,820;07:27,180;"So they're putting up top 10 all time scoring numbers every year for three years in a row."
07:29,020;07:37,260;"And as part of that in this, it was alluded to by one of the commentators that the Rams had scored coming into this game 31 touchdowns."
07:37,260;07:41,460;"And they only punted 23 times on the season coming into the game."
07:41,460;07:46,780;"And so I went down a bit of a route hole today at lunch and forgot to eat lunch because of it."
07:46,780;07:55,780;"But I decided that I would look up how many times teams have finished with more touchdowns than"
07:57,340;08:02,060;"punts on a season and they were there were 34 of them believe it or not"
08:02,060;08:08,060;"and i'm pretty sure you could probably name maybe half of them off the top of your head"
08:08,060;08:16,380;"but in terms of the punt differential the punt touchdown differential if you will"
08:16,380;08:19,420;"how many more touchdowns and punts there were"
08:19,420;08:23,580;"who would you guess would be the top of that list"
08:26,300;08:28,420;"with the most puns or the least amount of puns?"
08:28,420;08:32,340;"No, the most more touchdowns and puns,"
08:32,340;08:34,220;"like the biggest positive difference."
08:34,220;08:40,180;"Patriots, 7."
08:40,180;08:42,180;"Yeah."
08:42,180;08:42,940;"Is that correct?"
08:42,940;08:43,900;"That is correct."
08:43,900;08:49,300;"They had 75 touchdowns, which is, I think, second all time"
08:49,300;08:50,140;"to that."
08:50,140;08:53,060;"Was it 2013 Broncos?"
08:53,060;08:55,020;"Was it?"
08:55,020;08:57,960;"Yeah, 2013 Broncos had 76 touchdowns on the year."
08:57,960;09:00,600;"The '07 pants had 75."
09:00,600;09:02,920;"But the difference in punting was that that Broncos team"
09:02,920;09:04,600;"punted 66 times that year."
09:04,600;09:06,360;"So they're only plus 10."
09:06,360;09:10,080;"The Patriots in '07 punted 45 times."
09:10,080;09:13,560;"So they were a plus 30 on the season"
09:13,560;09:15,680;"in terms of touchdowns to punts."
09:15,680;09:18,840;"- Mike, thoughts on punters?"
09:18,840;09:19,680;"- I love them."
09:19,680;09:24,000;"So I'm just enjoying my O-cart rum"
09:24,000;09:26,500;"and listening to this fabulous conversation about."
09:26,500;09:27,660;"- Beautiful."
09:27,660;09:29,160;"- Beautiful, is that?"
09:29,160;09:30,660;"- Yeah, free plug."
09:30,660;09:31,980;"- It can be."
09:31,980;09:33,260;"I mean, we can work it out."
09:33,260;09:35,100;"(laughing)"
09:35,100;09:36,260;"- Let me vote all part."
09:36,260;09:37,620;"(laughing)"
09:37,620;09:39,140;"- It's not bad. - It's smooth."
09:39,140;09:39,980;"- It does."
09:39,980;09:40,820;"It goes out."
09:40,820;09:41,660;"You can sip it."
09:41,660;09:43,340;"You can chug it if you really want to."
09:43,340;09:44,580;"I don't recommend that."
09:44,580;09:47,740;"And you can find it for like 10, 12 bucks."
09:47,740;09:49,220;"It's not too bad."
09:49,220;09:51,580;"- Does it help ease the pain?"
09:51,580;09:53,580;"- It's making the show go a lot better."
09:53,580;09:59,340;"Oh boy, you said that now, but we're not even half way done."
09:59,340;10:00,380;"I know."
10:00,380;10:06,180;"Here's a point in 10 years that we're that number is going to skyrocket more"
10:06,180;10:08,980;"teensy NFL than not."
10:08,980;10:10,740;"We'll have more touchdowns than punts."
10:10,740;10:16,780;"So yes, I think you're right because to that point of the top four."
10:16,780;10:21,700;"Uh, two of those were this were the last two years."
10:21,900;10:28,360;"Kansas number two last year with a plus 26 and Baltimore this year plus 23."
10:28,360;10:31,220;"Yeah, the analytics say you shouldn't find."
10:31,220;10:35,780;"Yeah. Yeah. Cause I think way more infrequently than they do."
10:35,780;10:41,420;"Yeah. Actually both teams in this upcoming Super Bowl, the Chiefs and the 49ers"
10:41,420;10:43,320;"are both on this, this list."
10:43,320;10:44,480;"Yeah."
10:44,480;10:47,520;"Now this will not be upcoming by the time you listen to this, y'all."
10:47,520;10:50,980;"So if we say anything stupid or inaccurate, well,"
10:51,660;10:55,180;"Tweet at us if we have a Twitter then we do."
10:55,180;10:56,180;"Sweet."
10:56,180;10:57,180;"Let me know that."
10:57,180;10:58,180;"Yeah."
10:58,180;10:59,180;"I'm going."
10:59,180;11:00,740;"You're going to Super Bowl?"
11:00,740;11:02,380;"Going to Miami."
11:02,380;11:05,380;"Oh, well, that's almost cool."
11:05,380;11:07,940;"I mean, I was going to say that you're a big ball."
11:07,940;11:09,500;"And because the Super Bowl ticker's"
11:09,500;11:11,380;"going for like nine grand at the moment."
11:11,380;11:12,380;"I know."
11:12,380;11:13,780;"What is that all about?"
11:13,780;11:15,620;"We got the Airbnb."
11:15,620;11:21,340;"Like around the time of Antonio Brown being signed."
11:21,340;11:26,340;"And then it didn't quite work out, but no, it was like on a round trip flight for"
11:26,340;11:28,680;"150 bucks. So my Zos panel weekend."
11:28,680;11:30,480;"That sounds pretty good."
11:30,480;11:35,820;"Love that. I mean, it'd be awesome if that's a plan, but it would be, but they're not."
11:35,820;11:38,920;"But that would have been a whole lot more expensive because you can't go down there"
11:38,920;11:40,180;"and not go to the Super Bowl."
11:40,180;11:43,020;"That was a major concern of mine."
11:43,020;11:47,500;"You take out that second mortgage. It's all, it's all good."
11:47,500;11:49,360;"Yeah, exactly."
11:49,360;11:49,860;"Yeah."
11:49,860;12:00,540;"Um, Andy was one of the teams that you're mentioning the Peyton Manning's Colts because I remember one year they that it was a running gag without punter just never did anything."
12:00,540;12:02,220;"You remember that?"
12:02,220;12:06,020;"There are the Colts are on here a couple of times."
12:06,020;12:10,580;"That's 14 with a plus 12 in 2004."
12:10,580;12:13,460;"And then let's see where else."
12:15,140;12:20,420;"Uh, the 20 and 29 back to back seasons of '07 and '06, they're both plus two."
12:20,420;12:21,700;"Oh, all right."
12:21,700;12:23,860;"Oh, and they're also 32nd with a plus one."
12:23,860;12:25,620;"So they're on here a bunch."
12:25,620;12:29,140;"Yeah, they definitely score more touchdowns than punts often."
12:29,140;12:31,580;"That's the main error."
12:31,580;12:32,580;"Puns."
12:32,580;12:34,100;"Puns."
12:34,100;12:38,020;"Oh, I'm glad you boys found that as fast as I did."
12:38,020;12:40,900;"That was definitely worth a lunch break."
12:40,900;12:42,100;"Cool."
12:42,100;12:44,500;"Well, I can tell you any of that."
12:44,500;12:49,420;"You can what? You can tell that you didn't eat much. Oh, thanks."
12:49,420;12:53,020;"I said that I enjoyed it. Thank you very much for sharing that."
12:53,020;12:57,060;"You're very welcome. I know how much you like punters and punts that."
12:57,060;13:01,740;"So I think I just for you. Thank you. And I loved it every minute of it."
13:01,740;13:04,580;"Every second of it for all the people that are still listening."
13:04,580;13:08,220;"I just know how you feel about that whole conversation."
13:08,220;13:12,380;"Yeah, if I get you can tweet us at Pat's Dynasty info on Twitter."
13:12,700;13:13,700;"There you go."
13:13,700;13:16,660;"That's sexy, especially the info part."
13:16,660;13:17,980;"Come get us. Yeah."
13:17,980;13:20,220;"All right."
13:20,220;13:24,500;"The Rams, the architect of this greatest show on turf, Mike Martz."
13:24,500;13:27,060;"And Mike."
13:27,060;13:30,300;"He was pretty good."
13:30,300;13:35,340;"It was six seasons as a head coach from 2000 to 2005."
13:35,340;13:39,300;"So he was, you wasn't really the architect of this, I guess."
13:39,300;13:41,100;"Now that I'm saying that."
13:41,100;13:46,100;"Um, because this was already in place when he took over, wasn't it?"
13:46,100;13:47,340;"So that's great."
13:47,340;13:54,020;"Um, he was, he kind of like drove this team at the ground a little bit."
13:54,020;13:59,660;"So he was fired after a week five in 2005."
13:59,660;14:01,740;"So he didn't make it through the full season."
14:01,740;14:07,900;"Um, I can add to that, uh, probably the reason why he peed it out."
14:08,500;14:18,420;"because I wrote down that he had a comment that the Rams hadn't faced a team like the Patriots"
14:18,420;14:23,780;"with as speedy of receivers as they have. And I love Troy Brown. I love David Patton. But"
14:23,780;14:29,380;"if that's what you're putting on into the world, it makes sense that you might be out of a job soon."
14:29,380;14:34,260;"Yeah, I mean, that's a great point. Yeah, he wasn't."
14:37,220;14:38,900;"But was that something that he said?"
14:38,900;14:41,620;"I thought that was more on the defensive coordinator."
14:41,620;14:43,140;"Oh, I thought it was him."
14:43,140;14:45,700;"I read I take back everything I just said."
14:45,700;14:47,780;"If it was the defensive coordinator, everything."
14:47,780;14:51,460;"I had that written down as a lovey Smith quote."
14:51,460;14:52,500;"No, no, no."
14:52,500;14:55,380;"I say, Mart said they had that."
14:55,380;14:56,940;"I was kind of half paying attention."
14:56,940;14:57,780;"So I'm not sure."
14:57,780;15:01,060;"But I'm pretty sure Greg, could you well look that up, please?"
15:01,060;15:02,940;"I'm on it."
15:02,940;15:03,420;"Yeah."
15:03,420;15:06,460;"It was the the quote was, ""Patriots wide receivers"
15:06,460;15:08,700;"present the biggest challenge of the season, according to"
15:08,700;15:09,700;"lovey Smith and the steeple."
15:09,700;15:12,940;"Oh, see, because the quote that I had was that they hadn't"
15:12,940;15:15,340;"faced a team with receivers like the Patriots yet."
15:15,340;15:18,580;"Yeah, yeah, I think they see. Yeah. I think that was the"
15:18,580;15:21,580;"continuation of the quote. Yeah. And how fast they were."
15:21,580;15:24,300;"Maybe they both fucking said it. Okay. Maybe they both said"
15:24,300;15:26,860;"it. Maybe neither of them said it. Maybe we'll lie to you by"
15:26,860;15:27,540;"Joe Thiesman."
15:27,540;15:30,460;"I mean, he could, yeah."
15:30,460;15:33,460;"Like me, I never know. He didn't. Greg. That's where they go."
15:34,180;15:37,900;"find it. I'm looking at Google."
15:37,900;15:43,780;"Alexa, the phone quote."
15:43,780;15:54,660;"See, that was the only notable coaches, I think there was Ken Zampezi, who was"
15:54,660;16:00,100;"only really, he was a wider Seaver coach, only really notable in air quotes because"
16:00,100;16:03,540;"he's the son of the former Patriots offensive coordinator, Ernie Zampezi."
16:03,540;16:11,140;"back in 98.99 so I don't know how much of an effect you had on that although"
16:11,140;16:15,660;"these commentators were all about this this wider seeping core"
16:15,660;16:20,740;"I mean what the Rams yeah what happened Greg's coming in"
16:20,740;16:28,020;"well if Andy's gone is fucking weekly rant about the commentators I really like them"
16:28,020;16:36,020;"I like the book. You know what? I think it's this is a rarity, but I don't have a football or not football because I think I got everything that they were talking about."
16:36,020;16:37,020;"Yeah."
16:37,020;16:42,020;"It was Mike Patrick, Paul Maguire and Joe Thaisman."
16:42,020;16:49,020;"And I thought Joe Thaisman was the original Tony Romo. Like his points were a point."
16:49,020;16:52,020;"Point things out before they happened."
16:52,020;16:53,020;"A little fun."
16:53,020;16:57,020;"Yeah. Yeah. It was having a good time with people."
16:57,020;17:01,740;"That's what makes a good commentator is like, just having fun."
17:01,740;17:03,340;"Yeah, but also knowing the game too."
17:03,340;17:05,100;"Like it's not like listening to Dan Deodor,"
17:05,100;17:07,500;"I feel like, ""Grog, I don't understand why they're throwing a flag."""
17:07,500;17:09,420;"Like, Joe Thuy has been actually new to the rules"
17:09,420;17:12,380;"and could explain them to you in real time as it's happening"
17:12,380;17:15,420;"instead of 20 minutes later when he's been told by, you know,"
17:15,420;17:19,260;"whatever research staff he has, the Greg Browns of the world."
17:19,260;17:23,660;"I mean, the only thing I had was that he sticks him right between the two and the eight,"
17:23,660;17:26,140;"and I kind of figured what that meant pretty quickly."
17:26,140;17:31,420;"You figure that out? Did you like the comment about the the referees having those East German"
17:31,420;17:35,100;"surplus microphones that aren't working again? No, I missed that what's going on."
17:35,100;17:40,300;"Yeah. Well, did you not hear the referees because neither did anybody else because"
17:40,300;17:43,980;"everybody else. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah."
17:43,980;17:49,820;"I mean, it's a that bloods will throw us a more catchable ball. How do you feel about that as a"
17:49,820;17:50,820;"the blood so stand."
17:50,820;17:53,340;"- I don't know."
17:53,340;17:55,940;"I mean, they also said this."
17:55,940;17:58,580;"So like we can debate how good they actually were"
17:58,580;18:01,040;"because one of the quotes was,"
18:01,040;18:04,540;"Brady just ripped off and I say ripped off"
18:04,540;18:06,500;"because he looked like he was actually running."
18:06,500;18:08,580;"It was like a 10 yard run for first down."
18:08,580;18:09,500;"And one of the announced it says,"
18:09,500;18:11,940;"""That's one element that Brady adds to the offense"
18:11,940;18:14,200;"""that you won't see with blood so the ability to gain"
18:14,200;18:16,340;"""first downs running the football."""
18:16,340;18:18,300;"I don't know what that statement that lies."
18:18,300;18:22,540;"Is that a shot in the blood so for getting injured instead of getting a first down and"
18:22,540;18:25,020;"Oh, I should blood vessel it in."
18:25,020;18:28,660;"I didn't take it that way by that some shade."
18:28,660;18:33,620;"That is funny in retrospect now that we know that blood says, okay,"
18:33,620;18:35,620;"in retrospect, pretty hilarious."
18:35,620;18:36,460;"Hell yeah."
18:36,460;18:40,860;"So if we want to talk about the presentation, this is really the first"
18:40,860;18:44,380;"prime time game of the Patriots dynasty."
18:45,100;18:49,620;"And it was the first appearance of the yellow first outline."
18:49,620;18:50,320;"Yeah."
18:50,320;18:55,240;"And you, you basically took my best of the game because I didn't even know that."
18:55,240;18:57,900;"I wrote down, is this the first time we've actually seen this?"
18:57,900;19:01,060;"I wasn't sure, but I guess it is with these pagers."
19:01,060;19:01,240;"Yeah."
19:01,240;19:06,960;"Because apparently it was owned by, I think ESPN actually put it together."
19:06,960;19:08,320;"I have a quote here somewhere."
19:08,320;19:11,800;"Um, yeah."
19:11,800;19:13,420;"So this is the, here it is."
19:13,420;19:14,460;"Oh, CBS."
19:14,460;19:19,460;"you knew immediately it wasn't the usual third or fourth string AFC telecast on CBS"
19:19,460;19:23,460;"when the ball was spotted after the play and the yellow first and 10 line appeared"
19:23,460;19:26,460;"for the first time this season on the telecast of a Patriots game."
19:26,460;19:30,460;"It's usually reserved for the key national games because of the $25,000 per game"
19:30,460;19:31,460;"expense."
19:31,460;19:34,460;"That is some foresight."
19:34,460;19:38,460;"Yeah, so they're up in 25 G's for a lion."
19:38,460;19:40,460;"Yeah, but now everybody uses it."
19:40,460;19:43,460;"Yeah, but now how do you feel about because I love that yellow line because I'm"
19:43,460;19:45,460;"because I'm a lazy viewer."
19:45,460;19:51,460;"But and plus it creates like great conversations in bars and at friends homes, but"
19:51,460;19:59,380;"How does it compare with the hockey puck that used to like glow and it was like I'm higher. Why would that never stick?"
19:59,380;20:07,540;"Because we're because like, you know hockey fans are like macho like oh hockey"
20:07,540;20:11,540;"Yeah"
20:11,700;20:14,340;"casual fan who hockey fans hate."
20:14,340;20:17,380;"I don't think they're already casual hockey fans is the problem."
20:17,380;20:20,900;"It's like casual lacrosse fans. That's not a thing."
20:20,900;20:25,140;"They were offended by the glowing hockey."
20:25,140;20:26,580;"I can see that. Yeah."
20:26,580;20:35,220;"So, but yeah, I mean, on that note, watching games now, I realize the things that I think"
20:35,220;20:38,180;"when they first came out, I used to hate, but I don't anymore. Like when they actually put"
20:38,820;20:43,300;"the down and distance like they displayed on the field you know with that like arrow below the"
20:43,300;20:49,140;"where they all line up and i kind of missed that because i can never quite find it in time on these"
20:49,140;20:53,220;"telecasts because they only show it like before the game then it goes away when the play happens"
20:53,220;20:56,900;"i'm like this seems to play and i look up to find out like what down that was because i've already"
20:56,900;21:04,820;"forgotten because i have ADD and i have no idea what down a distance it is uh that doesn't happen to me"
21:04,820;21:08,260;"That sounds like a personal problem. Well, that's because I watch the games though."
21:08,260;21:13,860;"Oh, shots fired there. Oh, it's going to be a greater issue here. And"
21:13,860;21:17,460;"I'm watching the game as a speech. I know."
21:17,460;21:22,740;"You might get to the end of the game by the time we finish the podcast. I mean, we'll see."
21:22,740;21:29,700;"But that that is also something to talk about maybe for another time, but you throw around"
21:29,700;21:32,880;"on the ADD, is this, what do you mean by that?"
21:32,880;21:36,300;"Is it a flip it remark, or are you talking about actual"
21:36,300;21:37,260;"problems here?"
21:37,260;21:40,120;"Because if that's the case, then we're good."
21:40,120;21:43,020;"But if not, don't throw that shit around, Andy."
21:43,020;21:45,140;"- It's both, I can say it, 'cause I have it."
21:45,140;21:45,980;"- Okay, fine."
21:45,980;21:47,500;"- I can joke about it, 'cause I am one."
21:47,500;21:50,180;"- All right, now with your tone, it makes me feel bad."
21:50,180;21:51,020;"So."
21:51,020;21:52,020;"(laughing)"
21:52,020;21:56,060;"- I can joke about it because I abuse prescription drugs"
21:56,060;21:57,580;"that I'm not prescribed to."
21:57,580;21:59,980;"- Oh, all right."
21:59,980;22:01,380;"- Oh, that was loud."
22:01,380;22:05,780;"Sorry I brought it up, I don't know what to say."
22:05,780;22:09,140;"- Well, I got a lot about this one."
22:09,140;22:09,980;"- Yeah."
22:09,980;22:10,860;"- It's just my head."
22:10,860;22:15,060;"What do you think about if they were to,"
22:15,060;22:18,660;"like come up with technology to make that line visible"
22:18,660;22:19,860;"to the players?"
22:19,860;22:24,860;"- Well, all right."
22:24,860;22:28,580;"So I'll run with this."
22:28,580;22:29,700;"That's a good question."
22:29,700;22:31,180;"I think, no, here you go."
22:31,180;22:32,020;"Here's what you need to do."
22:32,020;22:33,060;"It can't just be--"
22:33,060;22:34,780;"because I think if it's going to be that,"
22:34,780;22:36,140;"it's going to be like lasers and shit, right?"
22:36,140;22:36,660;"Right."
22:36,660;22:37,580;"So yeah."
22:37,580;22:39,220;"So if you're going to be doing lasers and shit"
22:39,220;22:42,260;"in the field, you may as well just get rid of the sticks"
22:42,260;22:45,700;"and just like laser measure, like,"
22:45,700;22:47,900;"put a chip in the ball or some bullshit like that,"
22:47,900;22:52,500;"and then have both the line of scrimmage"
22:52,500;22:54,540;"be like laser etched on the field or whatever."
22:54,540;22:58,180;"and the laser displayed, BPRONOC could be etching anything."
22:58,180;23:01,260;"But then also the first down is exactly 10 yards away"
23:01,260;23:02,740;"to the millimeter."
23:02,740;23:03,980;"And so when they put the ball down,"
23:03,980;23:06,900;"as long as it breaks the line."
23:06,900;23:07,740;"- I gotta cut you off."
23:07,740;23:09,140;"I gotta cut you off."
23:09,140;23:09,980;"I gotta cut you off."
23:09,980;23:10,820;"- The first down."
23:10,820;23:12,460;"- You can't talk about this now because--"
23:12,460;23:13,620;"- Can you hear what a referee's?"
23:13,620;23:15,140;"- No, no, no, what you gotta do is--"
23:15,140;23:17,140;"- I'm gonna do it. - I'm gonna do it, dude, dude."
23:17,140;23:19,060;"You gotta keep it under wraps."
23:19,060;23:22,140;"This is why I want you to patent this idea."
23:22,140;23:24,260;"I don't know how to do all that shit,"
23:24,260;23:25,580;"that you just do it."
23:25,580;23:28,580;"And then you go into Shark Tank."
23:28,580;23:32,500;"And then you pitch this shit and then you license it."
23:32,500;23:33,340;"- Okay."
23:33,340;23:35,220;"- 'Cause that's what they tell me."
23:35,220;23:36,820;"'Cause I've been watching it recently."
23:36,820;23:39,020;"- I would need a name for this company though."
23:39,020;23:43,140;"It's gotta be something hip."
23:43,140;23:43,980;"- Yeah, that's what I mean."
23:43,980;23:46,700;"- That could also be translated to like classrooms"
23:46,700;23:48,540;"and like-- - It could be like laser lines."
23:48,540;23:50,180;"- Circumstance. - But with no vowels."
23:50,180;23:51,580;"Or like a hashtag laser lines."
23:51,580;23:55,460;"LZRLYN. Yeah."
23:55,460;23:57,820;"Done. All right."
23:57,820;24:01,660;"So, Sam, so everybody's hoping to don't patent this."
24:01,660;24:03,460;"Yeah, it's a really good idea."
24:03,460;24:07,620;"Because, I mean, we're talking about this probably six months in the past from when people are"
24:07,620;24:11,460;"listening, but I'm pretty sure that I wanted to patent it by then."
24:11,460;24:13,220;"What about, like, here's another idea."
24:13,220;24:17,420;"It's a little out of left field, but maybe it works out and I just thought of it."
24:17,420;24:21,860;"if you get tackled, the ball hits the ground and then the grass"
24:21,860;24:26,360;"like self paints itself. So that like, like, this line gets"
24:26,360;24:29,820;"painted real time on the field."
24:29,820;24:33,860;"You know what I mean? And then like, and then they like"
24:33,860;24:36,540;"paints itself green again. Like, you need a lot of paint for"
24:36,540;24:39,020;"this idea, but like, it seems more reasonable."
24:39,020;24:43,140;"What about let's let's play off of that then. If instead of the"
24:43,140;24:45,260;"grass painting itself, because I feel like that'd be a lot of"
24:45,260;24:52,140;"effort to ask on the house. We just hire homeless children with paint rollers to run out and just"
24:52,140;24:58,140;"paint lines every time they're the first down. That was my original thought when this whole"
24:58,140;25:05,260;"homeless children were on the phone paying off so much for clarification. I don't know where this"
25:05,260;25:11,260;"is going. This is going to hell and I have a basket and I'm out of a rum. The technology"
25:11,260;25:15,260;"I mean, you see tennis and they do that zoom in thing."
25:15,260;25:16,100;"- Yeah, yeah."
25:16,100;25:20,900;"- And then we got like old dudes carrying chains."
25:20,900;25:23,300;"No, it's like, it's like $1,000,000 a leak."
25:23,300;25:26,660;"- And it's probably 10-ish yards apart"
25:26,660;25:28,220;"as long as there's kings in the chain"
25:28,220;25:29,380;"and as long as it's straight"
25:29,380;25:31,780;"and as long as it's put down in the correct spot initially."
25:31,780;25:33,300;"- It is a pretty basic system,"
25:33,300;25:35,660;"now you know, we bring this up."
25:35,660;25:36,500;"- Yeah."
25:36,500;25:37,340;"- Oh yeah."
25:37,340;25:40,260;"- But do you think it adds to the intrigue?"
25:40,260;26:09,740;"and the old timey charm just like the referee wearing hats and that they're like stirrups or whatever that shit is a little like their baseball players you got lost. Right. All right. I'll go ahead. But there is a certain skill to it like as far as can the players see it. Some players do have that like internal. I know where the line is like the Kevin Fox and the. Yep. Yep."
26:09,740;26:14,620;"where they'll catch it and they'll fall forward exactly where they need to."
26:14,620;26:15,180;"That's true."
26:15,180;26:18,140;"They don't want to get rid of that skill, you know?"
26:18,140;26:21,580;"And as Andy pointed out, Drew Bleds did not have that skill."
26:21,580;26:24,940;"No, that wasn't me. That was your quote, bud."
26:24,940;26:28,540;"Dude, I don't know what has been said so far, but I will say this."
26:28,540;26:32,780;"They mentioned that half of the blood in Bleds O's body bled out."
26:32,780;26:33,580;"Yes."
26:33,580;26:34,540;"That's a fuck."
26:34,540;26:36,380;"That could be my worst, yeah."
26:36,380;26:37,980;"But they got it all back in."
26:37,980;26:40,380;"- They pumped it back in."
26:40,380;26:41,860;"Where'd they find the blood that they like"
26:41,860;26:43,300;"scraping off the grass?"
26:43,300;26:45,500;"I mean, was it all internal?"
26:45,500;26:47,260;"- Did they use his blood?"
26:47,260;26:48,100;"- I have no idea."
26:48,100;26:49,380;"- They're like calling his son somebody else."
26:49,380;26:51,620;"- I just remember Belichick saying"
26:51,620;26:53,660;"he might be out for like one or two weeks."
26:53,660;26:58,300;"- Yeah, he was a little bit longer than that, but that's okay."
26:58,300;27:00,700;"- Man, half the blood in his body, that's fantastic."
27:00,700;27:01,700;"Modern medicine."
27:01,700;27:06,620;"- Yeah, oh, so actually speaking of bloods as injury,"
27:06,620;27:12,860;"They had an article in the Globe this week before that talking about what the injury actually was."
27:12,860;27:20,140;"And the quote is what he did have was a sheared blood vessel that led to a condition known as hemo forax,"
27:20,140;27:24,140;"in which blood, not air enters the lungs. Jesus fucking Christ."
27:24,140;27:30,060;"In due time, the blood was removed via tube from the lungs and redirected back into his system."
27:30,060;27:32,420;"Honestly, the things you can learn."
27:32,420;27:34,660;"That's insane."
27:35,660;27:43,980;"So he was like part fish for a little bit like he was like breathing blood as opposed to air. That's like some superhero shit. Yeah"
27:43,980;27:49,780;"So I mean I'm assuming this only happened in one of his lungs, right?"
27:49,780;27:53,680;"Was that work maybe it was both well, I mean"
27:53,680;27:59,420;"In fact check it was my artfish syndrome"
27:59,420;28:04,660;"Yeah lung fish"
28:04,660;28:13,140;"So, and on top of that, I know we talked about it at the beginning about like when it happened,"
28:13,140;28:16,020;"we're talking about whether or not he had a concussion."
28:16,020;28:19,460;"And there was another quote in this, this same article talking about that you probably"
28:19,460;28:20,460;"did."
28:20,460;28:24,180;"So the blood so case is interesting because it demonstrates the limited ability of even"
28:24,180;28:27,100;"the most trained doctors to make accurate judgments in a hurry."
28:27,100;28:33,140;"Dr. Sarens was their doctor at the time was standing just a few feet away from where"
28:33,140;28:35,420;"""Bloodsoe was hit, he examined Bloodsoe immediately"
28:35,420;28:38,780;"for any signs of concussion and decided there were none."""
28:38,780;28:42,140;"It continues, ""But Bloodsoe did last just one more seared"
28:42,140;28:44,100;"before Belichick pulled him when it was obvious"
28:44,100;28:47,140;"he wasn't in full command of his faculties."
28:47,140;28:49,340;"I had communication with some of my teammates,"
28:49,340;28:50,980;"and based on that, they went to Bill"
28:50,980;28:53,420;"and said, ""Maybe I should go out,"" Bloodsoe explained."
28:53,420;28:55,820;"What concerned his teammates, Damon Heward"
28:55,820;28:57,940;"and Mark Edwards, was that their quarterback"
28:57,940;29:00,420;"and didn't really know what plays he was running."
29:02,140;29:03,340;"- Sounds like a confession."
29:03,340;29:05,940;"(laughing)"
29:05,940;29:08,940;"- That is that the team doctor who literally was standing"
29:08,940;29:11,140;"a few feet away from when he got hit"
29:11,140;29:13,020;"couldn't diagnose correctly."
29:13,020;29:14,620;"- Oh, he finally says bell wrong."
29:14,620;29:16,580;"- Yeah, I will say this."
29:16,580;29:18,900;"I will say this and I don't want to bring the mood down,"
29:18,900;29:21,660;"but it has to be addressed because this is just released"
29:21,660;29:24,140;"and people listening to this will have a little bit"
29:24,140;29:26,100;"more time to take it in."
29:26,100;29:30,060;"But in talking about getting your bell wrong,"
29:30,060;29:34,660;"which we've all seen like concussions and whatever in our playing days is, you know,"
29:34,660;29:37,700;"previous listeners will know my playing days."
29:37,700;29:39,460;">> All three of them."
29:39,460;29:41,660;">> Right. But they were mean."
29:41,660;29:44,260;"And I was playing cornerback/line, backer, don't get me started."
29:44,260;29:50,220;"But, yeah, with concussions becoming like a bigger thing,"
29:50,220;29:54,940;"there was the Aaron Hernandez documentary, which I think a lot of it is already common knowledge."
29:54,940;30:02,940;"But we also see the Antonio Brown stuff kind of escalating pretty quickly since the last few episodes."
30:02,940;30:09,940;"And then also in one of the articles that you posted, it was talking about Leon Gray who kind of, you know,"
30:09,940;30:14,940;"withered away and passed in his like apartment, which I think he was in his 40s."
30:14,940;30:19,940;"And there was some suspicions about what led to that."
30:19,940;30:25,940;"There's another player who passed homeless on the street by himself."
30:25,940;30:30,660;"And then I was looking at an article on Tony O'Brien on the Steelers."
30:30,660;30:33,300;"There was like a, you know, a Hall of Fame center."
30:33,300;30:40,500;"Forgive his name, but he passed sort of homeless and had problems and they were,"
30:40,500;30:44,420;"they were just, the teams kind of turned their back on them."
30:44,420;30:47,140;"So what do you think about all that?"
30:47,140;30:53,460;"I mean, and seeing something like that happen a Bledtoe, that could have probably, you know,"
30:53,460;30:57,140;"or at least like it could have changed his life a bit like it did, I think, for Antonio Brown."
30:57,140;31:01,220;"What do you think about like, because I think we've talked about discussions a little bit"
31:01,220;31:07,140;"in this season alone that kind of seemed like it was already popping up a little bit more frequently."
31:07,140;31:13,220;"Yeah, I think you're right. And I think I noticed even in this game,"
31:16,500;31:22,960;"I think they because they flash up a list of all the injuries that had happened in this game to the Rams alone"
31:22,960;31:27,420;"and I believe in Nius Williams was on that list as"
31:27,420;31:30,620;"Having suffered a concussion"
31:30,620;31:34,180;"But then like a few players later who's in there making the tackle"
31:34,180;31:39,340;"Or he was in there on the blitz putting his his helmet in Tom Brady's chest"
31:39,340;31:45,100;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah, like so he's still out there leading with his head even after he had been"
31:45,780;31:48,980;"diagnosed with a concussion, they let them back in there"
31:48,980;31:50,220;"to continue playing."
31:50,220;31:54,580;"So I think it's like just looking back at it now"
31:54,580;31:58,420;"from what we know is going on these days"
31:58,420;31:59,740;"with the information that we have"
31:59,740;32:02,140;"and like how much more research has been put into it,"
32:02,140;32:04,660;"especially with CTE and everything,"
32:04,660;32:07,100;"it does have a different tone to it"
32:07,100;32:08,940;"than just like, you know, rub some dirt on it"
32:08,940;32:10,660;"and get back out there."
32:10,660;32:11,500;"- Right. - It seems like"
32:11,500;32:13,660;"that's what it used to be."
32:13,660;32:14,780;"- Oh, it definitely was."
32:14,780;32:16,980;"I'm wondering, I mean, obviously they're taking steps"
32:16,980;32:18,660;"to kind of prevent some of the stuff."
32:18,660;32:21,100;"Maybe this year they're talking about removing kickoffs"
32:21,100;32:22,500;"altogether and whatnot."
32:22,500;32:24,660;"And, you know, I don't know if that's good or bad,"
32:24,660;32:27,260;"but do they that it's just prevalent to this?"
32:27,260;32:28,820;"And I know that it's like guys banging their heads"
32:28,820;32:31,820;"against each other, but like I hear like soccer players"
32:31,820;32:32,660;"have this."
32:32,660;32:34,060;"So is it like inherently a sports thing"
32:34,060;32:35,460;"or do you think it's primarily like,"
32:35,460;32:38,020;"and obviously we don't know at the moment, but."
32:38,020;32:39,340;"- Yeah."
32:39,340;32:43,740;"I think, I mean, obviously I'm just making shit up now."
32:43,740;32:54,240;"But I think that it's probably prevalent in the majority of sports because like they say you can get this like they're seeing CTE and soccer players from heading the ball and shit like that."
32:54,240;32:57,640;"Which is a big part of soccer, but I think that you're."
32:57,640;33:00,480;"I feel that."
33:00,480;33:06,080;"Sports like football and probably to a certain extent, maybe like rugby and things like that."
33:06,880;33:10,720;"those collision sports hockey, those sorts of things."
33:10,720;33:16,600;"I think you'll see it like worst cases of CTE in the future."
33:16,600;33:21,820;"Like I think you'll see it in all sports, but it will be more severe in the ones"
33:21,820;33:23,700;"where there's like collisions all the time."
33:23,700;33:25,700;"Like I have an offensive defensive line."
33:25,700;33:27,200;"That's kind of what they do every play."
33:27,200;33:29,100;"They just bash heads with each other."
33:29,100;33:33,700;"So I don't know how you fix it either because hitting is part of the game."
33:33,700;33:36,380;"And it's not like it has to be these big hits."
33:36,380;33:41,580;"take it. It's all the hits that kind of pile up is what it seems to be where the research is"
33:41,580;33:47,500;"is going with this. Right. You don't you don't have to solve it but you you can do things like"
33:47,500;33:54,060;"give the players lifetime health insurance. Right. Yeah. True. That yeah. You're not doing"
33:54,060;33:58,460;"that right now. Especially with the money that they're making hand over fist."
33:58,460;34:03,580;"Yeah. It's not like you can afford it. The teams don't give a shit once they cut you know."
34:03,580;34:05,260;"It's not falling off."
34:05,260;34:09,940;"So like make that require them to give them health insurance."
34:09,940;34:10,780;"- Yeah."
34:10,780;34:12,180;"- For these sacrifice in their body"
34:12,180;34:13,020;"so you can make all that money."
34:13,020;34:15,380;"Like that's an easy solution"
34:15,380;34:18,100;"that doesn't take any doctors or research or anything, right?"
34:18,100;34:18,940;"- It's true."
34:18,940;34:21,100;"- And continues the sport too."
34:21,100;34:24,380;"Because I think it shows response to the players."
34:24,380;34:25,380;"- Yep."
34:25,380;34:28,500;"But I mean, I think there's, I don't know how true it is"
34:28,500;34:29,500;"or what the numbers are,"
34:29,500;34:31,420;"but there's been stories out there"
34:31,420;34:36,420;"how youth football and participation in it is declining rapidly."
34:36,420;34:41,260;"So does it get to a point where you just don't have the same pool of players to choose from?"
34:41,260;34:45,340;"Yeah, I mean, I think there is something to that."
34:45,340;34:53,140;"I mean, obviously it's always going to offer an opportunity for anybody who doesn't have any other way to make an income or make a big splash like that."
34:53,140;34:55,420;"And it can kind of provide opportunities."
34:55,420;34:58,380;"But yeah, I think it does affect me."
34:58,380;34:59,340;"That's a good idea."
34:59,420;35:01,340;"I've always been on the camp of like,"
35:01,340;35:04,780;"we probably didn't know all this info years past,"
35:04,780;35:07,220;"but you know that banging your head against somebody else"
35:07,220;35:09,520;"is not the greatest thing inherently."
35:09,520;35:12,300;"But, and it's their choice."
35:12,300;35:15,860;"But like Greg said, maybe that would, you know,"
35:15,860;35:17,340;"fix something."
35:17,340;35:19,580;"Obviously these people are putting their body"
35:19,580;35:21,460;"through the ringer and their minds, but, you know,"
35:21,460;35:23,500;"I think a lot of them do that for their families"
35:23,500;35:26,620;"and it's a conscious decision, but at least make it"
35:26,620;35:29,020;"a little bit more humane while we're trying to clean it up"
35:29,020;35:34,900;"a little bit. Yeah, we'll see how it goes. I don't know. And for"
35:34,900;35:37,260;"anybody who's listening, we didn't solve shit with that"
35:37,260;35:42,140;"conversation. And I don't want to hear it. So you could tweet at"
35:42,140;35:49,060;"Mike. No Twitter. No Twitter. All right. You're that social"
35:49,060;35:52,700;"media. All right. So"
35:52,700;35:58,300;"Oh, yeah, I was gonna try to pull a true blood so cold out of"
35:58,300;36:02,620;"thing, but the only comment I have on Drew Bloods is that he blood out half the blood in his body."
36:02,620;36:07,900;"All right. Well, glad I derailed everything."
36:07,900;36:13,260;"That's not true. So I will I think we can get to it a little bit, but"
36:13,260;36:20,380;"so what are your kind of initial thoughts on this game? Because Mike, I know you were a bit"
36:20,380;36:24,380;"more down on it than I was talking to you before we started this."
36:24,940;36:30,540;"Right. I mean, it was interesting because I thought that the first half, you know, overall,"
36:30,540;36:34,140;"speaking, we can get into it, but the first half, it kind of seemed like it was a little bit more"
36:34,140;36:41,180;"competitive. Defense was, you know, holding their own. And then sort of in the second half,"
36:41,180;36:45,980;"which I still understand why they would be encouraged after this loss allegedly."
36:45,980;36:52,780;"But it kind of seemed like it became the Marshall Fox show and it was just run it down to their"
36:52,780;36:56,780;"of throats every single play until time for them out."
36:56,780;36:57,780;"Yeah."
36:57,780;36:59,580;"So let's just touch on a little bit."
36:59,580;37:05,860;"So first quarter, the page is on their first drive."
37:05,860;37:08,900;"Brady throws an interception deep in his own territory."
37:08,900;37:10,300;"He basically hits Falk in the hands,"
37:10,300;37:14,100;"Kevin Falk in the hands with a heater and bounces off"
37:14,100;37:15,580;"and he gets picked off."
37:15,580;37:18,500;"So the Rams start on like inside the 20 and score touchdown"
37:18,500;37:20,380;"three plays later."
37:20,380;37:24,740;"Ryan and I will say it started off pretty well because the game opened with like two"
37:24,740;37:29,260;"batted balls that Kurt Warner threw and then all of a sudden in the third play throws"
37:29,260;37:36,020;"a 35 yard pass Isaac Bruce and it was like really well covered by tie law. So even though"
37:36,020;37:40,180;"it's a good start for the D because they stopped them on that drive. It was tough letting"
37:40,180;37:41,180;"the whole game."
37:41,180;37:48,700;"Yeah. Yeah. But I think that the past defense definitely gave Warner trouble. I think this"
37:48,700;37:57,060;"this game, especially was one that the Patriots brought pressure more than I can ever remember,"
37:57,060;38:04,540;"which against a team with this firepower seems really ballsy to me. But they were it seemed"
38:04,540;38:09,220;"like they were bringing at least five or six guys every every defensive play from all"
38:09,220;38:11,220;"and"
38:11,220;38:19,100;"We haven't like gone over the roster like we usually have but just true looking at that like Tory Holt Isaac Bruce Ricky parole"
38:19,100;38:23,300;"Trung candidate, which was like super fast martial fock and that's like"
38:23,300;38:30,020;"offense but defense like Dre Bligh and Nia's Williams London Fletcher Leonard little like this team was stacked"
38:30,020;38:33,340;"Yeah, oh they had some some big fucking names"
38:35,500;38:39,140;"And like all those people you just mentioned went to the pro bowl"
38:39,140;38:43,180;"Kurt warner Tory whole Isaac Bruce Marshall fog. They were all pro bowlers"
38:43,180;38:45,900;"Falcon Kurt Warner were first team all pros"
38:45,900;38:48,180;"and"
38:48,180;38:49,940;"Marshall fog was"
38:49,940;38:55,860;"Basically a video game at this point. What was this the year he was on the cover Madden was around this time?"
38:55,860;38:59,220;"Maybe like 99"
39:00,380;39:05,500;"is the curse usually gets you. Yeah. So so yes, this is probably on 2000 be my"
39:05,500;39:14,620;"guess. Greg Statchek. But this was, I mean, talking about puns versus TV. This is"
39:14,620;39:21,820;"another rabbit hole. I went down. Marshall Falk in this season outscored the kicker."
39:21,820;39:28,700;"128 points of 127, which is hard to do because the kickers get, you know, a point every time"
39:28,700;39:30,900;"we'd go to touch down plus all the field goals and all that jazz."
39:30,900;39:36,900;"So the out of the top 20 scores of all time in the league,"
39:36,900;39:41,380;"15 of those are our kickers, which, yeah,"
39:41,380;39:43,940;"which doesn't seem right."
39:43,940;39:48,180;"And I would tell you who they were if this page would load, but, um,"
39:48,180;39:51,580;"2003 bad and tough."
39:51,580;39:52,140;"Really."
39:52,140;39:54,860;"So yeah."
39:56,180;40:00,180;"But yeah, so the only top 20,"
40:00,180;40:04,460;"the only players who aren't kickers"
40:04,460;40:06,540;"are actually running back, surprisingly."
40:06,540;40:09,020;"So,"
40:09,020;40:12,500;"Lydanian Thomason,"
40:12,500;40:16,260;"in terms of points in a single season,"
40:16,260;40:18,460;"like points scored."
40:18,460;40:21,940;"Lydanian Thomason first place in 2006."
40:21,940;40:24,500;"That was the year he had 31 rushing touchdowns."
40:24,500;40:25,500;"- Yeah, that's unbelievable."
40:25,500;40:26,340;"Was it rushing touch?"
40:26,340;40:27,340;"I don't know if they were all rushing touch now,"
40:27,340;40:28,860;"but yeah, like some take its amount."
40:28,860;40:32,740;"Yeah, but so he's got 186 points."
40:32,740;40:34,740;"- Should I have Alexander on there?"
40:34,740;40:38,740;"- He's second in 2005 with 168 points."
40:38,740;40:40,780;"So it's, he's a distant second."
40:40,780;40:42,080;"He's got 28 touchdowns."
40:42,080;40:46,340;"And then it's kickers, David acres,"
40:46,340;40:47,980;"Gary Anderson, Jeff Wilkins,"
40:47,980;40:51,260;"Priest Holmes in sixth place."
40:51,260;40:53,060;"He scored 27 touchdowns."
40:54,580;40:58,140;"Mark Mosley who, oh, I actually know who the fuck Mark Mosley is."
40:58,140;41:00,100;"He doesn't have a position."
41:00,100;41:02,220;"Mark Tier, he is also a kicker."
41:02,220;41:05,820;"- Let's edit that one out and just like pretend that like,"
41:05,820;41:07,340;"like do the research and then pretend that we knew"
41:07,340;41:08,340;"what we were talking about."
41:08,340;41:10,820;"- Ah, he's from the 83 Washington Redskins."
41:10,820;41:11,820;"So there you go."
41:11,820;41:12,660;"- Who was that?"
41:12,660;41:13,900;"Oh, Mosley?"
41:13,900;41:14,740;"- Yeah, Mark."
41:14,740;41:15,820;"- Oh, obviously, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
41:15,820;41:16,740;"- Yeah, you know him."
41:16,740;41:17,580;"- Me, yeah."
41:17,580;41:21,180;"- He was 62 of 63 on field goals, on extra points."
41:21,180;41:24,140;"- Mark Mosley, you know."
41:24,140;41:32,100;"Oh, sorry. But then an eighth place was this year's Marshall Falk with 160 points, which is out of control."
41:32,100;41:34,700;"That's basically pretty good. Pretty good."
41:34,700;41:45,100;"Yeah. So yeah, he would, like you said, I mean, this is why he, the second half looked like the Marshall Falk show because the whole season was the Marshall Falk show."
41:45,100;41:53,700;"Yeah, I also like made the note and I don't know if there's any correlation, but the way that Marshall Falk was used in this game,"
41:53,860;41:57,020;"It sort of very much beat up the Patriots."
41:57,020;42:02,620;"And this was before the Patriots incorporated the Scatback."
42:02,620;42:06,140;"So it's pretty much just like, run up the middle,"
42:06,140;42:08,220;"run up the middle, kind of beat people down."
42:08,220;42:10,300;"So you think that playing a guy like Marshall Fox"
42:10,300;42:12,900;"sort of changed his philosophy."
42:12,900;42:15,060;"Because I feel like as the years continued,"
42:15,060;42:19,100;"the Patriots now are sort of known for those like flexbacks"
42:19,100;42:22,540;"that are going to do a million things."
42:22,540;42:25,260;"Vereen, all the way to like James White."
42:25,260;42:27,260;"So you think that would have."
42:27,260;42:28,660;"Yeah, exactly."
42:28,660;42:30,740;"So do you think that like I was thinking about it?"
42:30,740;42:35,340;"I'm like, did this game maybe introduce that into his mind or at least like facing"
42:35,340;42:36,180;"him a couple of times?"
42:36,180;42:41,020;"Um, maybe a little bit, but I think they already had Kevin Falk on the team."
42:41,020;42:43,380;"I know, but he was like, I think."
42:43,380;42:48,300;"Yeah, I think this was, and I think this happened with not just the"
42:48,300;42:56,540;"Patriots were because it's a copycat league. And now I think people started to make their"
42:56,540;43:01,980;"wide receivers be more of a receiving threat. But having said that, I mean, the Patriots"
43:01,980;43:07,020;"from week one have been splitting their full back out wide and five wide receiver sets."
43:07,020;43:12,620;"Yeah, it's true. I mean, right. I mean, I feel like that's more gimmick than anything,"
43:12,620;43:17,820;"but it is the start of something. I mean, so who is the originator of that? Does it go"
43:17,820;43:21,820;"back to, I don't know, like the West Coast offense, when it was instilled, they're like,"
43:21,820;43:23,620;"who started that like, Scapback thing?"
43:23,620;43:26,380;"That's a great question."
43:26,380;43:27,340;"I don't know."
43:27,340;43:28,300;"All right."
43:28,300;43:29,820;"Again, we're going to pause."
43:29,820;43:32,540;"Get our information straight and we'll come right back."
43:32,540;43:38,780;"And so we'll just, we'll just have a, our listeners tell us on Twitter, because nobody"
43:38,780;43:42,020;"loves to tell you when you're wrong, like Twitter does."
43:42,020;43:46,140;"So if you know the answer, tweet @mikemellow."
43:46,540;43:47,540;"I don't have Twitter, man."
43:47,540;43:50,420;"That's how I, that's how I escape this bullshit."
43:50,420;43:51,420;"No social media."
43:51,420;43:52,900;"So, well, here's what we're going to do."
43:52,900;43:59,700;"So you can, you can tweet at our Pat's Dynasty info, but, but make sure it's made out to"
43:59,700;44:00,700;"Mike Mello."
44:00,700;44:03,060;"I won't read it because I don't give a damn."
44:03,060;44:04,060;"Oh, yeah."
44:04,060;44:05,060;"Well, we'll read it to you."
44:05,060;44:06,060;"So don't worry about it."
44:06,060;44:07,060;"It's cool."
44:07,060;44:08,540;"I won't listen because I don't really."
44:08,540;44:12,380;"I'm barely paying attention now."
44:12,380;44:14,180;"So live reactions."
44:14,180;44:15,180;"Live reactions."
44:15,180;44:18,900;"Yeah, maybe eventually we will be live and then maybe I'll give it to him"
44:18,900;44:24,460;"Maybe if somebody calls it eventually we get that whole thing set up. Maybe I'll hear that's a good human"
44:24,460;44:29,380;"Contact we have the technology. All right. We'll do that just for you"
44:29,380;44:35,020;"So eventually when these come live shows if we get Lee Johnson on would you"
44:35,020;44:38,300;"Would you would you listen to him?"
44:38,300;44:40,940;"You know"
44:40,940;44:45,180;"I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. I did I was a big, big fan."
44:45,180;44:51,100;"Way back. I mean, his career started before I was born. I was still a fan. I was in the womb"
44:51,100;44:56,620;"kind of pulling for the guy. So I bet you were. I would be I would be into having my conversation."
44:56,620;45:01,660;"Good. Try and it's like mustard sauce. That was him, right?"
45:01,660;45:06,300;"I think so. I kind of remember was that Ken Walter was one of the punters."
45:06,300;45:09,020;"All right. Well, even a page is punter. I don't remember."
45:10,220;45:12,220;"It's sausage to you."
45:12,220;45:17,500;"All right, so yeah, so I think you're right about the this being a game of two halves"
45:17,500;45:23,520;"The Patriots hung in in the first half because they had two interceptions in the first quarter off of"
45:23,520;45:26,820;"Warner was a pick six by Terrell Buckley"
45:26,820;45:31,200;"Which I don't know why I didn't remember that play happening, but it was a legit"
45:31,200;45:36,420;"A legit play it was definitely the highlight of the game. I think I mean"
45:37,420;45:39,420;"77 at that point"
45:39,420;45:47,180;"It's because they lost I am having an effect. I have way more distinct memories of wins. Oh, yeah"
45:47,180;45:49,920;"It's so true. I could just put it out of your mind. You move on"
45:49,920;45:53,580;"Recent and I probably didn't watch any highlights or you know, yeah"
45:53,580;45:58,660;"Team loses you just ignore it. Yeah, you know, you don't watch the past fifth quarter anything like that"
45:58,660;46:00,660;"You just kind of turn the TV off and walk away"
46:00,660;46:04,220;"I've noticed that a few times. Yeah, yeah me too"
46:04,540;46:09,140;"Although I going back to the shit on Andy episode from a few weeks ago"
46:09,140;46:14,740;"I think this this is one of the first games that I think I was still at home for"
46:14,740;46:18,580;"Either I come home for Christmas break or I had stayed home for Christmas"
46:18,580;46:21,020;"so"
46:21,020;46:23,340;"So I do actually remember watching this game"
46:23,340;46:29,300;"I will say that the the pick sixes that you're talking about"
46:29,300;46:33,180;"I mean one or three one to throw a buckly like you said and then the next"
46:33,180;46:37,540;"drive, one or three with a pick to Teddy Bruski at like the Rams 40."
46:37,540;46:41,700;"So you would think that would be a game defining moment."
46:41,700;46:42,940;"But it was not"
46:42,940;46:45,060;"like it. Well, I think it's just because it was early."
46:45,060;46:50,260;"It's like watching the Falcons pass Super Bowl like the Rams were driving up"
46:50,260;46:53,100;"and down the field the entire time, almost like the Colts game earlier in this."
46:53,100;46:57,340;"Well, both Colts games earlier in this season where Manning and the Colts could"
46:57,340;47:01,460;"drive all the way up and down the field, but then they'd stall and miss field goals"
47:01,460;47:04,820;"or go for it and forth down or not get it sort of thing."
47:04,820;47:08,260;"And I think that was happening in the first half."
47:08,260;47:13,940;"Because yeah, the Rams threw two picks in the first quarter,"
47:13,940;47:17,500;"punted once in the first on their opening drive,"
47:17,500;47:19,380;"missed a field goal in the second quarter."
47:19,380;47:20,940;"But then they missed a field goal,"
47:20,940;47:24,700;"passed drive down inside the five,"
47:24,700;47:30,460;"going to take a 17-7 lead instead, Antoine Smith"
47:30,460;47:33,260;"Fumbles the ball, Rams get the ball in their own."
47:33,260;47:34,660;"Was it three yard line, something like that?"
47:34,660;47:35,500;"Two three yard line?"
47:35,500;47:36,340;"- Yeah, I think so."
47:36,340;47:37,180;"That's two, yeah, something."
47:37,180;47:39,740;"- With two minutes left in the half"
47:39,740;47:42,780;"and drive 97 yards for a touchdown."
47:42,780;47:45,420;"- Yeah, averaging like 20 yards a play."
47:45,420;47:46,420;"- Yeah, that was incredible."
47:46,420;47:48,740;"That leg, I mean, that swung everything obviously"
47:48,740;47:50,220;"and poor hands once a month at a time."
47:50,220;47:55,220;"That sucks, but that two minute drill was flawless."
47:55,220;47:57,580;"It was nasty."
47:57,580;47:58,900;"- It didn't even look like they were trying."
47:58,900;48:03,260;"They weren't huddling up between plays and shit and taking time out at random times,"
48:03,260;48:05,260;"but they still, like, it didn't matter."
48:05,260;48:10,740;"It just felt like the Patriots had done so well up until this point with how much pressure"
48:10,740;48:14,620;"they were getting on Warner, and then as soon as the two minute warning hit, they backed"
48:14,620;48:17,100;"off and Warner just carved him the pieces."
48:17,100;48:22,500;"Well, I think that the announcers could sense that because I wrote a couple of things like"
48:22,500;48:25,100;"around this time that they were kind of bringing up."
48:25,100;48:30,700;"And one is that they went into this whole story about Antoine Smith and how nice a guy is."
48:30,700;48:32,180;"It is a pretty crazy story."
48:32,180;48:35,020;"But apparently he turned down a scholarship to Auburn."
48:35,020;48:37,460;"He put off college for three years to take care of his parents."
48:37,460;48:39,420;"So I think his grandfather had cancer."
48:39,420;48:41,660;"His grandmother was going to dialysis."
48:41,660;48:46,620;"And he worked at a factory for three years doing this, put everything off, and then got"
48:46,620;48:50,220;"a scholarship to Houston and continued on his path."
48:50,220;48:52,180;"But that's pretty crazy."
48:52,180;48:56,820;"Yeah, yeah, it's kind of similar to the, uh, uh,"
48:56,820;48:59,780;"well, Troy Brown has kind of a similar story and also, uh,"
48:59,780;49:02,020;"David Patney was right."
49:02,020;49:02,940;"They didn't actually mention this game,"
49:02,940;49:04,780;"but they mentioned a few games talking about him."
49:04,780;49:07,660;"Yeah. Chuck it around bags of coffee beans,"
49:07,660;49:08,780;"saxic coffee beans."
49:08,780;49:09,900;"Well, I want,"
49:09,900;49:14,500;"I choose to remember Antoine Smith in this game for his loving heart and not the"
49:14,500;49:15,340;"fumble."
49:15,340;49:17,140;"I'm a little fun."
49:17,140;49:21,860;"And then I thought this was a pretty hilarious, but there was a, uh,"
49:21,900;49:24,340;"They were talking about how Brady was the first"
49:24,340;49:28,660;"Patriot quarterback to have over 65% completion."
49:28,660;49:31,940;"Passing in four straight games."
49:31,940;49:34,500;"So in the hit the Patriots, they never had a quarterback"
49:34,500;49:36,740;"over 65% in four straight games."
49:36,740;49:37,780;"That is unbelievable."
49:37,780;49:41,100;"Including Drew Bledsoe, who was like the saviour of the franchise."
49:41,100;49:42,100;"Right."
49:42,100;49:43,100;"That's unbelievable."
49:43,100;49:46,220;"That's just said that like two of those games, he was at like 70"
49:46,220;49:48,460;"something percent in the other two. He wasn't."
49:48,460;49:50,340;"Right. Right."
49:50,340;49:51,700;"But I still thought it was funny."
49:51,700;49:54,540;"I mean, the guy played like what six or seven games at this point."
49:54,540;49:57,220;"He's already been making some kind of records."
49:57,220;49:58,180;"Yeah."
49:58,180;50:01,300;"I also thought around this time it was funny not to shoot on blood."
50:01,300;50:03,220;"So, but hey, he did it to himself."
50:03,220;50:06,780;"Um, the 90."
50:06,780;50:11,820;"So from 93 to like 2000, he'll win the seven games and you, uh, the Patriots"
50:11,820;50:13,140;"were one in six without him."
50:13,140;50:13,620;"Yeah."
50:13,620;50:17,900;"2001 with Brady at this point, they were five and two."
50:17,900;50:19,540;"So that's pretty amazing."
50:19,540;50:20,380;"Yeah."
50:20,380;50:21,020;"It is."
50:21,060;50:23,160;"Can you name the one win?"
50:23,160;50:26,060;"And the one in six."
50:26,060;50:27,380;"You name the quarterback."
50:27,380;50:29,220;"I want to say it was Zolak."
50:29,220;50:30,580;"I believe it was."
50:30,580;50:33,260;"And it was like he was like pointing to the gods."
50:33,260;50:34,940;"And I think I'm"
50:34,940;50:36,060;"having it up."
50:36,060;50:37,260;"Yeah."
50:37,260;50:38,780;"Forty nineers maybe."
50:38,780;50:40,820;"Was this a Bledto finger finger?"
50:40,820;50:42,100;"Was Zolak the one with the finger?"
50:42,100;50:44,100;"Was that around that time?"
50:44,100;50:45,100;"With the finger?"
50:45,100;50:47,500;"Yeah, it was like a broken finger or something like that."
50:47,500;50:49,700;"Oh, Bledto played through a broken finger."
50:49,700;50:50,780;"Oh, OK."
50:50,780;50:55,000;"I don't remember but I do remember this game until I was like freaking out and you know"
50:55,000;51:02,420;"Yeah, the lacks a he's a bit of a nutcase did that one game set up well for like the rest of his career. I think"
51:02,420;51:08,700;"As a man, I think well just being a backup to Drew Bledso. I think"
51:08,700;51:15,340;"He did have one sick game. He's got that win an NFL win under his belt"
51:15,340;51:18,180;"Which is more than any of us can say so I'll give it to him"
51:18,180;51:22,820;"I was going to the second half."
51:22,820;51:24,620;"I thought the third quarter was actually OK."
51:24,620;51:27,260;"The page was still in it."
51:27,260;51:29,860;"It ended 1710 Rams."
51:29,860;51:31,860;"And it was 1410 at the half."
51:31,860;51:33,340;"So the Rams got a field goal."
51:33,340;51:34,860;"There was out of eight drives."
51:34,860;51:38,500;"No one really went anywhere."
51:38,500;51:39,460;"It was kind of sloppy."
51:39,460;51:43,140;"The Warner had the fumbled snap near midfield."
51:43,140;51:46,500;"He just dropped the snap and the pages recovered."
51:46,500;51:49,480;"the very next play Tom Brady under pressure off his back foot."
51:49,480;51:51,300;"Chuck's an interception to the middle linebacker."
51:51,300;51:52,140;"Whoever the hell that was."
51:52,140;51:52,860;"Mm."
51:52,860;51:55,380;"And again, I'm surprised that bill."
51:55,380;52:02,340;"It's not very bill-like, but again, the alternative is, you know, lots of."
52:02,340;52:03,060;"Yeah."
52:03,060;52:04,100;"Well, yeah."
52:04,100;52:07,420;"Well, we'll get to that in a second because I have some thoughts on that."
52:07,420;52:08,580;"Um, so yeah."
52:08,580;52:12,740;"So, but going into the fourth quarter, the Rams have the ball driving"
52:12,860;52:14,260;"end of the third and the fourth."
52:14,260;52:19,380;"And, uh, they basically just walk down the field and score that touchdown."
52:19,380;52:22,580;"Warner, the, the, the, Warner was getting no pressure on him at this point."
52:22,580;52:24,620;"I think the defense was a bit gassed."
52:24,620;52:30,220;"It'd be on the field so long and he threw a touchdown to his full back,"
52:30,220;52:32,820;"which is the full backs first touchdown."
52:32,820;52:34,620;"Even right now his name, cause I didn't care at this point."
52:34,620;52:38,300;"Um, so that makes it 24 10 Rams."
52:38,300;52:42,700;"And at this point you think it's over, but Brady immediately responds with"
52:42,700;53:02,700;"I think they all six plays were passing plays like they just spread it out wide five wide and just are trucking the ball over the yard and Brady drives them down with touchdown to patent in the back of the end zone, which kind of had a feel of that same touchdown to patent that he would throw in the Super Bowl."
53:02,700;53:03,700;"Mm hmm."
53:03,700;53:08,700;"Kind of that back of the end zone fade but to the other corner this time."
53:08,700;53:15,100;"But then like the next RAN drive was the last drive of the game."
53:15,100;53:19,860;"Because I think they had they got the ball back with like six or seven minutes left."
53:19,860;53:22,860;"And before even getting into that, though, I feel like the"
53:22,860;53:27,300;"announcer touched on this and it was to be fair, the first time that the"
53:27,300;53:30,700;"Patriots sort of opened up the playbook a little bit and allowed Brady to throw"
53:30,700;53:32,260;"more than like a five yard pass."
53:32,260;53:38,460;"So in getting his first opportunity to sort of do that, even after like"
53:38,580;53:40,500;"You know, his interceptions or whatever."
53:40,500;53:44,100;"Um, pretty impressive drive very quick."
53:44,100;53:47,140;"And it was, yeah, it felt very pretty."
53:47,140;53:50,340;"Ask of what you know of him now, where some of the earlier mistakes,"
53:50,340;53:53,580;"like the interceptions that he was throwing, you don't feel like the guy"
53:53,580;53:55,620;"that we, we know and love at this point."
53:55,620;53:58,980;"Well, and they put up like the stat where it was like, you know, to prove that"
53:58,980;54:02,620;"point where they had no big plays because they were dinking and dunking."
54:02,620;54:06,780;"You know, maybe it was a plays of over 10 yards and something like that."
54:06,780;54:10,580;"And the Rams had 22, I think, and the Patriots had four."
54:10,580;54:11,300;"Yep."
54:11,300;54:12,480;"And it was halfway through the fourth,"
54:12,480;54:15,240;"it was before this fourth quarter drive by Brady."
54:15,240;54:19,040;"And I think almost all of the players on that drive, like all six of them were,"
54:19,040;54:21,740;"but we're 10 yards for the most part."
54:21,740;54:23,240;"Yeah."
54:23,240;54:24,120;"So that was interesting."
54:24,120;54:24,900;"Yeah."
54:24,900;54:28,220;"But like you said, the ramping of the ball back and the Patriots defense just"
54:28,220;54:29,660;"can't get off the field on third down."
54:29,660;54:34,900;"And the Rams converted like three or four maybe on the drive and just kept"
54:34,900;54:36,420;"the ball for the last six minutes of the game."
54:36,660;54:39,700;"six minutes. I thought I thought it was like seven and a half, almost eight."
54:39,700;54:44,660;"It may have been even longer that. Yeah. I have the log here. Let's see. When"
54:44,660;54:49,700;"they got the ball back with seven and a half minutes left 737. Yeah. And it was brutal."
54:49,700;54:55,860;"Yeah. Yeah. Let's see. Marshall Falk seven yard run Marshall Falk for yard run."
54:55,860;55:02,180;"Trung candidate one yard run. Kurt Warren, it's a Marshall Falk for two yards."
55:02,180;55:07,580;"Kurt Warner, Marshall Falk for 18 yards, Marshall Falk run of eight yards, minus one"
55:07,580;55:13,900;"yards, nine yards, Kurt Warner runs for no game fumbles it, but recovered by drunk"
55:13,900;55:14,900;"candidate."
55:14,900;55:20,460;"Andy, you're gonna put a listener's sleeve home. 12 is high. It was about to when I was"
55:20,460;55:25,140;"watching this game couldn't get out the field. And I think the backbreaker was third and"
55:25,140;55:31,660;"four 222 left. Like you still have the two minute warring to stop you. To stop the clock,"
55:31,660;55:33,140;"you can get the ball back."
55:33,140;55:36,020;"Third and four Marshall Falls up the middle for 60 yards"
55:36,020;55:38,220;"the game over."
55:38,220;55:39,940;"Yeah, it was 24 17."
55:39,940;55:42,660;"So yeah, say it was still a touchdown lane,"
55:42,660;55:44,220;"but I mean, all the Rams at that point"
55:44,220;55:46,260;"were in field goal range so they could kick the field goal."
55:46,260;55:47,380;"True, true."
55:47,380;55:50,420;"But it took three knees and that was the game."
55:50,420;55:52,780;"It's definitely a different defensive approach"
55:52,780;55:54,380;"than the Super Bowl."
55:54,380;55:56,220;"Yeah, and I think that's that kind of goes back"
55:56,220;55:59,500;"to my point that I started with is that the what"
55:59,500;56:03,820;"the Patriots learn from this game as well, being able to one,"
56:03,820;56:09,100;"kind of judge what they were getting themselves into to know that they can kind"
56:09,100;56:12,740;"of keep pace with this team and give Kurt Warner problems."
56:12,740;56:15,700;"Cause all the stats that they were showing with that, um,"
56:15,700;56:21,220;"this offensive production was way under what it, it, it usually is."
56:21,220;56:24,780;"Like all the averages were, were way lower playing this page's defense."
56:24,780;56:25,540;"So the page is defense."
56:25,540;56:27,420;"knew that they could hang in there."
56:27,420;56:29,980;"And it's just up to the Brady in the office"
56:29,980;56:31,180;"to stop making these mistakes,"
56:31,180;56:33,060;"stop fumbling it within inside the five."
56:33,060;56:34,620;"So you felt like you were kind of right there"
56:34,620;56:36,220;"in the doorstep."
56:36,220;56:41,220;"But you also were able to figure out what else you needed"
56:41,220;56:45,460;"to do to stop things like martial thought going off."
56:45,460;56:48,860;"- I don't know, I think, I kind of feel differently."
56:48,860;56:52,660;"I think it shows that I think the Rams made a lot"
56:52,660;56:54,220;"of mistakes made turnovers."
56:54,220;56:56,820;"in this game could have been a blowout."
56:56,820;56:59,780;"And they were like, ""Ooh, I think we need to try"
56:59,780;57:03,360;"""some different if we're gonna end that's at home"
57:03,360;57:05,660;"""on the grass, we're slowing down."""
57:05,660;57:06,860;"You get a minute."
57:06,860;57:08,060;"- Perfect."
57:08,060;57:10,960;"- Orleans, they said, ""All right, we gotta slow down"
57:10,960;57:14,000;"""these backs coming out of the thing by hitting them,"
57:14,000;57:16,400;"""getting up in the receiver's face on the line,"
57:16,400;57:18,180;"""like actually slowing down."""
57:18,180;57:21,240;"- Boy, I think, I mean, I'm sure we'll get to it"
57:21,240;57:22,700;"when we get to the Super Bowl,"
57:22,700;57:27,140;"But I feel like I remember, you know, three games of glory, something like that,"
57:27,140;57:33,740;"where they talk about the first game, their defensive game plan was to get pressure"
57:33,740;57:36,540;"on Kurt Warner and throw off his timing that way."
57:36,540;57:40,860;"And then when they realized that wasn't going to work because they couldn't get"
57:40,860;57:43,940;"to him in the second half of this game and he started carving in a bit,"
57:43,940;57:51,140;"it was to disrupt the timing by hitting the receivers instead and chipping Marshall"
57:51,140;57:55,540;"far wherever he went and making sure there's somebody there to take away that, I will let"
57:55,540;57:56,540;"it too."
57:56,540;58:00,940;"Yeah, this is the first half of that."
58:00,940;58:07,000;"But you're right, because they did show a stat where this greatest show on turf, like"
58:07,000;58:12,300;"turf is actually a big part of that because the offense as a whole is actually a TD worse,"
58:12,300;58:18,820;"a touchdown worse in production, because they averaged, this is mind-blowing, they averaged"
58:18,820;58:20,580;"35 points per game on turf."
58:20,580;58:25,900;"Well, like since 99 and they're only averaging 28 points per game on grass,"
58:25,900;58:29,680;"which that was seven pats played on turf."
58:29,680;58:31,820;"That would be nasty."
58:31,820;58:33,340;"That would be so awesome."
58:33,340;58:34,140;"Oh, God."
58:34,140;58:36,060;"That would be unfair."
58:36,060;58:37,660;"I think I mean, it was unfair."
58:37,660;58:39,780;"This quarter 75 touchdowns."
58:39,780;58:45,860;"I will say I thought this was a good bill."
58:45,860;58:46,180;"It is."
58:46,180;58:48,580;"Um, but they're talking about that."
58:48,580;58:54,900;"you know, leading up to this game and I'm sure after that, uh, Bill had the scout team face, uh,"
58:54,900;59:01,060;"you know, when they're facing each other, the receivers were lining up at, um, three yards ahead"
59:01,060;59:05,780;"of the ball just to give it to spot that sort of speed that they don't have on the paths to"
59:05,780;59:11,460;"replicate that. But that was funny that he's, you know, thinking that far ahead where he's"
59:11,460;59:17,460;"creating these like weird parameters with the scout team. Yeah. I know that was pretty cool."
59:18,020;59:24,340;"Yeah, and I, yeah, that's just one of those stories I always hear that makes you realize that"
59:24,340;59:29,620;"Belichick is just like further ahead than his coaching counterparts, I think."
59:29,620;59:37,460;"Because he does. He tries to make his, feeling he tries to make his starters practice at a"
59:37,460;59:43,220;"disadvantage so that when they actually get to the game, they're either prepared for it or"
59:45,060;59:50,420;"it comes easier to them because they've been like it's such a disadvantage all week."
59:50,420;59:52,900;"Right. Makes sense."
59:52,900;59:53,700;"Yeah."
59:53,700;59:59,060;"Seems like a great principle. You know, kind of surprised that more coaches aren't like"
59:59,060;01:00:01,460;"ahead of the cariboum things."
01:00:01,460;01:00:04,820;"I mean maybe the armiest one here about it is just because this is, you know,"
01:00:04,820;01:00:08,980;"bell checks being here for so long and so all these stories finally come out after guys retire"
01:00:08,980;01:00:09,620;"sort of thing, you know."
01:00:10,420;01:00:15,760;"That's what I think is like half a bell check success is like culture driven rather than"
01:00:15,760;01:00:16,760;"being genius."
01:00:16,760;01:00:20,280;"Like half of being a good coach is getting player buy in."
01:00:20,280;01:00:23,960;"So that's like this early on."
01:00:23,960;01:00:26,920;"You're basically setting yourself off future success."
01:00:26,920;01:00:27,920;"Oh yeah, absolutely."
01:00:27,920;01:00:28,920;"Good point."
01:00:28,920;01:00:32,120;"I still think there is some genius in there."
01:00:32,120;01:00:33,120;"I mean, he's got his."
01:00:33,120;01:00:39,560;"But I think a lot of genius that may not make it because they have a one two years span"
01:00:39,560;01:00:45,040;"Yeah, I think it's a difference of being a really good like offensive"
01:00:45,040;01:00:50,120;"coordinator and being a really good head coach because head coach you have to"
01:00:50,120;01:00:54,980;"build that that whole system of a team as well instead of just focusing on one"
01:00:54,980;01:00:57,680;"or the other. Yeah, it's probably certain"
01:00:57,680;01:01:03,000;"chances to get a good owner that gives you authority to make decisions or you"
01:01:03,000;01:01:05,480;"kind of hit on a Brady late in the draft."
01:01:05,480;01:01:10,200;"you turn doesn't be a jam like or ruffle or something yeah."
01:01:10,200;01:01:14,600;"Exactly out of your hand but you gotta take those things around."
01:01:14,600;01:01:19,640;"Well I think there's something to be said for him being a genius because along with the culture"
01:01:19,640;01:01:29,480;"you know he cheats and there it is. He does it in a way that is actually brilliant because"
01:01:29,480;01:01:34,360;"he'll cheat five or many years until it like doesn't work anymore and then he'll get caught"
01:01:34,360;01:01:36,760;"And you think, oh my god, these guys again."
01:01:36,760;01:01:39,160;"But then if you look at it the next year,"
01:01:39,160;01:01:40,960;"like it motivates the crap out of the team"
01:01:40,960;01:01:41,880;"because it's not against the world."
01:01:41,880;01:01:44,040;"So the guy uses cheating to his opinion"
01:01:44,040;01:01:46,400;"and then gets caught and uses it again."
01:01:46,400;01:01:48,120;"That's fucking genius."
01:01:48,120;01:01:49,240;"- Once he's done with these, like,"
01:01:49,240;01:01:50,680;"all right, yeah, we can get caught doing this."
01:01:50,680;01:01:51,800;"- Right."
01:01:51,800;01:01:52,800;"It's fucking great."
01:01:52,800;01:01:55,840;"- It helped him beat the Bengals this year."
01:01:55,840;01:02:01,200;"Like, we can send a film crew to the Bengals game."
01:02:01,200;01:02:03,760;"- Dude, he was meeting up with Alex Cora."
01:02:03,760;01:02:09,720;"a few times. I don't know if it's as big a deal in the future when you guys are listening"
01:02:09,720;01:02:14,160;"to this you'll you can chime in but we'll just leave it at that."
01:02:14,160;01:02:22,640;"Of course. Man that's that's a hot take. I like it. Mike's bad. Oh yeah. I'm feeling"
01:02:22,640;01:02:31,640;"good baby. Nice. Alrighty boys have anything else you want to touch on anybody else you"
01:02:31,640;01:02:38,360;"to talk about. Well, I mean, we never really talked about Kurt Warner at all. No. I mean,"
01:02:38,360;01:02:43,160;"he's a pretty, pretty amazing story. Thank you. It's true. And you want to share that"
01:02:43,160;01:02:49,280;"story? Because I do think it's pretty, pretty badass. Yeah. I mean, he was back in groceries"
01:02:49,280;01:02:57,320;"for five, 50 an hour. And then like six years later, he's like running the best offense"
01:02:57,320;01:02:59,120;"in the NFL but three years."
01:02:59,120;01:03:07,680;"I got to say though, even in an NFL uniform, he still has that like grocery bagger look"
01:03:07,680;01:03:08,680;"to him."
01:03:08,680;01:03:09,680;"Dork."
01:03:09,680;01:03:11,440;"Yeah, he did like his stance."
01:03:11,440;01:03:15,400;"I don't want to send any grocery baggers out there."
01:03:15,400;01:03:17,200;"So can you elaborate on that, please?"
01:03:17,200;01:03:20,600;"I don't know if it's like his stance or what it was just like his posture or just the way"
01:03:20,600;01:03:25,600;"he moves, but he doesn't look like a world class athlete to me."
01:03:25,600;01:03:29,680;"the fact he has no chin and he tries to wear that like tiny little chin strap that Brett"
01:03:29,680;01:03:34,320;"Favre used to wear. You know what I'm talking about? It's like it's just like a piece of like"
01:03:34,320;01:03:41,440;"a flap of leather underneath. I don't know what it is. He does not look like an athletic dude."
01:03:41,440;01:03:47,440;"He just doesn't look cool. There is a jackpot. He's a factor for like athletes like Sam Bradford."
01:03:47,440;01:03:49,440;"Not cool. True."
01:03:49,440;01:03:51,440;"He's cool. He's cool."
01:03:51,440;01:03:53,440;"He's cool."
01:03:53,440;01:03:57,440;"And, but also like, yeah, he's just bagging groceries."
01:03:57,440;01:03:59,440;"He's, you know, arena football."
01:03:59,440;01:04:01,440;"He was in NFL, Europe, when that was the thing."
01:04:01,440;01:04:05,440;"All that stuff. But if Frank Green doesn't go down with an injury, same thing."
01:04:05,440;01:04:07,440;"There's no Kurt Warner."
01:04:07,440;01:04:08,440;"Yeah."
01:04:08,440;01:04:09,440;"So that's crazy."
01:04:09,440;01:04:10,440;"And that was like a real good one."
01:04:10,440;01:04:16,440;"There's, there's no, there's no Patriots Super Bowl win theory."
01:04:16,440;01:04:19,220;"There's no so we thought the 9/11"
01:04:19,220;01:04:24,400;"Started the dynasty, but it might have been Trent green it might have been"
01:04:24,400;01:04:30,480;"Well talking in all right. That's what I like about talking to you guys. We're always learning"
01:04:30,480;01:04:32,120;"Wasn't"
01:04:32,120;01:04:35,320;"Ronnie Harrison that hurt Trent green - was it oh?"
01:04:35,320;01:04:39,200;"I don't know we've got to look that one up"
01:04:39,200;01:04:44,080;"Are we all googling right now, this is great radio"
01:04:45,240;01:04:47,240;"It was in 1999"
01:04:47,240;01:04:49,240;"Are you serious?"
01:04:49,240;01:04:53,240;"According to Google here we go in 1999 green was slated to be the starter for the Rams"
01:04:53,240;01:04:58,920;"But suffered a gruesome season ending knee injury in a preseason game on a hit by Rodney Harrison of the Chargers"
01:04:58,920;01:05:02,200;"Wow"
01:05:12,680;01:05:18,680;"Yeah fucking hell yes, this is all a Wikipedia. Wow so Rodney Harrison started the Patriots dynasty"
01:05:18,680;01:05:21,080;"Wow"
01:05:21,080;01:05:23,560;"Somebody tweet that out to him because that's unbelievable"
01:05:23,560;01:05:28,580;"I'm gonna let you do it because I'm scared of shit around here Harrison dare I say"
01:05:28,580;01:05:31,480;"God bless"
01:05:31,480;01:05:36,520;"Oh you like to what oh you like to"
01:05:36,520;01:05:40,080;"Say what what"
01:05:40,320;01:05:42,320;"Yeah, the commercial"
01:05:42,320;01:05:50,660;"Pulled you a lazy river if you wanted it and Rodney guys drilling like this. Oh, you like tubing"
01:05:50,660;01:05:55,440;"Now you're gonna have to post that for us"
01:05:55,440;01:06:04,400;"Showed out that sounds amazing imagine if Rodney can knock the ball out of you know, you know a wedge between a hand and a helmet"
01:06:04,400;01:06:08,720;"He would be the greatest. Yeah, he would yeah. That's for another day"
01:06:08,840;01:06:10,840;"Yeah"
01:06:10,840;01:06:13,660;"No, but Rod pot"
01:06:13,660;01:06:20,080;"The rod pod. Excuse you hurt waters in this commercial Jesus. Are you gonna?"
01:06:20,080;01:06:28,520;"Talking about I don't I have your idea. Yeah, he builds a little man cave and he calls it the broad pot"
01:06:28,520;01:06:35,000;"Yeah, oh, you're right so they're both players man. Well, although that would make sense that Kurt Warner would be hanging out with him"
01:06:35,000;01:06:38,040;"Mike football not football rod pod"
01:06:38,040;01:06:46,200;"Rod Pod. I actually, this is really easy for me because I did see the commercial and what"
01:06:46,200;01:06:50,920;"he's talking about is like, you know, with the money that he has, he created this environment"
01:06:50,920;01:06:55,200;"where it's kind of like a man cave. So it's the Rod Pod."
01:06:55,200;01:06:58,560;"What's the Rod in this situation?"
01:06:58,560;01:07:02,360;"The Rod is, it's Rodney. It's Rodney."
01:07:02,360;01:07:05,240;"Oh, it's his nickname. Oh, okay. All right."
01:07:05,240;01:07:11,280;"I want to make some joke about like a Hall of Fame jacket or something and each chips or"
01:07:11,280;01:07:16,620;"something. I don't know man. It's definitely, it's definitely football or not. I don't"
01:07:16,620;01:07:19,280;"know man. It's whatever I did."
01:07:19,280;01:07:20,680;"( subscribe to the channel)"
01:07:20,680;01:07:24,480;"Do you comment Terry? What was that?"
01:07:24,480;01:07:28,720;"Warner does the, I think he does the Monday Night Radio call or?"
01:07:28,720;01:07:32,720;"Wow. Yeah, he does something for like Westwood One or something. Right?"
01:07:32,720;01:07:37,120;"Yeah, yeah, I've heard you come across it randomly every once in a while"
01:07:37,120;01:07:42,100;"He's better than the guys that got run in the ESPN broadcast. Well, yeah"
01:07:42,100;01:07:50,520;"Annie seems to be a Patriots fan unlike Marshall Fock and those guys that were part of that team. So I can respect him. That's true. Yeah. Oh"
01:07:50,520;01:07:53,160;"Yeah, you"
01:07:53,160;01:07:55,600;"Yes, but"
01:07:55,600;01:08:00,920;"This is a great segue ready for this speaking of douchebags on the Rams. How about Leonard little? Oh"
01:08:00,920;01:08:06,080;"Oh, that was really good, right? Did either of you go down the rabbit hole I did?"
01:08:06,080;01:08:12,680;"No, I just want you to go out to the toilet. So when a little is a great a douchebag."
01:08:12,680;01:08:21,980;"I don't even know. It kind of, let's say a less successful Tyree kill, but worse."
01:08:21,980;01:08:25,660;"- Go on. - Go on."
01:08:25,660;01:08:29,580;"- And by that, you need a new doubling of domestic violence"
01:08:29,580;01:08:32,820;"with pregnant girlfriends and beating kids"
01:08:32,820;01:08:34,020;"and threatening women."
01:08:34,020;01:08:36,500;"- But worse."
01:08:36,500;01:08:37,980;"- Oh, wow."
01:08:37,980;01:08:42,300;"So shame on you, Kansas City, by the way, shame on you."
01:08:42,300;01:08:47,300;"- Yeah, so when he was a rookie,"
01:08:47,300;01:08:51,100;"his rookie season went a little,"
01:08:51,100;01:08:54,180;"He went out, I don't know if it's after a game,"
01:08:54,180;01:08:57,500;"so nobody went out something and he was drinking"
01:08:57,500;01:09:02,500;"and was driving home drunk and collided with another car"
01:09:02,500;01:09:06,340;"of a mother who was going to pick up her son"
01:09:06,340;01:09:11,260;"from a concert and killed her."
01:09:11,260;01:09:12,700;"- Oh."
01:09:12,700;01:09:13,760;"- Yeah, drunk driving."
01:09:13,760;01:09:19,100;"And the quote that I found of him talking about it"
01:09:19,100;01:09:25,420;"at the time said it was the family's deepest wish that little a 24 year old rookie be taken"
01:09:25,420;01:09:30,300;"away to prison for a substantial period of time. It didn't seem an outrageous wish."
01:09:30,300;01:09:34,300;"This was a man who according to the police report was so indifferent at the time of the"
01:09:34,300;01:09:40,380;"accident that he said of Susan Gutweiler, the lady that he killed, the expletive ran"
01:09:40,380;01:09:44,460;"a yellow light and hit me wrecking my $45,000 expletive car."
01:09:44,460;01:09:47,180;"- Brandi Yellow like this."
01:09:47,180;01:09:49,740;"- All right, that's pretty douche bagging."
01:09:49,740;01:09:50,900;"And he's just looking."
01:09:50,900;01:09:56,220;"- So he, please."
01:09:56,220;01:09:58,820;"- Oh man, should we have like an episode"
01:09:58,820;01:10:01,100;"where we're just like outing every fucking douche bag?"
01:10:01,100;01:10:02,340;"So that like it's on the record"
01:10:02,340;01:10:03,860;"that they are giant pieces of shits"
01:10:03,860;01:10:05,820;"and we don't support them whatsoever."
01:10:05,820;01:10:07,140;"'Cause that sounds fun."
01:10:07,140;01:10:09,660;"- Yeah, we'll do that during the bi-week."
01:10:09,660;01:10:10,500;"- Oh, okay."
01:10:10,500;01:10:13,060;"- I've been looking for a bi-week topic, so there it is."
01:10:13,060;01:10:17,780;"So here you go. So for that, how much time do you think he served?"
01:10:17,780;01:10:20,020;"What was the money?"
01:10:20,020;01:10:20,700;"Eight days."
01:10:20,700;01:10:25,860;"Little pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 90 days"
01:10:25,860;01:10:29,860;"in the city workhouse, four years probation and a thousand hours of community service."
01:10:29,860;01:10:35,780;"This is kind of like sound a little bit like Dante Stalwart's issue."
01:10:35,780;01:10:40,260;"I mean, obviously, I don't think he was a douchebag, but I mean, yeah, I mean, similar."
01:10:40,260;01:10:41,140;"Yeah."
01:10:42,380;01:10:51,380;"Drunk driving is sadly a common occurrence in America for a variety of reasons."
01:10:51,380;01:10:55,380;"But I think just the fact that you're not..."
01:10:55,380;01:11:02,380;"...and tried about it, I think is not great."
01:11:02,380;01:11:11,380;"But the other part of this is that this was not his only drunk driving offense."
01:11:11,380;01:11:16,380;"So did you start a backtrack?"
01:11:16,380;01:11:18,380;"Did you say $45,000 car?"
01:11:18,380;01:11:19,380;"Yeah."
01:11:19,380;01:11:20,380;"Yeah."
01:11:20,380;01:11:21,380;"Yes."
01:11:21,380;01:11:22,380;"It's fancy."
01:11:22,380;01:11:25,380;"No, it was some massive SUV as well."
01:11:25,380;01:11:28,380;"It was like a Lincoln or something or other."
01:11:28,380;01:11:40,380;"So yeah, his blood alcohol content was 0.19, which is well over the 0.08 in the state of Missouri."
01:11:40,380;01:11:45,380;"So yeah, he was suspended for eight games in that 1999 season."
01:11:45,380;01:11:57,380;"And then other things that he had on his record on January 18, 2003, according Wikipedia, little was charged with communicating threats and making harassing calls."
01:11:57,380;01:12:06,100;"and making harassing calls to his former girlfriend after the girlfriend ended their"
01:12:06,100;01:12:12,860;"relationship. And then on April 24, 2004, he was arrested again for surprise, surprise"
01:12:12,860;01:12:20,860;"driving while intoxicated after being stopped by the police for driving 78 and a 55. At the"
01:12:20,860;01:12:26,300;"time, he had red eyes, smelled of alcohol and failed three roadside sobriety tests. He"
01:12:26,300;01:12:31,620;"they remitted that he drank alcohol to the police. But he was convicted of a"
01:12:31,620;01:12:38,500;"misdemeanor speeding but acquitted DUI basically because the police screwed"
01:12:38,500;01:12:42,740;"something up in the loophole. But he was prohibited from drinking any sort of"
01:12:42,740;01:12:51,740;"alcoholic beverage for his probation. How long was this probation? Two years. No"
01:12:51,740;01:13:00,460;"chance. No, absolutely not. So it drives. So right. Do you think of the week? It goes"
01:13:00,460;01:13:04,380;"to the middle? Yeah, that's a good point. You're gonna afford a $45,000 car or whatever"
01:13:04,380;01:13:13,500;"that means. You can get a driver. I mean, call a cab. Yeah, invent Uber. So the, uh,"
01:13:13,500;01:13:18,420;"the article that I found was interviewing the dead mom's son. And that's basically what"
01:13:18,420;01:13:21,460;"He said, he's like, why the fuck aren't you just renting a limo every time you go out?"
01:13:21,460;01:13:25,140;"Which can I do with that?"
01:13:25,140;01:13:25,620;"Well, when you're."
01:13:25,620;01:13:28,340;"And you know what I'm realizing?"
01:13:28,340;01:13:33,620;"I'm realizing that in talking about football, there's a lot of dark moments on this podcast."
01:13:33,620;01:13:34,500;"Yeah."
01:13:34,500;01:13:41,380;"But we're going to try to navigate them properly and speak on it."
01:13:41,380;01:13:42,820;"We're not authorities on this."
01:13:42,820;01:13:43,780;"This is true."
01:13:44,420;01:13:49,460;"You don't know shit. I think I can spot a piece of shit when I see one, but you never know."
01:13:49,460;01:13:53,780;"Yeah. So on, I don't know if a lighter notes right term, but on a karmic note,"
01:13:53,780;01:14:00,740;"in the aforementioned list of Rams players that got injured on there was Leonard Litter,"
01:14:00,740;01:14:06,420;"Leonard, one more time, Leonard Little who had sprained his MCL in this game. So"
01:14:08,260;01:14:09,860;"Patriots are karma for that shit."
01:14:09,860;01:14:14,020;"Try driving with a sprained mcl bitch."
01:14:14,020;01:14:15,220;"Yeah, fuck you."
01:14:15,220;01:14:17,620;"All right."
01:14:17,620;01:14:19,060;"You're right."
01:14:19,060;01:14:22,980;"I know it's dumb bad when I see you."
01:14:22,980;01:14:26,420;"Right. I was just on your passion, Greg."
01:14:26,420;01:14:29,220;"So I mean, we could take it again."
01:14:29,220;01:14:29,700;"You start."
01:14:29,700;01:14:32,260;"Am I starting?"
01:14:32,260;01:14:34,500;"It's just anything like, how do you feel about Leonard Little?"
01:14:34,500;01:14:35,860;"Yeah, fuck yeah, guys."
01:14:35,860;01:14:37,140;"Yeah, he's a fucking piece of shit."
01:14:37,940;01:14:42,020;"Yeah. I felt, I felt pretty good about that."
01:14:42,020;01:14:43,860;"Yeah, you said like you felt pretty good."
01:14:43,860;01:14:45,540;"Yeah. All right."
01:14:45,540;01:14:48,140;"Um, I think it's about time we wrap this up."
01:14:48,140;01:14:51,620;"Does any of you want to do your best or worse?"
01:14:51,620;01:14:53,740;"I don't know."
01:14:53,740;01:14:54,540;"Yeah, that's a surprise."
01:14:54,540;01:15:01,060;"Um, I will say my worst and usually I love this, but it was a little silly in this game."
01:15:01,060;01:15:05,460;"Uh, Teddy Bruski was just throwing his body around for the hell of it, even when"
01:15:05,460;01:15:07,180;"it was near the football."
01:15:07,180;01:15:10,380;"So there's like one play where Marshall Flock is, you know,"
01:15:10,380;01:15:13,180;"cutting back into his run or whatever."
01:15:13,180;01:15:17,140;"And Bruce G is just seeing launching him off screen."
01:15:17,140;01:15:18,300;"Yeah."
01:15:18,300;01:15:21,780;"He was flash of way off to the corner."
01:15:21,780;01:15:22,580;"Yeah."
01:15:22,580;01:15:23,820;"Well, I was Teddy Bruce G."
01:15:23,820;01:15:25,380;"So I don't know if that was that great."
01:15:25,380;01:15:31,060;"I mean, the best for me was seeing the silver painted head fan guy."
01:15:31,060;01:15:32,220;"Oh, yes."
01:15:32,220;01:15:35,060;"And and somebody had written on the top of his head, um,"
01:15:35,780;01:15:38,580;"They're like coming up next Monday night countdown or something like that."
01:15:38,580;01:15:40,740;"I didn't see that."
01:15:40,740;01:15:44,500;"That's like, like, they came back from a commercial and it was like just showing"
01:15:44,500;01:15:45,940;"the top of his head and it said that."
01:15:45,940;01:15:49,060;"Sketchy look on his face."
01:15:49,060;01:15:49,340;"Yeah."
01:15:49,340;01:15:49,900;"Yeah."
01:15:49,900;01:15:52,940;"I don't know that guy's name, but props to you unless he's a piece of shit."
01:15:52,940;01:15:53,860;"And then I take that back."
01:15:53,860;01:15:54,740;"Yeah."
01:15:54,740;01:15:57,940;"It's the most famous picture is a mugshot."
01:15:57,940;01:15:59,140;"What?"
01:15:59,140;01:16:01,180;"So wait, is that actually him?"
01:16:01,180;01:16:02,900;"You got the tattooed head?"
01:16:02,900;01:16:04,580;"Wait, you guys a mugshot?"
01:16:04,580;01:16:05,220;"Oh, man."
01:16:05,220;01:16:14,820;"See I knew it. I can't pull for anybody anymore. Yeah, he's got a Patriots helmet like tattooed on his head to his ball. Is that the same guy though?"
01:16:14,820;01:16:21,140;"I don't know. Well, let's talk about the guy that painted his whole head silver."
01:16:21,140;01:16:30,820;"They look kind of similar. So I might be looking. I'll make the statement. I don't know him. I don't agree with anything that he's ever done in his life. It was just"
01:16:31,380;01:16:35,620;"It was, I've seen them before in games and it was, it was nice to see them again."
01:16:35,620;01:16:41,060;"Yeah, it was a blast from the past. All right. That's great. Greg, so you say you don't have a"
01:16:41,060;01:16:45,780;"best on where? It's not going to pull out your ass. Now that you guys mentioned the fans, there was"
01:16:45,780;01:16:53,700;"one like, I don't want to body shame these buddies. The other guy, like in his head was just big."
01:16:53,700;01:16:58,660;"They had one of those little like old school, not like quite leather helmet, but the notes"
01:16:58,660;01:17:05,080;"ask. Yeah, I've just squished his face into it. I'm like, I understand that I just"
01:17:05,080;01:17:11,600;"gave in. So Giggle. So look like Bedouac's burger. Or no, who was it that? Not not the"
01:17:11,600;01:17:17,440;"duck dude, but the the other quarterback they started this year. Yeah, where he got the"
01:17:17,440;01:17:22,680;"concussion and they had to take his face mask off. And he had that that had that look like"
01:17:22,680;01:17:28,200;"he had to pour into the helmet in the first place. Yeah, I just looked. I don't stand by"
01:17:28,200;01:17:30,920;"anything that's been said right now. That's fun. Nobody cares."
01:17:30,920;01:17:34,760;"I actually kind of look down on it a little bit. I'm going to cut that out that you said that anyway,"
01:17:34,760;01:17:43,400;"so don't worry about it. Oh, God. Is that again, Greg? I say, if it was like the same situation"
01:17:43,400;01:17:50,040;"as Rudolph, but it was Big Ben, that face like spilling out of the helmet. Yeah, exactly. Yeah."
01:17:53,720;01:17:54,560;"All right."
01:17:54,560;01:18:04,120;"Um, my best for this game was the live interactive polls on the challenges."
01:18:04,120;01:18:04,960;"Did you see this?"
01:18:04,960;01:18:10,120;"Every time they have the coaches challenge, you know, they show the referee, like watch the game."
01:18:10,120;01:18:15,160;"They do the, the, the, the shots of both head coaches and stuff."
01:18:15,160;01:18:20,560;"But then when they came back from the challenge, they, I, I, I guess you could like text"
01:18:20,560;01:18:22,720;"or something, it doesn't actually say."
01:18:22,720;01:18:27,120;"But it was the viewers' votes of ""Let the Playstand"""
01:18:27,120;01:18:28,600;"or ""Overturn It."""
01:18:28,600;01:18:29,800;"And it would show you the percentage,"
01:18:29,800;01:18:31,040;"like how many people voted."
01:18:31,040;01:18:33,720;"So for, I think this was the screenshot that I have"
01:18:33,720;01:18:36,840;"is of the Antoine Smith fumble."
01:18:36,840;01:18:41,320;"And out of 39,006 votes, 57% said ""Overturn It"""
01:18:41,320;01:18:43,800;"and 43% said ""Let the Playstand."""
01:18:43,800;01:18:47,400;"And why the fuck that isn't still a thing is amazing to me."
01:18:47,400;01:18:48,480;"- Definitely still do that."
01:18:48,480;01:18:53,880;"right? Because you could get so much like sports talk fodder out of that,"
01:18:53,880;01:18:58,380;"especially if they get something egregiously wrong. Like last year's NFC"
01:18:58,380;01:19:01,880;"championship game where it should have been passing their parents. Like that"
01:19:01,880;01:19:07,400;"sort of shit. Oh, maybe let him make the call. Yeah. But maybe that's a"
01:19:07,400;01:19:11,680;"that voting should be what results in the actual play. Yeah. But now that you"
01:19:11,680;01:19:15,680;"bring that up, I mean, remember the show, Playmakers, how it was out for a"
01:19:15,680;01:19:20,000;"season and then the NFL squashed that and then like, then there was an NFL blitz, the"
01:19:20,000;01:19:23,200;"video game where like, you know, you can do all kinds of messed up shit and then they"
01:19:23,200;01:19:27,840;"squashed that. And then now we can even imagine like they're pretty tight on certain things."
01:19:27,840;01:19:30,960;"So maybe for that reason, actually, they're like, you know what the fuck this?"
01:19:30,960;01:19:36,800;"Don't want to make your referees look bad. You might be right. Right. Good point. All"
01:19:36,800;01:19:38,800;"All right, so that was my best."
01:19:38,800;01:19:44,800;"And my worst was our old friend, Shank, Dan Shaughnessy."
01:19:44,800;01:19:49,800;"The day after the game is real immediate,"
01:19:49,800;01:19:52,400;"just firing up that QB controversy machine."
01:19:52,400;01:19:57,840;"I'm gonna leave you with this quote from Dan Shaughnessy."
01:19:57,840;01:20:00,840;"- Well, then I'm gonna piggyback on this quote as well."
01:20:00,840;01:20:02,480;"- All right."
01:20:02,480;01:20:04,240;"- Leave the Cadillac in the garage."
01:20:04,240;01:20:05,840;"The Toyota takes you around town"
01:20:05,840;01:20:13,500;"and it gets better gas mileage talking about Brady versus leaving Drew Bledso on the sidelines"
01:20:13,500;01:20:15,260;"in a close game against a good team."
01:20:15,260;01:20:19,540;"Yeah, who is he? Who's who in that?"
01:20:19,540;01:20:21,100;"Drew Bledso is the Cadillac."
01:20:21,100;01:20:24,420;"Shanks, that's a fucking idiot."
01:20:24,420;01:20:28,820;"Yeah, that's good. So maybe we'll tweet this at him too. Please still stand by this, you"
01:20:28,820;01:20:29,820;"fucking moron?"
01:20:29,820;01:20:32,660;"Yeah, Cadillac might ask you."
01:20:32,660;01:20:38,500;"Well, and to piggyback on that, I thought I was kind of let down by this, but you know,"
01:20:38,500;01:20:44,740;"like Brady, even throughout most of this, you know, the opportunity, he's been very confident."
01:20:44,740;01:20:46,580;"Everything that he says is like basically I'm the best."
01:20:46,580;01:20:48,660;"I learned from this, whatever."
01:20:48,660;01:20:55,540;"So, Bolezzo, he had a quote where you're just talking about, you know, what happens with"
01:20:55,540;01:20:56,540;"playing time or whatever."
01:20:56,540;01:20:59,820;"And he says, I intend to make it very hard for Brady to stay on the field."
01:20:59,820;01:21:02,620;"But he's playing better than I am he'll keep playing."
01:21:02,620;01:21:04,420;"I was like, look out."
01:21:04,420;01:21:06,580;"All right, I'm not going to go crazy,"
01:21:06,580;01:21:08,780;"but what kind of shit is that?"
01:21:08,780;01:21:09,220;"Like--"
01:21:09,220;01:21:09,980;"No, I love that."
01:21:09,980;01:21:11,140;"That's exactly what you want."
01:21:11,140;01:21:13,620;"You convinced me that you want the time."
01:21:13,620;01:21:16,300;"Don't play PC."
01:21:16,300;01:21:17,780;"That wasn't PC."
01:21:17,780;01:21:19,340;"Yeah, well, I was just like, oh, just playing better"
01:21:19,340;01:21:20,740;"than me than he'll keep playing."
01:21:20,740;01:21:23,740;"Don't say that you'd say, I'm going to get the job."
01:21:23,740;01:21:25,100;"I'm going to get the job."
01:21:25,100;01:21:25,620;"No."
01:21:25,620;01:21:26,180;"Greg?"
01:21:26,180;01:21:27,180;"What?"
01:21:27,180;01:21:28,900;"I'm with Andy."
01:21:28,900;01:21:32,340;"I'm with Andy if he's being realistic. Yeah. All right."
01:21:32,340;01:21:35,860;"And he's also like not shitting on Tom Brady too. Yeah."
01:21:35,860;01:21:39,620;"Yeah. But here's the thing. All right. My uncle told me this this once and I don't know if it's true,"
01:21:39,620;01:21:45,700;"but it doesn't matter because it still makes my point. There's this soccer player one time."
01:21:45,700;01:21:52,020;"He kicked the goal from from midfield, right? And then he did it again. He did two. He shot two"
01:21:52,020;01:21:58,740;"goals from midfield won the game. And after the game, they said, hey, man, like, how did that"
01:21:58,740;01:22:04,320;"Happened and then he said, you know, it was luck. It could happen to anybody and you know who that guy was"
01:22:04,320;01:22:08,960;"Who no one knows because no one fucking remembers him"
01:22:08,960;01:22:17,440;"So you gotta hear it up, baby PR"
01:22:17,440;01:22:21,040;"Typical Portuguese like"
01:22:24,960;01:22:25,960;"into it. Okay."
01:22:25,960;01:22:28,660;"You know it's true. What do you say Greg?"
01:22:28,660;01:22:33,360;"Okay, here you go. Say that again."
01:22:33,360;01:22:35,760;"It's just it's very Portuguese."
01:22:35,760;01:22:36,860;"You know, like the I'm right."
01:22:36,860;01:22:38,460;"You're wrong. All right."
01:22:38,460;01:22:38,760;"What?"
01:22:38,760;01:22:40,760;"I'm American baby."
01:22:40,760;01:22:43,360;"So I'm at the end of the week."
01:22:43,360;01:22:45,060;"I love talking to you guys."
01:22:45,060;01:22:47,260;"It's always a pleasure even when it's not."
01:22:47,260;01:22:48,760;"Yeah."
01:22:48,760;01:22:49,360;"I love it."
01:22:49,360;01:22:51,460;"Thanks for thanks for walking us out."
01:22:51,460;01:22:53,560;"What do we have to look forward to next week, Mike?"
01:22:54,260;01:22:55,460;"Tell me about it."
01:22:55,460;01:22:57,660;"Dude, you know, we're the"
01:22:57,660;01:23:03,660;"Patriots have played in this team and that team, they, they're guns are out and"
01:23:03,660;01:23:06,660;"they're just firing on also on there."
01:23:06,660;01:23:09,580;"So if that's not a teaser for you, I don't know what it is."
01:23:09,580;01:23:12,460;"They're coming marching in if that helps."
01:23:12,460;01:23:14,780;"Sure."
01:23:14,780;01:23:15,780;"Easy."
01:23:15,780;01:23:18,860;"Saints are coming marching into Foxboro Stadium."
01:23:18,860;01:23:19,660;"Right, right, right."
01:23:19,660;01:23:23,180;"The only team so far this year to have beaten the Rams that we just lost to."
01:23:23,180;01:23:30,460;"So we'll have that look forward to next week on the episode of the Patriots"
01:23:30,460;01:23:37,340;"Dynasty podcast Greg what last thing this is the last time that the Patriots"
01:23:37,340;01:23:43,820;"have lost to the Rams oh wow that was worth stopping it and now for the fourth"
01:23:43,820;01:23:48,500;"attempt at exiting this podcast great hearing from you guys love you take it"
01:23:48,500;01:23:52,100;"easy yeah bye"

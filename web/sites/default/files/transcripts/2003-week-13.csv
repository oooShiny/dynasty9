01:09,520;01:17,680;"But Steve and I were talking before you joined Greg and I think that at this point it's almost"
01:17,680;01:22,320;"like a Pavlov's response for the listeners because they when you're here they know that like this"
01:22,320;01:24,640;"This is a game worth watching."
01:24,640;01:26,280;"- Yeah, especially when they find out"
01:26,280;01:28,840;"that you even watched this entire game."
01:28,840;01:31,680;"- The whole game, start to finish."
01:31,680;01:32,760;"- So tell us which one it is."
01:32,760;01:35,760;"What are we talking about tonight?"
01:35,760;01:39,160;"- The folks out there will remember it"
01:39,160;01:43,760;"as the big, willy, fourth down stop on the goal line"
01:43,760;01:46,680;"and then run down the center of the field in the RCA"
01:46,680;01:49,000;"down pointing to the heavens."
01:49,000;01:51,560;"A legendary game in Patriots lore."
01:51,560;01:55,520;"- Yes, so this is 2003, week 13."
01:55,520;01:57,780;"Is the Patriots a real travel to,"
01:57,780;02:00,320;"was the, is it the RCA?"
02:00,320;02:01,160;"You don't?"
02:01,160;02:02,000;"- Yeah."
02:02,000;02:02,840;"- Is it still the RCA?"
02:02,840;02:03,960;"- Yeah, it was."
02:03,960;02:04,800;"- Yeah, it was that."
02:04,800;02:07,240;"I don't know if it still is, was it?"
02:07,240;02:08,960;"- No, it's Lucas soil field now."
02:08,960;02:09,800;"- Oh, that's right."
02:09,800;02:12,160;"Yeah, it's always a completely different stadium too, right?"
02:12,160;02:13,000;"- I don't know."
02:13,000;02:18,880;"- Yes, the Patriots at nine and two travel to Indianapolis"
02:18,880;02:25,200;"the Colts were also 9-2 for battle 4 I think technically second place in the AFC because"
02:25,200;02:30,480;"aren't the Chiefs like 10-1 they weren't defeated up until last week yes yeah"
02:30,480;02:42,640;"but the Colts are tied with the Titans for 9-2 in their division. Patriots are a couple games up"
02:42,640;02:46,280;"They're over the Miami Dolphins who are eight and four."
02:46,280;02:49,360;"And they will be playing each other next week."
02:49,360;02:54,000;"So a lot on the line for this kind of home field advantage to the playoffs,"
02:54,000;03:00,640;"maybe that sort of stuff and just kind of like the first real marquee battle"
03:00,640;03:03,440;"between Brady and Manning, right?"
03:03,440;03:06,480;"Because they've played before, but they haven't really been."
03:06,480;03:10,120;"That was like real early Tom Brady in 2001."
03:10,120;03:11,920;"The first game of Brady, right?"
03:11,920;03:15,820;"Yeah, his first game and then also the David Patton game like two weeks later."
03:15,820;03:17,920;"Yeah, they're both early in that season."
03:17,920;03:19,280;"Yeah, that's right."
03:19,280;03:23,560;"I had I want to put a correction out there though, because on the last episode,"
03:23,560;03:27,200;"I said, I don't remember who we play in the playoffs in this year."
03:27,200;03:31,740;"Well, she's a member because this is the year Manning and"
03:31,740;03:33,560;"McNair share MVPs."
03:33,560;03:34,240;"Correct."
03:34,240;03:35,600;"And both of them are in the same division."
03:35,600;03:37,120;"They're both doing awesome this year."
03:37,120;03:38,480;"Yeah."
03:38,960;03:42,400;"Yeah, Peyton Manning this year was like prime"
03:42,400;03:43,960;"Peyton Manning. And what do you do? He did"
03:43,960;03:48,560;"4200 yards, 29 touchdowns, 10 interceptions,"
03:48,560;03:54,640;"which, and this is still 2003. So they hadn't even changed the"
03:54,640;03:57,960;"rules yet, which I think we will get to at the later on in this"
03:57,960;04:04,120;"season, to allow wider receivers free releases and less contact"
04:04,560;04:06,660;"on my receivers. And they still"
04:06,660;04:07,920;"for only four or four to two hundred"
04:07,920;04:09,280;"yards and twenty nine touchdowns."
04:09,280;04:09,760;"Pretty good."
04:09,760;04:12,240;"This team is stacked."
04:12,240;04:15,040;"Yeah. And for comparison sake,"
04:15,040;04:17,480;"Tom Brady in 2002, the year before"
04:17,480;04:20,160;"this led the league with twenty"
04:20,160;04:21,160;"nine touchdown passes."
04:21,160;04:24,400;"So this is like lead leading numbers"
04:24,400;04:25,400;"here."
04:25,400;04:26,640;"It was sort of like the Patriots"
04:26,640;04:28,200;"offense of seven, like where he is"
04:28,200;04:30,360;"just like dominating a little bit"
04:30,360;04:31,480;"comparable a ton."
04:31,480;04:32,840;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
04:34,000;04:38,500;"but like reg said this is a loaded team kind of on both sides of the bar"
04:38,500;04:41,240;"more obviously more so on the offense but there's some names that you'll recognize"
04:41,240;04:42,760;"the defense to"
04:42,760;04:45,060;"uh... leading rusher eggern james"
04:45,060;04:47,180;"ramp twelve hundred yards eleven touchdowns"
04:47,180;04:48,320;"good season for"
04:48,320;04:50,780;"a team that's been slinging the ball"
04:50,780;04:53,500;"took four thousand years in twenty and i'm sure"
04:53,500;04:55,940;"uh... but the"
04:55,940;04:59,820;"other and that connection obviously marvin harrison and reggie wane"
04:59,820;05:02,420;"marvin harris in uh... twelve hundred yards"
05:02,420;05:05,540;"10 touchdowns and zero witnesses this season."
05:05,540;05:12,140;"Reggie Wayne, secondly and receiver of the 838 yards and another seven touchdowns on top of that."
05:12,140;05:15,580;"So they were scoring in bunches this team."
05:15,580;05:19,660;"How they do that?"
05:19,660;05:20,500;"Oh, they would end up."
05:20,500;05:23,260;"Pollard, Pollard and Clark had tied it in."
05:23,260;05:24,060;"Oh, that's right."
05:24,060;05:24,340;"Yep."
05:24,340;05:28,380;"And also rookie."
05:28,380;05:29,420;"What's his name?"
05:31,140;05:32,300;"The Dallas Clark."
05:32,300;05:34,020;"Yeah, I saw that."
05:34,020;05:38,860;"Who unfortunately in this game goes down with a real bad angle injury, which"
05:38,860;05:41,700;"turned out to be season ending, right?"
05:41,700;05:43,300;"Has fractured fibula."
05:43,300;05:44,220;"Had a season."
05:44,220;05:45,580;"Yeah."
05:45,580;05:48,180;"So I don't think he played much after this game."
05:48,180;05:49,020;"It was a beast later."
05:49,020;05:50,060;"Oh, yeah."
05:50,060;05:54,460;"Um, their draft this year was actually pretty good because I got him in the first"
05:54,460;05:55,300;"round."
05:55,300;05:58,740;"Robert Mathis, who also really good."
05:58,740;05:58,980;"Yeah."
05:58,980;06:03,620;"defensive end played really well. And then Cato June as well, the linebacker from Michigan."
06:03,620;06:06,740;"Oh, Cato all free. We'll go to least"
06:06,740;06:09,140;"early for free. Right."
06:09,140;06:13,300;"This is free. He's like just coming on the scene right now, too."
06:13,300;06:22,580;"He had 13 sacks in 2002. This is the middle of his pride. So he went 13, 11, 16, 11."
06:22,580;06:27,940;"So four straight years, a 10 sacks each. Yeah. And he was drafted the year before in 2002."
06:27,940;06:28,940;"like said."
06:28,940;06:29,940;"Yeah."
06:29,940;06:30,940;"Yeah."
06:30,940;06:31,940;"Wow."
06:31,940;06:33,940;"And that dude is fast."
06:33,940;06:38,180;"I remember like, you know, it's like, oh yeah, he was, he was fast and Matt Light always"
06:38,180;06:40,660;"had a problem with him."
06:40,660;06:43,660;"But you just forget how fast he actually was."
06:43,660;06:44,660;"Yeah."
06:44,660;06:49,420;"Like it was like the one of the first snaps of the game and he just blew by Matt Light"
06:49,420;06:50,820;"as if he would just stand in still."
06:50,820;06:51,820;"It was incredible."
06:51,820;06:52,820;"He was kind of snap."
06:52,820;06:53,820;"Wicked good too."
06:53,820;06:54,820;"Yeah."
06:54,820;06:55,820;"Oh yeah."
06:55,820;06:57,900;"And it's a, I think the Astro Turf."
06:57,900;07:00,020;"He looks so goddamn fast on the ass."
07:00,020;07:00,820;"Oh my god."
07:00,820;07:06,540;"It's like the cloud looked untouchable on this."
07:06,540;07:08,460;"Yeah, it just looks awesome in general."
07:08,460;07:15,400;"Like I understand that it's better to play on like this fake dress now, but the turf with"
07:15,400;07:20,360;"like the bright green popping against like the jerseys and like everyone looks fast and"
07:20,360;07:24,020;"they're about to like everyone's super clean too because it's a carpet."
07:24,020;07:26,220;"So yeah, it's awesome up there jerseys."
07:26,220;07:26,500;"Yeah."
07:27,060;07:28,780;"The colors definitely popping."
07:28,780;07:31,300;"Reggie Bush, ruined it for everyone when he tore his ACL."
07:31,300;07:33,700;"Fucking Reggie Bush."
07:33,700;07:36,740;"So how did the Colts do this here?"
07:36,740;07:38,940;"Well, you forgot one important player."
07:38,940;07:41,540;"Oh, yeah, I was going to get to him in a second."
07:41,540;07:43,100;"Mike, is it the same?"
07:43,100;07:43,460;"Yeah."
07:43,460;07:45,220;"Yeah."
07:45,220;07:47,940;"Mr. Perfection."
07:47,940;07:48,220;"Yeah."
07:48,220;07:48,500;"All right."
07:48,500;07:48,900;"Well, all right."
07:48,900;07:50,140;"Let's do it."
07:50,140;07:52,700;"Perfect human being."
07:52,700;07:54,340;"I'll just throw it out hilariously,"
07:54,340;07:56,700;"because I didn't actually realize that's the person who missed."
07:56,700;07:58,060;"Yes, no, that's what we're talking about."
07:58,060;07:58,900;"Yeah, with the tip."
07:58,900;08:00,500;"Yeah."
08:00,500;08:01,620;"So."
08:01,620;08:07,620;"I was looking him up a little bit and just kind of like some of the boss"
08:07,620;08:10,500;"and globe articles the week leading into this."
08:10,500;08:11,660;"And."
08:11,660;08:18,980;"There's a lot of talk about how one he's more than more than just a kicker."
08:18,980;08:19,820;"He's a football player."
08:19,820;08:22,580;"We have a quote here."
08:22,580;08:23,300;"Oh, here we go."
08:24,860;08:28,460;"Vannerjak will always defend himself as a football player, not just a kicker."
08:28,460;08:32,260;"Quote, I have the full respect of every player in this locker room, he said."
08:32,260;08:34,620;"And you'll never hear Manning for one."
08:34,620;08:36,700;"Call him quote, just a kicker again."
08:36,700;08:41,060;"A kicker seems to be a negative about you like, Oh, you're just a kicker."
08:41,060;08:43,940;"And that's a negative statement you put on you, Vannerjak said."
08:43,940;08:45,140;"It's ridiculous."
08:45,140;08:49,020;"I take pride in being able to tackle guys, throw the ball around and be an athlete."
08:49,020;08:50,100;"It's disappointing."
08:50,100;08:51,340;"I get labeled like that."
08:51,340;08:53,700;"It's changing, but it's been a slow process."
08:54,340;08:56,700;"Sometimes I talk to talk, but I walk the walk."
08:56,700;08:58,780;"I'm an athlete and everybody in here knows it."
08:58,780;09:02,700;"Well, that's even more ironic, right?"
09:02,700;09:06,700;"Because Manning said exactly that at the Pro Bowl."
09:06,700;09:09,940;"Yeah. My manager is just a kicker."
09:09,940;09:11,820;"Yeah, he's like when like"
09:11,820;09:17,020;"Vanderbilt was complaining about something, man, it was like, it's a real shame that we got this like"
09:17,020;09:22,500;"jackass drunken kicker and they can comment to the media while I'm here at my third"
09:22,500;09:24,500;"parable or something like that."
09:24,500;09:26,500;"Yeah, well, so here you go."
09:26,500;09:29,500;"I don't know if this is the same article or not, but I was earlier on."
09:29,500;09:36,500;"And so I was just talking about how he's, he's been Jack's way outspoken."
09:36,500;09:49,500;"And so it says when Vannerjack went home to Toronto to do quote the score, which I guess is a Toronto cable TV show, he said that Manning needs to quote show some enthusiasm and that Dungy is quote, just a mild man or guy."
09:49,500;09:53,780;"guy, Manning responded by calling Vanderjacked quote an idiot kicker."
09:53,780;09:57,060;"I mean, I'm in on that."
09:57,060;09:59,540;"I'm a major."
09:59,540;10:04,660;"I still am the incident hung over the team in the off season, but ever since the"
10:04,660;10:08,000;"Colts have been good and fiery and they take a nine and two records today's"
10:08,000;10:09,860;"matchup with the Patriots who are also nine and two."
10:09,860;10:14,220;"Nobody in the Colts locker room is apt to say that they're quote idiot"
10:14,220;10:16,580;"liquored up kicker as men described."
10:17,100;10:18,580;"- At the pro bowl last January,"
10:18,580;10:20,420;"how did he do his success?"
10:20,420;10:22,460;"- Yeah, that was actually making the rounds today."
10:22,460;10:24,140;"I watched that clip today."
10:24,140;10:24,960;"- Really?"
10:24,960;10:26,860;"- Yeah, 'cause apparently Mahomes was saying something"
10:26,860;10:28,580;"about not having like protection."
10:28,580;10:29,580;"- Oh, he was, yeah."
10:29,580;10:31,620;"- Yeah, so there were people throwing that around."
10:31,620;10:32,460;"- Yes."
10:32,460;10:38,300;"So, but he's perfect on this season."
10:38,300;10:40,820;"- He does go, I thought you guys thought that was important"
10:40,820;10:41,900;"'cause he missed a field or something,"
10:41,900;10:42,900;"which he did not."
10:42,900;10:45,260;"For an extra point, do you get two on field goals?"
10:45,260;10:49,820;"- Yes, he was also 0-2 on tackling Bethel Johnson though."
10:49,820;10:53,660;"- Yeah, but he was perfect on this."
10:53,660;10:55,500;"- Speaking of which, speaking of which."
10:55,500;10:59,740;"- Ooh, you have a Bethel Johnson jersey."
10:59,740;11:03,340;"- Audio-beam, I'm wearing a Bethel Johnson jersey."
11:03,340;11:04,700;"- What? Where the fuck did you get that?"
11:04,700;11:05,900;"- Did you buy it just for this?"
11:05,900;11:09,100;"'Cause it is, it's a B Johnson, holy shit."
11:09,100;11:12,180;"I didn't think it was a moss that you were just pretending"
11:12,180;11:12,500;"it was a-- - Does he have to be"
11:12,500;11:14,220;"Johnson and his jerseys?"
11:14,220;11:16,700;"Yeah. When I went downstairs earlier tonight,"
11:16,700;11:18,620;"I tell you it was like, who's that?"
11:18,620;11:22,380;"I said, I got to personalize because I have a big Johnson."
11:22,380;11:23,940;"[LAUGHTER]"
11:23,940;11:26,540;"I think she half believed it for a second."
11:26,540;11:27,980;"[LAUGHTER]"
11:27,980;11:28,460;"Of course she did."
11:28,460;11:29,460;"She lives with you."
11:29,460;11:31,060;"Oh, like P. Johnson."
11:31,060;11:33,340;"So you did just recently buy this though?"
11:33,340;11:35,140;"No, I've had it."
11:35,140;11:36,860;"How long?"
11:36,860;11:37,380;"I don't know."
11:37,380;11:38,900;"Probably since 2003."
11:38,900;11:42,620;"Since around this time, for--"
11:42,620;11:43,660;"You bought a Bethel."
11:43,660;11:44,660;"All right, you know what?"
11:44,660;11:45,500;"For good for you."
11:45,500;11:49,100;"Dude Bethel, I gotta say, like I--"
11:49,100;11:51,660;"You're right, he does have B Johnson on his jersey."
11:51,660;11:53,180;"I just checked it on the highlights"
11:53,180;11:54,940;"on pages 9/8 of info."
11:54,940;11:56,500;"Yep, B Johnson."
11:56,500;11:57,500;"Yeah, cool."
11:57,500;12:00,980;"But I like had this impression of him being like a bust."
12:00,980;12:03,140;"Ted Johnson."
12:03,140;12:05,700;"I think-- but he's awesome."
12:05,700;12:08,180;"He was more just like--"
12:08,180;12:11,100;"he was supposed to be kind of like a good wide receiver"
12:11,100;12:12,420;"and not just a kick returner, but he"
12:12,420;12:17,920;"never really did anything other than kick returning. I think he said some good receiving games. Yeah, I think he's really impressed me."
12:17,920;12:21,840;"This game was pretty good. This game was pretty good too. Yeah."
12:21,840;12:30,420;"I think it's more because they just haven't had anybody else to put there though. Like you're not going to start him over."
12:30,420;12:38,960;"The other place when given opportunities. He's doing okay. Okay. I lied. He had to catch a seven yards in this game. Right."
12:39,820;12:44,760;"I wasn't gonna buddy also had like two of the biggest players in the game right?"
12:44,760;12:48,180;"so"
12:48,180;13:00,300;"Let's get in the game I guess well one other note on the cults there are one two three four Hall of Famers on this team"
13:00,300;13:04,060;"Manning Harrison Harrison"
13:04,060;13:07,740;"Preenie no"
13:07,740;13:10,240;"- Oh, not right, you went."
13:10,240;13:12,320;"- No, not right, you went."
13:12,320;13:14,120;"- He was inducted last year."
13:14,120;13:14,980;"Edger and James,"
13:14,980;13:16,160;"Edger and James is a Hall of Famer,"
13:16,160;13:18,000;"which I found really surprising."
13:18,000;13:20,420;"Yeah, he got inducted last year."
13:20,420;13:22,700;"- That's a bit of a show."
13:22,700;13:24,400;"- And I wanted to bring that up."
13:24,400;13:29,400;"Like, I never feared Edger and James as an opponent."
13:29,400;13:33,080;"Like, Marshall Falk, you're always like,"
13:33,080;13:33,980;"what are we gonna do?"
13:33,980;13:35,600;"Like, this guy's a match up nightmare."
13:35,600;13:36,600;"- He's a weapon."
13:36,600;13:39,760;"He could you could just win this game on his own, but I never got that feeling from"
13:39,760;13:40,280;"everything."
13:40,280;13:42,520;"Kevin falls is exactly how they felt right, Andy?"
13:42,520;13:43,520;"Oh, yeah."
13:43,520;13:44,520;"Yeah."
13:44,520;13:45,520;"Same thing."
13:45,520;13:48,760;"But I get what you're saying, Greg, Adrian James is always just like a, you know, he's"
13:48,760;13:49,760;"like a Lawrence Moroni."
13:49,760;13:50,760;"Yeah."
13:50,760;13:52,600;"He just never showed up and that means he spots."
13:52,600;13:54,400;"He shouldn't be in all the fame, in my opinion."
13:54,400;13:55,800;"I'm with my grand."
13:55,800;13:56,800;"I will."
13:56,800;13:59,800;"Because he because he because he never scared Patriots fans."
13:59,800;14:00,800;"Mm hmm."
14:00,800;14:03,600;"He's like, hey, we just put up a ton of stats."
14:03,600;14:07,920;"demon like put him up in like a unprecedented way without a lot of big wins."
14:07,920;14:10,560;"Yeah, he never really showed up in the playoffs that I remember."
14:10,560;14:13,200;"Manning eventually figured out, but that was way after Edges gone."
14:13,200;14:14,320;"Yeah."
14:14,320;14:17,920;"But like Harrison, yes, right."
14:17,920;14:19,200;"He could kill you."
14:19,200;14:20,560;"You were scared of a manning."
14:20,560;14:20,920;"Yes."
14:20,920;14:23,560;"Tony Dungy is the fourth, by the way."
14:23,560;14:25,120;"Yes."
14:25,120;14:26,960;"Tony Dungy."
14:26,960;14:29,520;"Did Tony Dungy?"
14:29,520;14:29,960;"Yeah."
14:29,960;14:31,720;"- Yeah, I'm not saying that."
14:31,720;14:34,000;"- It's like the same career winning percentage as Bellacchak."
14:34,000;14:34,920;"- Yeah."
14:34,920;14:36,840;"I just didn't think that I was doing coaches at all."
14:36,840;14:37,680;"- Really?"
14:37,680;14:38,600;"- Mm-hmm."
14:38,600;14:40,200;"- We're talking about the same 20, don't you?"
14:40,200;14:41,400;"- That's correct."
14:41,400;14:46,400;"668 winning percentage compared to Bellacchak's 678."
14:46,400;14:48,440;"- Wow."
14:48,440;14:49,280;"- All right."
14:49,280;14:51,160;"- He didn't like half of it."
14:51,160;14:54,880;"- Yeah, he was five and five against the Patriots"
14:54,880;14:55,700;"in his career."
14:55,700;14:58,480;"The Pats actually started, it was weird"
14:58,480;15:00,500;"because they started like four and one against them,"
15:00,500;15:03,260;"but then they went one and four after that."
15:03,260;15:05,580;"But they were two and one of the patients"
15:05,580;15:07,020;"were two and one in the playoffs."
15:07,020;15:09,300;"- Fuck, Tommy, Danji, let's get into this game."
15:09,300;15:11,020;"- Yeah, well, oh, one other head coach though,"
15:11,020;15:16,020;"that is, well, funny, is Jim Caldwell was a QB coach."
15:16,020;15:21,380;"And so I guess, yeah, if you're a QB coach for Peyton Manning,"
15:21,380;15:23,060;"that means you will eventually get a head coach job"
15:23,060;15:26,260;"because between him and Adam Gaze,"
15:26,260;15:28,580;"just the eyes on both of them."
15:28,580;15:29,420;"- That's true, yeah."
15:29,420;15:31,220;"- For different reasons, because I think,"
15:31,220;15:35,620;"I think Jim Caldwell almost has that 1,000 yard stair."
15:35,620;15:36,900;"- Yeah, in case the house--"
15:36,900;15:38,940;"- You know how like sometimes dogs just stare"
15:38,940;15:40,140;"at a wall for no reason?"
15:40,140;15:43,460;"I'd be like, that's Tony, that's Jim Caldwell."
15:43,460;15:44,940;"- Where you start, you're like, you awake?"
15:44,940;15:45,780;"- Yeah."
15:45,780;15:46,620;"- You awake?"
15:46,620;15:47,460;"- Yeah."
15:47,460;15:50,540;"- And Adam's got those basalt sides just like that."
15:50,540;15:53,180;"- Yeah, he's awake, for sure."
15:53,180;15:54,380;"- Yeah."
15:54,380;15:56,980;"And he sees flies that are in the room that nobody else sees."
15:56,980;15:57,980;"Yeah."
15:57,980;15:59,780;"He's smelling colors."
15:59,780;16:02,220;"Exactly."
16:02,220;16:03,900;"You can see sounds."
16:03,900;16:08,380;"So yeah, Jim Caldwell."
16:08,380;16:09,740;"I had coach."
16:09,740;16:11,580;"QB whisper."
16:11,580;16:16,300;"Anybody, any, any coach of quarterbacks that if it's a good"
16:16,300;16:19,180;"quarterback is going to get labeled QB whisper."
16:19,180;16:21,500;"It's just how the NFL works."
16:21,500;16:23,740;"Buzzword city."
16:24,060;16:24,900;"- Yep."
16:24,900;16:29,340;"All right, so let's talk about the football game."
16:29,340;16:30,180;"- Yeah."
16:30,180;16:33,320;"- Give me a rundown, Brownie."
16:33,320;16:36,780;"- So, who's Brownie?"
16:36,780;16:37,620;"You're not."
16:37,620;16:40,580;"- Freezy."
16:40,580;16:41,620;"- Freezy."
16:41,620;16:42,860;"- You're Steve."
16:42,860;16:43,980;"- Steve, let me get this one."
16:43,980;16:45,540;"Okay, I watched this game."
16:45,540;16:46,380;"I'll have you."
16:46,380;16:48,980;"(laughing)"
16:48,980;16:50,300;"- I'll have you know it."
16:50,300;16:54,180;"So this game was famous for the stop at the end,"
16:54,180;16:56,300;"but the whole game was just wild at itself."
16:56,300;16:59,820;"And actually, should we give this a watchability score?"
16:59,820;17:01,100;"- Sure."
17:01,100;17:01,940;"All right."
17:01,940;17:03,620;"- This is a very entertaining."
17:03,620;17:04,460;"- Yes."
17:04,460;17:07,860;"- Out of six Lombardis, what would you give this?"
17:07,860;17:08,860;"- I'll give it a five."
17:08,860;17:09,700;"- Yeah."
17:09,700;17:10,540;"- Yeah."
17:10,540;17:11,980;"- I'd give it a five."
17:11,980;17:12,820;"- I'd say so."
17:12,820;17:16,380;"- Yeah, I mean, the only reason why it's six"
17:16,380;17:18,140;"is because it's not a playoff game, I think."
17:19,660;17:22,240;"but not in two teams going at it all the way to the end."
17:22,240;17:23,900;"And exciting."
17:23,900;17:26,560;"Man, man, a braiding, man, a great factor."
17:26,560;17:29,040;"No, I mean, it's a shootout too."
17:29,040;17:32,720;"The final score ends up being 38 to 34 Patriots."
17:32,720;17:33,140;"Yeah."
17:33,140;17:41,000;"So as a points fiesta and really it could have been a devastating loss for the"
17:41,000;17:41,800;"Patriots."
17:41,800;17:48,960;"This, yeah, when I was watching it, the part that surprised me was how many"
17:48,960;17:54,080;"opportunities, the Patriots squander to just like stomp on the Colts throat and put this"
17:54,080;17:55,080;"game away for good."
17:55,080;18:02,980;"Yeah. And it's I, I, I, when I thought of like the Colts comeback game, I was thinking"
18:02,980;18:06,720;"of the AFC championship game they lost, right?"
18:06,720;18:13,400;"I always got these six, I believe. Yeah. And I don't, really, it's like kind of similar"
18:13,400;18:17,680;"to that game, except the Patriots pull it out in the end. But the Patriots go up 31"
18:17,680;18:19,720;"to 10 late in the third quarter."
18:19,720;18:22,400;"Give up that lead."
18:22,400;18:28,960;"Get it back and then the fourth down stop comes on basically the last play of the game."
18:28,960;18:30,000;"Yeah."
18:30,000;18:32,840;"But the Colts had also already come."
18:32,840;18:35,960;"This was the season where I remember they were playing the Bucks and they were down."
18:35,960;18:36,720;"Yeah."
18:36,720;18:39,280;"35 14 with five minutes left in the game."
18:39,280;18:42,240;"And they came back and won it like 38 35."
18:42,240;18:46,400;"And that I watched the fourth quarter of that game."
18:46,400;18:47,440;"Yeah. Me too."
18:47,440;18:48,940;"- Oh no, not too early."
18:48,940;18:49,980;"- Not too early, generally."
18:49,980;18:52,660;"- I watched it before, like two weeks ago,"
18:52,660;18:55,060;"I just like stumbled across it on YouTube and I was like,"
18:55,060;18:57,060;"oh yeah, I remember hearing about this Monday night,"
18:57,060;18:57,900;"it came."
18:57,900;18:58,740;"- Yeah."
18:58,740;18:59,580;"- It was insanity."
18:59,580;19:00,420;"- Bananas."
19:00,420;19:01,260;"- Yeah."
19:01,260;19:02,400;"- They literally came back from,"
19:02,400;19:04,660;"was that three touchdowns down with five minutes left?"
19:04,660;19:07,740;"- It was 28 to seven."
19:07,740;19:10,580;"- No, that's the other thing is it,"
19:10,580;19:13,180;"it was 28 to seven to start the fourth."
19:13,180;19:18,180;"It was 35, 14 with four minutes and 16 seconds left."
19:18,180;19:19,300;"Yeah."
19:19,300;19:22,820;"And then they tied it up with still a minute 37"
19:22,820;19:23,820;"left on the clock."
19:23,820;19:26,740;"In less than three minutes,"
19:26,740;19:29,380;"they fucking scored 21 points without turnovers."
19:29,380;19:30,900;"Just like longs?"
19:30,900;19:34,460;"It was just, it was kind of like just clinical too."
19:34,460;19:36,940;"It was just Peyton Manning just, yeah."
19:36,940;19:38,100;"Just doing his thing."
19:38,100;19:39,940;"And it just all of a sudden, when it clicks,"
19:39,940;19:40,780;"that's what happens."
19:40,780;19:42,820;"You scroll three touchdowns in a couple of minutes."
19:42,820;19:48,380;"offensive perfection. Yeah. And to Greg's point, they kind of did that again in this"
19:48,380;19:53,420;"game. Because like you were saying, the Patriots went up. Was it 31 10?"
19:53,420;19:59,780;"That's not glass 31 10. That's kind of whipped them up. And then Peyton Manning had nothing"
19:59,780;20:03,500;"in the first half. He was not. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, yeah, the page in the first half,"
20:03,500;20:08,380;"the Manning's first drive, you got strips act on third down. You were confusing. You"
20:08,380;20:11,900;"could definitely tell that he had no idea what's going on. He's holding on the ball a lot longer"
20:11,900;20:13,540;"than ever seen Manning do."
20:13,540;20:16,380;"And Vable just like hunted him down, came all the way around,"
20:16,380;20:18,700;"looped around, just got on blind side in the back."
20:18,700;20:20,980;"- Yeah, that was great."
20:20,980;20:23,060;"Which the page was immediately turned into a,"
20:23,060;20:24,620;"Mike Cloud touchdown run."
20:24,620;20:26,820;"- Did you see that Pepper Johnson clip of him"
20:26,820;20:28,380;"stilt about that?"
20:28,380;20:29,940;"- Yeah, Pepper Johnson."
20:29,940;20:32,460;"- Oh man, he was height city."
20:32,460;20:34,420;"- The names in this game, I think,"
20:34,420;20:38,580;"is another reason why this is a five-line party game."
20:38,580;20:39,420;"A fucking Pepper Johnson."
20:39,420;20:42,780;"Wait, are you talking about like the obscure names on the Patriots?"
20:42,780;20:45,460;"No, just the fact that all these huge names played in this game."
20:45,460;20:46,220;"Okay."
20:46,220;20:50,980;"Cause there's also a bunch of fucking nobody's."
20:50,980;20:52,020;"Oh, yeah."
20:52,020;20:55,700;"Like the type of people that scored touchdowns for the Patriots"
20:55,700;20:57,220;"might cloud."
20:57,220;20:58,740;"Yeah, who the fuck might cloud?"
20:58,740;21:00,220;"Deidreck Ward."
21:00,220;21:01,140;"Yeah."
21:01,140;21:04,300;"Dietrich Ward, who he played last week."
21:04,300;21:06,060;"Yeah, he had a couple catches there."
21:06,100;21:07,220;"JJ Stokes is out there."
21:07,220;21:08,100;"JJ Stokes is out there."
21:08,100;21:09,100;"JJ Stokes."
21:09,100;21:10,100;"JJ Stokes."
21:10,100;21:13,740;"I had no clue that JJ Stokes played for the Patriots."
21:13,740;21:14,740;"Right."
21:14,740;21:15,740;"So that happens if you miss a fucking podcast."
21:15,740;21:16,740;"We're talking about this last week, Greg."
21:16,740;21:17,740;"We had a bunch of..."
21:17,740;21:18,740;"JJ fucking Stokes did?"
21:18,740;21:19,740;"No, last week."
21:19,740;21:25,460;"From last week, JJ Stokes and Dietrich Ward were basically starting at wide receiver."
21:25,460;21:27,460;"JJ Stokes was a man."
21:27,460;21:28,460;"Yeah."
21:28,460;21:30,260;"You had a like 35-yard bomb."
21:30,260;21:31,260;"Yeah."
21:31,260;21:33,460;"And Dietrich Ward did the same in this game."
21:33,460;21:34,460;"He snapped it."
21:34,460;21:42,760;"See you Greg. Yeah, but I just delete oh, yeah, you just don't even know you actually have you have killer snapchat Steve"
21:42,760;21:46,760;"Those ones are you make your face ugly? Yeah, I screwed shot of every time"
21:46,760;21:54,220;"They're hilarious the kick start when they open a beer and you pretend on rabbit like a fucking motorcycle"
21:54,220;21:59,100;"Those are funny. Yeah, I'll get cuz your girlfriend looks disappointed"
22:03,340;22:05,700;"You could just see it just like slowly leaving her eyes,"
22:05,700;22:07,740;"like just accepting it eventually."
22:07,740;22:10,380;"- You can just see the love fading."
22:10,380;22:16,420;"Speaking of love fading,"
22:16,420;22:18,740;"the shine went off the Patriots."
22:18,740;22:20,020;"Like that Andy?"
22:20,020;22:21,460;"- That was pretty good."
22:21,460;22:23,900;"Yeah, but like even this whole first half"
22:23,900;22:26,100;"was just all Patriots it felt like."
22:26,100;22:32,020;"Like they put up 10 points in the first quarter"
22:32,220;22:35,940;"And then there are another touchdown,"
22:35,940;22:38,300;"like right as the second quarter starts."
22:38,300;22:41,300;"And the Colts haven't scored yet."
22:41,300;22:44,500;"So it's 21, no 17, nothing."
22:44,500;22:46,540;"Yep, Colts score field goal."
22:46,540;22:48,460;"That field goal almost had touchdown."
22:48,460;22:49,300;"Yeah."
22:49,300;22:50,140;"Did you see that?"
22:50,140;22:52,420;"Absolute filthy move from Marvin Harrison."
22:52,420;22:53,340;"Yeah."
22:53,340;22:54,500;"He's pretty fucking good."
22:54,500;22:56,620;"He seems to take advantage of Eugene Wilson"
22:56,620;22:57,620;"as he means a safety."
22:57,620;22:59,660;"Remember he's a college quarterback."
22:59,660;23:04,380;"drafted, moved him to safety his rookie year. And this is his 10th or 11th game."
23:04,380;23:05,260;"Yeah, he had a"
23:05,260;23:08,020;"person was tough game and coverage in this game."
23:08,020;23:10,900;"I thought he was scrappy though. He like made a couple of good"
23:10,900;23:11,620;"players."
23:11,620;23:15,060;"He had his jersey. Well, no, he got a couple of good"
23:15,060;23:19,540;"scary. Now he's actually, that's why I think I liked him is because even"
23:19,540;23:24,740;"though he wasn't, he's like Butler, Malcolm Butler, where he might not be"
23:24,740;23:28,580;"the most talented player, but he could tell like he was taking it"
23:28,580;23:32,980;"personal if something and you play with anger where like every"
23:32,980;23:36,080;"tackle coming in like hard and being like, okay, if I'm going"
23:36,080;23:37,620;"to fuck up, I'm going to fuck up hard."
23:37,620;23:42,140;"Which I respect that in a player."
23:42,140;23:42,860;"That's fair."
23:42,860;23:49,140;"Um, but I think we should probably talk about the end of the"
23:49,140;23:53,620;"first half in this game because like this just again is kind of"
23:53,620;23:57,780;"another point of like, this is how exciting this game was because"
23:58,300;24:00,220;"The Colts scored right at the end of the half."
24:00,220;24:06,260;"There's like manning through a touchdown to Pollard with 12 seconds left in the half."
24:06,260;24:10,300;"And that pulls it within 17, 10."
24:10,300;24:11,020;"So, you know, it's it."
24:11,020;24:11,660;"They closed it."
24:11,660;24:12,060;"So it's cool."
24:12,060;24:14,380;"They're going to, Colts are going to get the ball back."
24:14,380;24:14,700;"Yep."
24:14,700;24:16,060;"Clout crowds were roaring."
24:16,060;24:16,660;"Exactly."
24:16,660;24:18,340;"Yeah, they're starting to get some momentum."
24:18,340;24:19,020;"Yeah."
24:19,020;24:25,060;"And I just want you to hear what actually, no, well, we'll talk about play first, but."
24:26,260;24:28,620;"So the, the, the cults kick it off."
24:28,620;24:29,140;"I know."
24:29,140;24:29,860;"Bethel Johnson."
24:29,860;24:30,820;"Mm-hmm."
24:30,820;24:32,980;"Instead of scrimming, it was 12 seconds left, but they just do"
24:32,980;24:33,780;"Rayleigh kick off."
24:33,780;24:38,140;"And all that happens is, um, house call."
24:38,140;24:38,500;"Yeah."
24:38,500;24:40,020;"Bethel Johnson."
24:40,020;24:40,460;"See you."
24:40,460;24:41,580;"Fucking later."
24:41,580;24:45,380;"Bethel Johnson alludes the tackle of noted athletes, Mike"
24:45,380;24:50,100;"Vanderjacks, big Johnson to take it 91 yards for the touchdown"
24:50,100;24:53,020;"to end the half large Johnson."
24:53,740;25:06,380;"And then one of my, one of my favorite, one of my favorite pastimes of the NFL is interviewing"
25:06,380;25:10,340;"coaches as they run into the locker room for halftime while running."
25:10,340;25:11,500;"Thanks, great coach."
25:11,500;25:14,940;"Obviously you cut it to seven that big, a huge reversal momentum."
25:14,940;25:17,180;"That's dumb on my part kicking the ball deep."
25:17,180;25:19,540;"We just got to bounce back from it the second half."
25:19,540;25:20,700;"We're starting to move the ball."
25:20,700;25:22,820;"We got to get them stopped on defense."
25:22,820;25:23,820;"All right, coach."
25:23,820;25:28,580;"I mean, he already had a big return earlier to you had like a 60 something"
25:28,580;25:30,060;"yarder, like a 65 yarder."
25:30,060;25:31,820;"No, that comes later."
25:31,820;25:33,620;"Which is even better."
25:33,620;25:34,340;"Yeah."
25:34,340;25:36,940;"Well, I just like, I respect that."
25:36,940;25:38,420;"I like the great coach."
25:38,420;25:41,460;"Obviously, you cut it to seven, that big drive and then a huge reversal."
25:41,460;25:43,140;"I mean, that's dumb on my part."
25:43,140;25:45,620;"He couldn't wait to get it out."
25:45,620;25:47,620;"He was like, let me let me interrupt you there."
25:47,620;25:49,620;"That's dumb on my part kicking the ball deep."
25:49,620;25:50,100;"What's that?"
25:50,100;25:52,260;"That's dumb on my part kicking the ball deep."
25:52,260;25:54,900;"That's dumb on my part kicking the ball deep"
25:54,900;26:04,860;"Dudger and you're gonna be like it has dumb on my part pretty sure and he just watches sports"
26:04,860;26:09,740;"Not like root for teens, but the root against teens. Yeah, I would individuals actually"
26:09,740;26:16,740;"Like I could give it I couldn't care less than a is it any individual. That's not the Patriots. Is that how you classify?"
26:17,700;26:21,620;"categories, not any, but they all seem to be not on the"
26:21,620;26:24,380;"Patriots, a large majority will say, yeah, yeah."
26:24,380;26:29,940;"All right. But if they see if Doug Peterson had said that same"
26:29,940;26:31,740;"exact quote, he'd have a job right now."
26:31,740;26:37,460;"Okay, if he just came out and said, you know what, that was"
26:37,460;26:41,420;"dumb. On my part, everybody would have been like, okay, I get"
26:41,420;26:43,860;"it. We all make mistakes."
26:43,860;26:44,460;"Moving on."
26:44,460;26:46,180;"Didn't happen though."
26:46,180;26:55,140;"So yeah, so I mean, so now it's 24 10 Patriots. Yeah. It's a half time instead of 17 10 and"
26:55,140;26:59,820;"like that just took the air out of the place. Yeah. Do you see the Patriots fans in the in"
26:59,820;27:05,420;"the crowd going wild? Like seven of them. Is there a better feeling than being in a wave"
27:05,420;27:10,900;"fan and with like a back breaking play like that where the whole stadium is like fuck"
27:10,900;27:12,620;"And you're just like, yeah,"
27:12,620;27:15,380;"there's a lot of your socket."
27:15,380;27:17,260;"Robin Trau just moon in the crowd."
27:17,260;27:18,340;"Oh, dude, I don't know."
27:18,340;27:19,620;"And it's like real intense."
27:19,620;27:20,780;"And everyone's drunk as shit."
27:20,780;27:23,140;"It's like, and at the end of the game, too."
27:23,140;27:23,660;"Yeah."
27:23,660;27:24,540;"Sketch."
27:24,540;27:25,540;"Yeah, I like that."
27:25,540;27:26,100;"I like that."
27:26,100;27:39,460;"Dumb fakes that, fakes like from Rothace"
27:39,460;27:40,300;"I took off the board."
27:40,300;27:41,140;"- Yes, right."
27:41,140;27:41,980;"- Right, yeah."
27:41,980;27:45,820;"- Yeah, that was beautiful too."
27:45,820;27:47,420;"I can't wait to get to that one."
27:47,420;27:50,060;"- But it's such a roller coaster of emotions"
27:50,060;27:53,020;"where you're bummed out everybody around you's happy."
27:53,020;27:56,300;"And then in 12 seconds, you're ecstatic"
27:56,300;27:58,460;"and everybody else is like,"
27:58,460;27:59,300;"- So good."
27:59,300;28:00,120;"- You're just like,"
28:00,120;28:01,380;"""Sug of roller coaster, it's that up incline,"
28:01,380;28:03,300;"there's a drop down from underneath it."""
28:03,300;28:04,820;"- Yeah, that was beautiful."
28:04,820;28:06,140;"- And I mean, it's a huge difference, right?"
28:06,140;28:07,900;"Instead of 17 times going to the half,"
28:07,900;28:09,180;"it's 24 to 10."
28:09,180;28:10,020;"- Right, it's exactly."
28:10,020;28:10,860;"- It's a whole different game."
28:10,860;28:14,540;"- Yep, and then the Patriots stop the Colts first drive"
28:14,540;28:16,020;"and then score another touchdown."
28:16,020;28:20,660;"And so now it's 31-10 and you know,"
28:20,660;28:23,100;"where two drives into the second half,"
28:23,100;28:24,340;"warm up the boss."
28:24,340;28:25,380;"- Yep."
28:25,380;28:26,700;"And then literally the next drive"
28:26,700;28:27,980;"manning through another interception."
28:27,980;28:31,020;"And this is where like it started to feel for me like,"
28:31,020;28:33,780;"how is this so close?"
28:33,780;28:37,020;"Because that was like two plays later."
28:37,020;28:38,620;"So the Patriots up 30 with nothing"
28:38,620;28:41,140;"and they're like harassing Manning."
28:41,140;28:42,620;"And he's thrown his, you know,"
28:42,620;28:45,060;"it's a second turn over the game."
28:45,060;28:45,900;"And-"
28:45,900;28:46,980;"- He's getting cloudy out there."
28:46,980;28:47,820;"- He's nervous. - Yes."
28:47,820;28:48,660;"- Dark clouds."
28:48,660;28:50,140;"- He was looking shook."
28:50,140;28:50,980;"- Yeah, he was."
28:50,980;28:52,260;"- Multiple touchdown games,"
28:52,260;28:54,260;"really getting dark cloudy out there, you know."
28:54,260;28:56,700;"(laughing)"
28:56,700;28:58,140;"- There's storm brewing,"
28:58,140;29:00,100;"'cause there's a lot of clouds, Gatherin'."
29:00,100;29:00,940;"- Yep."
29:00,940;29:04,860;"- Hey, hey, you, you, get off of my cloud."
29:04,860;29:06,740;"(laughing)"
29:06,740;29:07,580;"Good one."
29:07,580;29:10,700;"to look down. That's a bare minute. That is a bare minute. Okay."
29:10,700;29:13,260;"So rolling stone song, apparently. Yeah."
29:13,260;29:15,460;"You know the song? Why do now?"
29:15,460;29:17,500;"Good."
29:17,500;29:20,980;"Yeah. So the Patriots have"
29:20,980;29:27,140;"first and 10 at the Indianapolis 30, like already inside"
29:27,140;29:30,940;"field goal range up 31 to 10, six minutes left in the third."
29:30,940;29:33,220;"Yeah. You're like, yeah, this game's over."
29:33,220;29:35,580;"Yeah, points were great. Yeah. Yeah."
29:35,820;29:38,660;"Yeah, field goal in this game is done like any anything."
29:38,660;29:42,780;"You could just like run the clock out and run to the one and get stopped and it's"
29:42,780;29:46,060;"fine, but Brady throws the inception two plays later."
29:46,060;29:48,060;"And so like it's like never even happened."
29:48,060;29:48,660;"Whoops."
29:48,660;29:50,460;"And then the cold start rolling."
29:50,460;29:55,940;"Um, there, there at this point, it put all the stops because you have to write"
29:55,940;29:58,180;"your down fucking three touchdowns in the third."
29:58,180;30:01,580;"So they go for it on like fourth and nine and converting."
30:01,580;30:05,300;"Um, eventually Manning throws a touchdown of Wayne."
30:05,300;30:12,180;"And I think that was that the one one of these one of these were were really good."
30:12,180;30:14,500;"The really close."
30:14,500;30:19,700;"That the wane one was a toe tap in the corner."
30:19,700;30:21,140;"The end zone is a nice catch."
30:21,140;30:22,420;"Oh, no, that's not the one I'm thinking of."
30:22,420;30:22,660;"Yeah."
30:22,660;30:25,340;"You're thinking of the drop in the bucket tomorrow in Harrison in the back corner."
30:25,340;30:29,060;"Maybe it was one where like it looked like it was going to be a quick slant."
30:29,060;30:33,300;"And then he got to the middle field and took straight off the scene instead."
30:33,300;30:37,700;"the same route actually that he fooled Eugene Wilson on earlier. Yeah. And you didn't listen"
30:37,700;30:41,860;"with the wrong way both times and one, man, he just overthrew him. The second one, he made"
30:41,860;30:49,300;"it. It was the exact same route. So yeah, this man was so good. He was so fucking good, man."
30:49,300;30:56,420;"Because you remember this feeling to play against Manning, where you'd be like, oh boy,"
30:56,420;31:01,540;"well, yeah, exactly. Start, but he'll figure it out eventually."
31:01,540;31:04,020;"what they do and then he knows the counter to it."
31:04,020;31:05,020;"- And then once he gets--"
31:05,020;31:05,860;"- And then once he gets--"
31:05,860;31:07,860;"- I think Mahomes this year or later."
31:07,860;31:09,020;"- Yeah, Mahomes like same way."
31:09,020;31:11,700;"We have to score here because we're only up three touchdowns."
31:11,700;31:13,900;"- And Brady was the same way though, you know?"
31:13,900;31:15,060;"- But I think-- - He'll be down"
31:15,060;31:16,060;"to like, ""Oh, Brady'll figure it out."
31:16,060;31:17,060;"He'll figure out what they're doing"
31:17,060;31:18,060;"and we'll get it going."""
31:18,060;31:20,020;"- Yeah, yeah, I suppose that's true."
31:20,020;31:24,740;"- I think Mahomes and Manning have more of like the,"
31:24,740;31:27,780;"this could all fall apart really fast."
31:27,780;31:28,620;"- Yeah."
31:28,620;31:31,260;"- Like it could be like two touchdowns in four plays."
31:31,260;31:34,160;"Yeah, don't let them score once because once they score,"
31:34,160;31:35,820;"like you've opened the floodgates or the thing."
31:35,820;31:37,420;"Whereas Brady was always just like,"
31:37,420;31:40,660;"Brady will, he'll never really get down by that much"
31:40,660;31:42,460;"'cause he'll always find a way to just like,"
31:42,460;31:45,140;"claw back and hang in there until the end."
31:45,140;31:46,980;"- I mean, Brady always got,"
31:46,980;31:49,620;"I think Brady does get the lucky plays a little bit"
31:49,620;31:51,000;"and not like he plays the turnovers"
31:51,000;31:53,580;"and like help from the defensive special teams."
31:53,580;31:54,900;"I mean, even in this game,"
31:54,900;31:56,780;"a bunch of bigger terms from Bethel, you know,"
31:56,780;31:58,500;"to build him out of some dumb picks."
32:00,060;32:02,820;"Yeah, I mean, this was still early in his career."
32:02,820;32:04,700;"So he was still throwing those dumb picks,"
32:04,700;32:08,460;"but like one last time you remember him doing that recently,"
32:08,460;32:10,060;"he doesn't throw those anymore."
32:10,060;32:13,500;"- Well, I feel like you never really count Brady out"
32:13,500;32:15,660;"no matter how much, even like the Atlanta's you're bold."
32:15,660;32:17,380;"The other one that comes to mind is the bills,"
32:17,380;32:19,060;"you know, where they're up a ton in the fourth quarter"
32:19,060;32:20,740;"and McElvin fumbles the kickoff return"
32:20,740;32:21,580;"when he could dig any."
32:21,580;32:22,420;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
32:22,420;32:23,260;"That's true."
32:23,260;32:24,420;"- Like there's a bunch of other shit around that game,"
32:24,420;32:25,260;"the Bronco."
32:25,260;32:27,260;"- For the 49ers one, it was the same,"
32:27,260;32:28,820;"it just didn't break their way."
32:28,820;32:30,860;"Right. It's Kaepernick on that Monday night."
32:30,860;32:32,780;"Yeah. That game was ridiculous too."
32:32,780;32:34,860;"Yeah."
32:34,860;32:39,020;"But yeah, but you know, but this game was the opposite."
32:39,020;32:41,900;"Brady gets the ball back and he throws a pick."
32:41,900;32:44,180;"I want the fucking and Manning."
32:44,180;32:47,940;"I think I think it was on the first play throws another touchdown of Harrison."
32:47,940;32:49,540;"That's the way he's talking about where Eugene gets beat."
32:49,540;32:55,820;"Yeah. And so that's 14 points in like four plays."
32:55,820;32:58,540;"Yeah. Like total, including the pages plays."
32:58,540;33:01,900;"You're like, ""Ah, shit."""
33:01,900;33:07,820;"And now we're in the fourth quarter and it's 3124 instead of 3110."
33:07,820;33:13,340;"And the crowd is fucking into it."
33:13,340;33:17,420;"Especially when the page goes three and out and Manning again drives him down, scores"
33:17,420;33:25,540;"another touchdown and it's tie game, 31 31 31 with 10 minutes."
33:25,540;33:26,940;"That's another it's just crazy."
33:26,940;33:30,980;"You go high. How do you lose the 31 10 game with six minutes left in the third?"
33:30,980;33:33,100;"They lost it with ten minutes left in the fourth"
33:33,100;33:36,300;"It's a tie game by the stock"
33:36,300;33:41,540;"Tie game after two drives in the fourth quarter. Yeah, it's a it's unbelievable"
33:41,540;33:46,900;"This cult steam was like that though. Yeah, but then back to Steve's point like, you know"
33:46,900;33:50,780;"Manning's goes out touchdown a tie it and the Colts decide yeah, you know what we're gonna do"
33:50,780;33:56,420;"We're gonna kick it a battle Johnson and he does exactly say fucking thing and takes it 68 yards big Johnson"
33:56,420;34:02,740;"So I mixed that up. I thought did that most I had a big return the first half to you must have three bigger returns"
34:02,740;34:04,740;"Cuz I thought this return was that one"
34:04,740;34:09,580;"Watch them highlights. He must have had three because Mike's he says it big in the half"
34:09,580;34:14,140;"I got a dumb mistake cuz I think that's what already had a big return like in the first quarter or so"
34:14,140;34:16,020;"And he got a big"
34:16,020;34:19,620;"That's why I'm dumb with him to kick it to him again to give him a second chance in the first half"
34:19,620;34:23,340;"I have another big return and then he kicks down again in the fourth quarter"
34:23,540;34:26,700;"It is another big return. Yeah, and I think you're right. I think"
34:26,700;34:29,580;"I think you did have"
34:29,580;34:34,580;"It five returns for 192 yards. Yeah, which almost 40 yards a return"
34:34,580;34:37,780;"Good God"
34:37,780;34:40,260;"Yes, a lot he's the man"
34:40,260;34:48,220;"Yeah, I don't he didn't really have any returns on the first half because the cold didn't score so"
34:50,900;34:52,900;"fact check that's a lie"
34:52,900;34:55,840;"That's the only thing ever anybody remembers number one"
34:55,840;35:00,660;"I told you"
35:00,660;35:04,860;"So yeah, so the Patriots are set up to start at the Colts 32, which is"
35:04,860;35:11,180;"You know a big thing, but this time Brady finds branch for a touchdown and now"
35:11,180;35:13,940;"We're actually like"
35:13,940;35:17,260;"Now that like shit's just like all over the place"
35:17,260;35:19,940;"just all over the place and actually"
35:19,940;35:27,500;"Brady, you could have actually credit him with one of the earlier my cloud touchdowns because"
35:27,500;35:35,100;"it was a touchdown, but they ruled it out of bounds and the page didn't challenge it."
35:35,100;35:39,020;"I think it was a maybe a game award or JJ Stokes."
35:39,020;35:40,020;"It was JJ Stokes."
35:40,020;35:42,020;"I was going to piss about that."
35:42,020;35:45,460;"I don't like add him to the list of the Brady touchdown guys."
35:45,460;35:49,060;"Yeah, that would have been that be a deep cut on that list."
35:49,060;35:50,500;"The bomber cuts."
35:50,500;35:51,160;"He caught one."
35:51,160;35:52,940;"He definitely it was a clear catch."
35:52,940;35:53,260;"Yeah."
35:53,260;35:53,260;"Yeah."
35:53,260;35:57,860;"Why they how they even ruled that out of bounds the first place is beyond the guy was sitting"
35:57,860;35:58,060;"there."
35:58,060;36:03,060;"The referee was watching all the way through and there was like no reason."
36:03,060;36:03,860;"Yeah."
36:03,860;36:03,860;"Yeah."
36:03,860;36:07,500;"But then the the Patriots didn't even challenge it because they had the ball at the one for"
36:07,500;36:08,060;"whatever reason."
36:08,060;36:11,580;"And I think it was like, oh, there was I think it was a pass interference call on the play."
36:11,580;36:11,940;"Anyway."
36:11,940;36:13,460;"In the end zone."
36:13,460;36:14,660;"So they just gave it to him on the one space."
36:14,660;36:15,660;"like, ""Yeah, fuck it, we'll just run it in."""
36:15,660;36:18,660;"And then you almost have picked the next, there's like a tip ball that's playing."
36:18,660;36:19,660;"Yeah."
36:19,660;36:20,660;"Yeah."
36:20,660;36:21,660;"Yeah."
36:21,660;36:22,660;"And then that, there could have changed the game too."
36:22,660;36:30,660;"So a little bit more luck here."
36:30,660;36:32,980;"Yep."
36:32,980;36:40,220;"But the Patriots, again, you know, so they're up again by a touchdown and then they hold"
36:40,220;36:44,500;"the Colts, they stop on fourth and one."
36:44,500;36:46,060;"then what happens Andy?"
36:46,060;36:46,900;"Actually no they didn't."
36:46,900;36:49,820;"Yeah and then I don't even want to say it"
36:49,820;36:50,900;"'cause I feel like I'm-"
36:50,900;36:52,300;"League MVP."
36:52,300;36:54,980;"Yeah, no, Dynasty MVP."
36:54,980;36:58,100;"Kevin Falk makes a rare mistake."
36:58,100;37:00,620;"- That was just seasoned MVP."
37:00,620;37:02,780;"- No, early Dynasty MVP."
37:02,780;37:05,260;"- Oh, I didn't know you were saying he's the MVP"
37:05,260;37:06,580;"of the whole early Dynasty."
37:06,580;37:07,420;"- Oh yeah."
37:07,420;37:08,380;"- That seems rich."
37:08,380;37:11,780;"- Give me somebody else."
37:11,780;37:12,940;"- Teddy and Bruce."
37:12,940;37:14,540;"Rich as in like hilarious."
37:14,540;37:17,020;"Tom Brady."
37:17,020;37:19,900;"Maybe."
37:19,900;37:23,100;"Maybe without Kevin Falk Tom Brady doesn't put up"
37:23,100;37:23,300;"those."
37:23,300;37:24,700;"Okay, but he fumbles, right?"
37:24,700;37:25,300;"Yeah."
37:25,300;37:25,820;"Yeah."
37:25,820;37:26,300;"Yeah."
37:26,300;37:29,140;"Well, yeah, Paige is starting at their own eight and he fumbles."
37:29,140;37:29,660;"Yeah."
37:29,660;37:30,980;"So absolutely."
37:30,980;37:33,060;"They're called starting at the new England 11."
37:33,060;37:34,700;"Go three and out and settle for field goal, though."
37:34,700;37:37,340;"And a great fail."
37:37,340;37:38,180;"Not great."
37:38,180;37:38,940;"Not great."
37:38,940;37:39,420;"Yeah."
37:40,980;37:43,820;"And that's like we're definitely going for the touchdown here, right?"
37:43,820;37:44,340;"Yeah."
37:44,340;37:51,620;"And noted athlete, the Van de Jax kicks a field goal."
37:51,620;37:53,940;"Stay perfect on the season."
37:53,940;37:55,940;"I watched that highlight where we're talking."
37:55,940;38:00,020;"He definitely thought he could tackle a Johnson and then realized about the"
38:00,020;38:02,540;"30-yard line that goes way too fast."
38:02,540;38:03,060;"Oh, yeah."
38:03,060;38:06,020;"He's running for it."
38:06,020;38:09,260;"But he gets his hip started, so he comes back around and he'll be able to catch him"
38:09,260;38:09,820;"on the angle."
38:09,820;38:10,340;"No."
38:10,540;38:14,460;"Nope. Nope. There's no angle that that works out that you're going to catch him."
38:14,460;38:28,820;"But yeah, so I'm now is a huge stop by the defense number one because you're still up a touchdown and but you, you know, you're starting on a short field, the cold is starting on your 11 yard line and to hold the cold to a three and out and make him kick a field goal."
38:28,820;38:30,540;"So now it's 38 34."
38:30,540;38:36,980;"And so the page at this point just like fuck it. We're just going to run the clock right."
38:37,740;38:39,660;"They're doing whatever they can."
38:39,660;38:41,380;"I can know they weren't running the clock."
38:41,380;38:44,700;"They were like they should have because there was only a few minutes left, right?"
38:44,700;38:46,740;"But they came out throwing it with like five wide."
38:46,740;38:50,300;"Yeah, another suspect decision by Bellacheck."
38:50,300;38:51,420;"Little strange."
38:51,420;38:53,460;"I'd say Charlie Weiss, but yeah, OK."
38:53,460;39:00,700;"And then he throws Brady throws what that would have been the worst pick."
39:00,700;39:03,900;"I've ever seen Brady throw hits a guy directly in the hands."
39:03,900;39:07,260;"A linebacker directly in a chest between the number."
39:07,260;39:10,960;"They got drops it with nobody with a figure million yards of them"
39:10,960;39:15,800;"Real bad and you're trying you're holding on to a four-point lead with fucking two minutes"
39:15,800;39:18,200;"I'm like what the fuck are you doing?"
39:18,200;39:24,960;"And the only reason it's a four-point lead is because your defense held after your last turn over when they saw on the 11 yard"
39:24,960;39:29,400;"Line yeah, and they cut that they have a cut of down check here, and he looks worried"
39:29,400;39:34,400;"Yeah, most maybe the most part of ever seen bill check on the sideline was this cut here"
39:34,400;39:35,720;"He's like, oh shit."
39:35,720;39:39,800;"It felt a lot like the fourth and two game."
39:39,800;39:40,720;"Yeah."
39:40,720;39:40,960;"Yeah."
39:40,960;39:43,280;"You're like, you just can't give the ball back to Manning."
39:43,280;39:44,040;"Yeah."
39:44,040;39:46,560;"Maybe this, this, maybe, yeah."
39:46,560;39:47,760;"This had something to do with that."
39:47,760;39:48,280;"I bet."
39:48,280;39:48,800;"Yeah."
39:48,800;39:49,760;"And you know what?"
39:49,760;39:54,320;"Maybe this has something to do with what they do against the Seahawks, you know?"
39:54,320;39:55,040;"Yeah."
39:55,040;39:55,680;"Yeah."
39:55,680;40:00,440;"We're instead of like, OK, let's try and like let him score or whatever."
40:00,440;40:02,640;"He's like, all right, let's make a stop deal."
40:02,640;40:03,120;"You know?"
40:03,120;40:03,680;"Yeah."
40:04,040;40:08,260;"And like to keep the pressure on because like these are like pretty high pressure like play calls and all that"
40:08,260;40:11,200;"And stuff like getting down to it like oh, yeah"
40:11,200;40:15,480;"But as speaking of Charlie Weiss I"
40:15,480;40:23,020;"I was thinking about this the other day kind of as I was watching this and like through these few seasons and I forgot how kind of"
40:23,020;40:28,120;"Exciting I guess the play calling was like Charlie Weiss used to call a shit ton of"
40:28,120;40:33,180;"Trick plays and like all sorts of like gadgets and just like the movement all over the place"
40:33,180;40:39,100;"He never really knew what was happening. So I was thinking how would you rank Tom Brady's offensive coordinators?"
40:39,100;40:45,160;"So you've got you got four you got Charlie Weiss bill O'Brien Josh McDaniel's and Byron left which"
40:45,160;40:53,720;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I barely say that without I think I and left which is good"
40:53,720;40:56,020;"Wait, you think so?"
40:56,020;41:00,060;"Wait, I thought fucking what's his name was who Eric B. Enemy?"
41:01,340;41:04,800;"He's the Chiefs offensive coordinator. Oh, yeah, okay"
41:04,800;41:12,080;"Fire left which was the OC of the Patriots. Nope. No, he's Tom Brady's right now"
41:12,080;41:16,040;"Yeah"
41:16,040;41:18,520;"Yeah"
41:18,520;41:23,500;"We've only had three offensive coordinators. Yeah, yeah, McDaniel's been there forever"
41:23,500;41:27,160;"I mean you have to say McDaniel's the best fun, right? Yeah, I'm with Greg. I"
41:28,440;41:32,360;"And then obviously waste and then Bob at the back."
41:32,360;41:34,680;"Yeah, I put I put Bill O'Brien at the bottom."
41:34,680;41:40,200;"Well, just above Byron left, which is any offensive coordinator that"
41:40,200;41:41,880;"that's not really Byron."
41:41,880;41:42,920;"My picture is offensive."
41:42,920;41:43,240;"It's real."
41:43,240;41:48,360;"Oh, I think it is an effect that they run it directly up the middle on first down."
41:48,360;41:49,960;"It's just every single time."
41:49,960;41:53,080;"Brady is the one calling the place in essence, if that happens."
41:53,080;41:55,640;"Maybe he's calling all those plays of lines."
41:55,640;41:57,000;"Not like people like."
41:57,000;42:00,280;"right? People like Byron left which so"
42:00,280;42:03,480;"yeah I'm not saying is about coaching but I'm saying this point yeah it's"
42:03,480;42:07,320;"pretty is often why I don't know maybe he's a good coach and did that ever"
42:07,320;42:14,440;"cross your mind no well yeah but then I saw his game plans and that quickly"
42:14,440;42:20,040;"left my mind what game plans where you're fucking exe noz guy yeah would you"
42:20,040;42:26,440;"watch the fucking I watch y'all 22 baby you want 22s and he's Byron left"
42:26,440;42:28,880;"which didn't even recognize it."
42:28,880;42:30,360;"- Going up the middle on first down."
42:30,360;42:33,040;"- Didn't even adjust to the cover to a fucking idiot."
42:33,040;42:38,040;"And your brain is driving bullshit calls."
42:38,040;42:39,720;"- Did you see that video, Mike,"
42:39,720;42:41,800;"Vander Jack waving the towel around,"
42:41,800;42:43,280;"acting up on the sidelines?"
42:43,280;42:44,120;"- No."
42:44,120;42:44,960;"- Right at this time, right?"
42:44,960;42:45,800;"When they kick it back and they,"
42:45,800;42:47,600;"and the calls get the ball back."
42:47,600;42:48,440;"- Really?"
42:48,440;42:50,960;"- I thought the Patriots just throw it three times."
42:50,960;42:52,680;"There's a little clip of Mike Vander Jack, you know,"
42:52,680;42:54,520;"playing with cheerleader on the sideline."
42:54,520;42:55,360;"- Fucking cool."
42:55,360;42:56,200;"- With his earrings in."
42:56,200;42:59,760;"Oh, yes, those huge fucking studs that he plays football."
42:59,760;43:01,120;"He was about to go to the club."
43:01,120;43:02,960;"He's going to drop his shoulder pads off."
43:02,960;43:06,320;"And the club look like getting some tight leather."
43:06,320;43:07,320;"Let's go."
43:07,320;43:09,120;"Yeah, but this is being a leather."
43:09,120;43:11,680;"This is where the rubber hits the road."
43:11,680;43:18,120;"So Patriots, thankfully, don't have an exception."
43:18,120;43:19,480;"I have to punt it."
43:19,480;43:25,040;"But not a great punt again, because this is Ken Walter."
43:25,040;43:28,220;"- Oh fuck you, is my note."
43:28,220;43:29,060;"- What do I have?"
43:29,060;43:33,980;"My note is can't punt it out of his own half from the 20."
43:33,980;43:35,340;"18 yards."
43:35,340;43:37,500;"I know how those gay men's that I'm still living."
43:37,500;43:40,900;"Like I was, like my blood pressure was rising at this point."
43:40,900;43:42,780;"I knew they won this game."
43:42,780;43:44,660;"And I'm still like, you gotta be fucking kidding me."
43:44,660;43:47,620;"18 yards at this fucking moment."
43:47,620;43:51,740;"You can't, you're given fucking Peyton Manning"
43:51,740;43:54,820;"who scored three touchdowns and three drives."
43:54,820;44:00,460;"the ball with two 57 left at the New England 48 is where this drive started."
44:00,460;44:03,060;"You want to start Jay?"
44:03,060;44:04,500;"Never make it this easy."
44:04,500;44:06,860;"That's fucking yeah."
44:06,860;44:09,940;"That quote from Pete Carroll in the Super Bowl."
44:09,940;44:10,540;"Yeah."
44:10,540;44:14,100;"You know what I'm talking about when the mic up when they're when he says to"
44:14,100;44:16,780;"Russell Wilson, he's like, two minutes left 50 yards."
44:16,780;44:18,300;"They never make it this easy."
44:18,300;44:21,900;"I fucking I love that quote."
44:22,300;44:23,300;"I mean, it's there."
44:23,300;44:27,220;"I mean, I bet they practice it all the time, two-minute drill, and they usually make a lot harder than that."
44:27,220;44:30,180;"I know, but just the Pete Carroll, I'm the optimist."
44:30,180;44:31,700;"This is going to be great."
44:31,700;44:36,380;"It's just, it warns my heart to see his just completely shattered."
44:36,380;44:38,660;"To watch him fail."
44:38,660;44:39,220;"What is that?"
44:39,220;44:39,780;"A project?"
44:39,780;44:40,340;"Oh, yeah."
44:40,340;44:40,780;"Yeah."
44:40,780;44:41,340;"Yeah."
44:41,340;44:43,420;"I like everybody knows that guy at work."
44:43,420;44:48,540;"You know, the one that's just like, come on, guys, if we all pull together, we can do this."
44:48,540;44:50,500;"It's like, ""Shup, you hot day, guys!"""
44:50,500;44:51,620;"This sucks, dude."
44:51,620;44:54,180;"- Don't try to cheer me up."
44:54,180;44:55,980;"It makes me even more mad."
44:55,980;44:58,380;"- Just look for the silver lining, guys."
44:58,380;44:59,220;"- Yeah, I'm not going to--"
44:59,220;45:00,060;"- Look at all the stuff we're learning."
45:00,060;45:01,180;"- I'm gonna be that guy in your life."
45:01,180;45:02,300;"How about that?"
45:02,300;45:04,660;"Just so you get it outside of work too."
45:04,660;45:06,900;"- Yeah, but Steve, I know you don't mean it."
45:06,900;45:10,460;"I know in your heart of hearts, you're a pessimist."
45:10,460;45:11,300;"- No way."
45:11,300;45:14,940;"I have fucking an optimistic phrase tattooed on my body."
45:14,940;45:17,380;"- Yeah, sing it to us."
45:17,380;45:19,260;"- That's a good sing."
45:19,260;45:21,260;"the body set the"
45:21,260;45:23,260;"[laughter]"
45:23,260;45:25,260;"[laughter]"
45:25,260;45:26,220;"That body set the"
45:26,220;45:29,260;"[screaming]"
45:29,260;45:33,260;"Oh, did you that common, those he does some stab your granny music?"
45:33,260;45:35,260;"If I can write stab your granny music."
45:35,260;45:41,260;"Hmm. For those listeners at home, if you had to guess a genre music they didn't do like"
45:41,260;45:43,260;"[laughter]"
45:43,260;45:45,260;"How would you think it would be?"
45:47,260;45:49,020;"I don't know what you're getting at Greg."
45:49,020;45:49,520;"Yeah."
45:49,520;45:55,000;"Explain yourself to lightly refer it to as stab your granny music."
45:55,000;46:01,340;"Yeah, which is what one of my roommates called it when I heard what I listened to."
46:01,340;46:06,820;"I still make my playlist called stab your granny music every time I put one to you."
46:06,820;46:09,780;"It's well put."
46:09,780;46:15,120;"Peyton Manning is the guy in scream and the rest of the grannies in the house are the"
46:15,120;46:16,880;"the Patriots defense now."
46:16,880;46:18,600;"I didn't fall out now."
46:18,600;46:19,320;"Yeah."
46:19,320;46:20,120;"It was a bridge."
46:20,120;46:21,160;"You guys,"
46:21,160;46:23,580;"Edrin five yards,"
46:23,580;46:25,080;"Reggie weight 13 yards."
46:25,080;46:26,600;"It's about to be a two minute warning."
46:26,600;46:29,560;"He always runs a drop light, which great idea."
46:29,560;46:31,640;"They never make nine yards."
46:31,640;46:34,160;"They're there."
46:34,160;46:35,720;"So they're starting a two minute warning."
46:35,720;46:36,240;"Yeah."
46:36,240;46:39,200;"Second and one from the Patriots 21."
46:39,200;46:40,000;"Yeah."
46:40,000;46:41,560;"You get that shot and a win."
46:41,560;46:42,200;"Yeah."
46:42,200;46:44,440;"And it's really the time."
46:44,440;46:47,320;"- Yeah, box game all over again,"
46:47,320;46:50,240;"where it's like, you go from trying to come back"
46:50,240;46:53,360;"to like, maybe we should burn more time, you know?"
46:53,360;46:54,960;"- Yeah, yeah."
46:54,960;46:57,880;"- Yeah, so there is your, I love those coaching decisions."
46:57,880;46:59,280;"Those are tricky."
46:59,280;47:00,240;"- Oh, wicked heart."
47:00,240;47:01,080;"- Yeah."
47:01,080;47:02,200;"- Do we let them see if we can try to get the ball back"
47:02,200;47:03,040;"and give it to you?"
47:03,040;47:05,600;"- Well, you're like, do we just take the score?"
47:05,600;47:08,960;"Yeah, or do we like, you know, try and burn some clock here?"
47:08,960;47:11,080;"You take the score."
47:11,080;47:12,560;"- You feel like you get that a lot in the model game."
47:12,560;47:16,480;"Yeah, you take the score and then you fucking you"
47:16,480;47:19,160;"squib kick it so that fucking battle Johnson doesn't return it."
47:19,160;47:20,280;"You let Braves for another pick."
47:20,280;47:22,040;"That's what you do in this situation."
47:22,040;47:26,280;"It's true or or if you're fucking Tony"
47:26,280;47:31,320;"Junji, which you know, what does he have to say about it for himself?"
47:31,320;47:32,440;"I wonder."
47:32,440;47:35,160;"We have a post game for the Dom on my part."
47:35,160;47:39,080;"Thanks for ruining your great."
47:39,080;47:40,520;"Thanks, Greg."
47:40,520;47:42,080;"Coach, obviously, you cut it to someone, man."
47:42,080;47:46,360;"That's dumb on my part kicking the ball deep. Oh man. I'm as dumb on my part"
47:46,360;47:55,360;"So yeah, he didn't he didn't just go for the score, but I think"
47:55,360;48:01,240;"To exonerate him. I don't think you had anything to do with this last this last little bit"
48:01,240;48:05,940;"This is all pay me. I'll be feeling good. Hey, I'll pay man. It has a ball on the 21 with"
48:05,940;48:11,520;"From a play call I'm out. He has a timeout in two minutes to gain 20 yards and score touchdown"
48:11,520;48:17,000;"I mean, it's like at this point the way they've been playing the second half they've been zipping and zapping all over field"
48:17,000;48:21,760;"It's kind of like a fun deal. Yeah, and it drive right down to the one-yard line. So"
48:21,760;48:29,000;"They're at the carbon Harrison edge up the middle for seven yards. Yeah one yard run. Yeah, so now now it's"
48:29,000;48:34,040;"first single from the New England two yard line 40 seconds left. So you got four bangs at this and"
48:37,600;48:42,700;"They kind of I mean Manning had some excuses after the game which we'll get to"
48:42,700;48:48,400;"But first and goal from New England to the Colts run up"
48:48,400;48:52,260;"Quick snap run to the right and it gets stopped"
48:52,260;48:56,400;"And then they line right back up"
48:56,400;49:04,880;"Quick snap run straight up the middle gets stopped again, then they call the timeout third and goal from the one still 18 seconds left"
49:05,680;49:14,680;"And at this point, after the game, Manning was talking about how it was the fault of injuries."
49:14,680;49:16,680;"Like, injuries are the reason they didn't score here."
49:16,680;49:17,680;"Where is it?"
49:17,680;49:21,680;"Do we feel like his call on the two quick runs?"
49:21,680;49:23,680;"Like you got him on the heels a little bit."
49:23,680;49:25,680;"You know, you're on the one yard line that's down there."
49:25,680;49:27,680;"You just run it real quick and see if you get it in."
49:27,680;49:28,680;"That's what Brady does."
49:28,680;49:34,680;"Yeah, you run to the line and don't let the defense, the defensive line gets set up and get dug in."
49:34,680;49:37,980;"and you just snap the ball real quick and it did it twice it didn't work."
49:37,980;49:42,600;"It's great, fine. It doesn't work. But the quote from Manning"
49:42,600;49:46,960;"Atherame was, ""Sometimes we've done things like that in the past when we've"
49:46,960;49:50,920;"just punched it in before they, the defenders, have a chance to get set,"" Manning said."
49:50,920;49:55,080;"We got down to the one and I called the timeout. I think we were going over the"
49:55,080;49:59,000;"side and that we're going to go get into our goal line offense. Well, when I got"
49:59,000;50:01,840;"over there, we didn't have a goal line offense because the whole team is hurt."
50:01,840;50:04,240;"We had no fallback and no tight end."
50:04,240;50:06,240;"That's what it came down to."
50:06,240;50:08,240;"We had no personnel options."
50:08,240;50:11,440;"We had to stay with our three wide offense to the injuries."
50:11,440;50:16,440;"Even as a clock is a Clark getting hurt."
50:16,440;50:17,840;"You're fucking play call."
50:17,840;50:18,440;"I guess."
50:18,440;50:20,840;"We throw the fade to more head."
50:20,840;50:23,440;"Yeah."
50:23,440;50:24,440;"Yeah."
50:24,440;50:25,240;"Yeah."
50:25,240;50:29,440;"That might be worse than than throwing a slant with a game."
50:29,440;50:31,640;"More head and throw you deserve to lose."
50:31,640;50:37,480;"Yeah, not a good answer, but I guess he was the tallest receiver."
50:37,480;50:39,080;"How do you have a fucking season?"
50:39,080;50:43,960;"But, and if you're going to throw that, you do that on this, this quick down, right?"
50:43,960;50:47,280;"You run on first down, you run up like a year and a snap and you get these guys going,"
50:47,280;50:51,720;"okay, let's make sure we don't give up this quick run touchdown."
50:51,720;50:54,800;"And then you fool them by throwing, if you call a timeout and then you come out with"
50:54,800;50:59,000;"the fade, like that doesn't work that way, you know?"
50:59,000;51:00,000;"Right."
51:00,000;51:01,400;"Yeah, because they're prep for it."
51:01,400;51:08,120;"Like that, that defensive back out on that, on, on that corner knows, you know,"
51:08,120;51:09,280;"it's just me and him."
51:09,280;51:14,080;"I can, uh, you can sit there and get ready for repair himself for a fade or a slant or whatever."
51:14,080;51:20,200;"Aaron Moorehead, the rookie who ends the season with seven catches for a hundred and one yards."
51:20,200;51:21,200;"Let's throw him the fade."
51:21,200;51:21,400;"Yeah."
51:21,400;51:26,440;"Why the total more head off a, off a timeout."
51:26,440;51:26,880;"Right."
51:26,880;51:27,400;"Yes."
51:27,400;51:28,960;"You were injured and you have Reggie."
51:29,400;51:31,940;"You have Reggie Wayne, Marvin Harrison,"
51:31,940;51:33,440;"Pauler,"
51:33,440;51:35,480;"and Adrian James."
51:35,480;51:36,680;"You can catch your ball."
51:36,680;51:37,920;"That's a great point, Steve."
51:37,920;51:38,920;"That is a joke."
51:38,920;51:40,120;"It's great."
51:40,120;51:41,800;"Kill his call and throw a fade."
51:41,800;51:44,000;"I think it's because he's six, three, two, a hundred pounds."
51:44,000;51:45,480;"No."
51:45,480;51:47,440;"And you know, that's what I always told."
51:47,440;51:48,120;"We just throw him a fake."
51:48,120;51:50,880;"Greg, you have said this early on this podcast about how it was"
51:50,880;51:52,080;"that dumbest call in the NFL."
51:52,080;51:53,560;"Yeah, I hate it."
51:53,560;51:56,480;"Now, since you said that I'm so on your boat, you could."
51:56,480;51:57,000;"Yeah."
51:57,560;51:59,960;"Their chances, their success is not that good."
51:59,960;52:03,400;"- The only time you ever see a success is"
52:03,400;52:06,680;"when you throw up to Rob Gronkowski."
52:06,680;52:07,520;"- Yeah."
52:07,520;52:09,800;"- 'Cause he's just massively bigger than anybody covering him."
52:09,800;52:10,640;"- You guys are like a sea climber."
52:10,640;52:12,360;"You know, a receiver on a corner back."
52:12,360;52:13,200;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
52:13,200;52:14,080;"- That's one of the most of those."
52:14,080;52:15,060;"- Yeah."
52:15,060;52:17,800;"But even then it always looks difficult."
52:17,800;52:18,640;"- Yeah."
52:18,640;52:19,480;"- Like even when Grock would catch him,"
52:19,480;52:21,240;"it'd be like, whoa, that was a tough catch."
52:21,240;52:22,080;"- Yeah."
52:22,080;52:22,920;"- It's a surprise."
52:22,920;52:23,760;"- Yeah."
52:23,760;52:24,600;"- I thought it was a circus catch, you're right."
52:24,600;52:25,440;"- Yeah."
52:25,440;52:26,280;"- I agree."
52:26,280;52:28,760;"fourth and one, 14 seconds left."
52:28,760;52:32,000;"Oh, we didn't even mention the fact that"
52:32,000;52:35,500;"earlier on in this drive, I think."
52:35,500;52:36,760;"I don't remember exactly when it was,"
52:36,760;52:41,040;"but Willy McGinnis goes down hurt."
52:41,040;52:42,920;"- Yeah, so Willy makes a stop."
52:42,920;52:44,560;"- Yeah, her hair quotes hurt."
52:44,560;52:46,440;"- Does the rug."
52:46,440;52:50,200;"- Yeah, was he, well, he said he had cramps"
52:50,200;52:52,040;"and Belichick said he had a knee-brawl."
52:52,040;52:53,200;"- He had a knee issue."
52:53,200;52:54,600;"(laughing)"
52:54,600;52:55,440;"- After the game."
52:55,440;52:56,440;"the crowd."
52:56,440;52:58,280;"They didn't get on the same page on that one."
52:58,280;52:59,280;"Fucking crazy."
52:59,280;53:02,080;"Didn't fucking matter."
53:02,080;53:08,280;"So but he recovered in time because this was not part of these four plays."
53:08,280;53:10,560;"I think it was earlier in the drive."
53:10,560;53:13,800;"I think it might have been right before they called the time."
53:13,800;53:17,280;"I when they tried to do those first two quick runs, I don't know if he was in there or"
53:17,280;53:18,280;"not."
53:18,280;53:19,280;"He wasn't."
53:19,280;53:20,280;"No, they because I wrote down."
53:20,280;53:21,280;"Yeah, they match."
53:21,280;53:22,480;"Chatham was in there instead."
53:22,480;53:27,220;"And so I think the first play they ran at Matt Chatham and"
53:27,220;53:28,220;"Bruce gave me the tackle."
53:28,220;53:30,020;"Bruce gave me both those tackles."
53:30,020;53:30,700;"He did."
53:30,700;53:31,440;"Yeah."
53:31,440;53:33,160;"On the first and the second down play."
53:33,160;53:33,840;"That's on."
53:33,840;53:35,520;"Low key MVP."
53:35,520;53:36,020;"Brisky."
53:36,020;53:37,220;"You saw it."
53:37,220;53:39,420;"Uh, I didn't like that."
53:39,420;53:40,560;"I think change that rule."
53:40,560;53:41,820;"High tower like plays right there."
53:41,820;53:45,420;"Those two tackles because those should have been quarterback and runs."
53:45,420;53:49,540;"And even many said, you know, in his post game, we've had a lot of success doing that."
53:49,540;53:50,020;"Yep."
53:50,700;53:54,300;"Teddy's play an eye tower and make the clutch runs back to back place."
53:54,300;53:54,780;"Right."
53:54,780;53:55,140;"Yeah."
53:55,140;53:57,580;"And I liked that the, um,"
53:57,580;54:02,540;"the commentators are talking about how Teddy Bruski was the first small"
54:02,540;54:04,140;"linebacker to have success in the NFL."
54:04,140;54:04,620;"Yeah."
54:04,620;54:06,940;"I'm a fucking small Teddy Bruski."
54:06,940;54:07,660;"Monster now."
54:07,660;54:07,860;"Yeah."
54:07,860;54:09,140;"Right."
54:09,140;54:13,140;"Teddy Bruski was about 6, 1, 2, 47."
54:13,140;54:14,380;"So it's not tall."
54:14,380;54:16,860;"It's pretty empty."
54:16,860;54:18,780;"Uh, he's big enough."
54:18,780;54:24,380;"actually it's pretty light it's lighter than I thought it would be. I mean 247 yeah that's not"
54:24,380;54:31,500;"light dude but like you generally guys now are like 6 to 6 3 and that will not wait yeah so I mean"
54:31,500;54:37,420;"but I guess he was kind of like small compared to the linebackers before that you know the Willy"
54:37,420;54:42,300;"McGinnis if you will these big fucking the Ted Johnson's of the league the fucking massive"
54:43,020;54:44,020;"shitstompers."
54:44,020;54:49,020;"Yeah, four than one, 14 seconds left."
54:49,020;54:52,780;"And the Colts decide Edgar James, let the middle."
54:52,780;54:53,860;"That's the call to make."
54:53,860;54:58,220;"And McGinnis had, I don't know if I wrote the quote down or if I grabbed it."
54:58,220;55:03,420;"Talking about the like how he played that play."
55:03,420;55:07,180;"Where basically he's like, I know I'm coming in."
55:07,180;55:11,860;"I'm just like, I'm selling out on the run, but I don't want Meg to know that."
55:11,860;55:15,980;"So he turned and turned outside to the wide receiver."
55:15,980;55:18,460;"So it looked like he was going to hit him before he came."
55:18,460;55:24,100;"And then he turned back and Manning just assumed he was going to be in coverage."
55:24,100;55:32,220;"And so when William McGinnis came back, he saw that Manning had tapped his butt or some sort of signal"
55:32,220;55:34,900;"to say that he was running the ball."
55:34,900;55:40,620;"And so that's what keyed off William McGinnis to just come screaming off the edge"
55:40,620;55:44,540;"and caught Edgar James, what, two, three yards in the backfield?"
55:44,540;55:47,140;"Like, you didn't even make it to the pile before you got done."
55:47,140;55:48,140;"- I'm touched."
55:48,140;55:49,780;"- Oh, yeah, completely untouched."
55:49,780;55:52,380;"- Feels like it was a breakdown in blocking."
55:52,380;55:54,380;"- It wasn't good."
55:54,380;55:59,620;"- But I don't know enough about football to know whether that's true."
55:59,620;56:01,420;"- I watched the R22 Greg."
56:01,420;56:02,620;"- Getting on his knees."
56:02,620;56:06,220;"- Well, Peyton Manning didn't shift their protection"
56:06,220;56:08,660;"after the fucking motion, so."
56:08,660;56:09,660;"- Yeah."
56:09,660;56:16,940;"I mean, if you look closely, the tight end on that side crashes down."
56:16,940;56:20,720;"He's in the three technique as you can see here where that I've circled."
56:20,720;56:26,320;"I mean, he's not exactly standing up in what looks like he's going to be in coverage,"
56:26,320;56:30,920;"but literally just comes like screaming off the edge untouched."
56:30,920;56:33,020;"And I mean, he's uncovered on that side."
56:33,020;56:34,520;"There's no like tight end over there anyway."
56:36,560;56:41,240;"So yeah, it was just like the perfect play call, the perfect execution on defense."
56:41,240;56:47,180;"And and big, well, the perfect celebration, iconic celebration."
56:47,180;56:47,720;"Yeah."
56:47,720;56:49,240;"High stepping manning face."
56:49,240;56:53,040;"We just can't really see it because he's on his knees as we're running by him"
56:53,040;56:53,840;"with a finger up."
56:53,840;56:57,240;"And you can just think about the manning face on him right there."
56:57,240;56:58,000;"Yes."
56:58,000;56:58,720;"Yes."
56:58,720;57:03,440;"And again, this is the second point in this game where if you're a fan of"
57:03,440;57:08,860;"pages fan to this game. You are just ecstatic. The shift of"
57:08,860;57:11,680;"emotions. You're like, you're like, I can't believe we're gonna"
57:11,680;57:17,640;"lose this game to we fuck it. And really, you want to do the"
57:17,640;57:19,900;"same thing that William McGinnis is doing is just fucking"
57:19,900;57:23,220;"just stepping down. So much energy that you just want him,"
57:23,220;57:26,160;"you know, I love that feeling. I feel so good. Where you're"
57:26,160;57:30,000;"like, I just want to move. So excited."
57:32,960;57:40,040;"So good. Um, let's see. Anything else about this game that stuck out to you, boys?"
57:40,040;57:43,080;"We want to do that some worse."
57:43,080;57:46,600;"I can give you some stats first. If you want to do that. Sure."
57:46,600;57:49,840;"I have some notes on Marvin Harrison. All right."
57:49,840;57:52,960;"Let me give you. Let me do a save that for another day, but."
57:52,960;57:54,760;"All right. Let me do the nerd section here."
57:54,760;57:59,200;"Peyton Manning's last three home games for us in England."
57:59,200;58:05,920;"Like he hasn't done very well in New England, but at home against the Patriots coming into this game."
58:05,920;58:13,480;"In three games, 789 yards, six touchdowns, no interceptions and a rating of 121.9."
58:13,480;58:15,080;"And that's pretty good."
58:15,080;58:16,280;"That's fucking ridiculous."
58:16,280;58:19,320;"He's fucking dome merchant, but still he's the best at it."
58:19,320;58:27,320;"One of my favorite offense stats they showed was the cult offense."
58:27,560;58:34,760;"Their ranks in 03 they were ranked first and passing 28th and rushing and second overall"
58:34,760;58:38,280;"Why would you you know pass a model around the ball? You got paid money to pass it"
58:38,280;58:40,840;"But at green james still ran for 1200 yards"
58:40,840;58:44,200;"So you even like that didn't matter"
58:44,200;58:46,920;"um"
58:46,920;58:51,080;"Let's see. What is this one? Paying at home with NFL ranks on the season"
58:51,080;58:55,960;"First and completion percentage second and yards for attempt first and yards per game second in"
58:56,760;59:01,760;"keep you rating like just an absolute animal at home."
59:01,760;59:08,880;"Oh, and then they did the, uh, I've been enjoying these, just"
59:08,880;59:12,600;"looking back at them, the, the, um, the polls that they put up."
59:12,600;59:14,120;"Yeah."
59:14,120;59:19,080;"And this one was like, what was against the, the Cowboys, it"
59:19,080;59:20,680;"was who was the coach of the year this year."
59:20,680;59:23,960;"And Bill Parcells was first and Belichick was fifth."
59:23,960;59:24,760;"Yeah."
59:25,320;59:30,840;"nailed that one. Um, then this was, which of these AFC teams will be playing in Super Bowl 30,"
59:30,840;59:37,400;"five, six, seven, eight, 38 Indianapolis, Kansas City, Miami, New England, Tennessee."
59:37,400;59:45,240;"I think all those teams make the playoffs. So not like a huge fucking deal, but at least they,"
59:45,240;59:50,600;"at least they had the team on that. At the time, I think Cincinnati was stoked on that because"
59:50,600;59:52,440;"'cause they've been cracked for a while, right?"
59:52,440;59:56,180;"- Yeah, and I believe Cincinnati,"
59:56,180;01:00:00,360;"the week before had just beaten Kansas City"
01:00:00,360;01:00:02,920;"for their first loss of the season."
01:00:02,920;01:00:05,480;"So I think Cincinnati's like six in sections."
01:00:05,480;01:00:06,640;"I like right middle of the road,"
01:00:06,640;01:00:08,720;"but they had beaten Kansas City, like seven in--"
01:00:08,720;01:00:09,920;"- Corey Delling."
01:00:09,920;01:00:10,760;"- Yeah."
01:00:10,760;01:00:11,920;"- We'll hear about him later."
01:00:11,920;01:00:12,840;"- We sure will."
01:00:12,840;01:00:17,360;"Yeah, so those are my main stats."
01:00:17,360;01:00:19,400;"Do you guys wanna do best and worst?"
01:00:19,400;01:00:22,640;"Mike Vanderjack, 37 of 37 this year."
01:00:22,640;01:00:23,480;"- Yeah."
01:00:23,480;01:00:24,400;"- On field goal attempts."
01:00:24,400;01:00:26,560;"- Cool. - We'll get back to him."
01:00:26,560;01:00:29,040;"- The guy we just shit on the whole fucking podcast"
01:00:29,040;01:00:31,480;"had a perfect season kicking the ball."
01:00:31,480;01:00:32,320;"- Yeah."
01:00:32,320;01:00:34,320;"- How do you do tackling kicker turn this?"
01:00:34,320;01:00:35,160;"- I don't remember the thing."
01:00:35,160;01:00:36,880;"- That's his primary job."
01:00:36,880;01:00:39,640;"I think his primary job is kicking field goals."
01:00:39,640;01:00:41,080;"- Well, according to him."
01:00:41,080;01:00:42,760;"- Pretty good at it, you know."
01:00:42,760;01:00:43,840;"- Maybe."
01:00:43,840;01:00:45,880;"- I have a real best."
01:00:45,880;01:00:46,720;"- All right."
01:00:48,560;01:00:55,060;"I don't know how long this recording is right now, but we've got this entire fucking time with that Andy mentioning the commentators."
01:00:55,060;01:01:00,900;"Hmm. They were good. One thing positive or negative about the commentators."
01:01:00,900;01:01:02,900;"That means they were like stupendous."
01:01:02,900;01:01:12,940;"Yeah, they're this probably the most quality, compensated game we've watched and I have a nice quote."
01:01:12,940;01:01:15,140;"I bet we have the same one."
01:01:15,140;01:01:16,040;"Okay."
01:01:16,980;01:01:21,420;"Do you want to say to do I was about Bethel Johnson returning kicks?"
01:01:21,420;01:01:25,380;"Yeah, and this is why I think there's three big returns because he says something about"
01:01:25,380;01:01:31,100;"Slap me in a face with a skunk three times. You know, I wrote a verbatim because it was so good"
01:01:31,100;01:01:35,300;"Quote if you slap me in the face with a skunk three times, I'll figure out what it is"
01:01:35,300;01:01:39,140;"Yes, Phil Simcenter. Yeah"
01:01:39,140;01:01:41,780;"I like that"
01:01:41,780;01:01:46,260;"Break it off big returns in this game. Yeah, it's about not kicking to Bethel Johnson. Yes"
01:01:46,500;01:01:48,500;"Which I didn't figure out. Yeah"
01:01:48,500;01:01:53,340;"Also, this game got so exciting that Phil Sims literally fell out of his chair"
01:01:53,340;01:01:59,160;"At one point if he did like Phil are you all right Greg? I was like Phil are you all right? He's like"
01:01:59,160;01:02:01,580;"Yeah, this game is really exciting. Oh"
01:02:01,580;01:02:06,580;"You're talking about me just falling out of my chair you we he's like good doubles like yeah"
01:02:06,580;01:02:10,420;"I'm just gonna gloss over that but it's like yeah, it's so exciting. I fell out of my chair"
01:02:12,220;01:02:16,420;"It all fell. All right. Yeah, this was the NBC's 18 for sure"
01:02:16,420;01:02:21,100;"See I like the Brady quote and the when D. Drake Ward scored a touchdown"
01:02:21,100;01:02:26,860;"They said yeah Tom Brady talked to us last night and he said what a neat guy for us to pick up"
01:02:26,860;01:02:30,500;"fucking neat"
01:02:30,500;01:02:40,900;"Productive career more than you think yeah, and now Tom Brady's shit faced on a boat thrown the bomb already"
01:02:40,900;01:02:43,400;"He drove from one boat to another."
01:02:43,400;01:02:44,600;"I didn't watch any of that."
01:02:44,600;01:02:46,040;"Look how far he's matured."
01:02:46,040;01:02:46,880;"Yeah."
01:02:46,880;01:02:48,840;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:02:48,840;01:02:51,160;"I feel like he kind of peed now he's on his way back down again."
01:02:51,160;01:02:52,720;"He's going to be like a super goober."
01:02:52,720;01:02:53,360;"I know what it is."
01:02:53,360;01:02:54,120;"I saw it kind of--"
01:02:54,120;01:02:55,200;"I love it."
01:02:55,200;01:02:57,560;"--of Dante huddling the offensive line,"
01:02:57,560;01:02:59,640;"and Brady was listening in."
01:02:59,640;01:03:02,040;"So once he was removed from his life,"
01:03:02,040;01:03:04,200;"then I followed the trigger."
01:03:04,200;01:03:04,720;"Maybe."
01:03:04,720;01:03:05,220;"Yeah."
01:03:05,220;01:03:06,840;"Maybe Dante's kerneki was the--"
01:03:06,840;01:03:07,340;"Yes."
01:03:07,340;01:03:07,840;"That's a good--"
01:03:07,840;01:03:08,680;"The reason."
01:03:08,680;01:03:10,160;"He is the coming force."
01:03:10,160;01:03:11,000;"- Yeah."
01:03:11,000;01:03:12,160;"- All right."
01:03:12,160;01:03:17,600;"- I got another plus as well."
01:03:17,600;01:03:18,440;"- Okay."
01:03:18,440;01:03:21,040;"- I believe it was your boy Eugene Wilson"
01:03:21,040;01:03:22,920;"who committed a pass interference penalty"
01:03:22,920;01:03:24,540;"when he clearly got beat."
01:03:24,540;01:03:27,600;"But if he hadn't, I would have scored a touchdown"
01:03:27,600;01:03:29,800;"and he'll put the Colts on the one or whatever."
01:03:29,800;01:03:32,960;"I was like third quarter or so."
01:03:32,960;01:03:35,760;"And he was just gone."
01:03:35,760;01:03:37,480;"And if he doesn't commit that pass interference,"
01:03:37,480;01:03:38,960;"then that's an easy TD."
01:03:38,960;01:03:42,680;"And then they cut to Cole's guy to stand being like, yeah, we're number one."
01:03:42,680;01:03:45,920;"It is just the biggest Indianapolis Cooper ever seen."
01:03:45,920;01:03:46,760;"I hate."
01:03:46,760;01:03:53,480;"Well, that I was going to save that, but I was going to be my best, but I will"
01:03:53,480;01:04:01,760;"post this guy because I was at this guy with the turtle neck underneath the Jersey."
01:04:01,760;01:04:05,320;"The short sleeve turtle neck, obviously, underneath the Jersey."
01:04:05,320;01:04:06,040;"Yeah."
01:04:06,760;01:04:10,920;"I had to capture that I had to pause it and go back and capture this because this is like,"
01:04:10,920;01:04:13,720;"this is what I picture and Indianapolis Coleslaw look like."
01:04:13,720;01:04:16,840;"And I was going to need to be from Indianapolis."
01:04:16,840;01:04:20,360;"Wow, that's just the picture I get. They're just like,"
01:04:20,360;01:04:25,160;"keep man, he'll pull it out."
01:04:25,160;01:04:27,640;"That's how we know you don't get out of the state much Andy."
01:04:27,640;01:04:28,680;"Yeah, well that's why."
01:04:28,680;01:04:31,080;"I couldn't disagree more."
01:04:31,080;01:04:33,000;"I don't care."
01:04:33,000;01:04:34,840;"But Indiana, okay buddy?"
01:04:36,280;01:04:40,280;"Congrats. I was it. I think it's more impressive that I haven't"
01:04:40,280;01:04:47,640;"Let's go worse that"
01:04:47,640;01:04:50,840;"It's kind of a two-par in you know"
01:04:50,840;01:04:57,160;"It's the ads and the you know the what we what we got to see on the extra because this took a lot longer because it was no commercials cut out"
01:04:57,160;01:05:03,400;"Yeah, some of them were good. There is one about Jared as a judge like a judge"
01:05:03,880;01:05:04,720;"- I heard from someone."
01:05:04,720;01:05:06,240;"- The opinion was in some legal case,"
01:05:06,240;01:05:07,860;"which I thought was, you know,"
01:05:07,860;01:05:09,860;"(mumbles)"
01:05:09,860;01:05:11,520;"a little awkward for sure."
01:05:11,520;01:05:13,840;"- Yeah, it was a better one though,"
01:05:13,840;01:05:14,680;"that I found."
01:05:14,680;01:05:16,960;"- There's, all right, here we go."
01:05:16,960;01:05:19,440;"- Remember when Budweiser commercials were actually funny?"
01:05:19,440;01:05:23,440;"- Leon, your reactions following today's devastating loss."
01:05:23,440;01:05:25,200;"- Football's a tang sport now."
01:05:25,200;01:05:28,520;"So I gotta put the lost oily on the shoulders"
01:05:28,520;01:05:30,400;"of my supporting cast."
01:05:30,400;01:05:32,360;"Look, man, I've been carrying these guys the whole season,"
01:05:32,360;01:05:33,800;"I can't do it all."
01:05:33,800;01:05:35,000;"I need some help."
01:05:35,000;01:05:38,680;"So your four fumbles weren't a factor in your mind?"
01:05:38,680;01:05:41,280;"Not if one of those other guys would have jumped on the ball."
01:05:41,280;01:05:46,000;"Again, we can't do everything."
01:05:46,000;01:05:47,320;"There's no iron team."
01:05:47,320;01:05:48,760;"And they know we either."
01:05:48,760;01:05:53,880;"Again, ironic."
01:05:53,880;01:05:55,800;"It's in the Peyton Manning game, too."
01:05:55,800;01:05:58,040;"Exactly."
01:05:58,040;01:06:01,000;"Peyton Manning and Mike Vanderjakt in this."
01:06:01,000;01:06:02,600;"I wonder if either one of those."
01:06:02,600;01:06:03,480;"- And like that would be like,"
01:06:03,480;01:06:05,360;"I mean, I should probably still play today."
01:06:05,360;01:06:08,280;"And then the Diamond commercials are the same fucking thing too."
01:06:08,280;01:06:09,240;"- Oh yeah."
01:06:09,240;01:06:11,000;"Yeah, so all the car commercials,"
01:06:11,000;01:06:12,680;"exactly the same."
01:06:12,680;01:06:14,840;"Truck strap, two puddles, yay."
01:06:14,840;01:06:17,760;"- When are we getting widescreen?"
01:06:17,760;01:06:18,760;"- I don't know, yeah."
01:06:18,760;01:06:19,600;"It's gotta become the scene."
01:06:19,600;01:06:21,600;"- Whenever that, we got the first down line,"
01:06:21,600;01:06:22,840;"I think this year."
01:06:22,840;01:06:25,440;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:06:25,440;01:06:28,480;"I think we saw it for like prime time games last year,"
01:06:28,480;01:06:30,400;"but it's like official now for all the games this year."
01:06:30,400;01:06:32,520;"in every game and that's made a huge difference"
01:06:32,520;01:06:35,280;"and widescreen is gonna make a huge difference from you too."
01:06:35,280;01:06:36,120;"- Yeah."
01:06:36,120;01:06:37,960;"- All right."
01:06:37,960;01:06:39,080;"- Me too. - Greg, Greg,"
01:06:39,080;01:06:40,400;"give me your best and worst."
01:06:40,400;01:06:43,200;"- Can you go first?"
01:06:43,200;01:06:44,600;"I don't have anything."
01:06:44,600;01:06:45,760;"- Okay."
01:06:45,760;01:06:46,840;"- I didn't watch a game."
01:06:46,840;01:06:47,680;"(laughing)"
01:06:47,680;01:06:48,520;"- I watched."
01:06:48,520;01:06:50,040;"- You did the TFR all the time."
01:06:50,040;01:06:51,320;"- Just from memory, yeah."
01:06:51,320;01:06:54,760;"He's been bullsh*t us this entire time."
01:06:54,760;01:06:57,120;"Let's see."
01:06:57,120;01:07:02,920;"Um, there's a good bill, bellock check quote that they came out with."
01:07:02,920;01:07:09,400;"Um, talking to his team before the game, because they were getting a little, uh, high mighty"
01:07:09,400;01:07:11,520;"because they were nine and two."
01:07:11,520;01:07:15,640;"He said to his team, you want to be compared to that 2001 Super Bowl team?"
01:07:15,640;01:07:17,440;"How many games a day went after Thanksgiving?"
01:07:17,440;01:07:18,440;"Nine."
01:07:18,440;01:07:19,440;"How many of you won?"
01:07:19,440;01:07:20,440;"Zero."
01:07:20,440;01:07:26,040;"Fucking typical, Bell check right on their parade and then fucking nine and two."
01:07:26,040;01:07:31,520;"Um, and then at halftime, apparently his quote was this game will come down to who can protect the best at the end"
01:07:31,520;01:07:34,280;"Which, yeah, that's exactly what happened."
01:07:34,280;01:07:41,540;"Uh, let's see who else was good in this Tom Brady started off hot as hell. He was 11 for 11"
01:07:41,540;01:07:44,240;"Uh, before he finally missed in the second quarter."
01:07:44,240;01:07:50,140;"Um, Ken Walter already talked about garbage."
01:07:50,140;01:07:55,800;"Uh, Tony Dengy is done, which talked about, uh,"
01:07:55,880;01:07:59,840;"Peyton Manning, this is the first fumble in the first quarter that he lost in over a year,"
01:07:59,840;01:08:01,560;"which I thought was fucking ridiculous."
01:08:01,560;01:08:07,440;"And I think my worst was remembering."
01:08:07,440;01:08:15,280;"About the Colts, Peyton Manning, no huddle offense, where they used to just like not huddle,"
01:08:15,280;01:08:21,680;"but Manning would just like call audibles all the time at the line of scrimmage for like 30 seconds."
01:08:21,680;01:08:25,520;"And they put that in Madden and it was the fucking worst."
01:08:25,520;01:08:34,920;"because they've run no huddle the entire time, but then they would sit there and just like drain the clock down with Peyton Manning just going audible, audible, audible, and then eventually it's not the ball."
01:08:34,920;01:08:40,520;"Oh, oh, oh, just constantly. Yeah, it was brutal to play against games like so long."
01:08:40,520;01:08:53,320;"Um, and I've thought this before I think I've said it yet, but Marvin Harrison looks like somebody put the head of a 50 year old dude on the body of a football player."
01:08:53,320;01:08:58,740;"Like he's looked 50 years old like his entire career. That's really I don't have is the mustache or what it is"
01:08:58,740;01:09:02,540;"Just like it's facial features. It doesn't look like he didn't age either right?"
01:09:02,540;01:09:06,300;"Yeah, no, but he always looked like he's same age just 50. Yeah, he never got any older"
01:09:06,300;01:09:08,940;"Yeah, I bet he probably still looks like bad"
01:09:08,940;01:09:14,820;"Yeah, but he probably in 2003 was like 25 maybe"
01:09:14,820;01:09:21,180;"But he just looks he looks like like a 50 year old it looks like somebody's dad all the time"
01:09:21,340;01:09:23,340;"At least like a stone cold killer"
01:09:23,340;01:09:27,220;"Well, I mean he did have"
01:09:27,220;01:09:31,260;"1,200 yards 10 touchdowns and zero witnesses here"
01:09:31,260;01:09:34,380;"That wasn't a favor"
01:09:34,380;01:09:43,580;"Real we'll tease that for a later episode all right, but I have I looked into the Marvin Harrison"
01:09:43,580;01:09:46,380;"Shooting incident. Oh"
01:09:46,380;01:09:51,180;"All right, well, I will do a deep dive next time. I know it's coming down. I have a lot of pretty thoughts"
01:09:51,180;01:09:58,620;"just not well you know I mean it depends it's guilty or not well we'll see we'll get into the"
01:09:58,620;01:10:05,740;"nitty gritty next time yeah right there's my my best is from that to it that was so their"
01:10:05,740;01:10:14,780;"touchdown may need to Harrison that was their 66 TD pass from uh may need to Harrison that's a lot"
01:10:15,820;01:10:23,100;"Yeah, except when you think about where they finished at, the number one combo and it fell"
01:10:23,100;01:10:25,720;"history 114 times."
01:10:25,720;01:10:26,300;"Got to."
01:10:26,300;01:10:27,820;"And he threw touchdowns to Harris."
01:10:27,820;01:10:30,700;"Although Brady and Grock are going to be catching that."
01:10:30,700;01:10:34,860;"They were at 99 at the time of this writing."
01:10:34,860;01:10:36,220;"Okay."
01:10:36,220;01:10:38,060;"February 7th, 2021."
01:10:38,060;01:10:40,380;"So, yeah, three days ago."
01:10:40,380;01:10:43,580;"So, yeah, because that includes the two."
01:10:43,580;01:10:46,080;"- Do you want to guess number three?"
01:10:46,080;01:10:46,920;"- Oh."
01:10:46,920;01:10:48,960;"- I'll give you the team, 49ers."
01:10:48,960;01:10:52,260;"Montana Rice. - Yeah."
01:10:52,260;01:10:53,620;"- And..."
01:10:53,620;01:10:54,460;"- Close."
01:10:54,460;01:10:56,300;"- Steve Young. - Steve Young."
01:10:56,300;01:10:58,700;"- To Jerry Rice. - To Jerry Rice."
01:10:58,700;01:11:00,180;"- Jerry Stokes."
01:11:00,180;01:11:01,180;"(laughs)"
01:11:01,180;01:11:02,980;"- 92 times."
01:11:02,980;01:11:06,460;"- Philip Rivers to Antonio Gates 90."
01:11:06,460;01:11:07,380;"- Damn."
01:11:07,380;01:11:08,620;"- That's a lot."
01:11:08,620;01:11:11,420;"- Dan Marino to Mark Clayton 82."
01:11:11,420;01:11:14,580;"Ben Rothless burger to Mr. Big chest."
01:11:14,580;01:11:18,740;"D.A. Wow. They didn't even play that long together."
01:11:18,740;01:11:22,500;"Did they pay into Reggie Wayne 76?"
01:11:22,500;01:11:23,780;"Holy shit. He's on there twice."
01:11:23,780;01:11:27,020;"Yeah. Breeze to Colston, which is pretty interesting."
01:11:27,020;01:11:28,380;"Colston. Wow."
01:11:28,380;01:11:31,340;"They don't really think of Colston as like an household name."
01:11:31,340;01:11:34,060;"No. And then Aaron."
01:11:34,060;01:11:37,020;"The next one, uh, he's not top 10."
01:11:37,020;01:11:41,100;"Well, that's the thing. Like Brady has had so many"
01:11:41,100;01:11:44,880;"touch on so many different receivers that yeah and you know this is sort of"
01:11:44,880;01:11:51,300;"robbed by that Gonzalez Tony Gonzalez had it just he was like the Antonio Gates"
01:11:51,300;01:11:59,360;"same idea yeah a bunch of quarterbacks though yeah yeah like a"
01:11:59,360;01:12:03,360;"lack of its Gerald she has a shit on a touchdowns but I don't know if he has"
01:12:03,360;01:12:09,580;"10 from one quarterback at this point ridiculous all right did you have a"
01:12:09,580;01:12:16,320;"worse Greg? Well, games where there wasn't one. Yeah, there wasn't one. Just Tom Brady"
01:12:16,320;01:12:21,820;"interceptions. No, but do you want to you guys want to briefly talk about the Super Bowl"
01:12:21,820;01:12:32,180;"that just passed? I think we could probably do an episode on that. Steve, on Tom Brady"
01:12:32,180;01:12:37,140;"winning a Super Bowl not on the Patriots. It's certainly not an emergency. No, I think"
01:12:37,140;01:12:41,740;"Maybe it could be like a after we finish this season."
01:12:41,740;01:12:46,980;"We talk about the Brady winning a Super Bowl with the Patriots in 2003 and then do an"
01:12:46,980;01:12:50,380;"episode of 2020 Tom Brady winning a Super Bowl."
01:12:50,380;01:12:54,860;"Yeah, I don't know if I want to subject myself to rewatching all that, but I don't know."
01:12:54,860;01:12:56,940;"I didn't want to change your parade."
01:12:56,940;01:12:57,940;"Did you watch?"
01:12:57,940;01:13:02,340;"Were you happy that the Patriots won the Super Bowl Steve, the Patriots?"
01:13:02,340;01:13:04,740;"Yeah, I mean, the Bobby and the Fox."
01:13:04,740;01:13:06,740;"- I was ready for sure."
01:13:06,740;01:13:09,740;"- Speaking of other podcast related things though,"
01:13:09,740;01:13:13,740;"we're recording this on February 11th, 2021."
01:13:13,740;01:13:19,740;"That is exactly one year from when we launched this podcast."
01:13:19,740;01:13:21,740;"So congratulations, gentlemen. - So very thank you."
01:13:21,740;01:13:23,740;"- A full year, yes."
01:13:23,740;01:13:26,740;"- What the fuck do, why didn't we make a cake?"
01:13:26,740;01:13:27,740;"- You didn't get your cake?"
01:13:27,740;01:13:29,740;"- I've been telling you themed podcasts,"
01:13:29,740;01:13:31,740;"but I'm not going to make a cake."
01:13:31,740;01:13:35,740;"I've been telling you themed podcast birthday cakes."
01:13:35,740;01:13:36,740;"Come on."
01:13:36,740;01:13:37,740;"It's terrible."
01:13:37,740;01:13:39,740;"You know what makes great audio."
01:13:39,740;01:13:42,740;"Listen to three dudes eat fucking cake."
01:13:42,740;01:13:45,740;"Bad number guy lives with you."
01:13:45,740;01:13:47,740;"He didn't have way through these fucking things."
01:13:47,740;01:13:49,740;"Well, you know, guys got to live Andy."
01:13:49,740;01:13:54,740;"What am I going to be malnutritioned just for the sake of some fucking podcast?"
01:13:54,740;01:13:56,740;"I don't think anybody's going to consider you a nutrition."
01:13:56,740;01:13:57,740;"I tell you what."
01:13:57,740;01:13:58,740;"Fuck soup."
01:13:58,740;01:14:00,740;"Sorry to eat quietly."
01:14:00,740;01:14:02,580;"- Yes, you heard me though."
01:14:02,580;01:14:05,420;"- This episode, I apologize, but you know,"
01:14:05,420;01:14:07,020;"it's just one of those foods."
01:14:07,020;01:14:09,840;"- So, since I love numbers, I'll give you some."
01:14:09,840;01:14:15,620;"For, since we launched this, we have had 5,886 downloads"
01:14:15,620;01:14:17,180;"of the podcast."
01:14:17,180;01:14:18,460;"- Mm, that's the same amount of men"
01:14:18,460;01:14:19,940;"that have touched your penis, right, Andy?"
01:14:19,940;01:14:20,780;"- Also true."
01:14:20,780;01:14:22,540;"(laughing)"
01:14:22,540;01:14:23,860;"- That's annual, man."
01:14:23,860;01:14:25,780;"(laughing)"
01:14:25,780;01:14:27,100;"- Yeah, this is annual too."
01:14:27,100;01:14:28,180;"- This is over a year."
01:14:28,180;01:14:29,420;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:14:29,420;01:14:32,780;"So the numbers track."
01:14:32,780;01:14:34,740;"Yeah."
01:14:34,740;01:14:35,940;"Let's see."
01:14:35,940;01:14:37,140;"Do we have--"
01:14:37,140;01:14:38,500;"I don't know how to use this or--"
01:14:38,500;01:14:40,620;"How many episodes have we done?"
01:14:40,620;01:14:43,060;"Oh boy, we have done a lot of episodes."
01:14:43,060;01:14:44,220;"The guest, Steve."
01:14:44,220;01:14:46,140;"Yeah, give me a guess."
01:14:46,140;01:14:47,900;"Why don't we do 52?"
01:14:47,900;01:14:49,860;"I know we've done 50."
01:14:49,860;01:14:51,420;"We have no idea more than one a week."
01:14:51,420;01:14:57,820;"Well, when we launched, we launched three."
01:14:57,820;01:15:06,140;"right we pre recorded a bunch. So I think we have actually done one every week except"
01:15:06,140;01:15:14,120;"for last week and then over this past Christmas. So we have actually released 55 episodes."
01:15:14,120;01:15:22,320;"This will be 56 right now. We're 56 in 12 months. Surprising amounts. I hope they don't"
01:15:22,320;01:15:26,800;"expect that forever because no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah, it's going to end some point."
01:15:26,800;01:15:35,120;"I mean, this is very COVID specific, I think, the rate at which we're going."
01:15:35,120;01:15:38,520;"Well, I'm not excited to finish this season."
01:15:38,520;01:15:39,200;"Yeah."
01:15:39,200;01:15:39,560;"Yeah."
01:15:39,560;01:15:40,080;"Next season."
01:15:40,080;01:15:41,960;"This playoffs is going to be awesome."
01:15:41,960;01:15:42,760;"Four year or two."
01:15:42,760;01:15:43,800;"Yeah, this whole thing."
01:15:43,800;01:15:44,760;"Yeah, it's going to be great."
01:15:44,760;01:15:47,720;"Let's see."
01:15:47,720;01:15:48,480;"Oh, OK, here we go."
01:15:48,480;01:15:51,120;"Downloads per episode, the most popular episode."
01:15:51,120;01:15:55,280;"I don't know if I trust this is week one, 2001."
01:15:55,280;01:15:58,480;"That's probably the worst episode too."
01:15:58,480;01:16:08,400;"Yeah, but let's see, outside of the first one, two, three, week four is not popular."
01:16:08,400;01:16:12,160;"Week one, two, three and five of the first season."
01:16:12,160;01:16:16,240;"And then it's a Tombowy Emergency episode, 149 lessons."
01:16:16,240;01:16:17,920;"That makes sense."
01:16:17,920;01:16:18,920;"Yeah."
01:16:18,920;01:16:28,920;"of 2002. The emergency episode of when we pick up Cam Newton 132. So, Yungsen, naive."
01:16:28,920;01:16:36,040;"Yeah. And then a lot of the 2001 playoffs are on here. And then, yeah."
01:16:36,040;01:16:38,840;"Where does the Lions game rank? Because that was my favorite."
01:16:38,840;01:16:48,360;"The Patriots at Lions, 125 downloads. 2002, week 13, right? Yeah. So, not bad. Yeah,"
01:16:48,360;01:16:52,800;"Most of these are getting over 100 listens at this point."
01:16:52,800;01:16:56,760;"But we did see a bit of a drop."
01:16:56,760;01:17:00,680;"It seems when the season started right around."
01:17:00,680;01:17:05,880;"Actually, I think it was kind of when people realized maybe the"
01:17:05,880;01:17:10,800;"Patriots weren't doing great around around November."
01:17:10,800;01:17:12,960;"Things kind of dropped off a bit."
01:17:12,960;01:17:14,480;"Yeah."
01:17:14,480;01:17:16,960;"Well, we're fair weather fans, so I understand that."
01:17:17,720;01:17:21,080;"Yeah, no, I think all fair weather fans will make a podcast about"
01:17:21,080;01:17:24,480;"watching games from 20 years ago."
01:17:24,480;01:17:26,960;"What are you guys going to do in the off season?"
01:17:26,960;01:17:27,960;"Now there's no football."
01:17:27,960;01:17:34,120;"You guys got any like hobbies or, you know, planned activities or intro."
01:17:34,120;01:17:37,440;"Bro, you're you're you're a part of my hobby right now."
01:17:37,440;01:17:38,760;"Okay."
01:17:38,760;01:17:39,760;"Yeah."
01:17:39,760;01:17:40,920;"This is it though."
01:17:40,920;01:17:43,920;"They made a game when legal in Virginia."
01:17:43,920;01:17:46,280;"So say it a more."
01:17:46,560;01:17:48,200;"You're a gamble on WNBA."
01:17:48,200;01:17:53,960;"I put a $50 bet down on the NASCAR shit the other day."
01:17:53,960;01:17:55,760;"Yikes."
01:17:55,760;01:17:56,960;"As you do."
01:17:56,960;01:17:59,840;"How did you say $150 bet?"
01:17:59,840;01:18:06,360;"It was 50 bucks for Denny Hanlon complete one lap of the Daytona 500 plus 100."
01:18:06,360;01:18:07,120;"Did he?"
01:18:07,120;01:18:09,120;"I don't think it's happened yet."
01:18:09,120;01:18:11,160;"Yes."
01:18:11,160;01:18:12,360;"You have not won fucking left."
01:18:12,560;01:18:16,660;"So find out next week, how Steve lost 50 bucks."
01:18:16,660;01:18:20,660;"He's done a hamlin didn't actually fucking participate in this race,"
01:18:20,660;01:18:22,960;"but Steve didn't know it because he doesn't fall on ask."
01:18:22,960;01:18:24,060;"He's giving away money."
01:18:24,060;01:18:24,560;"It's great."
01:18:24,560;01:18:27,960;"Speaking of next week, what is next week?"
01:18:27,960;01:18:31,460;"Well, you want to wait?"
01:18:31,460;01:18:33,060;"What else you got going on here, Andy?"
01:18:33,060;01:18:36,060;"Let's let's get a peek inside."
01:18:36,060;01:18:38,060;"What else do we have going on?"
01:18:38,060;01:18:40,360;"Yeah, what else do you do for hobbies?"
01:18:40,360;01:18:41,460;"All right."
01:18:41,460;01:18:45,180;"Well, I know you always got a project going on."

01:18:46,620;01:18:48,980;"There is-- I wasn't about to announce it now,"
01:18:48,980;01:18:50,740;"but I guess I will."
01:18:50,740;01:18:54,780;"Going to be a revamp of the Patriots Dynasty website."
01:18:54,780;01:18:55,500;"So that's coming down."
01:18:55,500;01:18:57,580;"Something non-football related, Andy."
01:18:57,580;01:18:59,420;"Non-football related."
01:18:59,420;01:19:00,380;"I don't do it in there right now."
01:19:00,380;01:19:01,460;"I go hiking."
01:19:01,460;01:19:02,300;"Ooh, hiking."
01:19:02,300;01:19:04,260;"It's fucking cold right now, so I don't do that either."
01:19:04,260;01:19:05,060;"I'm on boots."
01:19:05,060;01:19:06,020;"Snow shoes?"
01:19:06,020;01:19:07,380;"You could try snowshoeing."
01:19:07,380;01:19:08,540;"I have snowshoes."
01:19:08,540;01:19:11,380;"Mom's getting snowshoes, she said."
01:19:11,380;01:19:14,900;"Yeah. If we get a bit more snow in my go skiing."
01:19:14,900;01:19:17,580;"That's what I'm going to do by yourself."
01:19:17,580;01:19:19,540;"You got any projects around the house going?"
01:19:19,540;01:19:21,940;"No, no projects around the house."
01:19:21,940;01:19:23,020;"No, no."
01:19:23,020;01:19:25,420;"What about yourself?"
01:19:25,420;01:19:26,580;"You got a project in the house?"
01:19:26,580;01:19:28,420;"If you need some advice, just let me know."
01:19:28,420;01:19:34,300;"With your all those months of experience you have."
01:19:34,300;01:19:36,700;"I'll come to you."
01:19:36,700;01:19:38,260;"I built a bet."
01:19:38,260;01:19:40,180;"I got a swing bed for the."
01:19:40,180;01:19:49,380;"my porch. Yeah. And no idea how I'm going to put it up. No. So it's just sitting in my living room."
01:19:49,380;01:19:56,740;"It's more than where you're keeping that because it's stinking the size of a bed. It's a twin-size"
01:19:56,740;01:20:02,420;"bed. Like it's a bed frame that you think you're going to hang from the roof of your porch. Yeah."
01:20:02,420;01:20:06,900;"I'm filling in the wood shed. You know what I'm saying up there. Yeah. That is a falls and falls"

01:20:51,700;01:20:55,620;"- Djibouti, Djibouti. - Did you get deployed?"

01:21:58,020;01:22:05,020;"I got it. When will you next go to like a Patriots sized group of fans?"
01:22:05,020;01:22:08,060;"So you're going to a professional sporting event?"
01:22:08,060;01:22:12,580;"Concerts? Like 10,000 people, you know, you're in a big ass crowd."
01:22:12,580;01:22:15,060;"Okay. That's really the test of what it's back."
01:22:15,060;01:22:16,820;"You know, that's what I've been saying too."
01:22:16,820;01:22:19,340;"That's when I know it's over. Yeah."
01:22:19,340;01:22:20,340;"Yeah."
01:22:20,340;01:22:23,860;"So September."
01:22:25,220;01:22:28,020;"I mean, you could go to a baseball game this summer, right?"
01:22:28,020;01:22:30,420;"Yeah, but like when will you be back to that?"
01:22:30,420;01:22:34,060;"Yeah, but well, will that have?"
01:22:34,060;01:22:39,540;"So we talk about when will pro when will pro sports allow capacity fans at"
01:22:39,540;01:22:40,100;"games? Yeah. Okay."
01:22:40,100;01:22:40,660;"That's what I'm saying."
01:22:40,660;01:22:41,100;"Yeah."
01:22:41,100;01:22:43,660;"I think that you can go to a baseball game, but I don't think it'll be"
01:22:43,660;01:22:45,460;"at capacity this summer."
01:22:45,460;01:22:46,460;"Right."
01:22:46,460;01:22:50,660;"But I think there's so much money in the NFL that it will be"
01:22:50,660;01:22:51,780;"September the latest."
01:22:51,780;01:22:54,420;"I think you'll have full fans by September."
01:22:54,700;01:22:59,900;"Steve. I'm gonna go one year from today."
01:22:59,900;01:23:03,980;"You sicko."

01:23:12,700;01:23:18,540;"Okay, I got another never. I'm just following the CDC recommended guidelines."
01:23:18,540;01:23:21,900;"This is what we're doing. Fouching forever. For expected until 2022."
01:23:22,780;01:23:24,620;"I'm optimistic of anything."
01:23:24,620;01:23:25,620;"Yeah."
01:23:25,620;01:23:30,620;"And the other piece of information is we know that COVID is not real."
01:23:30,620;01:23:35,660;"So really, it's how much is the government willing to push us until they break us?"
01:23:35,660;01:23:37,420;"Yeah, when will the sheep wake up?"
01:23:37,420;01:23:38,420;"Yeah."
01:23:38,420;01:23:39,980;"Oh, God, we don't need that."
01:23:39,980;01:23:41,420;"What are we in for wars?"
01:23:41,420;01:23:42,420;"God damn it."
01:23:42,420;01:23:45,420;"We're banned."
01:23:45,420;01:23:47,420;"It's called me Andy Jones."
01:23:47,420;01:23:48,420;"Great."
01:23:48,420;01:23:51,140;"Get deplatformed every speed."
01:23:51,140;01:23:53,060;"- Turn in the fogs, gay!"
01:23:53,060;01:23:54,860;"- What's your date, Greg?"
01:23:54,860;01:23:55,700;"- Yeah."
01:23:55,700;01:24:00,620;"- See, I like both of your calls of like,"
01:24:00,620;01:24:04,180;"I think the NFL, it's more likely to start a season"
01:24:04,180;01:24:07,340;"to go right into it than to transition halfway through a year,"
01:24:07,340;01:24:08,180;"right?"
01:24:08,180;01:24:09,900;"Like baseball is not gonna just be like halfway through,"
01:24:09,900;01:24:12,260;"be like, all right, now we're doing full."
01:24:12,260;01:24:14,060;"NFL makes sense."
01:24:14,060;01:24:18,300;"I think maybe, NBA is not gonna do it"
01:24:18,300;01:24:20,180;"'cause zero is the softest."
01:24:20,180;01:24:21,660;"- Yeah, for most people."
01:24:21,660;01:24:22,980;"- Hockey. - Hockey."
01:24:22,980;01:24:24,700;"- I can't do it. - Hockey."
01:24:24,700;01:24:26,180;"- When's that start?"
01:24:26,180;01:24:28,540;"- October, November."
01:24:28,540;01:24:30,340;"- End of the year, yeah, November."
01:24:30,340;01:24:32,780;"I'm saying November, write it down."
01:24:32,780;01:24:34,140;"The Boston Bruins."
01:24:34,140;01:24:37,460;"- It's the Andy September, you're November, I am February."
01:24:37,460;01:24:40,780;"- Okay, actually when will Biden be out of office?"
01:24:40,780;01:24:42,340;"'Cause that's mine now."
01:24:42,340;01:24:44,460;"This is all a Biden conspiracy."
01:24:44,460;01:24:46,020;"Greg sold me."
01:24:46,020;01:24:47,420;"So four years."
01:24:47,420;01:24:52,420;"- He dies in office."
01:24:52,420;01:24:55,420;"- Yeah, it depends on when we storm the cap."
01:24:55,420;01:24:58,420;"- In four years, he stages a coup, remains in office."
01:24:58,420;01:25:00,420;"- We're gonna get removed from my team."
01:25:00,420;01:25:04,420;"- Now, is it gonna be a coup or is it gonna be a coup d'etat?"
01:25:04,420;01:25:08,420;"- No, a coup d'etat is only for a certain,"
01:25:08,420;01:25:11,420;"it has to be a coup in a specific region of France."
01:25:11,420;01:25:13,420;"Otherwise, it's just a coup."
01:25:13,420;01:25:14,420;"- That's not true."
01:25:14,420;01:25:16,420;"- Like champagne, yeah, you can only call it champagne."
01:25:16,420;01:25:18,420;"You can only call it champagne. No, you can't"
01:25:18,420;01:25:27,000;"Other countries. Nope. Nope. It's a I'm pretty sure coup d'etat is like a military one, isn't it?"
01:25:27,000;01:25:31,960;"Yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty sure my explanation was a joke that you missed"
01:25:31,960;01:25:35,500;"Why because it's a French word"
01:25:35,500;01:25:40,380;"Yes, because that's how that's how the French handle champagne. It can only be called champagne"
01:25:40,380;01:25:44,460;"Although it has to be called sparkling wine or whatever. Fuck it. All right next week"
01:25:45,900;01:25:51,740;"Whoever comes to the podcast with the best foracle score on Brady's touchdowns."
01:25:51,740;01:25:53,500;"You've already taken it."
01:25:53,500;01:25:54,140;"You fucking."
01:25:54,140;01:25:57,300;"And you're going to come with a zero because you're not going to be there."
01:25:57,300;01:25:58,380;"So okay."
01:25:58,380;01:25:59,900;"Okay."
01:25:59,900;01:26:00,780;"So shit."
01:26:00,780;01:26:03,020;"Can you name Super Bowl winners in a row?"
01:26:03,020;01:26:08,020;"Starting in which way I start with 2001."
01:26:08,020;01:26:10,380;"Oh, yeah."
01:26:10,380;01:26:12,020;"I will save this for next week."
01:26:12,020;01:26:12,860;"Okay."
01:26:12,860;01:26:14,700;"This is going to walk."
01:26:14,700;01:26:15,780;"You think you could do it, though?"
01:26:15,780;01:26:24,680;"from 2001 onwards. Yes. I could. Well, I think you should go 2020 backwards and see you can go for this back. Yeah. But we'll do that next week."
01:26:24,680;01:26:30,040;"But then you're going to study and you're going to know it. No, no. I'm going to study. I got time for that."
01:26:30,040;01:26:34,580;"If anybody can tell me to be you Greg. So I'm not worried. Well, I already did study."
01:26:34,580;01:26:39,680;"Greg, Greg, I didn't watch any of our machines, but I did watch every other Super Bowl going backwards from 2000."
01:26:39,680;01:26:41,280;"Yeah, exactly."
01:26:41,280;01:26:43,580;"I don't have time to watch the game."
01:26:43,580;01:26:48,480;"I was like, who, who did the Steelers be in big bands first?"
01:26:48,480;01:26:51,380;"Did I have no idea?"
01:26:51,380;01:26:51,880;"Yeah."
01:26:51,880;01:26:59,780;"It's one Randall L score to touch on from a score to touchdown through a touchdown."
01:26:59,780;01:27:01,580;"They're touching behinds for it."
01:27:01,580;01:27:02,180;"Yeah."

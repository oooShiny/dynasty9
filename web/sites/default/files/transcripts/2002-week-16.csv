00:00,000;00:06,780;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,780;00:08,200;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,200;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:13,920;"they're just being stupid."
00:13,920;00:15,480;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,480;00:16,480;"Go right ahead."
00:16,480;00:18,400;"I am not your mother."
00:18,400;00:26,520;"Welcome back to the Page of Stimesy Podcast."
00:26,520;00:31,520;"We are mercifully almost finished with the 2002 season."
00:31,520;00:36,920;"But before we actually finished,"
00:36,920;00:39,520;"we actually have to watch some of these games"
00:39,520;00:41,520;"at the end of the season."
00:41,520;00:43,880;"We've had a lot of help so far throughout this season"
00:43,880;00:46,420;"because it has been a rough one."
00:46,420;00:49,720;"We've had some friends on, we've had Connor on,"
00:49,720;00:51,240;"we've had some experts on."
00:52,680;00:54,400;"And this time we have both."
00:54,400;00:58,960;"We have a friend of mine who is also,"
00:58,960;01:01,440;"maybe experts a strong word, but a legend."
01:01,440;01:02,520;"- I know, not an expert now."
01:02,520;01:04,440;"- Reddit famous, maybe?"
01:04,440;01:05,280;"(laughing)"
01:05,280;01:07,680;"- Just an archivist, an archivist."
01:07,680;01:09,260;"- All right."
01:09,260;01:10,100;"I like that."
01:10,100;01:14,440;"Yeah, we know her as Lisa,"
01:14,440;01:16,400;"but you probably know her as Timnog"
01:16,400;01:19,640;"if you're ever on the Patriot subreddit"
01:19,640;01:24,640;"because she is probably the most famous user"
01:24,640;01:27,600;"on that Patriot subreddit?"
01:27,600;01:30,280;"- Yeah, for sure."
01:30,280;01:33,540;"- Maybe other than random times,"
01:33,540;01:34,840;"Julian posts on there."
01:34,840;01:37,040;"- Yeah, he doesn't count."
01:37,040;01:37,860;"- Yeah."
01:37,860;01:39,280;"- He's not a real Redditor, is he?"
01:39,280;01:42,560;"Not a nerd like the rest of us."
01:42,560;01:44,200;"- Yeah, that's a hassle."
01:44,200;01:47,800;"- I'm happy to be here."
01:47,800;01:50,620;"- Yeah, thanks for joining us."
01:50,620;01:54,420;"Apologies in advance, one for making you watch this game"
01:54,420;01:56,900;"and two for my brothers."
01:56,900;01:57,880;"So I'm sure they'll say something"
01:57,880;01:59,500;"- Why? - I'm inappropriate."
01:59,500;02:00,340;"- What is that supposed to mean?"
02:00,340;02:01,700;"- You know why. - You know why."
02:01,700;02:03,200;"- Three brothers, just Greg."
02:03,200;02:04,680;"(laughing)"
02:04,680;02:06,100;"- Fair enough. - So good."
02:06,100;02:07,100;"I'm excited."
02:07,100;02:07,940;"- Yeah."
02:07,940;02:11,340;"But we've been internet friends for a while"
02:11,340;02:14,300;"and I realize I actually don't know"
02:14,300;02:17,340;"how you got into being a Patsvang"
02:17,340;02:19,660;"'cause you're not from around here."
02:19,660;02:23,020;"- I am not, but I will be soon, which I'm stoked about."
02:23,020;02:24,820;"- Cool, oh, that's right, yeah, here."
02:24,820;02:26,780;"Who gets the area at some point?"
02:26,780;02:29,820;"- Yeah, I'm looking forward to getting out of Arizona"
02:29,820;02:33,820;"'cause it's 101 today and I'm over it."
02:33,820;02:36,980;"- Isn't it 101 every day though?"
02:36,980;02:39,540;"- Let's see."
02:39,540;02:40,380;"- Pretty much."
02:40,380;02:45,660;"- Yeah, it, no, it's gonna get down to 98 on Saturday."
02:45,660;02:48,540;"So there's things to look forward to."
02:48,540;02:49,860;"- I stand corrected."
02:49,860;02:56,420;"- My husband is a Pads fan and he,"
02:56,420;02:58,580;"I don't wanna use the word indoctrinated me,"
02:58,580;03:01,940;"but he strongly suggested that they would be the best team"
03:01,940;03:03,540;"in the NFL to follow."
03:03,540;03:04,940;"And it's been a great ride."
03:04,940;03:06,860;"So I mean, I'm really excited."
03:06,860;03:08,260;"- How long ago was this?"
03:08,260;03:14,060;"- Oh geez, we've been together 15, 16 years, so."
03:14,660;03:15,920;"- I'm done."
03:15,920;03:19,220;"- So you're an Arizona born and raised?"
03:19,220;03:21,460;"- No, I'm from California."
03:21,460;03:24,560;"- Okay, just slowly making her way."
03:24,560;03:28,500;"So did you have a sports team before the Patriots?"
03:28,500;03:32,420;"- No, because growing up in LA, the age that I am,"
03:32,420;03:36,460;"I'm 36, no one was really a Rams fan"
03:36,460;03:40,940;"and no one where I lived was a Raiders fan."
03:40,940;03:45,340;"So LA did not really have a strong football affiliation"
03:45,340;03:46,580;"at all at that time."
03:46,580;03:49,980;"If I grew up in LA now,"
03:49,980;03:52,580;"I'd probably be super stoked about the Rams."
03:52,580;03:55,380;"I don't think anybody stoked about the Chargers ever."
03:55,380;03:57,620;"- Nope."
03:57,620;04:00,460;"Not even the doctors."
04:00,460;04:02,540;"- No, oh man, that's all."
04:02,540;04:07,100;"But yeah, we've seen some good games along the way"
04:07,100;04:08,940;"and it's been a really cool journey."
04:08,940;04:11,460;"This, this offseason was hard."
04:11,460;04:14,940;"I'm, I'm sure you guys have talked about that on the podcast."
04:14,940;04:16,100;"Yeah."
04:16,100;04:17,340;"Yeah."
04:17,340;04:23,220;"That, that one month between our like MVP quarterbacks, it was a difficult"
04:23,220;04:23,620;"month."
04:23,620;04:25,180;"Yeah."
04:25,180;04:26,620;"I know we publish a podcast."
04:26,620;04:28,140;"I don't remember recording much of it."
04:28,140;04:30,020;"When Tom Brady left."
04:30,020;04:34,500;"Uh, so my thoughts are out there somewhere, but."
04:34,500;04:35,980;"Yeah."
04:36,300;04:40,500;"Yeah, it's been tough to watch him play for a different team."
04:40,500;04:47,220;"Yeah, I was very like petty in game one and then I ate all my words in game two."
04:47,220;04:48,420;"Yeah."
04:48,420;04:50,500;"So yeah, that's where I'm at."
04:50,500;04:55,940;"Well, I was, I was all supportive until Brady ran for that first touchdown."
04:55,940;04:56,540;"I'm like, fuck it."
04:56,540;04:57,900;"Now he's doing it for somebody else."
04:57,900;04:58,740;"Yep."
04:58,740;05:01,100;"And then I got like super salty about it."
05:01,100;05:05,220;"Uh, and then yeah, then he lost and threw a pick six."
05:05,220;05:08,500;"I'm like, oh well, I still love them though."
05:08,500;05:11,260;"- I thought it was good to get our gut reactions"
05:11,260;05:12,100;"as soon as it happened,"
05:12,100;05:13,540;"'cause I think I feel different now."
05:13,540;05:14,700;"I'm fine with it."
05:14,700;05:16,660;"- You've made your piece?"
05:16,660;05:17,500;"- Yep."
05:17,500;05:18,340;"- I'm about to know."
05:18,340;05:20,180;"- There's Cam Newton, a reason that you're fine with it."
05:20,180;05:22,460;"- I think you're good, and the bucks to not do good."
05:22,460;05:24,540;"That way."
05:24,540;05:25,660;"- You want the bucks to lose, Steve?"
05:25,660;05:26,660;"That's what you're gonna say?"
05:26,660;05:27,900;"- Yeah, I can river concrete."
05:27,900;05:28,740;"I'm not gonna river the box."
05:28,740;05:29,900;"- I'm believable."
05:29,900;05:31,140;"- Unbelievable."
05:31,140;05:31,980;"- I get it."
05:33,100;05:34,820;"I might be a bigger bucks fan now."
05:34,820;05:36,580;"Whoa."
05:36,580;05:38,140;"Has them."
05:38,140;05:42,700;"Well, you can go start your own fucking podcast."
05:42,700;05:44,260;"I'm gonna get me some pewter pants."
05:44,260;05:48,580;"Having having cam really helps."
05:48,580;05:52,220;"If we didn't have cam, that would be brutal."
05:52,220;05:53,140;"I agree."
05:53,140;05:53,980;"Yeah."
05:53,980;05:57,620;"Yeah. I think just seeing a completely different"
05:57,620;05:58,620;"offense out there."
05:58,620;06:00,380;"Yeah, it's been fun."
06:00,380;06:00,860;"Yeah."
06:00,860;06:01,260;"Exactly."
06:01,260;06:02,820;"You've just been a nice change of pace."
06:02,820;06:05,220;"'cause some of you've seen from all these other teams"
06:05,220;06:08,220;"that get the young Adjaw quarterbacks,"
06:08,220;06:10,180;"they're like, oh, well, that looks fun,"
06:10,180;06:13,300;"but we have Tom Brady, so we'll be okay without it."
06:13,300;06:14,140;"- Right."
06:14,140;06:18,980;"- And now we actually get to enjoy it for ourselves for once."
06:18,980;06:22,820;"- And like, I still worry about Cam when he runs,"
06:22,820;06:25,180;"but it's not like a same kind of worry you have"
06:25,180;06:27,480;"for like your grandfather, you know,"
06:27,480;06:30,140;"following and breaking a hip that I didn't expect."
06:30,140;06:31,660;"- Or Tom Brady running."
06:31,660;06:32,660;"Yeah. Yeah."
06:32,660;06:35,460;"It's so true."
06:35,460;06:37,580;"You was running a lot in 2002."
06:37,580;06:40,260;"I was going to say speaking of Tom Brady running."
06:40,260;06:44,740;"I think we may have seen his longest run of his career"
06:44,740;06:46,500;"to this point in this game."
06:46,500;06:51,180;"Remember the whopping 15 yards on third down, right?"
06:51,180;06:52,020;"Yeah."
06:52,020;06:56,740;"And that may be the only highlight."
06:56,740;07:01,100;"One of three highlights that I can think of from this game off the top of my"
07:01,100;07:05,020;"head. Are there? Go ahead."
07:05,020;07:06,380;"Any fun."
07:06,380;07:09,300;"I think it's on Peach's Dynasty or no. Or do you just leave this this one off?"
07:09,300;07:14,540;"I cut that. I'll have them on the website when this comes out. But I think there"
07:14,540;07:20,220;"will be three. One of them is Tom Rees scramble. One of them is basically Kevin"
07:20,220;07:25,140;"Falk, who is the only player who produced in this game. And Brady's touchdown"
07:25,140;07:26,900;"pass, which is probably already in there."
07:27,380;07:28,820;"So we're done with the game."
07:28,820;07:29,320;"Good."
07:29,320;07:32,180;"I'm done talking about this week."
07:32,180;07:36,100;"Well, this is a big game, though."
07:36,100;07:40,660;"I mean, as far as like this is like the culmination of the season up to this point, right?"
07:40,660;07:41,420;"Right."
07:41,420;07:47,420;"I mean, both teams are what the Pats are eight and six coming in and the Jets were seven and seven."
07:47,420;07:48,300;"Yep."
07:48,300;07:50,900;"So you got two divisional games to finish the season."
07:50,900;07:53,420;"That's really going to decide if you're making playoffs or not."
07:53,420;07:54,140;"Yeah."
07:54,140;07:56,100;"I won't spoil it for you, but."
07:56,540;07:59,580;"Yeah, if you win both of these, you're in the playoffs."
07:59,580;08:00,460;"Yeah."
08:00,460;08:02,860;"If you were one of them, you need help."
08:02,860;08:03,980;"Refresh my memory."
08:03,980;08:08,300;"What happened to Testa Verdi that Chad Pennington started this game?"
08:08,300;08:09,900;"He sucked."
08:09,900;08:10,420;"Yeah."
08:10,420;08:12,420;"So he was just..."
08:12,420;08:13,660;"I think, yeah."
08:13,660;08:14,140;"Yeah."
08:14,140;08:17,980;"So they started out the season one and three with Testa Verdi."
08:17,980;08:21,180;"And then as soon as Pennington came in, they said..."
08:21,180;08:24,340;"So actually, I read into Pennington a little bit."
08:24,340;08:30,580;"And it's it's it's kind of interesting how that all played out because he was a first round"
08:30,580;08:38,500;"draft pick in 2000. So he's one of the Brady six. Yeah, he was the first first of the Brady six"
08:38,500;08:46,020;"in that draft. Oh, by the Jets. By the Jets. Yep. He played as a high pick, then, obviously."
08:46,020;08:50,500;"Do you know who who he was throwing to at in college? Yeah, I do."
08:51,700;08:54,940;"- Randy Moss. - Wow."
08:54,940;08:57,340;"- At the thundering herd of marshmallows."
08:57,340;09:00,180;"- 'Cause I just remember there's one particular"
09:00,180;09:02,980;"Randy Moss highlight from college."
09:02,980;09:04,820;"- I know exactly which one you found."
09:04,820;09:05,820;"- I know what you're showing."
09:05,820;09:09,020;"Chad Peddington throws a wide receiver screen to him"
09:09,020;09:12,740;"and there's two defenders, 10 yards downfield"
09:12,740;09:15,620;"and Randy Moss splits them and outruns them,"
09:15,620;09:17,220;"giving them a 10 yard headstock."
09:17,220;09:21,340;"- He like skips them too, like he like skips over them."
09:21,340;09:23,940;"It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen."
09:23,940;09:24,700;"All right."
09:24,700;09:27,140;"Let's add that highlight to the game."
09:27,140;09:29,020;"Yeah."
09:29,020;09:32,540;"Well, you know what's funny is if you were doing highlights,"
09:32,540;09:35,180;"Chad Pennington had a great game."
09:35,180;09:38,900;"I mean, you get way more Jets highlights out of this game"
09:38,900;09:40,180;"than Pat's highlight."
09:40,180;09:42,020;"Lisa, I think you know better than I do,"
09:42,020;09:43,660;"that we don't do Jets highlights."
09:43,660;09:45,580;"I know, I know."
09:45,580;09:47,700;"I agree, that was Pennington played pretty decently."
09:47,700;09:50,660;"And honestly, I never really truly hated Pennington."
09:50,660;09:52,700;"like I should since for being a chef."
09:52,700;09:53,980;"- Is he a good player?"
09:53,980;09:54,820;"- Yeah."
09:54,820;09:56,060;"- He's not surrounded a bunch too,"
09:56,060;09:58,300;"so that lessened it for me."
09:58,300;09:59,420;"- Yeah."
09:59,420;10:02,660;"Well, do you wanna, so I went through his career"
10:02,660;10:05,420;"and there was some interesting stuff in there."
10:05,420;10:07,420;"Usually I go to like the off the field stuff,"
10:07,420;10:10,820;"but he is, I think he's like playing yogurt off the field."
10:10,820;10:11,900;"- Yeah, he's too clean."
10:11,900;10:14,660;"- He's absolutely nothing of interest, I think, fine."
10:14,660;10:18,220;"But so he was drafted in 2000,"
10:18,220;10:22,020;"same time as Brady, he spent two years behind"
10:22,020;10:24,060;"the best of the birdie."
10:24,060;10:26,060;"And test the birdie really didn't even play that well either."
10:26,060;10:32,260;"Like last year, I mean, they went 10 and six last year, but he had like 15 touchdowns, 14 pigs."
10:32,260;10:34,780;"So it might just be a sign of the times."
10:34,780;10:39,820;"I know they used to like let quarterbacks work their way into a bit more."
10:39,820;10:42,700;"So they will start the rookie, did you?"
10:42,700;10:43,300;"Right."
10:43,300;10:43,540;"Right."
10:43,540;10:47,260;"So this year is when he makes his real first appearances."
10:47,340;10:50,260;"And he like completely turns a team around."
10:50,260;10:52,900;"So no in Jets fans."
10:52,900;10:56,100;"I'm assuming the hype train was like in full steam."
10:56,100;10:57,100;"Yeah."
10:57,100;11:00,420;"Cause they make, they make the playoffs."
11:00,420;11:00,980;"Well there."
11:00,980;11:04,740;"And then he beats Manning in the first round 41 to nothing."
11:04,740;11:05,900;"Wow."
11:05,900;11:11,420;"So yeah, they were, they were pretty, they had a pretty good season and they were"
11:11,420;11:12,340;"really hyped on them."
11:13,180;11:18,460;"So you'll like this, Steve, then next year in the fourth pre-season game,"
11:18,460;11:20,620;"he dislocates his hand."
11:20,620;11:24,340;"I'm sorry. What? Yeah."
11:24,340;11:27,060;"I don't know why he was playing in the fourth game."
11:27,060;11:29,940;"Also, how do you dislocate your hand?"
11:29,940;11:31,700;"No, I do. It's not like it's one boat."
11:31,700;11:34,620;"We jet spans, dislocated their hands, jerking off to the thought."
11:34,620;11:38,260;"He's the new Tom Brady."
11:38,260;11:42,060;"Then it heals enough in time for Sanchez to come along and they break it again."
11:42,060;11:50,220;"Yeah, so we missed the first five games of the year because that they finished six and"
11:50,220;11:56,180;"10. And then the next year, they give them a seven year, 64 million dollar contract."
11:56,180;11:57,700;"Oh my God."
11:57,700;11:58,700;"Oops."
11:58,700;12:05,700;"That turned out it didn't go well."
12:05,700;12:10,620;"The quote I took took out of here was he was he was beefing with the media in New York"
12:10,620;12:18,020;"too. Pennington scolded the assembled media telling them it was not their right but a"
12:18,020;12:22,660;"privilege of theirs to cover the jets to be around a bunch of professional athletes"
12:22,660;12:37,220;"every day and do your job. I love that. I like America. As a journalist, I am very offended."
12:37,220;12:44,820;"is also a strong word. Yeah, it is. So that he has also the injuries. I mean, it makes a playoffs,"
12:44,820;12:52,100;"you know, for, but he's got he has that shoulder injuries. Oh, six, he wins. Come back player of"
12:52,100;13:00,020;"the year. More years of injuries. And then he gets traded to Miami and wins come back player of"
13:00,020;13:03,740;"of the year again in Miami in 2008."
13:03,740;13:05,180;"- Oh yeah."
13:05,180;13:08,660;"- And he was actually second in MVP voting set here."
13:08,660;13:09,740;"- Nah, he should."
13:09,740;13:12,700;"- That's wild."
13:12,700;13:13,540;"- Yeah, and then-"
13:13,540;13:15,700;"- I wonder if there's any other player"
13:15,700;13:19,020;"that's one comeback player of the year twice."
13:19,020;13:20,100;"- He's the only one."
13:20,100;13:21,980;"Yeah, they mentioned that."
13:21,980;13:22,980;"- That is interesting."
13:22,980;13:24,460;"(laughing)"
13:24,460;13:26,300;"- But one of the years he won it was,"
13:29,300;13:31,220;"Yeah, he beat out Drew Brees."
13:31,220;13:34,660;"That was the road to shop here."
13:34,660;13:36,560;"I think so. Yeah."
13:36,560;13:38,060;"When he moved to the Saints."
13:38,060;13:39,860;"Yeah. Holy shit."
13:39,860;13:46,180;"Yeah. So he had one good year of Miami that year and then nothing after that."
13:46,180;13:55,100;"But he was the starting quarterback on both teams that won the AFCs, the only two teams."
13:55,100;13:56,620;"Yeah."
13:56,620;14:00,820;"Yeah, I'll wait dolphins in the this year. Yeah, so"
14:00,820;14:11,220;"the second best, right? Yep. I think he has to. For sure. Because, yeah, he is him and Brett Farr are both"
14:11,220;14:16,220;"the reason the Patriots missed the playoffs the two times that they missed them."
14:16,220;14:22,460;"Wow. Because in '08, we've talked about that where"
14:23,980;14:25,980;"Because wasn't um"
14:25,980;14:29,540;"Pennington was"
14:29,540;14:34,800;"Released or traded to Miami to make room for Brett Favre, right Greg? Yeah. Yeah, it sounds right"
14:34,800;14:38,220;"I think I think we talked about that and so then at the end of the season"
14:38,220;14:43,820;"Pennington beats Brett Favre, which keeps the Patriots out of the playoffs"
14:43,820;14:47,860;"Yes, I don't think Miami needed the win to get in the"
14:47,860;14:50,860;"Plan and they were in anyway, but that kept the Patriots out"
14:52,020;14:54,540;"How far they get that year I can't remember in"
14:54,540;14:57,540;"2008 yeah, no wait"
14:57,540;15:00,060;"They lost the wildcard"
15:00,060;15:02,900;"At least seven to nine to the Ravens cool"
15:02,900;15:07,460;"What are the Patriots were coming on strong and like heaven lesson to show it up?"
15:07,460;15:12,860;"Yeah, and then no 2001 it's a little bit more convoluted"
15:12,860;15:15,820;"but pennington I"
15:15,820;15:18,660;"Think they were already in the playoffs"
15:19,420;15:27,360;"Because the Patriots beat the dolphins which means the Jets were already in the playoffs and they were playing Brett Favre's Packers"
15:27,360;15:30,740;"Brett Favre was in the running for MVP"
15:30,740;15:34,520;"and I think the game mattered to"
15:34,520;15:43,980;"Matter to the Packers for seating reasons I believe yep because we talked about this when the Patriots played the Packers and"
15:48,100;15:50,740;"Basically, Packers got their doors blown off."
15:50,740;15:56,660;"Breath and people say that's why Brett Favre didn't win the MVP that year because he lost so badly in the last week of the season."
15:56,660;16:00,340;"And that loss kept the page side of playoffs again."
16:00,340;16:03,420;"So those two guys playing against each other."
16:03,420;16:07,420;"Jet panning is in beating Brett Favre twice."
16:07,420;16:09,860;"They're all really sad, which is weird."
16:09,860;16:13,300;"And that's probably why I don't really hate Chad Pennington, but I hate Brett Favre."
16:13,300;16:15,620;"I wonder if Brett Favre would won both those games."
16:15,620;16:17,660;"Maybe I like Brett Favre and hate Chad Pennington."
16:17,660;16:19,760;"Who would you?"
16:19,760;16:22,300;"I don't think you would."
16:22,300;16:23,100;"I don't know."
16:23,100;16:25,960;"I hate Mark Sanchez a whole lot more than Chad Pennington."
16:25,960;16:27,860;"But why don't you hate Chad Penning?"
16:27,860;16:30,620;"Because he's the reason he's the one that kept you out of the playoffs."
16:30,620;16:34,340;"Well, to be fair, I didn't know that until rewatching this game."
16:34,340;16:36,900;"You know, sometimes hate isn't logical."
16:36,900;16:39,780;"You know, if you feel you feel."
16:39,780;16:44,740;"And it hates a lot easier when you don't know."
16:45,180;16:52,020;"Well, maybe they didn't know that not only were they playing for the Patriots to get in the players are not they're playing for who I get to hate the most for the rest of my being."
16:52,020;16:55,280;"Yeah, they know that Brett far may have tried harder."
16:55,280;16:55,860;"Yeah."
16:55,860;16:57,620;"But I doubt it."
16:57,620;17:00,780;"You're about to make a little kid hate you, Brett."
17:00,780;17:01,620;"Come on."
17:01,620;17:12,380;"Also, Pennington's parents are both British and his real name is James Chadwick Pennington, the most British name ever."
17:14,380;17:15,100;"Wait, was he born?"
17:15,100;17:15,820;"Yes."
17:15,820;17:17,940;"James Chadwick Pennington."
17:17,940;17:19,220;"Was he born here, Greg?"
17:19,220;17:21,340;"Uh, yes."
17:21,340;17:23,380;"Yeah, he was born in Knoxville."
17:23,380;17:26,500;"So the same thing as our parents, except move to"
17:26,500;17:27,500;"Knox."
17:27,500;17:28,660;"He had a ham, sure."
17:28,660;17:30,060;"He had a seven draw."
17:30,060;17:31,780;"Chadwick."
17:31,780;17:33,940;"Is that what most most chads are?"
17:33,940;17:35,020;"Are they Chadwick's?"
17:35,020;17:36,420;"Oh, sorry."
17:36,420;17:36,940;"Question."
17:36,940;17:40,740;"Um, is not sure for Chad, right?"
17:40,740;17:42,540;"No."
17:43,780;17:45,480;"I don't think so."
17:45,480;17:46,620;"I thought I'm just."
17:46,620;17:51,380;"Unless they're just Chad because I have friends who are like just Jill and"
17:51,380;17:53,740;"not short for anything or just Kate."
17:53,740;17:57,700;"Well, what is Chad short for?"
17:57,700;17:59,500;"Yeah, my brother is just Matt."
17:59,500;18:00,420;"He's not a Matthew."
18:00,420;18:02,100;"Oh, wow."
18:02,100;18:03,700;"Oh, I guess."
18:03,700;18:05,060;"Do you call him Matthew?"
18:05,060;18:07,220;"No, because that's what I do."
18:07,220;18:09,940;"My friends, I just call them their names, even though it's not just"
18:09,940;18:13,120;"just watched a seven minute Randy Moss college highlight"
18:13,120;18:14,460;"(laughing)"
18:14,460;18:18,340;"and it's auto playing a in 12 minute one."
18:18,340;18:20,740;"I thought we were talking about that, that shit was awesome."
18:20,740;18:21,580;"- Yeah, right?"
18:21,580;18:22,700;"- That doesn't sound bad."
18:22,700;18:25,100;"- There's a bomb hurdle one too, it was ridiculous."
18:25,100;18:28,940;"- Oh, don't worry, there'll be like a 15 minute one after that."
18:28,940;18:30,020;"There's plenty."
18:30,020;18:33,940;"- No, it's the Vikings 12 minutes."
18:33,940;18:37,340;"- Oh yeah, the Vikings won't be even more ridiculous."
18:37,340;18:38,940;"- Least he never did that."
18:38,940;18:44,620;"Yeah, thank God. Who else played for these? Well, this is a her medwards team."
18:44,620;18:48,700;"Hmm. Nobody wants to do the her medwards. Okay."
18:48,700;18:55,580;"You do it, Andy. Yeah. I mean, what do you play to do?"
18:55,580;18:58,740;"You play to win the game. Oh, okay."
18:58,740;19:05,580;"And while he would win this game, this was the last time he would be the"
19:05,580;19:08,140;"Patriots as a head coach in the NFL."
19:08,140;19:12,220;"Yeah, after this, he is two and two."
19:12,220;19:16,380;"He would finish his record against the page to be two and nine."
19:16,380;19:17,980;"When was the final score of this game?"
19:17,980;19:19,980;"30 or 17."
19:19,980;19:21,100;"Yeah."
19:21,100;19:22,820;"And it wasn't even that close."
19:22,820;19:23,580;"It was close."
19:23,580;19:24,620;"It shouldn't have been."
19:24,620;19:25,740;"And it wasn't."
19:25,740;19:28,260;"According to the box score that I looked at."
19:28,260;19:30,780;"Oh, yeah."
19:30,780;19:33,180;"We forgot to give this a watchability score."
19:33,380;19:39,860;"Yeah, yes. So Lisa, what we do is, because we have to watch all these, the listeners don't,"
19:39,860;19:43,140;"but we like to give a watchability score out of six on parties."
19:43,140;19:49,060;"How good the game is to watch, and if it's worth rewatching. And we always start with Greg."
19:49,060;19:53,700;"Because he has yet to watch at one of these games."
19:53,700;19:56,740;"That's not true. I watch the ones that are worth watching."
19:56,740;20:02,340;"Week 16 and the Jets is not worth watching."
20:02,340;20:09,260;"Well, according to the stats, this one doesn't look like there's many."
20:09,260;20:14,940;"I mean, the score was closer than it and then the stats seemed to lead it to be."
20:14,940;20:19,700;"I mean, they got out yardaged 393 to 216."
20:19,700;20:20,700;"Yeah."
20:20,700;20:22,940;"So they didn't see."
20:22,940;20:27,540;"I mean, it was the kickoff return by fall because that was probably pretty sweet."
20:27,540;20:28,540;"I'm assuming."
20:28,540;20:29,540;"It was."
20:29,540;20:30,540;"It was good."
20:30,540;20:31,540;"That's okay."
20:31,540;20:32,540;"Not too much."
20:32,540;20:39,660;"I mean, it was like a minute 15 and they had the ball on the Jets 10 yard down to touchdown."
20:39,660;20:42,900;"So it wasn't like completely out of hand the whole game."
20:42,900;20:44,700;"Yeah, scored there."
20:44,700;20:47,860;"Like there was still a chance that they could go on."
20:47,860;20:50,660;"Kick it and recover something like that."
20:50,660;20:55,700;"So it wasn't like complete blow out like they scored 30 points in the first half and"
20:55,700;20:56,700;"then right."
20:56,700;20:58,700;"Right. But it's close to zero."
20:58,700;21:04,220;"Zero. I was wondering about you, Steve, because I know you're hatred for the jets."
21:04,220;21:07,580;"Yeah. I think this is nobody needs to watch this game."
21:07,580;21:11,340;"Yeah. Highlights and that's about as that's the maximum."
21:11,340;21:19,100;"All three. Have you guys talked about like the composition of the offensive line this season?"
21:19,100;21:25,500;"Because like Tom had a terrible game and part of it was he was under pressure so much this game."
21:26,540;21:28,340;"And he was."
21:28,340;21:29,140;"We talked about that."
21:29,140;21:30,740;"Matt Light sucks."
21:30,740;21:34,620;"Yeah, we've touched on Matt Light not being as good as"
21:34,620;21:36,500;"at least I remember."
21:36,500;21:37,700;"I remember him being great."
21:37,700;21:40,380;"But like what you're going to leave with me later."
21:40,380;21:41,020;"He was not good."
21:41,020;21:42,420;"Yeah."
21:42,420;21:47,100;"Yeah, I want to say, oh, one was his rookie year."
21:47,100;21:49,420;"And he didn't even know that was his year."
21:49,420;21:49,860;"I feel."
21:49,860;21:51,020;"Oh, there you go."
21:51,020;21:52,820;"That check."
21:52,820;21:53,260;"Yeah."
21:53,260;21:54,580;"Come on, Stat Check."
21:54,580;21:58,860;"And I loved it. Like the first, the first good throw I saw Tom"
21:58,860;22:01,860;"make was four minutes into the second quarter and then he"
22:01,860;22:04,420;"immediately got sacked. And I'm like, Oh, it's going to be this"
22:04,420;22:05,300;"kind of game. Okay."
22:05,300;22:10,780;"Yeah, even for his life, you ran for that 15 yard longest run of"
22:10,780;22:12,660;"his career for imagine that."
22:12,660;22:14,860;"And Tom Brady runs for 15."
22:14,860;22:16,940;"After dodging all three"
22:16,940;22:18,260;"rushes with the Jets sent."
22:18,260;22:23,580;"Yeah. So did he play as poorly as his as his stats luck? Or was"
22:23,580;22:29,500;"it in the first half he did. Yeah. Yeah. And he played so badly that the commentator"
22:29,500;22:34,780;"started again talking about him wearing his gloves. Because this was the, uh, this was"
22:34,780;22:40,380;"the ESPN crew. And the last time we saw them, the Patriots had played the Raiders in the"
22:40,380;22:47,340;"snowball rematch. Yeah. And they made a huge deal about Brady wearing his glove. And, uh,"
22:47,340;22:51,980;"and he lost that game. So as soon as he started like, you know, one hopping balls into receivers"
22:51,980;22:56,700;"like, oh, he's got the glove on again. Maybe he's got too much grip on the football."
22:56,700;23:01,580;"I didn't watch this that closely. Thank God. I just kind of had it on."
23:01,580;23:07,100;"Yeah, drop by my boy, David Givens. Oh, that would have changed."
23:07,100;23:11,020;"Already stat line. Yeah."
23:11,020;23:20,860;"So, but I think was in the first after the first quarter, I wrote it. Brady had five yards"
23:20,860;23:22,860;"passing and"
23:22,860;23:25,580;"Pettington had a hundred and seventy three in two touchdowns"
23:25,580;23:31,460;"Yeah, Pennington completed his first eleven passes and the Jets out gained them"
23:31,460;23:35,220;"261 to 78 at halftime, but it was still 17 10"
23:35,220;23:38,420;"just because"
23:38,420;23:41,780;"Kevin Falk took the kickoff back for touchdown"
23:41,780;23:44,860;"And he was also the only one"
23:44,860;23:49,820;"Like this is just a bag game all right. We had I hate to bring this up. Oh"
23:49,820;23:52,900;"Oh, I was hoping you'd bring this up"
23:52,900;23:55,780;"So"
23:55,780;23:59,580;"There was a point in this game third quarter like first drive of the half"
23:59,580;24:02,820;"the second half"
24:02,820;24:06,520;"Patriots basically drive down convert a fourth and one like in midfield"
24:06,520;24:12,620;"Brady has his 15 yard third down run and then he throws a touchdown a 4a to tie the game up at 17"
24:12,620;24:15,300;"Jets go three and out"
24:16,220;24:25,540;"For you. Yeah, didn't he like doing thing and getting trouble. Oh, yeah, but he's still employed. It was the Don ye thing. Brady's"
24:25,540;24:34,060;"He was mocking with the Asian accent. Yeah, I think there might have been some other stuff in there, too. Yeah, but he's still"
24:34,060;24:39,800;"Doing his shitty thing on one of the sports talk radios. Yeah, I probably"
24:39,800;24:44,860;"Say I was sad to see 48 doing well"
24:44,860;24:48,020;"just because we know how far he's fallen now."
24:48,020;24:52,860;"Yeah, at least you got that to look forward to Boston Sports Talk radio when you move there."
24:52,860;24:55,460;"It's you're in for a treat. I'll tell you that."
24:55,460;25:03,740;"Yeah. I've never heard anybody hate the New England sports teams as much as Boston Sports Talk radio."
25:03,740;25:05,700;"They were some Greg."
25:05,700;25:09,940;"Well, Greg, the Bucks fan."
25:09,940;25:13,380;"And while just to give Lisa some context here,"
25:13,380;25:16,740;"we have a constant battle between these two homers."
25:16,740;25:20,860;"That just so they have these blinders on."
25:20,860;25:24,420;"They're like, oh, the Patriots can never do anything wrong."
25:24,420;25:26,660;"And anything, anybody else does good sucks"
25:26,660;25:29,060;"because it's not the Patriots, but not me."
25:29,060;25:32,180;"I'm a fan of football first, and then I'm a Patriots fan."
25:32,180;25:35,260;"- You're a Belichick Hater, that's what you are."
25:35,260;25:36,100;"- You are."
25:36,100;25:37,180;"Give me no credit."
25:37,180;25:38,020;"- Yeah."
25:38,020;25:39,020;"All right."
25:39,020;25:40,220;"Let's do one."
25:40,220;25:44,460;"And do you want to give a hot take about the sweatshirt he was wearing?"
25:44,460;25:46,940;"I'm sure you got some things to say about that."
25:46,940;25:50,420;"Well, I think is did his mom pass away?"
25:50,420;25:51,420;"Yeah."
25:51,420;25:52,420;"Yeah."
25:52,420;25:55,420;"I tried not to make any jokes about that with."
25:55,420;25:56,420;"Yeah."
25:56,420;25:59,060;"You know, he was old."
25:59,060;26:02,060;"Yeah, he's 90 something right?"
26:02,060;26:03,060;"98."
26:03,060;26:04,060;"Yeah."
26:04,060;26:05,060;"Yeah."
26:05,060;26:07,900;"I'd love to meet his mom just to see what her personality is like."
26:07,900;26:15,260;"Oh, man. Yeah, I bet she was a firecracker. Yeah. I mean, just look at our mom. What happened to us?"
26:15,260;26:26,140;"I don't know. That's so ominous. Sorry, mom. Maybe we'll have a surprise guest next week."
26:26,140;26:28,620;"We're going to tease that. You see that, boys? That's called teasing."
26:28,620;26:33,180;"You're supposed to see my cast as I'm so good."
26:35,980;26:39,380;"But yeah, so back to the thing that none of us actually want to talk about"
26:39,380;26:44,520;"So the pages are tied it up. They get the Jets to go three and out momentum has shifted"
26:44,520;26:48,780;"The Jets punt. I don't even know if I can say it say"
26:48,780;26:51,540;"It hurt Troy Brown"
26:51,540;26:58,800;"Fumbles the punt. Oh, I missed that play the test recover at like the Patriots 20"
26:58,800;27:03,180;"Minish to drive all the way to the five-yard line before these out of four field goal"
27:03,940;27:05,940;"But then like that was the momentum"
27:05,940;27:13,300;"Brady gets like the next drive they go with patrons go three and out they punt and like that's it. Oh she wrote"
27:13,300;27:15,100;"Yeah"
27:15,100;27:17,100;"What your thoughts Andy?"
27:17,100;27:20,700;"This is when I say they think the Patriots can do no wrong"
27:20,700;27:26,380;"Just Troy Brown is even like further down that road of like"
27:26,380;27:33,860;"Troy Brown don't get me wrong, but you two are like"
27:33,860;27:37,020;"like weird fanboys about it."
27:37,020;27:40,540;"- All right, give me your unbiased fucking opinion then."
27:40,540;27:41,820;"- A little fence sitter."
27:41,820;27:45,060;"- You're the coolest."
27:45,060;27:47,380;"- Want to hear a quote from the man himself?"
27:47,380;27:48,380;"- I do."
27:48,380;27:50,460;"- He said, ""It just kills you."
27:50,460;27:52,580;"It takes a lot of momentum from your team."
27:52,580;27:55,380;"It's one of the worst plays I've ever had in my career."
27:55,380;27:58,660;"It was just a bad decision not to call for a fair catch."""
27:58,660;28:02,460;"- So how is this any anti-troy Brown?"
28:02,460;28:03,940;"- It's not, I just--"
28:03,940;28:07,500;"- Everyone makes mistake and then he owns up to it."
28:07,500;28:09,980;"- That's possible way, plus the Troy Brown."
28:09,980;28:11,540;"- What humility."
28:11,540;28:13,640;"- And they showed him on the sideline,"
28:13,640;28:15,820;"like when the Jets were still driving the ball,"
28:15,820;28:17,980;"and he looked like he was gonna cry."
28:17,980;28:19,300;"Like he was--"
28:19,300;28:23,300;"- I watched, well I bet it's gotta be weird for him"
28:23,300;28:25,740;"because he's always been the guy that like"
28:25,740;28:27,980;"does the little things right, you know?"
28:27,980;28:28,820;"- Yeah."
28:28,820;28:31,500;"- So it's gotta be weird for him to like make a mental mistake"
28:31,500;28:36,500;"like that. And like that. I mean, in a huge part in a game that's deciding your season,"
28:36,500;28:40,220;"whether you go to play offs or not, I bet that I bet that weighed on him a lot. I bet"
28:40,220;28:46,260;"it did. Yeah. But we still love them. Right, Steve? Of course. I love it. You were now"
28:46,260;28:51,060;"everyone. Exactly. Because because you knew it was going to go up to it. You knew it was"
28:51,060;28:59,540;"going to go play for the Buccaneers. No one's perfect. You still perfect in my eyes. So"
28:59,540;29:02,980;"I got super bored when I was watching this game,"
29:02,980;29:05,740;"'cause I just didn't really watch it, honestly."
29:05,740;29:07,060;"And I swear, I watched most of it"
29:07,060;29:08,260;"except those like two minutes."
29:08,260;29:10,500;"I took something outside to my yard,"
29:10,500;29:11,420;"like some trash and stuff,"
29:11,420;29:13,260;"so I just left it playing in my room"
29:13,260;29:14,460;"and came back and saw they had the ball"
29:14,460;29:17,500;"and I wasn't gonna rewind it to find out."
29:17,500;29:18,340;"- Good job."
29:18,340;29:20,660;"- I looked up on your website,"
29:20,660;29:21,940;"- That sounds suspicious."
29:21,940;29:24,660;"- All of like the biggest spreads,"
29:24,660;29:26,820;"highest over under, lowest over under."
29:26,820;29:28,340;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
29:28,340;29:31,560;"I thought that's kind of cool to kind of get in there and be like, I remember that game."
29:31,560;29:32,600;"I don't remember that game at all."
29:32,600;29:35,540;"Yeah, I didn't remember this game at all."
29:35,540;29:41,300;"I think the whole, I think I just kind of blacked out the whole 2002 season as if it didn't happen"
29:41,300;29:43,620;"because it's that one down year."
29:43,620;29:48,500;"They don't make the playoffs in between three Super Bowl winning seasons."
29:48,500;29:49,080;"Yeah."
29:49,080;29:50,420;"I just don't remember it."
29:50,420;29:50,980;"It's fine."
29:50,980;29:55,220;"I sort of feel that way about the Matt Castle year too."
29:55,220;29:56,540;"That's a good point."
29:56,540;29:56,900;"I don't."
29:58,300;30:01,980;"Like I can't think of specific things that happen that year."
30:01,980;30:07,220;"I remember being impressed with how well it went for what it was."
30:07,220;30:13,180;"But I remember not having the same investment in it because the"
30:13,180;30:14,900;"expectation was lower, I guess."
30:14,900;30:15,700;"Yeah."
30:15,700;30:19,660;"Well, because the expectation was so high at the beginning of the year,"
30:19,660;30:23,100;"yeah, just shattered 10 minutes in to the season."
30:23,100;30:23,340;"Yeah."
30:23,340;30:24,180;"Yeah."
30:24,180;30:25,660;"I think we're also grieving that year."
30:25,660;30:26,380;"Yeah."
30:26,380;30:32,800;"I mean, we went to the game against the Cardinals, all of us, the Brown family in the snow."
30:32,800;30:34,240;"That's my first game."
30:34,240;30:37,600;"And that was the Cardinals team that actually went to the Super Bowl that year."
30:37,600;30:39,780;"And the Patriots like walked them."
30:39,780;30:42,140;"It was like 40 to seven or something ridiculous."
30:42,140;30:49,760;"So I was living in Phoenix during that Super Bowl year."
30:49,760;30:55,600;"And I worked, um, I used to be a librarian and I was working at the Phoenix"
30:55,600;31:04,160;"public library and this kid came in the day after that Super Bowl head to toe. Oh no, it wasn't"
31:04,160;31:13,760;"'08, it was '07, oh my god. And he had to print some homework, but he was just the saddest kid I've"
31:13,760;31:15,120;"ever seen in my life."
31:15,120;31:21,840;"That's awesome. I know that I know that kid. You are that kid."
31:23,600;31:30,960;"Yeah, I when the second giant Super Bowl, I was in college at the time."
31:30,960;31:35,800;"And I had a Monday class at like 8 a.m."
31:35,800;31:39,640;"And I couldn't skip those classes."
31:39,640;31:44,800;"And I like, I used to like write down the date on my notes every time."
31:44,800;31:49,000;"And I was like studying like a month later, I was going through and I get to one"
31:49,000;31:50,520;"section. It's like gibberish."
31:51,880;31:52,720;"I like looked at the day."
31:52,720;31:53,860;"It was the Monday after the seat ball."
31:53,860;31:54,680;"I was like, oh, okay."
31:54,680;31:56,760;"That makes sense."
31:56,760;31:58,640;"Oh, man."
31:58,640;31:59,720;"Not your best work."
31:59,720;32:02,720;"Yikes."
32:02,720;32:06,240;"Well, let's talk about Reddit."
32:06,240;32:08,280;"Okay."
32:08,280;32:11,480;"I mean, I don't think I have any else from this game."
32:11,480;32:12,920;"Yeah."
32:12,920;32:17,800;"You being a librarian, librarian is like the least surprising update ever."
32:17,800;32:19,480;"Right."
32:20,880;32:26,680;"So like just explain what your role is in Reddit and the Patriots Reddit for those that like don't know."
32:26,680;32:32,760;"Like I just post highlights. I don't really ever even comment."
32:32,760;32:38,240;"You know, I don't I don't check that subreddit on daily basis, but during the game."
32:38,240;32:39,880;"I'll do."
32:39,880;32:46,000;"I've kind of pared it down to just do like scoring plays or Zach or anything like that."
32:46,000;32:49,920;"Because after what is this five years, maybe."
32:50,800;32:54,280;"It's my husband's like, would you just sit down and watch a football game with me?"
32:54,280;32:57,520;"So that's why I scaled it back a little bit."
32:57,520;33:01,760;"Um, and then I'll do an upload after the game that has them all, like"
33:01,760;33:05,720;"bing, bing, bing, bing, in a row and people can request whatever I missed."
33:05,720;33:13,000;"And I put it up and, you know, several years ago, the, I would say the"
33:13,000;33:15,880;"Patriots subreddit was less saturated with highlights."
33:15,880;33:16,840;"Like it's come a long way."
33:16,840;33:20,120;"And there's other people doing, like, you know, I don't."
33:20,560;33:22,040;"Andy, when did you join Reddit?"
33:22,040;33:24,700;"I couldn't tell you."
33:24,700;33:26,240;"I'm broke."
33:26,240;33:32,880;"But but yeah, people used to ask me for really old gifts."
33:32,880;33:36,160;"Like, Oh, do you have anything from the intentional safety game or, you"
33:36,160;33:38,120;"know, I went to this game."
33:38,120;33:39,480;"Do you have any highlights from it?"
33:39,480;33:43,960;"And there are so there was at that time."
33:43,960;33:48,280;"So few old highlights that I have a lot of games recorded."
33:48,280;33:49,280;"And so I said, sure."
33:49,280;33:49,880;"I'll share."
33:49,880;33:53,520;"And that's really how it came about."
33:53,520;33:55,160;"So where did you have them recorded?"
33:55,160;33:58,400;"Did you just have them like on a DVR or something?"
33:58,400;34:02,960;"Some of them, yeah, some of them prove like TV capture software and then, you know, some"
34:02,960;34:07,600;"of them, I don't want to like the FBI to come knock on my door, like tape takers and things"
34:07,600;34:08,600;"like that."
34:08,600;34:11,440;"Yeah, just trading them with other people, yeah."
34:11,440;34:12,440;"Yeah, exactly."
34:12,440;34:19,600;"You know, you don't, it really chaps my hide the way that this content is protected."
34:19,600;34:21,600;"Everybody should be able to watch it."
34:21,600;34:27,760;"And it's one thing, you know, not to besmirch the crafts, I guess, but it's one thing that"
34:27,760;34:32,040;"they're really like, persnickety about."
34:32,040;34:37,200;"And so I don't think that it will ever change, but I honestly really love watching the old"
34:37,200;34:39,680;"games just as they're presented."
34:39,680;34:44,360;"And I think even the old games, when they will re-ear them on NFL Network, you're not"
34:44,360;34:45,560;"getting that telecast."
34:45,560;34:47,880;"You're getting like a condensed version."
34:47,880;34:56,200;"I love seeing like the long fan shots of how bad people looked and you know stuff like that"
34:56,200;35:03,960;"That's true though. It is a different experience like watching"
35:03,960;35:10,280;"Like the long-form like TV version of a game after the fact like with the Super Bowls"
35:10,280;35:14,840;"I remember like trying to try to some of the earlier ones trying to find like the full"
35:15,320;35:20,380;"Games because all you could find was just like the highlights and like that doesn't really put you in that"
35:20,380;35:24,000;"Just yeah the feelings that you had while you're watching plays, you know"
35:24,000;35:27,520;"Like the building of tension and that kind of stuff, you know, yeah"
35:27,520;35:34,760;"Miss the commercials in it and sort of don't if like this whole game at commercials in it"
35:34,760;35:36,760;"I would be like fuck that"
35:36,760;35:37,960;"but"
35:37,960;35:43,800;"Sometimes you catch like a little bit of a commercial on these someone like just didn't stop the tape in time or started too early and"
35:44,040;35:47,040;"Yeah, some of the old commercials are hilarious."
35:47,040;35:48,040;"Yeah."
35:48,040;35:53,280;"Yeah, and I was thinking, you know, as you guys are going through, you know, this is one year"
35:53,280;36:00,520;"post 9/11, and that was such a moment in time, especially that first game, the Malus"
36:00,520;36:03,200;"game."
36:03,200;36:07,480;"I was thinking, we're about what, 19 years out from that?"
36:07,480;36:13,280;"I wonder what people watching these games, 19 years from now, are going to think seeing"
36:13,280;36:18,280;"Bill wear his mask so stupidly like he did on Sunday night."
36:18,280;36:22,720;"Like these guys with their face shields, like, are we going to think, wow,"
36:22,720;36:25,440;"remember COVID or are we all still going to be wearing masks?"
36:25,440;36:28,760;"It's true. Yeah. Yeah."
36:28,760;36:31,040;"They're going to look at a game some last year and be like, why aren't they wearing"
36:31,040;36:32,360;"masks? This is weird."
36:32,360;36:37,720;"But it's true. Yeah. Like 20 years from now when we're still doing this"
36:37,720;36:39,680;"podcast. Exactly."
36:39,680;36:41,560;"Because the dynasty just doesn't end."
36:42,320;36:48,120;"Yeah, check still wearing his mask wrong. Yeah, probably on purpose, I'm sure."
36:48,120;36:52,320;"Cam Newton just won his tent Super Bowl."
36:52,320;36:53,880;"I like it."
36:53,880;36:56,920;"As a pocket passer, though, he's all done running. Yeah."
36:56,920;37:03,840;"So all these games that we've been watching are those from you"
37:03,840;37:08,080;"from that right inside at least in some"
37:09,760;37:11,760;"I mean, I know you've done a little..."
37:11,760;37:12,760;"You've got..."
37:12,760;37:13,760;"Yeah."
37:13,760;37:14,760;"Um..."
37:14,760;37:15,760;"Yeah."
37:15,760;37:16,760;"So..."
37:16,760;37:20,760;"I was going to say, I have every Brady game."
37:20,760;37:24,760;"I think like between you and I, we've now gotten the whole shebang."
37:24,760;37:25,760;"We have, yeah."
37:25,760;37:30,760;"Yeah, we've been sharing what each other didn't have."
37:30,760;37:33,760;"And I think at this point, I think we do have them all."
37:33,760;37:34,760;"Yeah."
37:34,760;37:37,760;"When you get back into blood, so it just becomes impossible."
37:37,760;37:38,760;"Yeah."
37:38,760;37:40,960;"Yeah. Yeah. That's true."
37:40,960;37:43,160;"So do you feel like the pressure?"
37:43,160;37:44,760;"Because I know like, you know,"
37:44,760;37:49,560;"you have a certain like name notoriety and the Reddit now and people like expect"
37:49,560;37:52,360;"like the clips and the post game and stuff."
37:52,360;37:55,160;"Do you feel like the pressure of, you know,"
37:55,160;37:58,760;"I got to like get these things up there because people are like waiting for it."
37:58,760;38:02,160;"Or do you just not give a shit about strangers on the internet?"
38:02,160;38:04,160;"I did a couple of years ago."
38:04,160;38:07,760;"Yeah. And I would like sit here through the whole telecast"
38:07,760;38:10,520;"and then sit and see what people wanted."
38:10,520;38:12,760;"And it was too much, especially when it's like"
38:12,760;38:14,400;"a Sunday night game."
38:14,400;38:18,840;"Like I don't stay up late, I can't."
38:18,840;38:21,080;"That's gonna be really hard for me next year"
38:21,080;38:24,640;"'cause like right now I'm taking advantage of my time zone."
38:24,640;38:28,280;"But people ask me for the weirdest stuff,"
38:28,280;38:29,840;"they'll be like, hey, do you have that clip"
38:29,840;38:31,920;"of that guy picking his nose or,"
38:31,920;38:34,680;"hey, do you have like, can you get that"
38:34,680;38:36,080;"where Tom can't find his hat?"
38:36,080;38:39,920;"Like that's probably one of the most requested gifts I ever had."
38:39,920;38:42,160;"Um, so."
38:42,160;38:42,920;"You find it?"
38:42,920;38:44,000;"Yeah."
38:44,000;38:45,240;"Well, yeah, it was during the game."
38:45,240;38:46,640;"So, you know, just rewind."
38:46,640;38:52,160;"But yeah, people, people are funny, but I haven't noticed that."
38:52,160;38:57,040;"Yeah, the, the requests lately have been more and more obscure."
38:57,040;38:58,240;"Yeah."
38:58,240;38:59,920;"A little bit ridiculous."
38:59,920;39:00,880;"Yeah."
39:00,880;39:02,400;"But you know what?"
39:02,720;39:07,720;"I like football and I'm happy to share this weird hobby."
39:07,720;39:11,720;"So it's really, I'm a Celtics fan too."
39:11,720;39:16,000;"I don't know if you guys are like all four,"
39:16,000;39:18,400;"you're not into it."
39:18,400;39:22,040;"It always cracks me up that the Celtics highlights"
39:22,040;39:24,600;"capture is also named Tim,"
39:24,600;39:28,320;"but he's like a Polish guy, yeah."
39:28,320;39:29,200;"- Polish guy."
39:29,200;39:31,360;"- But didn't he learn from you?"
39:31,360;39:35,120;"No, we've actually never interacted, but he's really."
39:35,120;39:40,640;"Well, it is interesting that they are like protective about their highlights and stuff."
39:40,640;39:44,880;"Cause I mean, I think like from a fan point of view, it's almost like universally"
39:44,880;39:48,880;"accepted that like we want to see highlights and people always shit on like the"
39:48,880;39:51,920;"MLB because they're like super protective about it."
39:51,920;39:52,600;"That's the worst."
39:52,600;39:52,840;"Yeah."
39:52,840;39:57,240;"Like you can't even get like highlight packages on YouTube, you know, it's, and"
39:57,240;40:01,840;"It seems like all the customers feel the same way."
40:01,840;40:05,520;"So I don't know, I mean, there has to be"
40:05,520;40:07,440;"in their side of the argument is,"
40:07,440;40:10,440;"do you know what that is, what their argument would be?"
40:10,440;40:15,160;"- I want to go ahead."
40:15,160;40:17,360;"- They want the viewers on their website"
40:17,360;40:20,080;"to look at the highlights on their content platform"
40:20,080;40:23,120;"so they can serve them as a big money often."
40:23,120;40:26,640;"But what they fail to realize is like,"
40:26,640;40:28,440;"That's not a like sustainable solution."
40:28,440;40:30,000;"You can just go find it anywhere."
40:30,000;40:30,840;"- Yeah."
40:30,840;40:32,560;"- And like you're hurting the brand"
40:32,560;40:35,040;"by not being accessible for everybody"
40:35,040;40:36,800;"in the modern internet day, right?"
40:36,800;40:37,640;"- Yep."
40:37,640;40:38,480;"- Yep."
40:38,480;40:40,240;"- You're not gonna stop people from finding it"
40:40,240;40:45,200;"and since you're stopping more people from finding it,"
40:45,200;40:47,840;"thus decreasing what you'd make at a ballpark"
40:47,840;40:49,640;"or getting new fans, whatever it might be."
40:49,640;40:50,680;"- Yeah."
40:50,680;40:52,040;"- Yeah."
40:52,040;40:54,840;"- Yeah, and if the way that they're sharing it"
40:54,840;40:56,360;"doesn't have a social aspect to it,"
40:56,360;40:59,480;"And it's pointless because you look at a highlight"
40:59,480;41:01,360;"and you want to talk about it with somebody."
41:01,360;41:01,880;"So."
41:01,880;41:02,880;"Yeah, exactly."
41:02,880;41:04,880;"Yeah, especially just the short clips too."
41:04,880;41:08,680;"Like I understand the NFL posting there,"
41:08,680;41:10,400;"like full game highlights to YouTube"
41:10,400;41:12,640;"and making you go to YouTube to watch it."
41:12,640;41:13,140;"Yeah."
41:13,140;41:16,440;"I guess I still don't quite understand why that is."
41:16,440;41:20,960;"But that might be more to control where the video shows up."
41:24,120;41:29,120;"- Oh yeah, just for like 15, 20 second clips of one play,"
41:29,120;41:35,480;"it seems like allowing people to easily share that"
41:35,480;41:39,800;"would actually build more interest in the brand"
41:39,800;41:43,640;"and have more people come to find more of those"
41:43,640;41:45,520;"and actually like visit your website more"
41:45,520;41:46,560;"and then you can serve the meds"
41:46,560;41:49,440;"and do whatever you need to to make your money."
41:49,440;41:50,360;"- Sure, excited."
41:50,360;41:51,200;"- Yeah."
41:51,200;41:53,160;"- I can't have a highlight request."
41:53,160;41:54,000;"Okay."
41:54,000;42:02,520;"And this goes back to the commentators, which, Andy, I can't believe you haven't talked on."
42:02,520;42:08,280;"I have a, I have a lot of hate on them, but they were talking about this Miami Denver game"
42:08,280;42:11,440;"where they were just laying each other out and ended field goal, field goal, field goal."
42:11,440;42:17,400;"So I tried to Google it and I couldn't find it, but it sounded like it was like a super duper slug"
42:17,400;42:21,080;"fast where people just absolutely crushing each other."
42:21,080;42:22,200;"Oh."
42:22,200;42:31,200;"Huh. So 2001 week 16. Well, it's had to be 2002. Right. Oh, week 15."
42:31,200;42:40,700;"Because I had to rewind it because he said he said something so dumb. I listened to this twice because right before he says, I've seen more third and 20s made than I have seen third and ones."
42:40,700;42:43,200;"That's fucking stupid."
42:43,200;42:43,700;"Yeah."
42:43,700;42:51,700;"And the other commentator called him out. I mean, which commentary said this dumb shit, but he's like, oh, really, you've been around for a long time, which doesn't make any sense either because the longer you're going to be."
42:51,700;42:55,300;"the longer you're around, they're starting to say you're going to see wait if you watch"
42:55,300;43:04,580;"one third downplay maybe. It's so dumb. So they start talking about this slugfest between"
43:04,580;43:12,980;"Miami and Denver however many years ago. Oh, so it wasn't even this season? No, no, it's like"
43:12,980;43:17,940;"they're talking about old, they're reminiscing about some slugfest between the two teams."
43:19,140;43:24,420;"We've honestly, it feels like from like the 70s or 80s, probably worst with good highlight guests in there too."
43:24,420;43:31,380;"Yeah, that's probably my guess. And you probably won't find highlights from games from the 70s because do they even have TV back then?"
43:31,380;43:33,400;"Yeah."
43:33,400;43:35,540;"Last mom."
43:35,540;43:37,380;"I guess some other choice."
43:37,380;43:42,100;"Just go through our the old VHS ones. Remember those videos we used to have as kids."
43:42,100;43:43,300;"Oh,"
43:43,300;43:45,380;"- Oh, I like films with Steve Sable."
43:45,380;43:46,660;"- Oh, yeah."
43:46,660;43:48,060;"- Steve Sable's videos."
43:48,060;43:52,520;"- Dude, he's Morgan Freeman before Morgan Freeman."
43:52,520;43:53,600;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
43:53,600;43:55,520;"- And the music too was always great."
43:55,520;44:01,160;"Speaking of which, I forgot about the ESPN chime"
44:01,160;44:03,160;"that was in this whenever they'd show the thing"
44:03,160;44:05,920;"at the bottom, the Dunno-Nah."
44:05,920;44:07,580;"- The Mayonnaise chime."
44:07,580;44:11,380;"- I feel like I've told you this before."
44:11,380;44:15,380;"Every time I say the word mayonnaise in my head, I say it to that team."
44:15,380;44:16,380;"Mayonnaise."
44:16,380;44:17,380;"Mayonnaise."
44:17,380;44:19,380;"That's where I got it from."
44:19,380;44:20,380;"Yeah."
44:20,380;44:21,380;"Finetically."
44:21,380;44:22,380;"God damn it."
44:22,380;44:25,900;"Because they had a commercial they do with the straws too, right?"
44:25,900;44:27,380;"There's like two guys at the wedding."
44:27,380;44:28,380;"Oh yeah, I remember that."
44:28,380;44:31,380;"I was used to doing it every time I go to get fast food."
44:31,380;44:36,380;"You're like, ""Hey kid, ever since we did the Brett Favre game, I've been saying real,"
44:36,380;44:38,380;"comfortable, jeans."
44:38,380;44:43,520;"time I pick up jeans like the footage. I can't stop thinking it."
44:43,520;44:45,680;"This podcast is gonna ruin us."
44:45,680;44:48,600;"Ready to pretty fucked up, so"
44:48,600;44:53,520;"I do every time I hear his name though, and I'm a real"
44:53,520;44:55,840;"comfortable pine killers."
44:55,840;45:01,680;"It'll bread. I have some other choice comparisons from the"
45:01,680;45:07,800;"commentators. Okay. You talked for a little bit about how Brad"
45:07,800;45:10,880;"Johnson was better than Mike Vick and should have gone to the Pro Bowl over him."
45:10,880;45:14,720;"It's a high was not paying attention to family."
45:14,720;45:15,400;"I missed that."
45:15,400;45:23,160;"And then they were talking about saying Randy Moss and for some reason,"
45:23,160;45:24,320;"because he's not even in this game."
45:24,320;45:28,800;"This one I know they said like Santana Moss is better."
45:28,800;45:30,280;"Oh no."
45:30,280;45:33,400;"No, they said he was faster."
45:33,400;45:36,640;"Like, you know, it was like, which moss is faster than the guys?"
45:36,640;45:38,840;"Just like dead pans like Randy."
45:38,840;45:41,360;"I don't know which team is worse."
45:41,360;45:44,200;"They have their own moss and he's faster."
45:44,200;45:49,120;"It was because Chad Pennington had thrown to Randy Moss in college."
45:49,120;45:52,240;"And now he's throwing to Santana Moss and he's so fast."
45:52,240;45:54,640;"He's like, Oh, which guy is faster?"
45:54,640;45:57,200;"And the other guy just dead pans like Randy."
45:57,200;45:59,160;"Obviously. Yeah."
45:59,160;46:00,000;"Like what you mean?"
46:00,000;46:02,280;"That's not a player that's ever played in the league."
46:02,280;46:03,920;"Exactly what he said."
46:03,920;46:05,640;"Well, back to the victim."
46:05,640;46:11,080;"I think this is this is the year Vic like makes his name known right where he goes into"
46:11,080;46:19,800;"Lambo because we're talking about the packers by losing to the dolphins would have to play"
46:19,800;46:26,200;"Vic and the Falcons right and then Vic goes into Lambo and beats him."
46:26,200;46:29,560;"Is this not Brad Johnson's Super Bowl appearance though?"
46:29,560;46:30,560;"It is."
46:30,560;46:31,560;"Yes it is."
46:31,560;46:38,700;"Considered the worst quarterback to win a Super Bowl, right? Yeah, is he because they didn't win it because of him"
46:38,700;46:41,320;"They want it because of that spider witness"
46:41,320;46:48,020;"Yeah, yeah to win actually see that I mean Grossman made one he was really bad. Oh, yeah"
46:48,020;46:50,760;"He didn't win it though"
46:50,760;46:54,240;"Yeah, yeah, who else"
46:54,240;46:56,240;"I mean flacko would be on that list"
46:56,600;47:00,880;"But I mean he had really good playoffs that year"
47:00,880;47:04,320;"So he was kind of the reason they want the Ravens won that Super Bowl"
47:04,320;47:09,720;"Peyton man was pretty bad that last year, but yeah, that's what I was also paid manning. Yeah"
47:09,720;47:13,200;"But that individual game performance was so bad"
47:13,200;47:15,160;"Yeah"
47:15,160;47:17,160;"Which one"
47:17,160;47:21,480;"Hey man, I had a couple of stinkers in the Super Bowl"
47:23,600;47:25,600;"Speaking of stinkers Ken Walter"
47:25,600;47:32,520;"He is probably the worst punter I've seen on the Patriots"
47:32,520;47:35,560;"Did I can I can remember"
47:35,560;47:38,080;"Like I wrote down"
47:38,080;47:41,720;"The one good thing that he's done this season"
47:41,720;47:49,560;"Was tackling Santana Moss on a part return after out kicking his coverage by like 20 yards and setting up a huge return"
47:51,040;47:53,480;"Okay, you're blaming it for out kicking the coverage"
47:53,480;47:55,680;"Yeah"
47:55,680;47:58,880;"Your that's your just fucking job as a punter and when he wasn't"
47:58,880;48:03,880;"When he wasn't doing that he was he was kicking it too far again into the fucking end zone for touchbacks"
48:03,880;48:09,580;"Well, maybe the coverage should have sped up and got down there quicker. It landed five yards in the end zone"
48:09,580;48:13,560;"Not much you can do about that like it pounds five yards"
48:13,560;48:20,520;"I retract my previous statement. So that pun was a net of 20 yards. So it wasn't even like"
48:20,520;48:26,040;"like, uh, and so I had one that I thought was like, oh, it finally hit a good punt."
48:26,040;48:32,760;"It was a whopping 44 yard punt, which you followed up with a 27 yard punt like late"
48:32,760;48:33,160;"in the game."
48:33,160;48:39,480;"There's a, there's a really fascinating news article about Ken Walter and like"
48:39,480;48:43,680;"just how much the anxiety of being so bad got to him."
48:43,680;48:48,000;"I, I think it was written around 2001 or 2002."
48:48,000;48:49,360;"Oh, I have to dig it up."
48:49,640;48:51,560;"That sounds like a must read right."
48:51,560;48:52,080;"Yeah."
48:52,080;48:53,320;"It was good."
48:53,320;48:54,760;"Oh my god."
48:54,760;48:55,420;"All right."
48:55,420;48:55,520;"Yeah."
48:55,520;48:57,240;"We'll have to dig right after."
48:57,240;49:01,960;"Because you think of punting as like the least stressful position in football, really, you"
49:01,960;49:02,960;"know?"
49:02,960;49:03,960;"Yeah."
49:03,960;49:04,460;"Yeah."
49:04,460;49:07,240;"If you fuck it up, it's not like you lost the game."
49:07,240;49:09,440;"Like if you fuck up as a kicker, you could lose the game, you know?"
49:09,440;49:09,940;"Yeah."
49:09,940;49:10,440;"Yeah."
49:10,440;49:10,440;"Yeah."
49:10,440;49:10,940;"Yeah."
49:10,940;49:12,440;"High leopardy."
49:12,440;49:15,960;"And you're already there performing because they fucked up."
49:15,960;49:16,480;"So I--"
49:16,480;49:17,000;"Exactly."
49:17,000;49:17,500;"Yeah."
49:17,500;49:18,520;"You're already given the ballway."
49:18,520;49:20,000;"So it's like whatever."
49:20,000;49:24,160;"And then people feel, I feel like you only remember bad punts"
49:24,160;49:26,400;"like the next day when someone else brings it up"
49:26,400;49:28,720;"and you're like, oh yeah, he was terrible."
49:28,720;49:30,240;"You know, you don't ever like think of it on you."
49:30,240;49:31,600;"Like he lost the game for us."
49:31,600;49:33,120;"It was always just."
49:33,120;49:34,600;"- Yeah, it's never lost on a pun."
49:34,600;49:35,440;"Yeah. - Right."
49:35,440;49:37,840;"- You don't say Ryan Allen probably won that Super Bowl"
49:37,840;49:38,680;"with us."
49:38,680;49:39,820;"He punted awesome in that Ram Super Bowl."
49:39,820;49:40,680;"- That's true."
49:40,680;49:43,360;"Yeah, him and Matt Slater."
49:43,360;49:45,160;"I think he could have given them co-nppies."
49:45,160;49:46,760;"- That would have been awesome."
49:46,760;49:47,600;"Just the fact that it's so--"
49:47,600;49:52,000;"So Bella Checchi and if the punter went super on the fee,"
49:52,000;49:53,360;"I would have been so happy."
49:53,360;49:54,520;"I remember like half time."
49:54,520;49:58,120;"I was like, I, I really was hoping for a three nothing win."
49:58,120;50:02,400;"You know, just have that like all signature to the game."
50:02,400;50:05,200;"Yeah, it was so good."
50:05,200;50:11,320;"Cause that that Rams offense, I think was top 10 all time."
50:11,320;50:12,680;"Yeah, I think it was like,"
50:12,680;50:16,320;"leaving higher because the Chiefs was as well."
50:16,360;50:18,280;"the two softens, I think was fourth all time."
50:18,280;50:20,800;"And I think I want to say I thought they like both."
50:20,800;50:24,560;"I think there was seventh all time there, but they were both like"
50:24,560;50:30,680;"all the time offenses and the Patriots held that Rams team to three points,"
50:30,680;50:34,080;"which is outrageous. But yeah. And also the fact that"
50:34,080;50:41,360;"Matthew Seder would occasionally actually catch Ryan Allen's punts,"
50:41,360;50:45,000;"like before they hit the ground, like you would get down there fast enough"
50:45,000;50:48,300;"and to be able to turn around and field the punt as if he was the punter."
50:48,300;50:52,520;"Is he still playing or did we like cut him and he's gone?"
50:52,520;50:56,000;"Are you still playing? Yeah. Who?"
50:56,000;51:01,000;"Matthew Slater Slater. No. Alan. Oh."
51:01,000;51:04,020;"Oh, I see."
51:04,020;51:06,020;"He's talking."
51:06,020;51:10,720;"That's actually this is what I'm saying. Like no, we don't even know."
51:10,720;51:15,840;"Is it it's week three? Oh, no, it is not yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
51:15,840;51:22,720;"Yeah, it's not that they're here. He's not playing. No, I thought he played for Falcons last year. He was a good part"
51:22,720;51:24,720;"I don't understand"
51:24,720;51:29,000;"Yeah, the fact they moved on from him and"
51:29,000;51:34,520;"He couldn't land anywhere else because he wasn't yeah"
51:34,520;51:38,000;"Yeah, oh man"
51:39,680;51:43,400;"You want to hear some other another interesting staff from this game?"
51:43,400;51:48,640;"Let's do it. I depressing but the Jets the Jets said"
51:48,640;51:52,720;"186 yards in the first quarter alone after only"
51:52,720;51:57,280;"Getting 200 yards in their previous meeting this year"
51:57,280;52:00,440;"Yeah, that's right"
52:00,440;52:05,320;"Patriots shall act them. Mm-hmm. That was a victory week - yeah"
52:05,320;52:08,880;"Yeah, I had a pick sick like a 90 something yard pick six. Yeah"
52:08,880;52:11,960;"Yeah, this is all team makes you long for Vinny test of Verity"
52:11,960;52:17,200;"Sure does all the Vinny green head"
52:17,200;52:25,540;"Is that what that means yeah, we looked it up. I mean I don't that's what the translation"
52:25,540;52:28,500;"I believe we call that loosened translated"
52:28,500;52:35,140;"The Vinny green head I know we're like wait the Jets this all makes sense"
52:37,960;52:39,960;"Really does oh"
52:39,960;52:42,480;"man"
52:42,480;52:44,480;"I"
52:44,480;52:46,480;"Had a stat that I thought was"
52:46,480;52:49,320;"I don't know interesting, but strange"
52:49,320;52:54,480;"Because another player who I think has struggled down the stretch here is Anton Smith"
52:54,480;53:00,580;"How many eyes do you have in this game rec? He's had a few disappointing games down this"
53:00,580;53:06,160;"See here I'd say less than 50"
53:07,480;53:10,080;"14 carries for 46 yards."
53:10,080;53:11,080;"Right."
53:11,080;53:13,960;"On the season, they showed a stat."
53:13,960;53:15,760;"He was averaging four yards per carry."
53:15,760;53:16,660;"Really?"
53:16,660;53:18,220;"That does not sound right."
53:18,220;53:18,960;"Yeah."
53:18,960;53:21,460;"This has been the least impressive four yards per carry."
53:21,460;53:23,320;"I've seen from a running deck."
53:23,320;53:25,960;"I mean, to be fair, they're trying to throw it a ton."
53:25,960;53:27,540;"They did."
53:27,540;53:27,700;"Yeah."
53:27,700;53:31,100;"This was kind of like a microcosm of the season, really."
53:31,100;53:32,180;"Couldn't stop the run."
53:32,180;53:35,080;"I'm sure Curtis Martin went over a hundred yards."
53:35,080;53:35,840;"Yeah."
53:35,840;53:37,600;"And a thousand yards again on the season."
53:37,600;53:39,520;"Um,"
53:39,520;53:43,320;"couldn't stop a pass rush."
53:43,320;53:46,200;"Brady was getting shellacked the entire time and just"
53:46,200;53:49,800;"like couldn't run the ball early and just got away from like, just didn't even"
53:49,800;53:50,480;"try anymore."
53:50,480;53:55,520;"And Brady was just trucking around and didn't have the time, wasn't accurate."
53:55,520;54:00,880;"Just wasn't able to put the team on his back, which again, it's surprising"
54:00,880;54:02,640;"considering what we've seen for the last."
54:03,640;54:14,440;"And I was since probably 2004-ish, like when he just decided, yeah, no, I am going to put the team on my back and the offense is going to run through me now instead of him being more of a game manager."
54:14,440;54:15,880;"Like these last couple of years."
54:15,880;54:16,240;"Yeah."
54:16,240;54:22,320;"Yeah, he was 19 of 37 for 133, one touchdown, one pick."
54:22,320;54:25,760;"So really not that impressive."
54:25,760;54:26,240;"No."
54:26,240;54:31,040;"And the and the pick was his kind of patented getting really frustrated."
54:31,040;54:33,640;"the office and do anything and chuck it deep in a double coverage."
54:33,640;54:34,520;"Yeah."
54:34,520;54:35,760;"You know, he still does that."
54:35,760;54:36,320;"Yeah."
54:36,320;54:36,960;"That's what I'm saying."
54:36,960;54:39,160;"That hasn't gone anywhere."
54:39,160;54:39,600;"Yeah."
54:39,600;54:41,720;"But you were seeing it in 2002."
54:41,720;54:44,480;"Frustration with the offense."
54:44,480;54:50,280;"There was such a weird lack of urgency in this game given how important it really"
54:50,280;54:54,080;"was like, yeah, didn't seem like a game with any implication at all."
54:54,080;54:56,000;"And it was actually very important."
54:56,000;54:56,720;"Right."
54:56,720;54:59,200;"It was played at home and everything and the crowds behind him and they still"
54:59,200;55:05,920;"just like didn't seem to get up for it. Yeah. Because yeah, I mean, the defense, which had been,"
55:05,920;55:10,960;"uh, I guess the strength of this team or what you would expect to be in the early years, like this"
55:10,960;55:15,360;"year wasn't like they were getting absolutely no pass rush. Even when they brought the blitz,"
55:15,360;55:20,560;"they easily got picked up and Pennington just had all day to throw. Was he an attack? Uh,"
55:20,560;55:26,800;"they have one play where I think he was not it was close. Anybody still like picked up a yard"
55:27,440;55:31,280;"Yeah, it's because it can't stop the run. I mean, right"
55:31,280;55:37,040;"And all that slows down your pass rush and now that's more I think the secondary is to every"
55:37,040;55:41,280;"Yeah, yeah, but they just had to cover for too long"
55:41,280;55:48,160;"And the defense was biting on every play action the chat pending was doing they had that it was uh to be fair"
55:48,160;55:49,920;"It was a good play action. I'll give them that"
55:49,920;55:54,320;"I'm interested in the palm lachete turnover into 2003"
55:55,840;55:58,880;"How much what how much of the defense they turn over after this?"
55:58,880;56:04,720;"Um, well, what was game one of 2003?"
56:04,720;56:12,880;"That I remember did fine. I bet you do. Yeah, you do. We'll see if that talk for that week."
56:12,880;56:15,920;"So you said that you said he had a good uh"
56:15,920;56:25,440;"Play action pennington. Yeah. Yeah, so they said the whole dislocating the hand thing. Yeah"
56:25,440;56:30,780;"So they said that so he dislocated in the preseason game. They rushed him back"
56:30,780;56:33,960;"It said due to the severity of the injury in a rush rehab process"
56:33,960;56:41,060;"Pennington's wrist would never be the same and his once outstanding play fake became thoroughly ordinary. Wow"
56:41,060;56:47,780;"So just think about how good that play fake could have been Andy"
56:53,840;56:58,880;"Must have been known for his play face. He's like it was really good read option"
56:58,880;57:02,240;"We leave it as belly for like an extra second good old Chadwick"
57:02,240;57:08,740;"What's his name Chadwick to you James Chadwick Pennington the third"
57:08,740;57:16,360;"Lord Chadwick"
57:16,360;57:22,680;"What else can we pile on since this is shit on the Patriots week? Oh well this shit on Chadwick he"
57:23,360;57:30,960;"Apparently when he got traded to the Dolphins, it was like, like a rush job for the preseason."
57:30,960;57:34,960;"And he just got married and they said he brought his playbook on his honeymoon."
57:34,960;57:36,640;"Oh my God."
57:36,640;57:38,680;"What a loser."
57:38,680;57:39,960;"Is he still married?"
57:39,960;57:42,600;"Probably doubt it."
57:42,600;57:47,960;"Oh, he just seems like a a dork, you know, what woman kind of guy."
57:47,960;57:51,240;"Yeah, he got three point three eight three GPA."
57:51,240;57:52,000;"Yeah."
57:52,000;57:52,640;"What is going on?"
57:52,640;57:55,140;"Like no a yogurt plain yogurt"
57:55,140;57:58,400;"What do you think is wonder like was"
57:58,400;58:02,240;"What was Brady 32? Yeah"
58:02,240;58:10,160;"Probably right I don't think 50 50. Yeah, give me a 41"
58:10,160;58:14,400;"It was a road scholar. He's finally oh"
58:14,400;58:18,160;"Look at this dummy 25"
58:21,520;58:26,360;"How do you get how was the road scholar finalists and then it's a 25 and a wonder right?"
58:26,360;58:28,720;"Wait, you're serious about the road scholar"
58:28,720;58:33,120;"Yeah, it's what according to Wikipedia Wikipedia calm"
58:33,120;58:38,880;"Yeah renowned source of unbiased"
58:38,880;58:42,000;"factual information"
58:42,000;58:44,560;"boy"
58:44,560;58:51,300;"That's surprising it was a it was an interesting look from Belichick read with a headband"
58:51,300;58:53,700;"I love that fan looking."
58:53,700;58:54,700;"Rocking the headband."
58:54,700;58:55,700;"I like that."
58:55,700;58:56,700;"Yeah."
58:56,700;58:57,700;"That was pretty slick."
58:57,700;59:01,940;"No holes in a sweater, which no none taking care of himself."
59:01,940;59:02,940;"Yeah."
59:02,940;59:05,180;"Well, shit for him."
59:05,180;59:06,940;"Yeah."
59:06,940;59:08,580;"Fighting scale."
59:08,580;59:10,780;"I love bill of checks."
59:10,780;59:16,380;"Like I tire because it's like, you know, you see like hipsters are like, oh, I don't"
59:16,380;59:20,940;"care what I look like, but his just so authentically not giving a shit."
59:20,940;59:23,780;"You know, you just have to respect it."
59:23,780;59:24,660;"You do."
59:24,660;59:27,380;"So completely unflattering all the time."
59:27,380;59:28,020;"Yeah."
59:28,020;59:29,700;"It doesn't give a shit."
59:29,700;59:32,660;"He's the least photogenic man ever."
59:32,660;59:37,860;"Even though it's like, man, you had half a beard at one point."
59:37,860;59:38,980;"Yeah, right."
59:38,980;59:40,980;"Rich covers a new drag."
59:40,980;59:44,140;"I'm not I'm not trying to imply that I'm photogenic."
59:44,140;59:48,220;"I'm just saying, at least he's setting the bar low."
59:49,220;59:53,780;"Well, what was it like trash and a dumpster and like, you know, you can"
59:53,780;59:58,460;"you just yeah, to go back to what Lisa was saying earlier, of once you set a"
59:58,460;01:00:02,660;"standard, a high bar, people start to accept, expect that from you."
01:00:02,660;01:00:04,940;"So always set a low standard."
01:00:04,940;01:00:07,940;"Just like,"
01:00:07,940;01:00:08,540;"live by."
01:00:08,540;01:00:15,740;"Holy shit."
01:00:15,740;01:00:18,940;"So I got some names for you guys."
01:00:18,940;01:00:23,140;"here. Alright. Uh, starting on this defense."
01:00:23,140;01:00:26,500;"And you tell me if you've ever heard of them. Okay."
01:00:26,500;01:00:30,300;"I'm just gonna go through the list and you tell me if you heard them."
01:00:30,300;01:00:34,900;"Bobby Hamilton left to find. Yes. Richard Seymour left offensive tackle."
01:00:34,900;01:00:38,340;"Yes. Yeah. Rick Lyle right defensive tackle."
01:00:38,340;01:00:41,700;"I had that note. Who the fuck is Lyle? Yep. So did I."
01:00:41,700;01:00:45,220;"Anthony Pleasant, Roman Fyfer, Mike Rayville, Ted Johnson."
01:00:45,220;01:00:46,820;"So the linebackers. Okay."
01:00:46,820;01:00:49,700;"Yes. Cornerbacks, tie law."
01:00:49,700;01:00:50,880;"I'm assuming you've heard of him."
01:00:50,880;01:00:54,020;"All Leonard Leonard Myers."
01:00:54,020;01:00:55,740;"I remember Leonard Myers."
01:00:55,740;01:00:56,220;"Little bit."
01:00:56,220;01:00:56,740;"Literally."
01:00:56,740;01:00:58,220;"Sure."
01:00:58,220;01:00:59,980;"I do not remember him at all."
01:00:59,980;01:01:06,940;"I do not like him, which is strange because he actually apparently he played"
01:01:06,940;01:01:08,500;"in seven games in 2001."
01:01:08,500;01:01:15,180;"I remember that he did something that like made me an eight games this season."
01:01:15,620;01:01:17,620;"And this was his one and only start."
01:01:17,620;01:01:21,500;"I and he was the one that panning to was picking on in this game."
01:01:21,500;01:01:27,940;"And then your safeties are lower below in to Bucky Jones, but I have not heard"
01:01:27,940;01:01:31,700;"two of these starting players on the defense."
01:01:31,700;01:01:34,100;"Lyle must have been new."
01:01:34,100;01:01:35,940;"I didn't see him on the list of like."
01:01:35,940;01:01:40,540;"Jets players currently playing on the Patriots, which was pretty long as we all"
01:01:40,540;01:01:42,580;"know, and I saw his name on the top."
01:01:42,580;01:01:43,220;"I was like, who the fuck?"
01:01:43,220;01:01:45,500;"I mean, I saw one that the game tells like, who is Lyle?"
01:01:45,500;01:01:48,700;"So he must have like was that Steve Martin was so shit"
01:01:48,700;01:01:52,120;"Right now check probably cut him this this in this week"
01:01:52,120;01:01:55,300;"I would think and just signs some guy he knew from the Jets"
01:01:55,300;01:01:59,480;"Yeah, it must have been because band didn't work"
01:01:59,480;01:02:02,200;"because as a defensive end"
01:02:02,200;01:02:05,900;"He spent five six seven eight nine years in the league"
01:02:05,900;01:02:09,800;"and had 11 sacks ever"
01:02:10,500;01:02:12,500;"Never all with the Jets or"
01:02:12,500;01:02:19,460;"No, but in 2001 he hit his high where he had three and a half sacks with the Jets before coming to New England"
01:02:19,460;01:02:23,020;"Where he had none in two years?"
01:02:23,020;01:02:28,120;"Yeah, the real question is how did Wayne Krabette not plan the Patriots?"
01:02:28,120;01:02:30,300;"Right"
01:02:30,300;01:02:32,300;"It was a killer - a"
01:02:32,300;01:02:38,900;"510 white receiver that was undrafted out of a division one double a school like that"
01:02:38,900;01:02:39,740;"- Yeah."
01:02:39,740;01:02:41,500;"(laughing)"
01:02:41,500;01:02:42,700;"- I'll check that all over."
01:02:42,700;01:02:46,100;"That played in the AOC, he's basically Welker."
01:02:46,100;01:02:48,180;"- He plays without gloves too."
01:02:48,180;01:02:49,700;"Think about the glove game."
01:02:49,700;01:02:52,300;"- Why are you not wearing gloves and him not wearing gloves?"
01:02:52,300;01:02:54,740;"Many of you are wearing gloves and Tom Brady does it."
01:02:54,740;01:02:57,100;"(laughing)"
01:02:57,100;01:03:00,780;"- And his name is Wayne John Cravette"
01:03:00,780;01:03:03,700;"instead of John Wayne Cravette, which is just,"
01:03:03,700;01:03:05,580;"it's just Chezkiss."
01:03:05,580;01:03:06,580;"(laughing)"
01:03:06,580;01:03:07,580;"- Oh my God."
01:03:07,580;01:03:09,020;"I didn't know that."
01:03:09,020;01:03:12,180;"So, all right, here's a conspiracy theory for you."
01:03:12,180;01:03:13,020;"Okay."
01:03:13,020;01:03:14,300;"Belichick played against Wayne Kerbat"
01:03:14,300;01:03:15,700;"and wanted him the entire time,"
01:03:15,700;01:03:17,660;"but Kerbat wouldn't come."
01:03:17,660;01:03:21,380;"So as soon as Belichick saw another shifty white receiver"
01:03:21,380;01:03:25,500;"playing in the AFC East that would play really well against him,"
01:03:25,500;01:03:26,860;"he's like, I have to have him."
01:03:26,860;01:03:28,340;"And he signed, he spent,"
01:03:28,340;01:03:30,780;"was like a second round draft pick on Buzz Welker?"
01:03:30,780;01:03:32,340;"Yeah, second."
01:03:32,340;01:03:33,460;"That's caught legs."
01:03:33,460;01:03:34,540;"That makes sense."
01:03:34,540;01:03:36,620;"a long waiting game though."
01:03:36,620;01:03:41,340;"Well, I think you just had his eyes open for that that shift"
01:03:41,340;01:03:42,020;"for that long."
01:03:42,020;01:03:43,740;"That's if you're white receiver."
01:03:43,740;01:03:46,340;"All of those ears, but I can't think of anybody else."
01:03:46,340;01:03:48,660;"Yeah, I mean,"
01:03:48,660;01:03:52,660;"I mean, Troy Brown was kind of fit that role."
01:03:52,660;01:03:56,940;"Oh, but like the undrafted one double A white wide receiver with"
01:03:56,940;01:03:57,900;"that shift. Yeah."
01:03:57,900;01:04:01,180;"You've talked about what round Troy was picking."
01:04:01,180;01:04:03,940;"He was like the closest thing you can come to"
01:04:03,940;01:04:06,660;"- That's true, yeah. - Yeah, it's round, I think."
01:04:06,660;01:04:08,620;"- Yeah, it's round. - It doesn't exist anymore."
01:04:08,620;01:04:12,640;"- I'm so late. (both laughing)"
01:04:12,640;01:04:15,160;"- But out of, where did he play?"
01:04:15,160;01:04:17,020;"- Marshall? - Uh, where did you play the game?"
01:04:17,020;01:04:18,640;"- With Pennington."
01:04:18,640;01:04:20,540;"- Yeah, uh, well. - Awesome."
01:04:20,540;01:04:22,280;"- I don't know about before, Pennington."
01:04:22,280;01:04:24,080;"- No, I think he's been in the league too long."
01:04:24,080;01:04:25,640;"- Definitely, I think it would have been sick."
01:04:25,640;01:04:28,100;"- I think it would have been sick of those college highlights."
01:04:28,100;01:04:30,400;"Troy Brown, Randy Moss, and Chad Pennington."
01:04:30,400;01:04:32,620;"- Steve, didn't we look at up at Troy Brown"
01:04:32,620;01:04:36,260;"And Randy Moss where they overlapped."
01:04:36,260;01:04:37,180;"- At the end of the year. - At the one year."
01:04:37,180;01:04:38,020;"- At the one year. - At the one year."
01:04:38,020;01:04:40,540;"- Troy Brown was there in 2007, Randy Moss was there."
01:04:40,540;01:04:44,260;"- Oh, I thought they overlapped in college."
01:04:44,260;01:04:45,300;"- Oh, in college."
01:04:45,300;01:04:47,860;"- Not the other way around. - They overlapped in"
01:04:47,860;01:04:51,060;"New England at the very end of '07,"
01:04:51,060;01:04:52,860;"at the very tailtail of Troy"
01:04:52,860;01:04:54,180;"in the very beginning of Randy."
01:04:54,180;01:04:56,180;"- Yes, yes, that's what it was."
01:04:56,180;01:04:59,700;"- It went 70. - Yeah, because Randy Moss,"
01:04:59,700;01:05:01,800;"when he played for Vikings this year,"
01:05:01,800;01:05:08,280;"Uh, the first like, as soon as the game ended, the Patriots won pretty handily and Rainy"
01:05:08,280;01:05:09,960;"Moss gave up on the last play."
01:05:09,960;01:05:15,880;"Um, you know, as he does, but the, like, you know, how they, they show everybody like"
01:05:15,880;01:05:18,400;"talking after the game."
01:05:18,400;01:05:22,120;"And Rainy Moss was like buddy, buddy with Troy Brown."
01:05:22,120;01:05:25,800;"So we floated the conspiracy theory that Troy Brown's a reason Rainy Moss ended up in New"
01:05:25,800;01:05:28,440;"England because of the Marshall connection."
01:05:28,440;01:05:30,120;"I'm not saying it's not true."
01:05:30,120;01:05:32,320;"Yeah, that one's a little bit more of a stretch."
01:05:32,320;01:05:33,120;"I feel it's not."
01:05:33,120;01:05:36,320;"I mean, Randy's like, ""Hey, Troy, we went to the same alma mater."
01:05:36,320;01:05:37,120;"We're buddies."
01:05:37,120;01:05:37,920;"What do you think of El check?"
01:05:37,920;01:05:38,420;"What do you like?"
01:05:38,420;01:05:39,220;"Do you like working with them?"""
01:05:39,220;01:05:40,920;"And Troy's like, ""Yeah, of course, this is the best."""
01:05:40,920;01:05:44,120;"If they traded for him, he didn't like sign here as a free agent."
01:05:44,120;01:05:46,320;"Yeah, that's why they go out for him in the first place."
01:05:46,320;01:05:48,720;"Because he's the best receiver in the NFL."
01:05:48,720;01:05:49,720;"I don't know, Andy."
01:05:49,720;01:05:51,720;"But he hadn't had good seasons, though."
01:05:51,720;01:05:53,320;"They were still taking a chance."
01:05:53,320;01:05:57,420;"Hey, remember Randy's lost contract was outrageous then."
01:05:57,420;01:05:59,320;"He took a huge pay cut to come here."
01:05:59,320;01:06:01,320;"That's right. Why did he do that?"
01:06:01,320;01:06:02,320;"As soon as he got trained."
01:06:02,320;01:06:04,600;"Yeah, why did Randy accept the deal?"
01:06:04,600;01:06:05,920;"Yeah. All right."
01:06:05,920;01:06:07,400;"All right. You're right."
01:06:07,400;01:06:08,200;"Can we move on?"
01:06:08,200;01:06:11,120;"Nope."
01:06:11,120;01:06:16,640;"Remember Chris Berman's Troy Brown."
01:06:16,640;01:06:17,920;"He's he saw his goal."
01:06:17,920;01:06:19,360;"Troy Brown from."
01:06:19,360;01:06:21,200;"Yep."
01:06:21,200;01:06:22,440;"You know what it is?"
01:06:22,440;01:06:24,280;"Middle and renowned."
01:06:24,280;01:06:27,040;"Oh, that's right."
01:06:27,040;01:06:27,880;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:27,880;01:06:34,040;"What does that mean? Yeah, I never do that either. Lester Raymond Brown and his band of renown"
01:06:34,040;01:06:42,520;"From like 1938 jazz musician apparently the Chris Berman always has the deepest cuts"
01:06:42,520;01:06:49,000;"Less Brown and his band of renown. Yeah"
01:06:49,000;01:06:53,520;"Well Brown I think is a white dude"
01:06:54,440;01:07:00,280;"Not that I'm at it, but okay in 1930s jazz - that's crazy - 19. Yeah"
01:07:00,280;01:07:03,200;"1947"
01:07:03,200;01:07:05,200;"Wow"
01:07:05,200;01:07:09,400;"Yeah, it led the band for nearly seven decades from 1938 to 2000"
01:07:09,400;01:07:12,080;"Maybe not that deep of a cut shit"
01:07:12,080;01:07:15,440;"It's not my kind of music. That's a hell of a"
01:07:15,440;01:07:19,360;"Yeah"
01:07:19,360;01:07:21,360;"Do you have any"
01:07:21,360;01:07:26,800;"Bermanisms for this one Greg I think we already did the Jets doing I don't know it's been so long"
01:07:26,800;01:07:30,720;"Maybe not but"
01:07:30,720;01:07:33,040;"Do not what I did not do any now"
01:07:33,040;01:07:41,040;"You don't have anything for John Hall that feels like yeah Matt Turk. There's definitely a name you can do there"
01:07:45,720;01:07:50,640;"So here's a question. Who do you think was the best who who had the most yards out of"
01:07:50,640;01:07:53,760;"Laverneas cold Santa moss and wanker bet"
01:07:53,760;01:08:02,000;"There is Stephen Corro was pretty stacked. That's yeah. Yeah, yeah solid one day three right there. Are you talking about in this game or"
01:08:02,000;01:08:04,760;"just career wise"
01:08:04,760;01:08:08,480;"Let's do the game first. I'd say"
01:08:08,480;01:08:14,100;"Santana Moss probably just because he played forever on the Redskins. That was a deep threat"
01:08:14,100;01:08:15,840;"Yeah, especially you use it."
01:08:15,840;01:08:16,680;"That's what I would say."
01:08:16,680;01:08:18,440;"It returns and all that to use a sick return or even in the"
01:08:18,440;01:08:18,940;"store."
01:08:18,940;01:08:19,440;"All right."
01:08:19,440;01:08:20,440;"Yeah."
01:08:20,440;01:08:21,440;"You are correct."
01:08:21,440;01:08:23,240;"It goes, ""Moss calls Cribette."""
01:08:23,240;01:08:26,680;"Yeah, Cribette was the possession receiver."
01:08:26,680;01:08:29,200;"I would have put him last."
01:08:29,200;01:08:31,200;"In this game, though?"
01:08:31,200;01:08:32,200;"Mmm."
01:08:32,200;01:08:35,400;"It's got to be Santana, especially with that factor."
01:08:35,400;01:08:36,400;"Yeah."
01:08:36,400;01:08:37,400;"All per person."
01:08:37,400;01:08:38,400;"That's it."
01:08:38,400;01:08:41,400;"It could be calls because calls had that big deep touchdown pass that should have been"
01:08:41,400;01:08:43,880;"picked off by whoever the hell it was."
01:08:43,880;01:08:45,480;"Was that the double coverage?"
01:08:45,480;01:08:50,520;"Yeah, Victor Green, like literally had his hands just didn't back up far enough"
01:08:50,520;01:08:53,080;"before he jumped and it just sailed over his head."
01:08:53,080;01:08:54,600;"Dropped right in the basket."
01:08:54,600;01:08:56,080;"Just stressing."
01:08:56,080;01:08:57,160;"It was tired."
01:08:57,160;01:08:58,520;"I think he was on Cole's all night."
01:08:58,520;01:09:00,960;"So I'm saying my Moss had the most."
01:09:00,960;01:09:04,200;"Stat check it."
01:09:04,200;01:09:06,000;"It was Cole's was 78."
01:09:06,000;01:09:06,960;"This is receiving out."
01:09:06,960;01:09:09,320;"78 Moss was 77."
01:09:09,320;01:09:11,040;"Progen 61."
01:09:11,040;01:09:13,440;"They're all right about the same."
01:09:13,440;01:09:19,720;"Patriots, I would say Kevin Falk had the most receiving yards."
01:09:19,720;01:09:21,640;"Yeah."
01:09:21,640;01:09:24,040;"Seems like the only one that had any."
01:09:24,040;01:09:24,720;"Yeah."
01:09:24,720;01:09:26,960;"Him and David Patton, both at 38."
01:09:26,960;01:09:32,520;"Troy Brown, tough day, seven targets, two catches, eight yards and a fumble punt."
01:09:32,520;01:09:34,920;"He had one catch rate that hurt too."
01:09:35,400;01:09:38,240;"Yeah, like he landed on a football and lower back."
01:09:38,240;01:09:40,080;"Yeah, he was hurt."
01:09:40,080;01:09:42,360;"He landed on like tailbone or something."
01:09:42,360;01:09:45,360;"The way he was holding himself."
01:09:45,360;01:09:51,800;"I do have from the Pat Chaneyton or Chadwick."
01:09:51,800;01:09:52,200;"Sorry."
01:09:52,200;01:09:53,120;"It's a"
01:09:53,120;01:09:53,960;"at Chaneyton."
01:09:53,960;01:09:58,200;"The commentators are like fumbling over each other to like a great"
01:09:58,200;01:10:01,120;"math about like, oh, this is what he does in one quarter."
01:10:01,120;01:10:03,480;"What if you extrapolate that to the whole game?"
01:10:03,840;01:10:11,160;"692 yards. Did you just do that in your head? Oh my God. You're so smart."
01:10:11,160;01:10:12,760;"It's just like, dude, the fuck."
01:10:12,760;01:10:16,520;"Well, they were they were having a rough night because apparently this was the"
01:10:16,520;01:10:22,680;"Monday night game, right? Yeah. And they had done the Sunday night game in Dallas"
01:10:22,680;01:10:27,160;"the night before. And they were acting like it was the biggest fucking deal that"
01:10:27,160;01:10:29,040;"they were in Dallas 24 hours ago."
01:10:29,040;01:10:31,520;"Yeah, they would not shut the fuck up about that."
01:10:31,800;01:10:34,560;"Yeah. Like, so we're all running on no sleep."
01:10:34,560;01:10:35,760;"Okay."
01:10:35,760;01:10:37,640;"All right. Let's show the camera guys again."
01:10:37,640;01:10:43,880;"Because they were running. Oh, look, they're Santa Claus holding the microphone."
01:10:43,880;01:10:49,840;"Yeah, it wasn't their best game, but December 22nd."
01:10:49,840;01:10:52,440;"Yeah, it was also three days before Christmas."
01:10:52,440;01:10:55,520;"And they kept showing like shots of, you know,"
01:10:55,520;01:10:58,560;"moving Christmas and like, oh, they do it different up here."
01:10:58,560;01:11:00,640;"There's like one house that has some reason on the windows."
01:11:00,640;01:11:02,980;"And like that is beautiful."
01:11:02,980;01:11:04,580;"It's amazing."
01:11:04,580;01:11:08,180;"Like I think that's my neighbor."
01:11:08,180;01:11:10,340;"And like I think they leave that up all year round."
01:11:10,340;01:11:11,500;"Yeah, but I live in Virginia."
01:11:11,500;01:11:12,900;"It just looks like a goddamn house."
01:11:12,900;01:11:14,260;"Now I can do it."
01:11:14,260;01:11:16,900;"It's like, oh yes, only people in New England"
01:11:16,900;01:11:18,420;"put a briefs in their windows."
01:11:18,420;01:11:19,420;"Exactly."
01:11:19,420;01:11:21,260;"And then they had some like."
01:11:21,260;01:11:22,180;"Okay."
01:11:22,180;01:11:23,620;"Oh, I have this cactus."
01:11:23,620;01:11:24,780;"Yeah, that's true."
01:11:24,780;01:11:28,980;"If they just came from Dallas, I suppose that makes more sense."
01:11:28,980;01:11:29,500;"Yeah."
01:11:29,740;01:11:30,920;"We had snow as well."
01:11:30,920;01:11:31,840;"So all right."
01:11:31,840;01:11:32,960;"Do we want to do best and worse?"
01:11:32,960;01:11:34,880;"I don't think there's much else to talk about in this."
01:11:34,880;01:11:35,740;"Yeah."
01:11:35,740;01:11:36,800;"All right."
01:11:36,800;01:11:38,380;"Greg, you want to go first?"
01:11:38,380;01:11:39,200;"No."
01:11:39,200;01:11:41,600;"Steve."
01:11:41,600;01:11:46,540;"Uh, yeah, I'll take the best best so Greg doesn't have it."
01:11:46,540;01:11:47,620;"Okay."
01:11:47,620;01:11:48,520;"Definitely."
01:11:48,520;01:11:48,920;"They kept him."
01:11:48,920;01:11:50,880;"Falk touchdown return."
01:11:50,880;01:11:52,120;"Where are you?"
01:11:52,120;01:11:52,640;"Herd."
01:11:52,640;01:11:56,060;"What two guys touchdown and they went up like what seven or."
01:11:56,060;01:11:56,880;"Yeah."
01:11:56,880;01:11:58,280;"Something like that."
01:11:58,560;01:12:00,360;"Now seven, nothing was the first issue."
01:12:00,360;01:12:02,960;"And he just took it right back to the house."
01:12:02,960;01:12:07,720;"Yeah. And in it, he like kind of cuts left and then cuts back right and just sees"
01:12:07,720;01:12:10,560;"a little gap in the blocking and jumps."
01:12:10,560;01:12:11,600;"A dude."
01:12:11,600;01:12:12,920;"That's like kind of falling over."
01:12:12,920;01:12:16,680;"And if you watch it from the opposite, from the end zone, you see him jump and you"
01:12:16,680;01:12:18,800;"see three jets, just missed a bit."
01:12:18,800;01:12:20,800;"Like they can't get over the guy on the ground."
01:12:20,800;01:12:24,800;"And then it's just him on the kicker and it's like, you better outrun that kicker, Kevin."
01:12:26,040;01:12:30,040;"If you don't know, run that kick, you know, Bella checks going to play that highlight on the loop."
01:12:30,040;01:12:30,840;"Are you getting caught?"
01:12:30,840;01:12:31,640;"Oh, my God. Yeah."
01:12:31,640;01:12:33,640;"No, I don't subscribe to that theory."
01:12:33,640;01:12:38,440;"Getting like getting tackled by the kicker is like losing in a Super Bowl."
01:12:38,440;01:12:41,640;"Like you have to get to the point of getting to the kicker."
01:12:41,640;01:12:43,160;"I don't know. But he had to get a great."
01:12:43,160;01:12:45,840;"He really had like no chance."
01:12:45,840;01:12:48,760;"It's one of those. If you get caught by the kicker, it's your fault for not."
01:12:48,760;01:12:51,440;"If you get like caught, like he chases you down."
01:12:51,440;01:12:53,440;"Like we saw a mandatory chase that guy down."
01:12:53,440;01:12:53,640;"Yeah."
01:12:53,640;01:12:54,640;"That's different."
01:12:55,040;01:12:56,380;"That guy, Herschel Walker."
01:12:56,380;01:12:59,120;"Yeah, it was Herschel Walker was it was."
01:12:59,120;01:13:01,000;"So yeah, I think it depends on the kicker."
01:13:01,000;01:13:02,260;"I'm kind of in the middle of you too."
01:13:02,260;01:13:04,760;"If you get tackled by Adam Venatorian, he runs you down."
01:13:04,760;01:13:05,920;"Fair enough."
01:13:05,920;01:13:11,040;"If you get tackled by Sebastian Janikowski, like that should be on loop the next day."
01:13:11,040;01:13:15,320;"Because I don't think Sebastian Janikowski has ever made a tackle in his career."
01:13:15,320;01:13:18,240;"Because he does the Olay every time."
01:13:18,240;01:13:20,040;"I love Sebastian."
01:13:20,040;01:13:21,040;"I know."
01:13:21,040;01:13:22,160;"I just love him."
01:13:22,160;01:13:23,000;"- Let's see the ass."
01:13:23,000;01:13:25,640;"(laughing)"
01:13:25,640;01:13:30,640;"- And then my worst is the 2007 spread against the Eagles."
01:13:30,640;01:13:37,880;"We were at no negative 24 and a half points."
01:13:37,880;01:13:38,720;"And if you remember,"
01:13:38,720;01:13:41,440;"that was that Chip Kelly game, we were super close."
01:13:41,440;01:13:42,920;"- Oh yeah."
01:13:42,920;01:13:45,680;"- I would fuck with you to make a fucking"
01:13:45,680;01:13:48,840;"spread negative 24 and a half."
01:13:48,840;01:13:50,640;"- So the page was 24 and a half point favorites."
01:13:50,640;01:13:51,920;"- I remember all, it tells the game,"
01:13:51,920;01:13:53,840;"I remember a super close me barely won."
01:13:53,840;01:13:57,120;"- Do you know why they were 24 and a half point favorites?"
01:13:57,120;01:13:59,120;"Because every game before,"
01:13:59,120;01:14:01,360;"they were like at least two touchdown favorites"
01:14:01,360;01:14:02,880;"and they kept blowing it away."
01:14:02,880;01:14:06,080;"Like they covered by like two touchdowns"
01:14:06,080;01:14:07,880;"on top of whatever the spread was."
01:14:07,880;01:14:09,600;"So finally got up to 24 and a half"
01:14:09,600;01:14:11,840;"and then they won by like seven."
01:14:11,840;01:14:13,360;"- Now there was like three I felt like,"
01:14:13,360;01:14:15,400;"I feel like it was pretty close, but whatever."
01:14:15,400;01:14:17,160;"- There were a couple of close games are you?"
01:14:17,160;01:14:18,320;"- I have to play in Vegas."
01:14:18,320;01:14:19,160;"- So."
01:14:20,040;01:14:22,480;"Do you know the biggest spread and the other way"
01:14:22,480;01:14:23,640;"for the Patriots was?"
01:14:23,640;01:14:25,680;"- Were there biggest on dogs?"
01:14:25,680;01:14:26,680;"- Awesome."
01:14:26,680;01:14:27,520;"- Huh?"
01:14:27,520;01:14:30,780;"- Was it the Super Bowl?"
01:14:30,780;01:14:31,840;"- Nope."
01:14:31,840;01:14:33,720;"- Wait, the biggest favorites they were?"
01:14:33,720;01:14:35,640;"- No, the biggest underdogs."
01:14:35,640;01:14:36,480;"- Dogs, underdogs."
01:14:36,480;01:14:37,460;"- Dogs."
01:14:37,460;01:14:39,480;"- 11 and a half points."
01:14:39,480;01:14:41,720;"- They're 14 point dogs to the Rams"
01:14:41,720;01:14:42,920;"in Super Bowl, weren't they?"
01:14:42,920;01:14:47,160;"- Not according to Patriots dynasty that info."
01:14:47,160;01:14:48,440;"- Oh, Andy."
01:14:48,440;01:14:49,760;"- They may have shifted."
01:14:49,760;01:14:52,200;"I got a mission from Pro Football reference."
01:14:52,200;01:14:54,760;"So I'm going to be around this time frame, right?"
01:14:54,760;01:14:55,360;"Yeah."
01:14:55,360;01:14:57,040;"Steelers Steelers, they have to change."
01:14:57,040;01:14:58,720;"Oh, no."
01:14:58,720;01:15:00,320;"No, steal it."
01:15:00,320;01:15:02,320;"Steelers opening week."
01:15:02,320;01:15:04,400;"No, they weren't that big of it."
01:15:04,400;01:15:06,160;"I don't know. Tell us."
01:15:06,160;01:15:10,400;"The Colts game where Patton runs and catches."
01:15:10,400;01:15:13,320;"Oh, not Brady's first star."
01:15:13,320;01:15:15,880;"That was surprisingly not."
01:15:15,880;01:15:17,280;"Second."
01:15:17,280;01:15:19,480;"That's surprising."
01:15:19,640;01:15:23,240;"Wow, shit. Okay. Who knew? All right, Greg, you got your best"
01:15:23,240;01:15:23,840;"and worst ready?"
01:15:23,840;01:15:26,120;"Yeah, something up."
01:15:26,120;01:15:29,480;"Yes, I have something to add here."
01:15:29,480;01:15:30,880;"Okay."
01:15:30,880;01:15:35,600;"For cyber everything called best and worse, whatever."
01:15:35,600;01:15:40,480;"Looking at scores around the league for the same week, because I was like,"
01:15:40,480;01:15:43,960;"Oh, I wonder how the bills did because they were, you know, we played them last"
01:15:43,960;01:15:45,080;"week, right? Yeah."
01:15:45,920;01:15:52,920;"So they went to Lambo and lost 10 to nothing to Green Bay."
01:15:52,920;01:15:54,020;"Oh, shit."
01:15:54,020;01:15:57,560;"And between Brett Favre and Drew Bledself,"
01:15:57,560;01:16:04,040;"they had less than 300 yards passing combined,"
01:16:04,040;01:16:06,560;"one touchdown and four picks."
01:16:06,560;01:16:07,400;"Nice."
01:16:07,400;01:16:10,840;"And they were sacked eight times."
01:16:10,840;01:16:13,600;"Merry fucking Christmas."
01:16:13,600;01:16:14,840;"Waffy game."
01:16:14,840;01:16:19,000;"I'm a little surprised the the picks weren't more than four combined."
01:16:19,000;01:16:19,740;"I know."
01:16:19,740;01:16:20,240;"I know."
01:16:20,240;01:16:21,540;"Watch the finish three each."
01:16:21,540;01:16:23,040;"Yeah."
01:16:23,040;01:16:25,340;"That's 27 degrees."
01:16:25,340;01:16:26,640;"Wind chill 13."
01:16:26,640;01:16:27,440;"Yeah."
01:16:27,440;01:16:28,040;"Lamb of."
01:16:28,040;01:16:33,040;"Oh, would you rather watch that game in person or this game on TV?"
01:16:33,040;01:16:34,440;"Back game in person."
01:16:34,440;01:16:35,840;"Probably."
01:16:35,840;01:16:38,840;"Man, we're blood."
01:16:38,840;01:16:39,240;"So."
01:16:39,240;01:16:44,140;"All right, Lisa, we kind of sprung this on you, but do you have any best and worse?"
01:16:44,640;01:16:49,100;"How is is am I talking about this game or what's the format?"
01:16:49,100;01:16:52,440;"Some of us talk about this game"
01:16:52,440;01:16:58,360;"It doesn't watch the game doesn't offer you like best of experience"
01:16:58,360;01:17:02,100;"That's a worse of brothers feel free to rank us"
01:17:02,100;01:17:07,920;"You're all equally great, that's my mom answer"
01:17:07,920;01:17:14,560;"Yeah, well our mom doesn't answer it like that though, yeah"
01:17:14,560;01:17:16,560;"- Yeah, she hates you."
01:17:16,560;01:17:17,560;"- No, she doesn't."
01:17:17,560;01:17:18,400;"(laughing)"
01:17:18,400;01:17:19,940;"- She loves me all the time."
01:17:19,940;01:17:20,860;"(laughing)"
01:17:20,860;01:17:21,700;"- Oh man."
01:17:21,700;01:17:23,940;"- But it's not, she says to me, dude."
01:17:23,940;01:17:25,540;"- She's here, she says about you."
01:17:25,540;01:17:29,180;"- How far apart are you guys in age?"
01:17:29,180;01:17:32,500;"- 18 months."
01:17:32,500;01:17:34,340;"- Yeah, I'm 37."
01:17:34,340;01:17:35,340;"- And I'm 38 months."
01:17:35,340;01:17:36,180;"- 38 months."
01:17:36,180;01:17:38,020;"- 38 months. - 38 months."
01:17:38,020;01:17:39,860;"- Yeah."
01:17:39,860;01:17:41,340;"- I always forget how old I am now."
01:17:41,340;01:17:42,420;"I think I'm 32."
01:17:42,420;01:17:43,420;"- Yeah."
01:17:43,420;01:17:46,420;"- Yeah, we have a sister as well who's between me and Steve."
01:17:46,420;01:17:48,860;"- Yeah, so it made our 18 months apart."
01:17:48,860;01:17:51,060;"- Me and Greg are 18 months and then me and Ellie"
01:17:51,060;01:17:55,140;"are two and a half years apart."
01:17:55,140;01:17:57,100;"- Why isn't she on the fuck?"
01:17:57,100;01:17:58,980;"- She hates us."
01:17:58,980;01:18:00,340;"- She's smarter than us."
01:18:00,340;01:18:01,780;"(laughing)"
01:18:01,780;01:18:03,500;"She knows better."
01:18:03,500;01:18:05,820;"- She also has three children and doesn't have time"
01:18:05,820;01:18:08,420;"to watch football games from 2000 and so on."
01:18:08,420;01:18:09,780;"(laughing)"
01:18:09,780;01:18:10,620;"- I feel that."
01:18:10,620;01:18:11,460;"Yeah."
01:18:11,460;01:18:12,300;"I was like, oh, I'm having stuff."
01:18:12,300;01:18:13,140;"You're great."
01:18:13,140;01:18:14,140;"You're great."
01:18:14,140;01:18:16,780;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:18:16,780;01:18:19,940;"But about this game, no."
01:18:19,940;01:18:23,820;"I mean, it's very little best and all worst."
01:18:23,820;01:18:25,940;"There was one play that I kind of liked"
01:18:25,940;01:18:28,580;"where Tom fell over."
01:18:28,580;01:18:30,980;"It was like right after that goal line stand"
01:18:30,980;01:18:33,340;"where the Jets had to settle for a field goal."
01:18:33,340;01:18:35,640;"And then on that subsequent drive,"
01:18:35,640;01:18:38,620;"Tom fell over and he just looked so mad."
01:18:38,620;01:18:41,020;"And I don't know, brought me joy."
01:18:41,020;01:18:44,780;"- I like sassy, Tom."
01:18:44,780;01:18:47,140;"It's my favorite to all of us when he starts getting mad"
01:18:47,140;01:18:48,220;"and pissy."
01:18:48,220;01:18:51,700;"- Was that the one where John Abrams"
01:18:51,700;01:18:55,020;"pushed Matt Light back so far that he stepped on Brady's foot?"
01:18:55,020;01:18:55,860;"- Yes."
01:18:55,860;01:18:58,060;"(laughs)"
01:18:58,060;01:18:59,700;"- I stole from Matt Light."
01:18:59,700;01:19:01,220;"- Yeah."
01:19:01,220;01:19:03,500;"- Sacking his own quarterback."
01:19:03,500;01:19:05,300;"- Microcosm of the game."
01:19:05,300;01:19:08,060;"- Yeah, that was bad."
01:19:08,060;01:19:17,060;"Yeah. All right. Well, I had, I don't know if this is the best or worst. It was the best for this game, but maybe a worse for what's to come."
01:19:17,060;01:19:24,060;"They were sure they were kept throwing it back to Chris Berman for like highlights of other games that happened over the weekend."
01:19:24,060;01:19:36,060;"And one of them was, I don't remember who the charges were playing, but they were down a score with like a few, like under a minute left or something."
01:19:37,060;01:19:39,460;"They lost because Rache Caldwell fumbled it"
01:19:39,460;01:19:48,780;"A sign of things to come I like follow up. We'll get to this. I think Caldwell's underrated. I know"
01:19:48,780;01:19:56,340;"We will get to this because I disagree and we've had this disagreement for a while wait till we get to Kenbrell Tompkins my boy"
01:19:56,340;01:20:06,300;"He was the second kind of big begins I love I still do love Kenbrell Tompkins, okay"

01:23:52,180;01:23:59,160;"She does she wants it to be a call-in show, which I don't think she understands how podcast work"
01:23:59,160;01:24:06,180;"We I mean, maybe we can oh, you know we should do we'll set up a"
01:24:06,180;01:24:11,400;"voicemail box that people can leave us voicemails instead maybe that'll be easier"
01:24:11,400;01:24:18,180;"And you all right yeah, I'll work on that for next episode"
01:24:18,180;01:24:19,180;"of moving out."
01:24:19,180;01:24:21,020;"Let's start with the tweet season."

01:24:22,260;01:24:23,220;"And then we'll graduate."

01:24:33,500;01:24:35,340;"I get a bunch of dumb ass friends that"
01:24:35,340;01:24:37,540;"at least some stupid shit on a voicemail."
01:24:37,540;01:24:38,660;"See, that's what I'm saying."
01:24:38,660;01:24:40,780;"That might actually be easier."
01:24:40,780;01:24:42,620;"Because I mean, most of our friends are illiterate."
01:24:42,620;01:24:45,660;"So it's not like they can actually write us a podcast."
01:24:45,660;01:24:47,260;"We did call them big dummies."
01:24:47,260;01:24:49,180;"and I don't think we're too far off."
01:24:49,180;01:24:50,180;"Yeah."

01:25:11,700;01:25:13,180;"I don't think we're spoiling anything"
01:25:13,180;01:25:14,900;"to say that they don't get into the playoffs,"
01:25:14,900;01:25:17,140;"but they do"
01:25:17,140;01:25:19,300;"finish on a high note"

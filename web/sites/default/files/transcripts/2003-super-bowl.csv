00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:19,440;"I am not your mother."
00:19,440;00:26,080;"Welcome back to the Pages of the Odyssey podcast."
00:26,080;00:31,360;"a bi week last week, but in preparation for a big game, you kind of have to do that."
00:31,360;00:39,000;"So we're back. And it is your host here. Any Brown along with both brothers, Brown, Greg"
00:39,000;00:44,800;"and Steve, who I believe actually both watched the game this week. I always watch the game."
00:44,800;00:51,440;"Me too. I think we both know talking about you, Steve."
00:51,440;00:52,820;"And Bobby's on."
00:52,820;00:54,900;"And we got to ruin the surprise."
00:54,900;00:55,900;"Yeah."
00:55,900;00:57,860;"At least he are ruining the surprise."
00:57,860;01:00,100;"He has lurked into the bedroom."
01:00,100;01:02,340;"She doesn't hear anything we're saying."
01:02,340;01:04,300;"And he was just about to announce me."
01:04,300;01:05,300;"Yeah."
01:05,300;01:06,500;"I can only imagine."
01:06,500;01:07,540;"OK, it's fine."
01:07,540;01:08,900;"OK, bye."
01:08,900;01:09,900;"I can't get him."
01:09,900;01:10,400;"Good."
01:10,400;01:11,060;"Yeah."
01:11,060;01:12,100;"Thanks for the contribution."
01:12,100;01:13,820;"Great start."
01:13,820;01:14,340;"Yeah."
01:14,340;01:17,540;"And so for the surprise that was now ruined,"
01:17,540;01:20,100;"we have also with us joining us today"
01:20,100;01:27,660;"our brother in law, Bobby Bridges, the Carolina Panthers fan, Bobby Bridges, it felt appropriate"
01:27,660;01:28,660;"to bring him back."
01:28,660;01:33,420;"We've talked to him before, but these are better circumstances for you, Bobby."
01:33,420;01:39,700;"I would think I'm just here to boost my ratings from the last time I was on."
01:39,700;01:40,700;"With whom?"
01:40,700;01:41,700;"Yeah."
01:41,700;01:42,700;"You know, again, three anyways."
01:42,700;01:48,820;"One of those mom with all the Patriots fans that are dying to hear you come back on the"
01:48,820;01:54,500;"podcast. I just add whatever flavor I can. I love it. Yeah. So last time we talked to you,"
01:54,500;02:01,780;"the Panthers were one in 15 finishing out that season. This was only two seasons ago,"
02:01,780;02:06,500;"and the Patriots had thrashed them to end their season going to their playoffs."
02:06,500;02:12,180;"And you said it was the low point in the franchise's history, if I recall."
02:12,900;02:19,460;"I believe that's accurate. Yeah, so then would that make this 2003 team"
02:19,460;02:28,020;"the high point or just a high point? Yeah, I was thinking that. For me personally,"
02:28,020;02:32,980;"high point, like this was a high watermark. This was like, I mean, this is the most important"
02:32,980;02:36,180;"panther team I've ever watched, most important panthers in my life."
02:38,820;02:44,740;"I, high moment for the franchise, I think arguably in retrospect, yes."
02:44,740;02:48,900;"Wow. Because we don't even need to talk about that stupid-ass shit show against Denver a few"
02:48,900;02:54,340;"years ago. Yeah. I mean, that's the only competition, right? Yeah. Well, I mean, but which team would"
02:54,340;03:00,660;"you say was better? As a Panthers fan. Because that, that more recent one with Cam Newton, they were"
03:00,660;03:02,760;"or what, 15 and one?"
03:02,760;03:04,440;"- Yeah, that was a better team,"
03:04,440;03:08,940;"but this 2003 team was grittier."
03:08,940;03:11,460;"- There you go."
03:11,460;03:13,980;"- And the second half showed that, as I recall."
03:13,980;03:15,140;"- Yes."
03:15,140;03:18,140;"So yeah, these Carolina Panthers back in 2003"
03:18,140;03:19,940;"finished the season 11 and five."
03:19,940;03:23,660;"It was good enough for the three seed in the NFC."
03:23,660;03:28,660;"And they kind of had a bit of a wild ride to the Super Bowl"
03:29,180;03:33,020;"'cause I know we actually touched on it last week, week before,"
03:33,020;03:37,260;"when the Patriots were playing their,"
03:37,260;03:42,180;"oh, their divisional game against the Titans in the cold, yeah."
03:42,180;03:44,820;"They kept showing highlights of the Panthers game"
03:44,820;03:47,020;"'cause they were playing the Rams"
03:47,020;03:50,060;"and they beat the Rams in double overtime."
03:50,060;03:51,900;"Where Steve Smith took a quick slant"
03:51,900;03:54,260;"and just fucking housed it."
03:54,260;03:55,700;"Walked it off in first."
03:55,700;03:57,260;"- Yeah, this was the most important game,"
03:57,260;03:59,900;"but that Rams game is my favorite Panthers game"
03:59,900;04:01,660;"of my entire life, actually."
04:01,660;04:04,060;"I actually vividly remember that game"
04:04,060;04:05,580;"and where I was watching it."
04:05,580;04:10,420;"And that Steve Smith play, I remember,"
04:10,420;04:12,260;"that play is seared into my soul."
04:12,260;04:15,740;"It was the only way it could have gone down."
04:15,740;04:19,700;"I can picture it in front of my eyes right now."
04:19,700;04:20,540;"- Yeah."
04:20,540;04:21,540;"(laughs)"
04:21,540;04:22,660;"I understand that feeling."
04:22,660;04:24,880;"I have that for the few pages, please."
04:26,660;04:30,120;"But that actually brings me to my point,"
04:30,120;04:33,460;"because I feel like Steve,"
04:33,460;04:35,300;"I don't wanna hear my brother say about this."
04:35,300;04:39,140;"I feel like Steve Smith is like a Rodney Harrison type"
04:39,140;04:41,380;"of guy where you love him if he's on your team,"
04:41,380;04:44,180;"but otherwise you think you fucking hate him."
04:44,180;04:46,460;"- Yeah, he was like, I didn't see me."
04:46,460;04:47,860;"- I knew you would, Greg."
04:47,860;04:50,500;"(laughing)"
04:50,500;04:54,540;"'Cause I imagine like he's probably one of like the top,"
04:54,540;04:56,460;"like Panthers in Panther history, right?"
04:56,460;05:01,900;"I have no hesitation in saying he's the greatest Panther in history."
05:01,900;05:06,420;"And my opinion is if you didn't like Steve Smith, you didn't fucking like football."
05:06,420;05:07,340;"I agree."
05:07,340;05:08,460;"I'm a complete agree."
05:08,460;05:12,340;"He's different than Rodney in that, even if he's not on your team, you love him"
05:12,340;05:13,900;"because he's just fucking awesome."
05:13,900;05:19,580;"But I feel like he was that same, like always played right on the edge."
05:19,580;05:23,780;"We're just trash talk this shit out of everybody all the time."
05:23,780;05:28,780;"And like he seemed to be able to rile up the other team"
05:28,780;05:33,380;"in a way that felt very reminiscent of Rodney Harrison."
05:33,380;05:36,460;"- He was like a Heinz Ward to me."
05:36,460;05:38,900;"- That seems pretty good comparison."
05:38,900;05:40,140;"Yeah, I think he was probably more talented"
05:40,140;05:42,060;"than Heinz Ward, but yes."
05:42,060;05:44,740;"- But also like if you're gonna, I mean,"
05:44,740;05:48,880;"Steve Smith's making my top 10 all-time athletes"
05:48,880;05:52,180;"in terms of biggest chip on your shoulder."
05:52,180;05:56,020;"Like he's up there in terms of just like every game showed up with a like,"
05:56,020;05:59,420;"I heard all these motherfuckers thought I sucked at football,"
05:59,420;06:01,420;"like literally before every game."
06:01,420;06:05,660;"And like the thing about his trash talk was like that shit cut deep."
06:05,660;06:09,540;"I mean, the most hilarious moment ever was this like Minnesota game when he"
06:09,540;06:13,020;"like just just ripped Fred Smootz like so out of his body."
06:13,020;06:15,620;"I think that was the like ice up son game."
06:15,620;06:18,220;"Yes. Oh, that's right. Yeah."
06:19,460;06:23,020;"He's even better now with like the analyst stuff he did."
06:23,020;06:26,460;"Like he was doing Thursday night football halftime show."
06:26,460;06:30,300;"And like Michael Urban was like trying to like playfully talk"
06:30,300;06:33,580;"shit to him about like his suit or something."
06:33,580;06:34,420;"Oh, that's right."
06:34,420;06:36,340;"And Steve says was just having none of it."
06:36,340;06:38,380;"He was just like, he was like, fuck you,"
06:38,380;06:39,780;"I'm a better receiver than yours."
06:39,780;06:40,780;"I'm sure."
06:40,780;06:41,280;"Yeah."
06:41,280;06:42,660;"That's how he responds to every moment."
06:42,660;06:45,780;"And it's become clear in all aspects of his life."
06:45,780;06:47,900;"Like if you have something to say,"
06:47,900;06:50,260;"I have a response, I'm coming for you."
06:50,260;06:53,420;"He also apparently runs like an epic soccer champ."
06:53,420;06:54,880;"- Realist soccer."
06:54,880;06:56,460;"- His kids play soccer."
06:56,460;06:57,780;"He's like super into it."
06:57,780;06:58,960;"- No shit. - Stay."
06:58,960;07:01,860;"- Pretty sweet."
07:01,860;07:05,860;"- So I just Googled like top Steve Smith,"
07:05,860;07:09,860;"best of Steve Smith seniors trash talk"
07:09,860;07:12,660;"on BaltimoreRavens.com of all websites."
07:12,660;07:13,700;"- Whatever."
07:13,700;07:15,900;"They can try to claim that ownership that they want."
07:15,900;07:17,820;"Yeah, well, I know."
07:17,820;07:21,220;"But the slide show, the number, the first slide is,"
07:21,220;07:23,140;"I look in the eyes of all my victims"
07:23,140;07:25,100;"before I take their lunch money."
07:25,100;07:27,140;"(laughs)"
07:27,140;07:28,140;"That sounds right."
07:28,140;07:29,140;"That sounds right."
07:29,140;07:30,980;"Yeah, it really does."
07:30,980;07:33,500;"And there's another one, I don't know what you're talking about,"
07:33,500;07:35,420;"but we're not on the same team anymore."
07:35,420;07:37,540;"So I'm gonna go try and knock his block off too."
07:37,540;07:39,300;"And when I get up, I'm gonna spin the football,"
07:39,300;07:41,100;"go back to the huddle and do it again."
07:41,100;07:44,900;"That's just media shit talking too."
07:44,900;07:48,900;"Yeah. Put your goggles on because it's going to be blood and guts everywhere."
07:48,900;07:54,740;"He said that about coming back to his first Panthers game. Oh, did he?"
07:54,740;08:00,180;"He wasn't happy about the way things ended. He was not wrong in the way he was treated by ownership."
08:00,180;08:02,620;"How did it end? I don't think I remember."
08:02,620;08:07,180;"They just didn't resign him and it was just like for a franchise icon, completely inexcusable."
08:07,180;08:11,140;"Wasn't it like he was too old and there's no step?"
08:11,980;08:13,700;"Cause there's a lot of quotes in here about like,"
08:13,700;08:16,400;"- Yeah, and then he went to Baltimore"
08:16,400;08:17,740;"and like had a thousand yard season."
08:17,740;08:18,900;"It was like, fuck everybody."
08:18,900;08:19,740;"- Yeah."
08:19,740;08:22,860;"- I remember that year."
08:22,860;08:24,060;"This is a good one."
08:24,060;08:26,000;"Honestly, I want your mom to be pissed off"
08:26,000;08:27,140;"when she sees on Sports Center"
08:27,140;08:28,860;"that I'm doing her son like dirt."
08:28,860;08:32,660;"- The difference like is,"
08:32,660;08:35,420;"is like, you have those players now,"
08:35,420;08:39,980;"like the guy from the Rams, the cornerback,"
08:41,300;08:43,700;"- You have the cocky guys."
08:43,700;08:44,540;"- Yeah, yeah."
08:44,540;08:45,900;"- Friends are the Sherman, the Richard Sherman,"
08:45,900;08:50,900;"but they don't feel as authentically psychopathic as Smith does."
08:50,900;08:56,580;"Like that's what's great about Smith is it's very genuine."
08:56,580;09:00,660;"You could tell it's not like he's just like playing a character."
09:00,660;09:03,340;"He is actually that fucking crazy."
09:03,340;09:05,180;"- Yeah, it was never for attention."
09:05,180;09:07,060;"It was not about spectacle."
09:07,060;09:08,820;"This was pre-social media."
09:08,820;09:11,700;"He like actually took all of this shit personally."
09:11,700;09:13,640;"And that was like his journey to the league, right?"
09:13,640;09:16,860;"He was like a special teams guy from like Utah"
09:16,860;09:18,180;"that nobody thought would make it."
09:18,180;09:20,060;"And like, you know, he's like one of those guys."
09:20,060;09:22,860;"He like, he like truly legit bought"
09:22,860;09:24,180;"and earned his spot in the league."
09:24,180;09:27,100;"And then I think truly felt disrespected"
09:27,100;09:28,580;"by everyone all the time."
09:28,580;09:30,260;"- It sure seems that way."
09:30,260;09:32,340;"And that's why I was saying like,"
09:32,340;09:33,940;"my comparison was Rodney Harrison"
09:33,940;09:37,300;"because I mean, Rodney Harrison was the king of"
09:37,300;09:38,540;"Nobody believes in us."
09:38,540;09:39,940;"We're playing with the chip in our shoulder"
09:39,940;09:41,220;"because everybody's talking shit"
09:41,220;09:42,980;"and we're going to prove the world wrong"
09:42,980;09:45,580;"and all that sort of crap."
09:45,580;09:48,820;"Even when they were in the midst of like a 20-something game"
09:48,820;09:52,140;"wind streak and nobody was doubting them."
09:52,140;09:53,420;"Is he in the hall of fame?"
09:53,420;09:55,020;"Steve Smith?"
09:55,020;09:56,100;"It's a good question."
09:56,100;09:57,220;"I don't think he's eligible yet."
09:57,220;09:59,180;"I was going to say, I think he's been retired line up."
09:59,180;10:00,620;"OK."
10:00,620;10:03,580;"He's one of those like borderline cases on the numbers."
10:03,580;10:06,500;"But I mean, I think I've made it clear"
10:06,500;10:08,100;"where my, my opinion lies."
10:08,100;10:09,660;"I think so too."
10:09,660;10:10,980;"I think you should get it."
10:10,980;10:15,020;"And I say in here you seventh in NFL career receiving yards."
10:15,020;10:17,300;"That's gotta be, that's gotta be a Hall of Famer."
10:17,300;10:21,340;"12th in receptions and 25th in touchdown."
10:21,340;10:22,180;"So it's gotta be."
10:22,180;10:25,420;"Yeah, that's pretty legit."
10:25,420;10:26,620;"What about Edelman then?"
10:26,620;10:28,420;"He also gets back."
10:28,420;10:30,500;"I'm in sneaky crazy too."
10:30,500;10:32,940;"Yeah, I think he's also got that chip on his show."
10:32,940;10:33,380;"He played."
10:33,380;10:36,460;"He didn't, he didn't say like he didn't talk the same way."
10:36,460;10:39,700;"that Steve Smith did, but I think he played the same way."
10:39,700;10:40,780;"Right."
10:40,780;10:41,540;"I agree."
10:41,540;10:46,060;"I always think back to, I think it was the Seattle Super Bowl"
10:46,060;10:51,300;"when they had like the mic up version and he like got crunched in a hit and he"
10:51,300;10:53,700;"got up laughing and goes, I love getting hit."
10:53,700;10:54,180;"Yeah."
10:54,180;10:55,540;"It's like that."
10:55,540;10:57,500;"That's just the fucking crazy man."
10:57,500;10:58,420;"That's a little too."
10:58,420;10:58,740;"Yeah."
10:58,740;11:03,020;"Or they he was saying something about how like he was on the bench mic up."
11:03,580;11:08,860;"And he's like, so my dad always said, growing up, when you have somebody on the ground, you've got to step on their throat."
11:08,860;11:15,780;"And then like later on, because back to me, he's like, that explains a lot about me, actually, really, doesn't it?"
11:15,780;11:18,580;"Apparently, I think his dad was a bit of a psycho, though."
11:18,580;11:19,180;"Not that he has."
11:19,180;11:22,380;"He makes a lot of sense."
11:22,380;11:27,580;"He seems a little more like social media savvy, though, and like kind of knows what he's doing."
11:27,580;11:30,740;"I mean, that could also just be a sign of the times, too, though, right?"
11:30,740;11:31,380;"That's true."
11:31,380;11:32,060;"That's true."
11:32,060;11:40,820;"But yeah, so Bobby, do you have any like just overall thoughts about this 2003 team?"
11:40,820;11:45,020;"Just memories generally about them?"
11:45,020;11:49,580;"Yeah, I mean, I mean, I remember this team so well."
11:49,580;11:52,740;"This was like such a watershed moment."
11:52,740;11:56,340;"I mean, for me, this was freshman year in college."
11:56,340;12:02,100;"And in the early days of the Panthers, I had not--"
12:02,100;12:07,220;"I didn't really get in on the team closely in '96 and all that."
12:07,220;12:09,380;"But a little bit later on high school"
12:09,380;12:11,100;"started too, because then this was like,"
12:11,100;12:13,620;"after we lost the Hornets, and the Panthers"
12:13,620;12:15,740;"were kind of the thing in town."
12:15,740;12:17,140;"Football was growing a little bit,"
12:17,140;12:19,260;"but I might have said this the last time."
12:19,260;12:23,820;"But it was still big time Red Skin's Cowboys territory,"
12:23,820;12:25,960;"which is why actually I've seen to remember"
12:25,960;12:27,800;"we trashed Dallas in the first round"
12:27,800;12:29,840;"during the stupid Quincy Carter days."
12:29,840;12:31,400;"It was such a satisfying victory"
12:31,400;12:34,440;"'cause the Cowboys fans were such obnoxious assholes."
12:34,440;12:37,080;"And we'd like smash them."
12:37,080;12:37,980;"I think we might've even,"
12:37,980;12:40,200;"we either shut them out or they don't score like three points."
12:40,200;12:42,200;"And it was just like fucking assholes."
12:42,200;12:43,280;"- 29s like 10s."
12:43,280;12:44,200;"- Apparently."
12:44,200;12:45,040;"- Yeah."
12:45,040;12:46,280;"- So I'll beat that."
12:46,280;12:49,760;"- Yeah, I mean this team it was like,"
12:49,760;12:51,960;"I mean the winning season came out of nowhere."
12:53,360;12:55,560;"You know, like you said, it's like we were total shit."
12:55,560;12:59,040;"And then 2001, John Fox takes over in 2002,"
12:59,040;13:01,360;"and immediately at least makes the franchise respectable."
13:01,360;13:03,760;"I think we went seven and nine the year before."
13:03,760;13:07,720;"And then was like, have the makings of a solid defense,"
13:07,720;13:09,440;"but like we're coming into that season."
13:09,440;13:12,640;"And it's like, Steve Smith, like this was his blow up season."
13:12,640;13:14,440;"Like you've been solid, Justin too."
13:14,440;13:16,960;"But like, he was just a returner before that."
13:16,960;13:20,280;"Lucid Muhammad was like a respectable veteran,"
13:20,280;13:22,560;"like he didn't blow up until really about this time."
13:22,560;13:24,900;"as like the legit number two receiver."
13:24,900;13:28,300;"We like signed Stephen Davis, I think,"
13:28,300;13:30,860;"from the Redskins, it's like this like slightly"
13:30,860;13:32,500;"over the hill work horseback,"
13:32,500;13:34,800;"but like nobody knew if he was gonna stay healthy."
13:34,800;13:38,540;"And then Rodney Pete was the starting quarterback"
13:38,540;13:39,700;"to start that season."
13:39,700;13:40,540;"- Rodney Pete."
13:40,540;13:43,540;"- And it's funny 'cause my,"
13:43,540;13:46,060;"the first game of that season we played the Jaguars"
13:46,060;13:48,540;"and my parents went to that game."
13:49,980;13:52,820;"And that was the game that, like,"
13:52,820;13:54,460;"I mean, to like Jake DeLone, remember,"
13:54,460;13:56,900;"this is fucking Jake DeLone, like,"
13:56,900;14:00,060;"coming out of nowhere, NFL, Europe, like,"
14:00,060;14:02,980;"on the practice squad, and then they put him at halftime"
14:02,980;14:05,820;"where religion to Jacksonville, he sparks the comeback,"
14:05,820;14:08,540;"and then wins the starting job week one."
14:08,540;14:10,420;"Like people were, I mean, my parents were buzzing"
14:10,420;14:11,820;"about it coming home, like people were Jack."
14:11,820;14:12,900;"The second half was awesome."
14:12,900;14:16,100;"This guy Jake DeLone, thumbs on, brings the comeback."
14:16,100;14:17,900;"And it just, it was one of those seasons, right?"
14:17,900;14:19,780;"where it's like this like scrappy kind of team"
14:19,780;14:21,380;"of no names comes together."
14:21,380;14:23,180;"And that was the vibe."
14:23,180;14:26,060;"But like, I mean, without that team,"
14:26,060;14:28,740;"I don't think the Panthers look like they do now."
14:28,740;14:33,740;"Like without that team to galvanize the fan base."
14:33,740;14:35,860;"Like, I don't know where things are at."
14:35,860;14:37,500;"I don't know if the team really gains momentum."
14:37,500;14:38,340;"Hell, who knows?"
14:38,340;14:39,340;"They might have gotten moved."
14:39,340;14:40,580;"Maybe it'll be a little dramatic,"
14:40,580;14:43,060;"but like they didn't accomplish much before that."
14:43,060;14:45,700;"And it's like, this season made the Panthers"
14:45,700;14:49,380;"like a legit thing in the region."
14:49,380;14:52,340;"And like, so it was a big deal."
14:52,340;14:54,620;"I mean, they won a lot of close games that season."
14:54,620;14:58,940;"Like I remember they weren't dominant, you know what I mean?"
14:58,940;15:00,340;"They won 11 to five."
15:00,340;15:02,420;"I mean, I'm pretty sure they like won a shitload"
15:02,420;15:05,380;"of like down to the wire games and close."
15:05,380;15:07,140;"And like it was like scrappy defense"
15:07,140;15:09,820;"and opportunistic offense and, you know,"
15:09,820;15:12,060;"kind of a like nobody believes in us attitude"
15:12,060;15:13,500;"the whole fucking way."
15:13,500;15:15,840;"And I don't think they were favored in any of their playoff games."
15:15,840;15:19,520;"Like even people were talking about Dallas beating us in the first round,"
15:19,520;15:21,200;"which is why it was so disrespectful."
15:21,200;15:23,760;"Cause Dallas was trash."
15:23,760;15:26,520;"They had five overtime games and one of them all."
15:26,520;15:27,960;"I know that was one."
15:27,960;15:33,160;"Apparently the loam had eight game winning drives in both quarter over time."
15:33,160;15:34,560;"Just an NFL record."
15:34,560;15:34,920;"Yeah."
15:34,920;15:35,960;"It was that kind of season."
15:35,960;15:40,840;"It didn't like come and you got a Deloam."
15:42,440;15:45,140;"I mean, I still got my somewhere in the closet."
15:45,140;15:46,940;"I, you know, I should have fucking worn it."
15:46,940;15:48,440;"Uh, maybe I'll go get it in a minute."
15:48,440;15:50,300;"I got a, I got a, I got the powder blue"
15:50,300;15:51,920;"to loam jersey in the closet somewhere."
15:51,920;15:54,200;"(laughing)"
15:54,200;15:55,260;"- That's a deep cut."
15:55,260;15:56,380;"I like that."
15:56,380;15:57,220;"- No, I mean,"
15:57,220;15:59,200;"- He's one of those guys you can't get his jersey"
15:59,200;16:01,060;"'cause he's such a fucking dork."
16:01,060;16:01,980;"(laughing)"
16:01,980;16:03,060;"- He looks like drugs."
16:03,060;16:04,080;"- Nope."
16:04,080;16:06,360;"Nope, but the thing you don't have to remember"
16:06,360;16:09,020;"is the whole franchise was a giant dork"
16:09,020;16:11,680;"and he, he did something special."
16:11,680;16:14,320;"So like, I don't, you say whatever you want about him."
16:14,320;16:18,000;"That guy, that guy's an important franchise player."
16:18,000;16:21,000;"But yeah, he's a nerd. He's a dork."
16:21,000;16:23,920;"Oh, totally. Totally. I'm like watching."
16:23,920;16:28,640;"I'd take like four players jerseys over his on this roster."
16:28,640;16:31,520;"Oh, name him."
16:31,520;16:38,440;"Julius Pepper, Steve Smith, Chris Jenkins, Ricky Manning."
16:38,440;16:40,560;"Boom. Ricky Manning."
16:40,560;16:43,160;"Yeah, Ricky Manning was awesome."
16:43,160;16:47,360;"Yeah, he was like low key contributor, glue guy."
16:47,360;16:48,360;"Uh-huh."
16:48,360;16:50,160;"Big play guy."
16:50,160;16:51,160;"Yeah."
16:51,160;16:52,760;"Play his best in the big games."
16:52,760;16:58,160;"I mean, all of this is true from a football nerd standpoint."
16:58,160;16:59,960;"But I don't know."
16:59,960;17:03,960;"So many of those moments, it's just like, this is a franchise that everything went wrong"
17:03,960;17:05,460;"for before him."
17:05,460;17:10,360;"And then, like, Deloam was the guy who, did anybody think he was a franchise quarterback?"
17:10,360;17:11,920;"- Nope."
17:11,920;17:13,720;"By the end of that season, did people trust him"
17:13,720;17:14,760;"to come through in the clutch?"
17:14,760;17:16,840;"Yes, and it was like a moment, you know what I mean?"
17:16,840;17:19,640;"It was like a, it was like a lenseality kind of moment"
17:19,640;17:20,720;"for a whole season."
17:20,720;17:24,320;"- He was only the second undrafted quarterback"
17:24,320;17:25,600;"to start in the Super Bowl."
17:25,600;17:27,920;"I think he probably still is, I would guess."
17:27,920;17:29,760;"- Was that after Kurt Warner?"
17:29,760;17:31,080;"- It was."
17:31,080;17:31,960;"- Yeah. - He got a lot of the,"
17:31,960;17:33,960;"a lot of the Kurt Warner comparisons that year."
17:33,960;17:35,240;"- Yeah."
17:35,240;17:38,960;"And like, I think you touched on it earlier, Jake,"
17:38,960;17:42,800;"alone was the backup for Amsterdam in the world football league."
17:42,800;17:44,760;"You know, who we backed up."
17:44,760;17:46,180;"Your Warner."
17:46,180;17:47,680;"Oh, I would have known this."
17:47,680;17:49,080;"It was car Warner."
17:49,080;17:50,040;"Yeah."
17:50,040;17:53,200;"I remember they had a connection from the NFL, Europe gig."
17:53,200;17:55,600;"The Amsterdam admirals."
17:55,600;17:59,960;"So the Amsterdam admirals are basically a quarterback factory is what we're saying."
17:59,960;18:00,300;"Yeah."
18:00,300;18:04,320;"I graduated of southwestern Louisiana."
18:04,320;18:07,240;"University, another powerhouse."
18:07,440;18:11,120;"college that does not exist. Well, I guess it does. It's you"
18:11,120;18:13,520;"all laugh yet now. They changed their name."
18:13,520;18:16,400;"That's why I thought they had become lucky. Yeah. Yeah."
18:16,400;18:21,920;"But yeah, I mean, then the playoff run, I mean, I was watching all these games on my college"
18:21,920;18:26,960;"dorm. And this kind of like helped set that like, I'm going to Davidson, right? So I'm like"
18:26,960;18:31,760;"literally 20 minutes out of Charlotte. But I'm going to college with a bunch of out-of-staters."
18:31,760;18:35,760;"Like my whole freshman hall is a bunch like New Jersey,"
18:35,760;18:38,720;"New England, Florida, like people are all over."
18:38,720;18:40,680;"And this like cemented me as like,"
18:40,680;18:43,160;"oh Bob's the like local guy who's like fucking crazy"
18:43,160;18:44,000;"about the pan."
18:44,000;18:45,840;"(laughing)"
18:45,840;18:47,440;"- You're that asshole."
18:47,440;18:48,680;"- Yeah."
18:48,680;18:49,520;"- That was a--"
18:49,520;18:51,880;"- Steve made a fucking friend group out of that."
18:51,880;18:54,360;"- Oh yeah."
18:54,360;18:57,440;"Just being like, oh, he's a boss, it's sports guy."
18:57,440;18:58,280;"- Yeah."
18:58,280;18:59,620;"- That was a good one."
18:59,620;19:04,420;"And here I am doing a fucking Patriots podcast for 65 fucking episodes."
19:04,420;19:05,540;"We're watching all these games."
19:05,540;19:06,420;"Yeah."
19:06,420;19:09,780;"Uh, I got a question about the loan."
19:09,780;19:17,340;"Um, based on the Wikipedia.com entry for the loan, it said, uh,"
19:17,340;19:21,580;"the loan is noted for licking his fingers before every play and sticking his"
19:21,580;19:28,620;"tongue out as part of his focus, which led him to be a Bojangles fried chicken."
19:29,460;19:33,420;"Uh, uh, representative, what do you ever want to call?"
19:33,420;19:34,900;"Like use it all the commercials."
19:34,900;19:35,460;"Yeah."
19:35,460;19:39,100;"Do you do you remember any of the Bojangles to loan commercials?"
19:39,100;19:43,220;"Oh, I was like waiting to be like, what's the question?"
19:43,220;19:44,460;"All of those things are just facts."
19:44,460;19:48,860;"And yes, I know it or Carolina."
19:48,860;19:52,260;"100% remember the Bojangles subscribe, uh, commercials."
19:52,260;19:53,140;"Awesome."
19:53,140;19:55,460;"I mean, I also liked no joke."
19:55,460;19:56,660;"Remember the tongue thing."
19:58,300;20:00,060;"I didn't notice it in this game."
20:00,060;20:03,500;"Dude, he looks like he's on drugs on multiple points in this game."
20:03,500;20:04,500;"Oh, yeah."
20:04,500;20:07,580;"He's like kind of wild-eyed at times."
20:07,580;20:13,400;"At one point, for years I had this DVD that was like, I got out of like the $10 bin at"
20:13,400;20:16,580;"Walmart once on a whim during like maybe later in college."
20:16,580;20:20,020;"And it was like one of those like Super Bowl highlights videos."
20:20,020;20:22,460;"And it like gave you like the spiel in every Super Bowl."
20:22,460;20:23,460;"Yeah."
20:23,460;20:28,060;"And for years, like the day of the Super Bowl, I would like make my roommates at the time"
20:28,060;20:29,800;"and watch it and like get hype."
20:29,800;20:33,740;"And I remember, I mean, I can vividly remember"
20:33,740;20:35,900;"all the highlights it had for this game,"
20:35,900;20:38,700;"which was the second to last game on the disc."
20:38,700;20:40,980;"The last game on the disc was the Eagle Super Bowl,"
20:40,980;20:41,980;"the next one."
20:41,980;20:45,060;"And, but like you can literally see him in the huddle"
20:45,060;20:46,860;"doing that crazy tongue out shit."
20:46,860;20:48,140;"Yeah, it was crazy."
20:48,140;20:50,020;"Some country bumpkin' crazy ass."
20:50,020;20:52,340;"- It was crazy 'cause, and,"
20:52,340;20:54,100;"but I think it was more of a good crazy"
20:54,100;20:56,380;"than like a Steve Smith scary crazy."
20:56,380;21:00,780;"Yeah, but there was one time where not to ruin anything,"
21:00,780;21:03,700;"but he threw a touchdown and he was running down"
21:03,700;21:05,500;"to celebrate it and Rodney Harrison"
21:05,500;21:07,380;"kind of like shoulder checked him."
21:07,380;21:09,900;"And he spun around and just started screaming"
21:09,900;21:11,100;"at Rodney Harrison."
21:11,100;21:12,580;"No idea what he was saying."
21:12,580;21:14,020;"- Sounds like a truck."
21:14,020;21:14,860;"- Yeah."
21:14,860;21:16,020;"- That's why I wrote that note that scene there."
21:16,020;21:18,620;"It looks like he's just on those guys he see"
21:18,620;21:20,060;"and raving by the 7-Eleven."
21:20,060;21:20,900;"- Yeah, that's what it looked like."
21:20,900;21:21,860;"Yeah."
21:21,860;21:22,700;"It looked like he was--"
21:22,700;21:23,540;"- But the other way."
21:23,540;21:24,540;"- Yeah."
21:24,540;21:25,380;"- Yep."
21:25,380;21:27,780;"Jesus to the field. It's great."
21:27,780;21:31,980;"Are you guys watching the Jake Dolan Bojangles commercials now?"
21:31,980;21:34,260;"No, I already watched them. They're awesome."
21:34,260;21:36,500;"I think we'll have to put them in the hazard one."
21:36,500;21:38,860;"Yeah, the Dix to hazard one sweet."
21:38,860;21:44,980;"But I mean, he was, I mean, you're talking to like a like underdog"
21:44,980;21:48,900;"upstart franchise in a region that hasn't had football."
21:48,900;21:53,140;"And here you have this guy who took him to the Super Bowl who say what you want"
21:53,140;21:56,300;"about him, he like bleeds authenticity."
21:56,300;21:57,820;"So people love that."
21:57,820;21:58,660;"That's true."
21:58,660;21:59,660;"Yeah, that is true."
21:59,660;22:01,580;"Like none of this shit was an act."
22:01,580;22:02,580;"He just was himself."
22:02,580;22:07,700;"You know, that's the it's kind of the vibes you got from Brady back in the day to like"
22:07,700;22:09,540;"I was thinking this a lot of came cool."
22:09,540;22:13,980;"He was kind of similar, like nerdy, aw, shucks kind of guy."
22:13,980;22:17,900;"That was like also a competitor when you put him on the field, but you get him off the field."
22:17,900;22:20,140;"He's like, oh, you know, my baby."
22:20,140;22:21,380;"Yeah, exactly."
22:21,380;22:21,700;"Yeah."
22:21,700;22:22,140;"Yeah."
22:22,140;22:25,420;"And he had more of the like quiet intensity on the field vibe."
22:25,420;22:29,940;"But like that also, yeah, in those days, red as authentic."
22:29,940;22:33,460;"Of course, now we know it's just, you know, associate path, but he's"
22:33,460;22:34,580;"like, he's definitely on drugs."
22:34,580;22:38,540;"Steve Smith is in one of these commercials."
22:38,540;22:40,620;"Oh boy, but I think it would."
22:40,620;22:44,980;"Yeah, Steve's great is strikes me as somebody who can't take a joke."
22:44,980;22:49,820;"Well, I also remember like moments like this, the Steve Smith"
22:49,820;22:52,340;"that Jake DeLone relationship was interesting"
22:52,340;22:55,460;"because they simultaneously had a ton of success together"
22:55,460;22:57,860;"and had a clear connection."
22:57,860;23:02,700;"And as Steve Smith's sort of like, as he hit his prime,"
23:02,700;23:04,780;"there was also this clear tension of like,"
23:04,780;23:07,020;"""Hey, motherfucker, if you would just be a little bit better,"
23:07,020;23:08,260;"I could do a lot more."""
23:08,260;23:09,340;"But he would just like,"
23:09,340;23:10,460;"they had the kind of relationship"
23:10,460;23:11,420;"where they would just go at it."
23:11,420;23:12,620;"Like Steve Smith would just tell him,"
23:12,620;23:16,100;"like, ""Motherfucker, you missed that throw in the huddle."""
23:16,100;23:19,140;"And they would just like, that was the relationship."
23:19,140;23:22,060;"But like, I think that like, that's what set the tone for the whole team."
23:22,060;23:27,740;"It was just like, we just like, it was like a very like a real vibe on that team."
23:27,740;23:37,500;"It seemed like another strength of this panthers team was their defensive line."
23:37,500;23:41,740;"Like I remember like, that's one of the few things I remember from like the"
23:41,740;23:46,860;"bill up to the game was just it was nonstop talk about how would the Patriots"
23:46,860;23:48,940;"offensive line handle this?"
23:48,940;23:52,740;"These absolute fucking monsters on the Panthers defense."
23:52,740;23:54,740;"Peppers and Mike Rucker on the end."
23:54,740;23:57,100;"Brinson Buckner and Chris Jenkins on the middle."
23:57,100;23:58,140;"Yeah, they were a force."
23:58,140;24:00,700;"Yeah, they really were."
24:00,700;24:05,260;"And I thought you kind of saw it early in this game too, where."
24:05,260;24:10,900;"Like Brady just had absolutely no time and the whole offensive line"
24:10,900;24:13,060;"of the Patriots getting pushed around."
24:13,060;24:15,900;"Yeah, the first the first half was low scoring, right?"
24:15,900;24:18,100;"Oh, yeah."
24:18,100;24:22,780;"At the first light, there's 21, 25 minutes."
24:22,780;24:23,820;"- That's right."
24:23,820;24:24,660;"- Yeah."
24:24,660;24:28,380;"- And then 24 points were scored right at the end of the half."
24:28,380;24:29,220;"- Oh, that's right."
24:29,220;24:31,580;"It was right before halftime things kind of lit up."
24:31,580;24:32,420;"- Yeah."
24:32,420;24:33,780;"And then nothing in the third quarter,"
24:33,780;24:35,260;"then the fourth quarter."
24:35,260;24:36,460;"- Yeah, back to the fourth."
24:36,460;24:37,380;"- Yeah."
24:37,380;24:38,220;"- Ton of points."
24:38,220;24:39,380;"- Well, it's supposed to be a boring game, right?"
24:39,380;24:42,340;"'Cause the Patriots were the defensive juggernaut"
24:42,340;24:46,140;"and the Panthers, it just come off a 14 to three win"
24:46,140;24:46,980;"against the Eagles."
24:46,980;24:53,620;"So the over under 38, which is, you know, you never see a 38 point over"
24:53,620;24:54,500;"under these days."
24:54,500;24:55,220;"Right."
24:55,220;24:59,460;"But yeah, I think people were had low expectations of what this super will be"
24:59,460;24:59,820;"like."
24:59,820;25:01,500;"Then the paths are seven point favorites."
25:01,500;25:04,260;"So it's like they weren't even expecting like a close game."
25:04,260;25:08,180;"They were thinking a low scoring Patriots win."
25:08,180;25:08,740;"Right."
25:08,740;25:09,180;"Yep."
25:09,180;25:10,380;"Exactly."
25:10,380;25:12,540;"And it was the complete opposite."
25:12,540;25:16,340;"It was a fucking shoot out that came down to the last play."
25:16,660;25:17,160;"Tom Brady."
25:17,160;25:18,160;"It was pretty awesome."
25:18,160;25:18,660;"It wasn't."
25:18,660;25:22,260;"It wasn't though, because like the first half was 1410."
25:22,260;25:23,420;"Yep."
25:23,420;25:26,740;"And actually after the third quarter, still 1410."
25:26,740;25:29,300;"And the other half that back and forth just"
25:29,300;25:30,860;"made him at the end."
25:30,860;25:32,180;"Yeah."
25:32,180;25:34,540;"So do we want to give this a watchability score, boys?"
25:34,540;25:35,660;"We haven't actually done that."
25:35,660;25:39,580;"We haven't actually said what the final score is either."
25:39,580;25:41,980;"Where from the nose we went in on the last minute field goal?"
25:41,980;25:42,420;"Yeah."
25:42,420;25:44,220;"3229, after all that."
25:44,220;25:49,100;"So 38 point over under and the pages almost covered that themselves as the Panthers."
25:49,100;25:56,260;"So nice high scoring game, even though 14, like I said, 14 10 going into that fourth quarter."
25:56,260;26:00,620;"There was one man, John Casey kicked it out of bounds."
26:00,620;26:02,100;"Five touchdowns."
26:02,100;26:03,900;"That final, that final kickoff."
26:03,900;26:04,980;"Yeah."
26:04,980;26:08,540;"And he was like, he was a really good kicker too."
26:08,540;26:08,980;"For you."
26:08,980;26:10,260;"I'll say no bad words about him."
26:10,260;26:12,260;"Another important man in the franchise."
26:12,260;26:14,180;"but what a tragic moment."
26:14,180;26:16,440;"It was kind of the opposite of Adam"
26:16,440;26:19,540;"Venetarian this game because Adam had"
26:19,540;26:22,560;"struggled all season with misses and"
26:22,560;26:25,240;"missed his first field goal and then"
26:25,240;26:26,420;"had a second one blocked."
26:26,420;26:28,340;"So it was 0 for 2 on the game and field"
26:28,340;26:29,340;"goals."
26:29,340;26:32,480;"And then it came down to him having to"
26:32,480;26:34,420;"kick his other field goals were actually"
26:34,420;26:35,920;"short at like 30 something yarders."
26:35,920;26:38,920;"This one was a 41 yard to win it."
26:38,920;26:41,620;"What a great example of how the"
26:41,620;26:44,260;"the the victor set the narrative."
26:44,260;26:46,860;"Cause like the pats lose that game,"
26:46,860;26:48,940;"Venetaries of fucking goat."
26:48,940;26:50,300;"Go. Yeah."
26:50,300;26:51,740;"And not in a good way."
26:51,740;26:53,020;"When you've been close."
26:53,020;26:53,740;"Yeah."
26:53,740;26:55,220;"Six add six points to that."
26:55,220;26:56,980;"It's true. Yeah."
26:56,980;26:57,980;"We're even three."
26:57,980;27:00,220;"Also a tough look for John Casey."
27:00,220;27:02,300;"Is did you see he had earplugs in?"
27:02,300;27:03,940;"Yeah."
27:03,940;27:07,820;"That is just for a kicker that it's just a tough look."
27:07,820;27:09,620;"That's a kicker thing."
27:09,620;27:12,020;"- You know, it's not even supposed to be that loud there."
27:12,020;27:13,700;"- Such a kicking thing."
27:13,700;27:18,100;"- I mean, I remember him as like a like pretty weird dude."
27:18,100;27:19,100;"- Really?"
27:19,100;27:20,300;"- He was also like old."
27:20,300;27:22,780;"- Yeah."
27:22,780;27:24,300;"- He like kicked for a long time."
27:24,300;27:27,140;"He had like a really long career, but like he was like,"
27:27,140;27:29,340;"I think he might've even been then at that time"
27:29,340;27:31,180;"one of the oldest guys on the team."
27:31,180;27:32,860;"- He was 34."
27:32,860;27:35,580;"He kicked for 20 years in the NFL."
27:35,580;27:38,580;"The rookie season was 1991."
27:38,580;27:40,780;"So yeah, he'd been around kicking up kicking."
27:40,780;27:43,340;"I have notes on that long snapper from the Patriots."
27:43,340;27:44,100;"Oh, that's right."
27:44,100;27:44,980;"Yeah."
27:44,980;27:47,420;"Speaking of old ass motherfuckers."
27:47,420;27:49,140;"Yeah, tell me about them."
27:49,140;27:51,140;"I said I read that."
27:51,140;27:52,740;"I think it's a sports illustrated piece."
27:52,740;27:53,220;"He should read."
27:53,220;27:55,140;"I got a quick cliff notes version,"
27:55,140;27:57,900;"but if you have time, you should definitely read it."
27:57,900;28:01,460;"He had snapped for bill of check in Cleveland."
28:01,460;28:03,540;"Had been retired for like three years"
28:03,540;28:06,780;"and was teaching third grade or second grade in Louisiana."
28:06,780;28:13,100;"And then they brought him up right before the playoffs."
28:13,100;28:15,860;"Right, because the Patriots long snapper got hurt."
28:15,860;28:19,140;"And so they brought in the backup and he got hurt too."
28:19,140;28:20,780;"So they just didn't have a long snapper."
28:20,780;28:22,620;"So Louis signed this guy off the street, right?"
28:22,620;28:26,260;"Yeah, but from like Bellagetex Cleveland days."
28:26,260;28:27,780;"So you got to love that ship."
28:27,780;28:29,500;"There's nothing better about sports."
28:29,500;28:33,300;"I want to I want to I wish I could do that as a principal."
28:33,300;28:36,220;"I wish I could be like this teacher's on leave."
28:36,220;28:38,180;"this backup sucks."
28:38,180;28:41,220;"I'm literally calling somebody I know from college."
28:41,220;28:44,140;"I need you in here to teach seventh grade science"
28:44,140;28:45,860;"for six weeks."
28:45,860;28:47,860;"We're on the verge of a major breakthrough."
28:47,860;28:48,940;"You're a part of the team."
28:48,940;28:51,220;"Here's a Jersey."
28:51,220;28:52,060;"A lot of pressure."
28:52,060;28:52,900;"You're a Jersey's."
28:52,900;28:53,740;"A lot of pressure."
28:53,740;28:58,580;"He's like taking camcorders around the Patriots facility"
28:58,580;29:00,220;"and it's experiencing mailing them back"
29:00,220;29:02,380;"to his secondary classroom in Louisiana."
29:02,380;29:05,100;"I would love to see those things by the way."
29:05,100;29:05,600;"Right."
29:05,600;29:06,100;"That's right."
29:06,100;29:06,600;"Awesome."
29:06,600;29:07,600;"Oh, man."
29:07,600;29:09,100;"I wonder if we can get ahold of these guys."
29:09,100;29:09,600;"Yep."
29:09,600;29:11,600;"Right before the Super Bowl."
29:11,600;29:14,000;"And he like, he's got to save his life."
29:14,000;29:15,800;"Yeah."
29:15,800;29:16,800;"He's skipping them all."
29:16,800;29:18,800;"And if you look closer, there's a couple of skips,"
29:18,800;29:20,200;"snaps in this game on punts."
29:20,200;29:21,000;"On punts, yeah."
29:21,000;29:21,500;"That's right."
29:21,500;29:24,400;"I feel goals."
29:24,400;29:27,400;"So he's like up all night, the night before the game,"
29:27,400;29:33,100;"snapping into a pillow goes to the meal before the game,"
29:33,100;29:36,620;"tries to cut a dinner roll with a steak knife and fucking gets three"
29:36,620;29:41,980;"stitches, cuts his fucking hand for the Super Bowl, the meal, the"
29:41,980;29:42,700;"morning of."
29:42,700;29:44,420;"Bro, get it together."
29:44,420;29:45,260;"Oh, yeah."
29:45,260;29:46,620;"So he's already got the yips."
29:46,620;29:49,620;"Vellichek's pissed at him, but there's nobody else to replace him."
29:49,620;29:50,020;"Yeah."
29:50,020;29:54,460;"Then he cuts his hand at the dinner the day before the morning of."
29:54,460;29:56,700;"This is my nightmare."
29:56,700;30:01,500;"And so he was like, please score a touchdown."
30:01,500;30:04,500;"And then the Panthers came back and scored another touchdown."
30:04,500;30:07,500;"So then he was just flipping shit when they got out."
30:07,500;30:09,500;"When they had the field goal to win it."
30:09,500;30:13,500;"And he's like, look, you know, if I'm going to go out, I'm going to go out guns firing."
30:13,500;30:18,500;"So I'd rather snap it over the guys head entirely than just like dribble that doesn't get there."
30:18,500;30:21,500;"So you ended up crushing it."
30:21,500;30:22,500;"Perfect snap."
30:22,500;30:23,500;"The only one he needed."
30:23,500;30:25,500;"Rest of dinner really matter."
30:25,500;30:30,500;"Cause not like Ken Walter was going to put a good punts together, even if you did snap it to him."
30:30,500;30:31,500;"to him."
30:31,500;30:32,500;"It's true."
30:32,500;30:37,540;"But he had played with Ken Walter in Cleveland as well, so they'd known each other from way"
30:37,540;30:38,540;"back when."
30:38,540;30:39,540;"Oh my God."
30:39,540;30:40,540;"Yeah."
30:40,540;30:42,740;"Because Bell check was a coach that I'm like late a year, he was early night."
30:42,740;30:44,540;"This is not recent."
30:44,540;30:45,540;"Yeah."
30:45,540;30:46,540;"Ridiculous times."
30:46,540;30:47,540;"Jesus."
30:47,540;30:51,900;"His brother is a NFL receiver, Todd Kitchen."
30:51,900;30:52,900;"I think the Cardinals."
30:52,900;30:55,140;"Todd Kitchen, I recognize that name."
30:55,140;30:57,940;"Not, not anymore, but."
30:57,940;31:06,560;"And then he worked as a college analyst and retired after explaining that receivers make"
31:06,560;31:08,920;"catches with their hands because they can crest the ball."
31:08,920;31:12,000;"He added that's kind of gay, but hey, whatever."
31:12,000;31:14,000;"Who is this?"
31:14,000;31:16,000;"Is this the one?"
31:16,000;31:17,000;"His brother?"
31:17,000;31:18,000;"Yeah, God."
31:18,000;31:32,640;"It's like the guy for the, so I speak in Carolina, the hurricane's goalie, the emergency goalie,"
31:32,640;31:34,080;"it was like the equipment manager."
31:34,080;31:35,080;"Oh, yeah."
31:35,080;31:36,080;"Yeah."
31:36,080;31:39,000;"I'm trying to look it up right now."
31:39,000;31:43,960;"This was like recently and he pitched like a shutout basically, right?"
31:43,960;31:45,720;"He got into the game."
31:45,720;31:46,720;"Yeah."
31:46,720;31:50,720;"And was just like stone walling, whoever they're playing the blues or someone."
31:50,720;31:51,720;"I'll try and find it."
31:51,720;31:53,720;"Yeah, I remember that guy."
31:53,720;31:59,720;"Yeah, there's a lot of those just like stories that are under the radar that you don't even"
31:59,720;32:01,720;"realize are happening."
32:01,720;32:02,720;"Yeah."
32:02,720;32:08,720;"I mean, because wasn't there a thing with the Panthers running backs to?"
32:08,720;32:14,720;"I remember Stephen Davis went down in the Rams game and got hurt."
32:14,720;32:20,120;"And then who was the Sean Foster? Yes, the Sean Foster. That's right."
32:20,120;32:25,360;"It was always kind of the like change of pace back. Yeah, he's kind of like the"
32:25,360;32:30,720;"Kevin Falk of the Panthers, I would say. Yeah, but you like a third down right?"
32:30,720;32:34,280;"Never quite lived up to the hype, but he had his moments."
32:34,280;32:40,040;"Yeah, the sweet TD in this game. I thought so. He had to like reaching over the pile on TD, didn't he?"
32:40,040;32:45,080;"Yeah, we thought he out of down your ends like two guys and then burst out of it and yeah"
32:45,080;32:48,520;"Yeah, they showed a stat where"
32:48,520;32:55,820;"The Patriots hadn't given up a touchdown all season of more than 30 yards and they did it twice in this game"
32:55,820;32:58,420;"Mmm, and that was one of them was that"
32:58,420;33:03,400;"That just Sean Foster touched out. Yeah. I mean that was the character of that team. It was just like"
33:04,200;33:07,360;"Back against the wall not everything is gonna go right"
33:07,360;33:09,620;"We're not the best team of the field in a lot of games"
33:09,620;33:12,900;"But somebody's gonna step up when needed and make a play"
33:12,900;33:19,400;"Yes, they just didn't make one more play enough in this game Bobby. Yeah, I mean what'll haunt me forever is"
33:19,400;33:21,400;"I mean at the end of the day"
33:21,400;33:26,960;"If John Casey doesn't kick that that ball at a bounds, I mean I"
33:26,960;33:32,900;"Feel like momentum was swinging our way like I'll take that game to overtime any fucking day"
33:33,680;33:39,440;"All roll that I would have rolled the dice on overtime in that game any fucking day come on John and Casey"
33:39,440;33:44,480;"Come on seriously you can't get out of bounds and gave Brady 30 yards to go. God damn it"
33:44,480;33:46,480;"This is Tom Brady. He was gonna do that anyway"
33:46,480;33:49,480;"True. Yeah, I mean"
33:49,480;33:58,080;"But not then yes in in 2015 sure but 2003 Tom Brady not in that game"
33:58,080;34:03,240;"That's not what that game felt like I don't know. I think the Rams felt the same way"
34:03,240;34:08,640;"Yeah, and I think you've got their fucking throats and double overtime. That's true"
34:08,640;34:10,860;"But I mean you can say that but like"
34:10,860;34:17,660;"The Patriots had driven down the fields the last three foreign Tom Brady like 350 yards passing at that point"
34:17,660;34:23,160;"Yeah, guys we can agree to disagree on this both teams where we're picking up yards and chunks at this point"
34:23,160;34:25,700;"We can agree to disagree. I'm just saying fall on a part"
34:25,700;34:29,380;"I'm just saying that game should have gone to overtime and I like their chances"
34:29,380;34:32,700;"Yes, it played a lot over time games right here. Yeah, exactly"
34:32,700;34:38,500;"But I mean, you say that, but the Patriots also coming into this, they were what?"
34:38,500;34:40,940;"16 wins in a row or something."
34:40,940;34:45,980;"And they had won all of those games except for one by less than seven points."
34:45,980;34:46,980;"Mmm."
34:46,980;34:50,140;"Both teams were teams that knew how to win close."
34:50,140;34:53,020;"The teams were, the teams were like more similar than they appeared."
34:53,020;34:54,020;"Yeah."
34:54,020;34:55,020;"At face value."
34:55,020;34:56,020;"For sure."
34:56,020;34:57,020;"Absolutely."
34:57,020;35:01,420;"Kind of that strong veteran defense almost have felt like with in the past overcoming"
35:01,420;35:05,820;"all those injuries. Yeah. Yeah. That was incredible early this year. That's right. Yeah."
35:05,820;35:11,020;"There was some down there still just reeling off wins. There was some stat where the Patriots"
35:11,020;35:18,460;"were leading the league in most different starters with like 40 something and they showed"
35:18,460;35:23,660;"a list of all the other teams who had led the league in starters. And I think the most wins"
35:23,660;35:29,420;"on the season was four for those teams that that suffered that many injuries and had to start so"
35:29,420;35:33,520;"so many players and the Patriots went, what, would they go this season?"
35:33,520;35:34,280;"I don't even remember."
35:34,280;35:37,320;"Well, 14 and two."
35:37,320;35:42,840;"So just like figuring out how to plug guys in and it all worked out."
35:42,840;35:50,560;"Um, but I think the one guy that they couldn't plug and play was, uh,"
35:50,560;35:55,440;"Rodney Harrison actually who this was one of my memorable moments from the"
35:55,440;36:00,520;"game where he was, he made it's in the fourth quarter at some point."
36:00,520;36:05,620;"Oh, it was, it was on that last, uh, Caroline touchdown drive where"
36:05,620;36:12,180;"Rodney made the tackle of the running back and apparently like broke his arm"
36:12,180;36:14,140;"or like separated shoulders and like that."
36:14,140;36:15,700;"I can't remember what exactly what the injury was."
36:15,700;36:16,440;"Greg, do you remember?"
36:16,440;36:19,080;"I do not remember."
36:19,080;36:23,780;"I just remember him being in the sling, um, after the game, but so he broke his"
36:23,780;36:27,380;"arm, but Caroline was running the no huddle so he couldn't get off the field."
36:27,380;36:31,540;"So he was then in coverage on the next play on, I think it was a tight end."
36:31,540;36:34,180;"And they threw it to him, the tight end caught the ball and he had to make the"
36:34,180;36:38,940;"tackle out of bounds with a broken arm and still managed to make the play and"
36:38,940;36:43,580;"then just kind of like laid there out of bounds, which is like one."
36:43,580;36:47,740;"And then I remember there was some camera shot of him coming out like"
36:47,740;36:51,580;"after the confetti was falling in a sling and he's just like covered in confetti."
36:51,580;36:54,180;"He's like crying because it's Rodney Harrison"
36:54,180;36:55,660;"and he just runs on emotion."
36:55,660;37:00,500;"So, but as soon as he went out after that,"
37:00,500;37:02,320;"the Panthers are just like,"
37:02,320;37:04,020;"oh, well, whoever that new guy is,"
37:04,020;37:06,140;"which I didn't even recognize who he was."
37:06,140;37:07,300;"Like number 29 or something,"
37:07,300;37:10,940;"I couldn't even figure out who he was on the game sheet."
37:10,940;37:13,220;"But he was not good."
37:13,220;37:15,460;"And the pages just picked him apart"
37:15,460;37:17,400;"with Ricky Pearl of all people."
37:18,940;37:22,180;"Ricky Pro, another key member of that scrappy team."
37:22,180;37:28,340;"Yeah, I mean, and he was he was one of those guys who always seemed to show up"
37:28,340;37:32,980;"against the Patriots and Super Bowls because this was actually going to be one"
37:32,980;37:36,940;"of my bests at the end, but I'll put it in here because it fits."
37:36,940;37:41,500;"He in this game caught the tying touchdown."
37:41,500;37:43,900;"Like the time he came up with less than two minutes left."
37:43,900;37:48,260;"Um, and he also did the exact same thing when he was a member of the Rams."
37:48,780;37:53,580;"in Super Bowl 36. He was the one that caught the tying touchdown with under two minutes left."
37:53,580;37:56,620;"And then the Patriots did what they did then as well."
37:56,620;37:57,420;"Yeah."
37:57,420;38:03,180;"So Ricky Prol, I think he may have also been the guy at the beginning of the Rams Super Bowl."
38:03,180;38:05,420;"Do you believe tonight a dynasty is born?"
38:05,420;38:06,140;"Yes he is."
38:06,140;38:06,620;"Yep."
38:06,620;38:09,500;"Just didn't realize which team he was talking about at the time."
38:09,500;38:11,820;"He must hate the Patriots. He really must."
38:11,820;38:15,500;"Yeah. Also, well, because he's just next to"
38:16,940;38:19,540;"Ricky Prole on my list here of Panthers players."
38:19,540;38:21,460;"Bobby, do you have any."
38:21,460;38:25,060;"Feelings one way or another on Jermaine Wiggins."
38:25,060;38:27,500;"Nope."
38:27,500;38:28,460;"Zero feelings."
38:28,460;38:31,660;"He was one of those guys that floated in the background for a while."
38:31,660;38:35,420;"Another guy who like always kind of flashed like maybe he'll be kind of good."
38:35,420;38:36,420;"And no."
38:36,420;38:40,540;"Yeah, because he was a former patriot and that's how we felt about him too."
38:40,540;38:46,540;"And now he's like on one of the sports radio morning shows."
38:46,540;38:47,540;"Mm."
38:47,540;38:48,540;"Wiggy."
38:48,540;38:49,540;"Good for him."
38:49,540;38:50,540;"He is unlistenable."
38:50,540;38:55,780;"Yeah, I didn't know he was in this game."
38:55,780;38:56,780;"For the Panthers, yeah."
38:56,780;38:57,780;"Yeah."
38:57,780;38:59,980;"He had a couple of catches like right the end there."
38:59,980;39:00,980;"Yeah."
39:00,980;39:04,540;"He used one that hurtles Gene Wilson, Greg's boy."
39:04,540;39:05,540;"Yeah."
39:05,540;39:07,820;"Wilson did not have a good game in this game."
39:07,820;39:09,820;"Sorry to say Greg."
39:09,820;39:10,820;"It's okay."
39:10,820;39:11,820;"No comment."
39:11,820;39:12,820;"That sounds okay."
39:12,820;39:13,820;"He doesn't."
39:13,820;39:14,820;"Does he?"
39:14,820;39:15,820;"No comment."
39:15,820;39:17,820;"Fair enough."
39:17,820;39:23,140;"'Cause he's the one that got beat on the 85 yard touchdown."
39:23,140;39:26,940;"- Oh yeah, the longest play in Super Bowl history."
39:26,940;39:27,940;"- Is it still?"
39:27,940;39:28,780;"- Yes, I looked it up."
39:28,780;39:31,140;"- No, longest play from scrimmage it has to be"
39:31,140;39:33,380;"because our mom is a touchdown, I guess."
39:33,380;39:34,540;"- Mm, it is."
39:34,540;39:36,140;"- No, because the Patriots,"
39:36,140;39:40,180;"their Super Bowl 97 gave up like a 99 yard kick return"
39:40,180;39:42,740;"to whoever that Green Bay Packers returner was."
39:42,740;39:43,580;"- Does not matter."
39:43,580;39:45,220;"- Doesn't matter, yeah."
39:45,220;39:47,340;"Okay, kick returns."
39:47,340;39:50,300;"As Greg has said, special teams aren't really a part of the game,"
39:50,300;39:51,620;"so that doesn't count."
39:51,620;39:53,940;"That's true."
39:53,940;40:04,220;"Yeah, it was definitely the longest something at the time it happened."
40:04,220;40:07,740;"It is still the longest touchdown pass or run in Super Bowl history."
40:07,740;40:08,740;"Yeah."
40:08,740;40:15,180;"Against one of the historic best defenses in the National Football League."
40:15,180;40:17,900;"Well, the London even complete 50% of his passes."
40:17,900;40:18,740;"No."
40:18,740;40:22,460;"No, he started off terribly in this game."
40:22,460;40:24,300;"I think I was trying to keep track."
40:24,300;40:29,380;"They didn't actually have positive offensive yards"
40:29,380;40:33,380;"with five minutes left in the in the second half in the second quarter."
40:33,380;40:36,340;"Yeah, the beginning of the game was brutal."
40:36,340;40:41,860;"Yeah, he was one for nine for one yard with two minutes left in the second quarter"
40:41,860;40:44,900;"and like three sacks or something like that."
40:44,900;40:47,620;"So he had a negative passing yards."
40:47,620;40:48,940;"Classic Jake Dylan."
40:48,940;40:49,340;"Yeah."
40:49,340;40:51,780;"So, I mean, what did he finish with?"
40:51,780;40:53,620;"He finished with probably a few hundred yards."
40:53,620;40:54,620;"Oh, yeah."
40:54,620;40:59,100;"Twenty three, twenty yards over twenty yards per completion, 16 completions for"
40:59,100;41:00,380;"three hundred and twenty three yards."
41:00,380;41:00,980;"Jesus."
41:00,980;41:01,820;"Three touchdowns."
41:01,820;41:04,740;"Four sacks, one of which was a fumble which he lost."
41:04,740;41:06,460;"You got to think the man can live with that."
41:06,460;41:08,700;"That's that's how he showed up in the Super Bowl."
41:08,700;41:09,540;"You got to think."
41:09,540;41:14,660;"You know, he's got some nice horses and mophets in Louisiana."
41:14,660;41:17,240;"somewhere and he's his mind is at peace."
41:17,240;41:19,360;"You would have to think so, yeah."
41:19,360;41:23,000;"Because I mean, they didn't have really any offense going."
41:23,000;41:24,840;"They couldn't get the running game going either."
41:24,840;41:27,000;"Stephen Davis was he had a bad day."
41:27,000;41:29,760;"No, and they were they were really run oriented team."
41:29,760;41:30,440;"Right."
41:30,440;41:30,800;"Exactly."
41:30,800;41:31,680;"And they kept trying it."
41:31,680;41:35,880;"Stephen Davis, 13 carries 49 yards with a longest of 21."
41:35,880;41:36,220;"So."
41:36,220;41:38,280;"Yeah, not not great."
41:38,280;41:42,160;"And then to Sean Foster, three carries, 43 yards."
41:42,160;41:43,940;"But one of those was a 33 yard touchdown."
41:44,520;41:50,040;"Yeah, this was really before the era when you're tossing a lot of past us to your you're running back. Yeah"
41:50,040;41:54,040;"So it was it was mainly jaked alone to"
41:54,040;41:56,600;"Steve Smith and"
41:56,600;41:59,800;"Mushin Hamad. Can we talk about Anton Smith's stat line by the way?"
41:59,800;42:02,520;"26 carries"
42:02,520;42:07,960;"26 carries 83 yards of the touchdown touchdown. Hell yeah, I went in this. Yeah, I know"
42:07,960;42:14,220;"He was sneaky good in this game. He was yeah, the the pages running game was actually because it started off real slow"
42:14,220;42:21,220;"But Antoine Smith again, we've said it last couple of weeks is running like it's 2001 again because he is big"
42:21,220;42:27,080;"Like the wheel had fallen off through the regular season. I don't know if they were saving them or what but"
42:27,080;42:30,500;"He was actually running it relatively effectively in this game"
42:30,500;42:34,280;"Especially against that D line to everyone thought they were absolutely tested could have run it all year"
42:34,280;42:36,940;"Yeah, and then the dancers have a monster D line"
42:36,940;42:41,100;"And we get 83 yards in a touchdown huge. Yeah"
42:41,100;42:43,820;"quick question on"
42:43,820;42:48,380;"what your boys thought about our Lord and Savior Troy Brown in this game."
42:48,380;42:50,260;"Oh, big Troy Brown game."
42:50,260;42:52,600;"You know, this is a big game for both my favorite receivers."
42:52,600;42:54,060;"Troy and David Gibbons."
42:54,060;42:56,460;"David, David Gibbons had a, had a good game."
42:56,460;43:01,740;"I mean, Deon Branch had the numbers, 10 catches, 143 yards in the touchdown."
43:01,740;43:06,380;"Yeah, it didn't seem like Deon, Deon seemed like the third best receiver out there."
43:06,380;43:07,620;"Yeah."
43:07,620;43:11,680;"And the commentators were talking about how he was the, he was Brady's new"
43:11,680;43:12,940;"like favorite target."
43:12,940;43:18,700;"which everyone's like, you know, you'd expect it to be Troy Brown, but Brady says it's"
43:18,700;43:24,620;"Dion branch because, you know, for whatever reason, he's small, but he's strong. And then"
43:24,620;43:31,580;"you get to the last drive of the game and it's incomplete to Dion branch, Brady to Troy"
43:31,580;43:38,220;"Brown, Brady to Troy Brown, Brady to Graham, and then Brady to branch. So yeah, well,"
43:38,220;43:43,980;"You're just discounting the most important player that drive is Brady to branch. Yeah, that's right Greg has got a good"
43:43,980;43:49,100;"That's the game that won the Super Bowl a day. Yeah, but if you look at that play"
43:49,100;43:54,620;"Are they're both on the same side. They were both wide open so he could have hit"
43:54,620;44:00,540;"He's a wide he throw at the branch is because his favorite player you're gonna say that open deeper down the field Brady's"
44:00,540;44:03,580;"Brady's favorite player is not dictated by Brady"
44:03,580;44:08,420;"It's up to him who is favorite players and he told the commentators it was branch"
44:08,420;44:12,000;"Yeah, and I disagree and you disagree with Brady"
44:12,000;44:18,900;"As to who Brady's favorite players. Well, I think about branches stat lines in his two Super Bowls here back to back years"
44:18,900;44:25,000;"Yeah, that's pretty crazy 10 catches 142 to touchdown this one and then he wins MVP in the next one. Yeah"
44:25,000;44:29,220;"Yeah, I think he sets the the record for catches in the next one was not what it is"
44:29,220;44:32,220;"Something like that in the Super Bowl. Yeah"
44:32,220;44:33,220;"Yeah."
44:33,220;44:38,820;"Oh yeah, there's some good, uh, good wide receiver play on both ends of the ball."
44:38,820;44:39,820;"Right."
44:39,820;44:40,820;"Like on both sides."
44:40,820;44:41,820;"Yeah."
44:41,820;44:42,820;"Like that."
44:42,820;44:43,820;"Yeah."
44:43,820;44:45,700;"It was because usually you see the Patriots kind of spread the ball around."
44:45,700;44:49,460;"Um, and Brady's favorite receiver is the open one, but in this one, it was pretty much all"
44:49,460;44:50,460;"wide receivers."
44:50,460;44:54,660;"I thought it really was, uh, into like a lot of screen or any bubble screens."
44:54,660;44:56,220;"Either it was all passes down the field."
44:56,220;44:57,660;"Yeah, which was very unusual."
44:57,660;45:01,780;"And it sounded like, and Bob, correct me if I'm wrong."
45:01,780;45:06,420;"It sounds like the Panthers relied on a lot of screens"
45:06,420;45:08,620;"in the regular season as well,"
45:08,620;45:10,360;"similar to the Patriots offense."
45:10,360;45:14,220;"- Yeah, I think there were a lot of similarities."
45:14,220;45:20,700;"Like they were running team and then,"
45:20,700;45:21,620;"I mean, they lived on,"
45:21,620;45:23,500;"they made their money on play action"
45:23,500;45:25,740;"and like Steve Smith bailing them the fuck out,"
45:25,740;45:27,820;"you know, and doing pulling out crazy shit."
45:27,820;45:29,140;"- Yeah, so very similar."
45:29,140;45:32,540;"There's a, there's some I wrote down from the first quarter."
45:32,540;45:34,820;"It was third and six and they ran the ball."
45:34,820;45:41,220;"And, and Sim said, I know it's not exciting to watch, but it's kind of fun."
45:41,220;45:45,820;"And I was like, well, no, it's not exciting and it's not fun either."
45:45,820;45:48,100;"Oh, we go into the commentators."
45:48,100;45:54,220;"Also pre-saging Phil Sims, eventually getting the axe for being fucking boring as hell."
45:54,220;45:55,580;"Yeah, he was pretty bad."
45:57,220;45:59,460;"I don't know. He called Julius Peppers being a beast."
45:59,460;46:02,500;"I mean, Julius Peppers is a second overall pick."
46:02,500;46:04,300;"Yeah, it's not really a reach."
46:04,300;46:07,460;"But I thought you would have been up about him"
46:07,460;46:09,700;"and roasting Bill Belichick's Squib kick decision."
46:09,700;46:12,220;"He donned. That was a terrible decision."
46:12,220;46:13,980;"And he was a kick."
46:13,980;46:16,020;"He was pretty butter about that."
46:16,020;46:17,780;"Yeah, I'm sure you were too."
46:17,780;46:19,780;"I was too. Yeah, I was dumb."
46:19,780;46:21,740;"You should take Belichick to task for that, dude."
46:21,740;46:23,060;"Yeah, give it to us."
46:23,060;46:25,940;"Give us give us the Greg Brown Bell check hate minute."
46:26,460;46:34,400;"Well, what was how much time was that there's like 15 seconds left in the half you just you just gone up 14 to 7"
46:34,400;46:42,400;"The Panthers have been like absolutely dominated the whole half with the like the two minute warning. They had like zero total yards"
46:42,400;46:43,380;"Yeah"
46:43,380;46:48,560;"The one was like one of nine up to that point like you had absolutely ship pumped them the whole half"
46:48,560;46:52,280;"And it was 14 to 7 and for some reason instead of just kicking it deep"
46:52,340;46:57,620;"They do this stupid squib kick which gets returned to like midfield one play later"
46:57,620;47:01,600;"It's a 50-hour field goal, and it's good and then go and momentum"
47:01,600;47:03,600;"I think you're kind of"
47:03,600;47:09,120;"Glossing over the fact that that one play was just like a run up the middle the Patriots just did not defend"
47:09,120;47:17,280;"Well, if that play happens from your 20 yard line, it doesn't matter like when does a kick ever get to the fucking 50 yard line?"
47:17,280;47:20,480;"That's fair play the odds play the numbers. It doesn't make any sense"
47:20,900;47:24,880;"Do your job, Bellaget, as some would say we've seen"
47:24,880;47:31,360;"The Colts kick off to the Patriots in this exact situation in Bethel Johnson takes to the house. That's a good point Andy"
47:31,360;47:38,020;"So I think he is playing the numbers as long as that doesn't happen. We're okay. Feel go. Yeah, okay. We're still winning"
47:38,020;47:42,040;"You think he's okay with giving a feel go there"
47:42,040;47:48,880;"Probably not but I think he in the in the moment that decision was the right decision because there's the least amount of chance of"
47:49,320;47:53,160;"All right, let's talk about the other big coaching decision here in this game"
47:53,160;47:56,860;"And I want to get Bobby's thoughts on this was the Panthers going for two"
47:56,860;48:00,480;"Somewhat early in the fourth quarter because Phil Sims hated that"
48:00,480;48:04,160;"Sims hated it. I was like the first thing he said at the end of the game was like well"
48:04,160;48:06,360;"I'll be second guessing that I was like, yeah"
48:06,360;48:09,200;"Back to shit on him again"
48:09,200;48:14,600;"So let's set it up right it's 12 48 left in the fourth quarter"
48:15,360;48:20,420;"The Sean Foster's sick ass touchdown makes it 21 16"
48:20,420;48:23,280;"Yeah"
48:23,280;48:28,960;"Yeah, I think all three time outs left. So it was a fair whole quarter to play a lot of football left. Yeah"
48:28,960;48:35,120;"Kicking it puts you down what for three go for two and within three"
48:35,120;48:38,040;"So they go for two and don't get it. So they're down"
48:38,040;48:40,320;"five"
48:40,320;48:42,240;"- Correct. - I mean, there's two schools"
48:42,240;48:44,960;"I thought here, like there's the school thought of like,"
48:44,960;48:47,360;"don't go for two until you have to."
48:47,360;48:52,200;"But in the context of this game, I have mixed feelings."
48:52,200;48:54,160;"In the context of this game, I kind of liked it"
48:54,160;48:57,720;"because I was just like, your point scoring opportunities"
48:57,720;49:00,520;"have been really limited so far, maximize them,"
49:00,520;49:02,160;"get within three, hell yeah."
49:02,160;49:07,280;"So I think it made sense ultimately that said,"
49:08,480;49:13,240;"The other part of my brain says, motherfuckers, you don't have an offense to get a two point"
49:13,240;49:14,720;"conversion in this game."
49:14,720;49:16,720;"And they didn't."
49:16,720;49:18,220;"That's true."
49:18,220;49:20,560;"You weren't like this ain't Philly special."
49:20,560;49:23,120;"You didn't have a play in your back pocket."
49:23,120;49:31,320;"And so it was maybe, maybe sort of like from a strategic standpoint, the right call except"
49:31,320;49:33,720;"you weren't equipped to win on it."
49:33,720;49:35,720;"So I don't know."
49:35,720;49:38,240;"Yeah, the play does not look good."
49:38,240;49:44,280;"of having to play in the pocket. Oh, I know. Great. Yeah. That's the difference in the"
49:44,280;49:48,400;"coaching stats, right? Is Belichick had a play for a two point conversion when they"
49:48,400;49:53,960;"guaranteed that they had practiced multiple times. Correct. Even though this was their"
49:53,960;49:59,000;"first two point conversion attempt of the entire season. And remembering more than two"
49:59,000;50:05,000;"team and John Fox, I fucking guarantee the Panthers did not. Yeah. I had a question."
50:05,000;50:07,720;"Is this the first direct snap that Kevin Falk?"
50:07,720;50:08,720;"Oh, no."
50:08,720;50:13,160;"No, they've been running this since the blood so days."
50:13,160;50:14,160;"Oh, really?"
50:14,160;50:15,160;"Oh, yeah."
50:15,160;50:16,560;"You never read Andy's blog post?"
50:16,560;50:18,360;"Yeah, there's a blog post about it."
50:18,360;50:20,440;"The evolution of a play."
50:20,440;50:23,840;"Yeah, it's been around for ages and they always seem to break it out like when they need it"
50:23,840;50:24,920;"the most."
50:24,920;50:25,920;"Yeah."
50:25,920;50:29,240;"And it was here."
50:29,240;50:35,840;"They did it in 2006 when they needed two points against the Chargers in the Marlon"
50:35,840;50:40,720;"McCree, Troy Brown interception fumble game."
50:40,720;50:44,560;"They did it in the Falcon Super Bowl with James White."
50:44,560;50:47,560;"They did it in '07 where they actually faked it."
50:47,560;50:48,720;"They snapped it to Brady."
50:48,720;50:53,360;"Brady pretended like it went over his head, even though he had the ball."
50:53,360;50:56,520;"And so they faked the run and then Brady threw a touchdown."
50:56,520;51:02,120;"So they've run this play a lot, but it's like, it's that absolutely have to have this"
51:02,120;51:04,400;"point play."
51:04,400;51:08,240;"Whereas I think beforehand, like back in the bloods of days, they'd run in midfield,"
51:08,240;51:11,720;"just push it some giggles."
51:11,720;51:14,080;"Which came off the heels of the Rebel touchdown."
51:14,080;51:17,920;"I think everybody associates this game with on some level."
51:17,920;51:23,120;"Yeah, I still think this is my hot take for this game."
51:23,120;51:25,960;"Mike Rebel should have been Super Bowl MVP."
51:25,960;51:33,160;"He had two sacks. He had a strip sack, which set up the first page of touchdown and he caught a touchdown as a defensive player. How do you not give him?"
51:33,160;51:35,880;"MVP. I agree."
51:35,880;51:38,960;"Because it goes to the quarterback as a non-patriots fan."
51:38,960;51:46,720;"For some reason Mike Rebel is one of the guys from that era that sticks out in my mind so much. Maybe subconsciously because of this game."
51:46,720;51:53,120;"Yeah, and he caught what eight touchdowns in his career or something like that? Yeah, I think he had eight passes."
51:54,400;51:59,240;"Uh, eight receptions on eight attempts, uh, for eight touchdowns."
51:59,240;52:02,140;"I bet the tight ends love that with like nine yards."
52:02,140;52:04,560;"But yeah."
52:04,560;52:06,600;"And they also, I thought it was interesting."
52:06,600;52:10,500;"The commentators were talking about my grable saying, I think it was"
52:10,500;52:14,040;"after he caught the touchdown, maybe, uh, that he aspires to be a coach someday"
52:14,040;52:18,600;"and wants to go back to Ohio state and is hoping that they would give him a, uh,"
52:18,600;52:20,440;"like assistant coaching job after he finishes playing."
52:20,920;52:27,360;"And he said that if he ever was to become a coach, that if his team made the Super Bowl,"
52:27,360;52:28,560;"he would cut off his penis."
52:28,560;52:30,560;"He did say that."
52:30,560;52:31,560;"I think that was later."
52:31,560;52:32,560;"Yeah."
52:32,560;52:33,560;"Can we win?"
52:33,560;52:36,560;"Also, also mind-bending the dream."
52:36,560;52:37,560;"Two seasons ago."
52:37,560;52:38,560;"That was the same?"
52:38,560;52:42,760;"Yeah, it was like I cut off my own dick to get the zoo."
52:42,760;52:44,760;"Not said when he was 25-year-olds."
52:44,760;52:45,760;"No, no."
52:45,760;52:48,280;"Two years ago, his head coach of an NFL franchise."
52:48,280;52:49,280;"Yeah."
52:49,280;52:51,000;"12 year old boy. He"
52:51,000;52:53,520;"no said I ever leave the"
52:53,520;52:55,680;"the Houston Oilers to the Super Bowl."
52:55,680;52:59,640;"Cut off my penis and then of course they got renamed is the Titans."
52:59,640;53:00,840;"Yeah. Yeah."
53:00,840;53:05,600;"Oh boy."
53:05,600;53:08,000;"Yeah. So do we want to do the commentator, Steve?"
53:08,000;53:09,520;"I know you said you had some notes."
53:09,520;53:11,760;"I've already said all of my notes."
53:11,760;53:13,160;"Really? Because I have one more."
53:13,160;53:17,160;"Phil Sims blaming Tyla for the blown coverage on Touchdown when it was a"
53:17,160;53:20,040;"Sante Samuel. Yeah. Yeah. It definitely was."
53:20,040;53:25,160;"Sure. Greg was. Greg was mad about that, but happy that he called out Bill Bell check for a shitty squib quick."
53:25,160;53:26,360;"Yeah. Exactly."
53:26,360;53:35,160;"I, the one other quote that I had was Phil Sims saying, ""Neither team is big on celebrating or trash talking."
53:35,160;53:39,880;"I'm thinking myself, have you met Steve Smith and or Rodney Harrison?"""
53:39,880;53:43,240;"Like that's their fault. You're protecting yourself on this game."
53:45,560;53:48,320;"What the fuck dude did like both of them?"
53:48,320;53:50,920;"That's all they do is trash talk the entire fucking time."
53:50,920;53:53,720;"Greg Gumpel did call Adam"
53:53,720;53:56,040;"Ben and Terry's game when he filled the one if you caught that too."
53:56,040;53:56,960;"Oh, I missed that."
53:56,960;53:57,440;"What are you saying?"
53:57,440;54:01,200;"He's like, oh, maybe you'll have an opportunity to redeem himself and kick kick for the win."
54:01,200;54:01,760;"Oh, yeah."
54:01,760;54:03,920;"That's before the rebels TD."
54:03,920;54:05,120;"Yeah."
54:05,120;54:08,840;"All right, since we're not going to trash on the commentary, so how do we trash on the referees?"
54:08,840;54:14,080;"Because this was an Ed fucking hockey league game made it all about him."
54:14,560;54:16,280;"And then notice referees at all."
54:16,280;54:17,760;"I thought they were perfectly fine."
54:17,760;54:19,480;"No, how many penalties were there?"
54:19,480;54:24,040;"There were the shits on there was New England, eight penalties for 60 yards."
54:24,040;54:26,080;"Caroline, 12 penalties for 73 yards."
54:26,080;54:28,200;"I'd say a good half of those were Tiki tech."
54:28,200;54:32,480;"They were just like fucking Ed Hawkely one to hear himself talk, one to be fucking"
54:32,480;54:37,600;"Major League Baseball umpire taking control of the game or like a fucking NBA"
54:37,600;54:40,360;"basketball referee, because it was the center of attention."
54:40,360;54:44,080;"I do vaguely remember there being periods of this game"
54:44,080;54:46,080;"that were frustrating with lots of penalties."
54:46,080;54:48,520;"Hey, I remember I think Andy's just but hurt."
54:48,520;54:52,560;"No, well, I mean, all right, let's go on and go to the last one,"
54:52,560;54:54,880;"the Troy Brown offensive pass interference."
54:54,880;54:56,720;"You're going to tell me that was legit call."
54:56,720;55:00,440;"There is one stretch where I was like, this is getting out of hand"
55:00,440;55:05,040;"where they had a measurement three plays in a row and then called a challenge"
55:05,040;55:06,280;"after the third measurement."
55:06,280;55:11,040;"And like that was in the first quarter or the first half when the game was just a"
55:11,320;55:17,480;"Slogfest anyways in like three straight plays with them. Okay, come on measure it out and you're just like oh"
55:17,480;55:21,440;"Not again. It's not exciting, but it's kind of fun to watch"
55:21,440;55:27,720;"It is interesting to like"
55:27,720;55:29,880;"You know"
55:29,880;55:32,760;"Surely after this is when the NFL"
55:32,760;55:41,280;"Change the illegal contact rule. Yes and like that panthers eagles NFC championship got often cited"
55:41,280;55:44,420;"as a game that caused them to change the rule."
55:44,420;55:47,460;"When like, I mean, I haven't gone back and watched it,"
55:47,460;55:49,300;"but it seems pretty clear that in retrospect,"
55:49,300;55:51,900;"like the Panther secondary, like,"
55:51,900;55:55,540;"absolutely fucking robbed the Eagles in that game"
55:55,540;55:58,260;"and was just like, fuck them up at every moment."
55:58,260;55:59,100;"- Yeah."
55:59,100;56:02,980;"- That game was often cited as the one of the key exhibits"
56:02,980;56:06,380;"for the NFL to like change the illegal contact rules."
56:06,380;56:09,380;"And it makes you wonder if in the immediate aftermath,"
56:09,380;56:12,860;"there wasn't some sort of conversation about that chip."
56:12,860;56:14,300;"- I think if that's exhibit A,"
56:14,300;56:18,780;"then exhibit B is the Patriots Colts game"
56:18,780;56:22,100;"where the Patriots defense just band handled"
56:22,100;56:24,420;"that red hot Colts offense."
56:24,420;56:25,340;"- Yep."
56:25,340;56:26,180;"- And so yeah, I think,"
56:26,180;56:30,500;"and that was the two, what conference championship games,"
56:30,500;56:31,340;"both of those?"
56:31,340;56:32,180;"- Yeah."
56:32,180;56:33,020;"- That's all."
56:33,020;56:34,740;"- You basically have this defense."
56:34,740;56:35,740;"- It's interesting."
56:35,740;56:37,940;"Ricky Manning had three picks in that game"
56:37,940;56:40,140;"and Tyler Law had three picks in the past game."
56:40,140;56:40,980;"- Oh shit."
56:40,980;56:43,380;"- Called the Ricky Manning Tyler rule."
56:43,380;56:44,220;"- God damn."
56:44,220;56:48,900;"So this kind of like these two teams are very kind of parallel"
56:48,900;56:52,780;"to each other, which makes sense why it was such"
56:52,780;56:54,700;"a close scoring game."
56:54,700;56:56,020;"- Are we, I just gotta ask,"
56:56,020;56:58,180;"were we talking about the halftime show at all?"
56:58,180;57:00,340;"- Oh yeah, I think we just look at that."
57:00,340;57:01,580;"- Oh, is that this one?"
57:01,580;57:02,740;"- So I, yeah."
57:02,740;57:03,580;"- I did it."
57:03,580;57:11,460;"to say that this is the the the triple exeist Super Bowl that was in the X, X, X range of"
57:11,460;57:20,420;"Super Bowls because they no longer are because this is 39. So X, X, X, V, 38. Yeah. So we're"
57:20,420;57:27,860;"getting close to the the fucking Timberlake man. Yeah. So yeah, Greg, I just so you had"
57:27,860;57:32,260;"notes on this. It's just so audacious that they could even"
57:32,260;57:36,780;"think to call this a wardrobe malfunction. She had a tassel"
57:36,780;57:42,460;"around her nipple. So what are we talking about here? I think"
57:42,460;57:45,660;"you did that. She just wears those under her clothes without"
57:45,660;57:50,340;"the intention of showing them. I have tasks. Can you milk me?"
57:50,340;57:56,060;"People just like bought it too. No one was like, okay, wardrobe"
57:56,060;57:59,220;"- Malfungs. - Also you try to accomplish."
57:59,220;58:01,860;"- I mean, the last line in the song is,"
58:01,860;58:04,060;"I'm gonna have you naked by the end of the song."
58:04,060;58:05,500;"- Yeah. - Come on, people."
58:05,500;58:06,780;"Come on, people."
58:06,780;58:10,060;"- And then he grabs, he grabs like a piece of clothing"
58:10,060;58:13,300;"right in her breast area and pulls it."
58:13,300;58:15,700;"What, if it didn't malfungs her,"
58:15,700;58:17,060;"what was supposed to happen?"
58:17,060;58:19,420;"- This is probably my defining memory of this as a kid,"
58:19,420;58:22,420;"'cause we had Tivo and it had just gotten Tivo."
58:22,420;58:23,740;"- Oh, thank God."
58:23,740;58:26,020;"- We were like, we were like, what?"
58:26,020;58:28,020;"This dude I just launched."
58:28,020;58:29,940;"Wow, this thing is the best we should have."
58:29,940;58:32,980;"So we've watched it that year like a million times."
58:32,980;58:35,500;"- So I was at college watching this too."
58:35,500;58:38,500;"And we were all in like the main common room."
58:38,500;58:40,460;"And we like wheeled the TV in,"
58:40,460;58:41,340;"'cause this was back in days"
58:41,340;58:43,100;"before like flat screens and shit."
58:43,100;58:45,620;"So we had the TV like we wheeled somebody's TV in"
58:45,620;58:47,380;"whoever had the biggest one."
58:47,380;58:48,220;"And we're all watching it."
58:48,220;58:51,540;"And so it was halftime and like everybody else left to like,"
58:51,540;58:53,340;"you know, go pee or grab some food"
58:53,340;58:54,660;"or more drinks or whatever."
58:54,660;58:55,820;"And so I'm sitting there watching this thing"
58:55,820;58:59,100;"by myself alone in this empty room."
58:59,100;59:03,740;"And that happens, I'm like, did that,"
59:03,740;59:05,660;"did I just see a boom on live TV?"
59:05,660;59:07,100;"And I had nobody to validate with me."
59:07,100;59:08,180;"I don't know."
59:08,180;59:11,260;"And this is like kind of before live internet's happening."
59:11,260;59:13,140;"So you can't go on Twitter and find out."
59:13,140;59:15,060;"You can't go on Twitter and ask people."
59:15,060;59:18,220;"So you're like, I think it's a boom on TV."
59:18,220;59:19,980;"And so everybody came back and I'm like, guys, you miss it."
59:19,980;59:21,620;"They were with boobs on TV."
59:21,620;59:24,020;"At the halftime show, they're like, you had to go fuck yourselves."
59:24,020;59:24,860;"- Wow."
59:24,860;59:26,300;"- It's always the key to shit already."
59:26,300;59:27,780;"- Yeah, it was a strange moment."
59:27,780;59:30,620;"A viral moment before viral moments were things."
59:30,620;59:34,140;"And like, I just remember it as like, it kind of happened."
59:34,140;59:35,460;"And then there was like this pause,"
59:35,460;59:37,540;"and then they like, the lights went out."
59:37,540;59:38,380;"- Yep."
59:38,380;59:39,940;"- And it was just like, wait."
59:39,940;59:42,260;"- Everyone just looked at them each other and be like,"
59:42,260;59:43,980;"did I just, just like Andy was it?"
59:43,980;59:46,660;"Did I just see that or was that nipple?"
59:46,660;59:48,980;"No, I'm gonna be a nipple."
59:48,980;59:51,540;"- In question is obviously staged."
59:51,540;59:53,860;"- Right, but how far up did it go?"
59:53,860;01:00:03,420;"Mm. Like obviously Jan Jackson and Justin Timberlake knew what was happening. Did the show producers know it was happening? Did the NFL know what was happening?"
01:00:03,420;01:00:05,620;"Bill Sim people that had commercial."
01:00:05,620;01:00:07,420;"Bill Sims."
01:00:07,420;01:00:09,980;"They could have told Bill Sims and he had not."
01:00:09,980;01:00:16,100;"Hey, it's to quote Phil Sims in this game. You're allowed to push him around every now and then. That's what I do up here in the booth."
01:00:16,100;01:00:18,420;"That's true. Yeah."
01:00:18,420;01:00:22,300;"Maybe talking about boobies. He knows about, you know, what's actually."
01:00:22,300;01:00:24,300;"It was coming"
01:00:24,300;01:00:26,820;"Fucking Phil Sims. Oh boy"
01:00:26,820;01:00:33,980;"Yeah, I mean, I think I think though I gotta get props, you know, I think I think if they"
01:00:33,980;01:00:40,860;"Just if they were just if they just leaned into it and we're they were like, yeah, you saw what you saw"
01:00:40,860;01:00:44,820;"What do you like that shit? We'll put that on the Super Bowl for you"
01:00:44,820;01:00:46,020;"I would have loved it"
01:00:46,020;01:00:50,940;"But the fact that they immediately tried to walk it back and be like no malfunction. It's like come on"
01:00:50,940;01:00:55,460;"You can't like commit and then backtrack immediately."
01:00:55,460;01:00:56,460;"Yeah."
01:00:56,460;01:00:58,220;"Back then they probably would have been."
01:00:58,220;01:00:59,740;"What's wrong with a little nipple?"
01:00:59,740;01:01:01,300;"It's very European."
01:01:01,300;01:01:03,140;"Just to be like, you guys aren't cultured enough."
01:01:03,140;01:01:04,140;"You know what it is?"
01:01:04,140;01:01:07,100;"Our world is ready for that in 2004, Greg."
01:01:07,100;01:01:08,100;"Yeah."
01:01:08,100;01:01:10,540;"Let's not pretend Justin Timberlake didn't"
01:01:10,540;01:01:13,740;"tuck that shit right onto his resume."
01:01:13,740;01:01:17,940;"This was building a brand before building a brand was a thing."
01:01:17,940;01:01:20,420;"Bob's got a great point here."
01:01:20,420;01:01:25,420;"Although Greg, you know why they didn't cop to it?"
01:01:25,420;01:01:27,220;"It's because it was--"
01:01:27,220;01:01:28,580;"- Very naughty."
01:01:28,580;01:01:29,500;"- Very naughty."
01:01:29,500;01:01:30,940;"- And not--"
01:01:30,940;01:01:32,820;"- Our boy Justin Timberlake Andy?"
01:01:32,820;01:01:34,180;"- Our boy Justin Timberlake."
01:01:34,180;01:01:35,820;"- Sometimes a naughty boy."
01:01:35,820;01:01:36,660;"- He is."
01:01:36,660;01:01:39,580;"(laughing)"
01:01:39,580;01:01:41,340;"- It's been back in the news"
01:01:41,340;01:01:45,020;"'cause the Britney Spears documentary,"
01:01:45,020;01:01:48,980;"apparently it doesn't shine very good light on Timberlake."
01:01:48,980;01:01:54,100;"So he is, he was apologized for both that and the gin Jackson."
01:01:54,100;01:01:55,340;"I'd heard that."
01:01:55,340;01:01:56,060;"Yeah."
01:01:56,060;01:02:03,260;"Apparently he said he was trying to compete with Madonna, Christina"
01:02:03,260;01:02:07,340;"Aguilera and Britney Spears, kissed at the MTV music awards."
01:02:07,340;01:02:08,540;"Oh, that's right."
01:02:08,540;01:02:08,900;"Yeah."
01:02:08,900;01:02:10,060;"With that."
01:02:10,060;01:02:12,340;"I mean, a formula of years."
01:02:12,340;01:02:16,580;"This is consistent with how we perceive Mr."
01:02:16,580;01:02:20,740;"Timberlake we just it would be great if he could just be honest about these things."
01:02:20,740;01:02:21,260;"Uh huh."
01:02:21,260;01:02:22,260;"Yeah, I agree."
01:02:22,260;01:02:23,260;"I stopped."
01:02:23,260;01:02:26,820;"Stop trying to present yourself as like kind of wholesome."
01:02:26,820;01:02:29,460;"You'd like, that's not how you are."
01:02:29,460;01:02:30,460;"Yeah."
01:02:30,460;01:02:34,460;"He never quite got the line right between am I a bad boy or am I America sweet?"
01:02:34,460;01:02:35,460;"I know man."
01:02:35,460;01:02:36,460;"You were."
01:02:36,460;01:02:37,900;"He couldn't make his decision."
01:02:37,900;01:02:38,900;"I think."
01:02:38,900;01:02:39,900;"Mm hmm."
01:02:39,900;01:02:40,900;"Yep."
01:02:40,900;01:02:41,900;"He wanted the best of both worlds."
01:02:41,900;01:02:42,900;"Well, I think we're right."
01:02:42,900;01:02:44,620;"He would have thrived on TikTok."
01:02:44,620;01:02:46,620;"For sure"
01:02:46,620;01:02:48,660;"There's still time"
01:02:48,660;01:02:51,420;"Real time"
01:02:51,420;01:03:01,560;"Also, this is in Houston and then they did a NASA tribute in the pregame is the one-year anniversary of the Columbia disaster"
01:03:01,560;01:03:05,420;"Yes"
01:03:05,420;01:03:09,340;"Well way to bring it down right before I was gonna segue into that"
01:03:10,340;01:03:14,660;"halftime show not being the sexiest thing to happen in this game."
01:03:14,660;01:03:16,620;"You tell you about Tom Brady?"
01:03:16,620;01:03:18,780;"No, actually here."
01:03:18,780;01:03:22,300;"I will share my screen so you gentlemen can share in this with me."
01:03:22,300;01:03:25,260;"And you're saying this is sexier than Janet Jackson's boob."
01:03:25,260;01:03:26,340;"It is. Yes."
01:03:26,340;01:03:31,260;"This is right after right before the halftime kickoff."
01:03:31,260;01:03:36,220;"There was this gentleman who dressed up as a referee, got to midfield,"
01:03:36,220;01:03:40,100;"and then took off the vast majority of his clothes and went streaking."
01:03:40,100;01:03:45,700;"And then our good friend of the podcast, Matt Chatham,"
01:03:45,700;01:03:49,500;"who it's quite possibly the best tackle of the game."
01:03:49,500;01:03:50,540;"He bodies him."
01:03:50,540;01:03:54,700;"Yeah, this game match at all with the neck roll at this point,"
01:03:54,700;01:03:58,500;"like the arm sleeves and everything just absolutely."
01:03:58,500;01:04:00,300;"The best view."
01:04:00,300;01:04:01,700;"The best view."
01:04:01,700;01:04:03,100;"When you hit the turf,"
01:04:03,100;01:04:04,700;"they view from the end zone's best."
01:04:04,700;01:04:06,300;"Oh, he's like, oh, no, I give up."
01:04:06,300;01:04:07,100;"I give up and match up."
01:04:07,100;01:04:09,100;"Oh, God, we don't give up in this game."
01:04:09,100;01:04:12,380;"Well, yeah, Matt Chad doesn't hit him that paint this guy's gonna get him."
01:04:12,380;01:04:14,900;"And then just kind of like walks off the cliff."
01:04:14,900;01:04:21,100;"So like this like 45 year old guy, I wasn't thinking pretty overweight in a jock strap"
01:04:21,100;01:04:22,620;"and a rough hat."
01:04:22,620;01:04:23,620;"And that's it."
01:04:23,620;01:04:28,260;"Running down the field is sexier than Jan Jackson."
01:04:28,260;01:04:29,580;"No, the hit was sexier."
01:04:29,580;01:04:31,500;"Oh, oh, the hit part of it."
01:04:31,500;01:04:32,500;"Yeah."
01:04:32,500;01:04:33,500;"Oh, that makes more sense."
01:04:33,500;01:04:35,500;"I mean, yeah, he got fucked up."
01:04:35,500;01:04:36,500;"Yeah."
01:04:36,500;01:04:38,700;"Yeah, they had like the medics on the field, I think."
01:04:38,700;01:04:43,380;"And so can we else can we also just talk I mean you guys have been rewatching old games"
01:04:43,380;01:04:49,700;"But yes, this is probably you're yeah, I'm just like man pre-high death. What the fuck is that shit?"
01:04:49,700;01:04:52,220;"It might as well been"
01:04:52,220;01:04:54,940;"Yeah, actually I mean"
01:04:54,940;01:04:59,540;"Yeah, when we first started they didn't have the yellow first down line and it was so hard to wash"
01:04:59,540;01:05:05,620;"You like wait, and they didn't have the the score bug up all the time. It only showed like when the play was starting"
01:05:05,620;01:05:07,460;"Yeah, you get to be like"
01:05:07,460;01:05:10,960;"Where are they on the field? What down is it? I don't even know what's going on right now"
01:05:10,960;01:05:18,480;"So hard to follow us. Yeah, very weird just watching that highlight. I was just like I was distracted by the the pixels"
01:05:18,480;01:05:21,580;"Yeah, archaic"
01:05:21,580;01:05:27,820;"Like the Monday night footballs and it is you know it is you've all the others have a little bit better quality in the regular season shit. Yep"
01:05:27,820;01:05:32,840;"It's I think it's like watching football as like"
01:05:33,780;01:05:38,940;"My wife Kelly watches it where there's no perception of like what down is it?"
01:05:38,940;01:05:41,380;"How much time's left but like ooh exciting play"
01:05:41,380;01:05:46,020;"Yeah, I'll watch that and then just like drift off for a bit. Oh exciting play. I'll watch that"
01:05:46,020;01:05:52,260;"You know like that's her fan experience which is similar to like pre yellow line and clock and shit. Yeah"
01:05:52,260;01:05:58,340;"That's a good way of doing it. Yeah every play has like less significance when it's like that because it's like I don't even know"
01:05:58,340;01:06:00,820;"Could be a first sound could be I don't know"
01:06:00,820;01:06:02,340;"Are we winning? I don't know."
01:06:02,340;01:06:03,540;"Yeah, I don't know if we're winning."
01:06:03,540;01:06:06,740;"Who are we starting to wait till they bring the chains on the field to know what's happening?"
01:06:06,740;01:06:09,540;"It's true. Yeah."
01:06:09,540;01:06:12,980;"No, it's been almost like relearning how to watch some of these"
01:06:12,980;01:06:16,660;"football games because like, oh, fuck, I actually have to pay attention to like,"
01:06:16,660;01:06:18,980;"how far you got? Is that a first down? Yeah, nobody knows."
01:06:18,980;01:06:21,940;"Yeah, no, the, uh, but they're starting to get better."
01:06:21,940;01:06:24,580;"We're getting closer to high def, I think, in 2003."
01:06:25,860;01:06:31,620;"Another another interesting little anecdote from this game."
01:06:31,620;01:06:37,620;"The kick returner and like third string running back is none other than Rod Smart."
01:06:37,620;01:06:40,580;"He hate me from XFL glory."
01:06:40,580;01:06:43,220;"I thought I recognized the name but I couldn't place it."
01:06:43,220;01:06:45,700;"That was really he hate me."
01:06:45,700;01:06:46,500;"Damn."
01:06:46,500;01:06:48,260;"He hate these game of sweet."
01:06:48,260;01:06:50,420;"Yeah."
01:06:50,420;01:06:53,060;"Another like character on this Panthers team."
01:06:54,620;01:06:55,460;"Yeah, he was pretty awesome."
01:06:55,460;01:06:57,140;"Success returning kicks in this game."
01:06:57,140;01:06:57,860;"I will say."
01:06:57,860;01:06:58,420;"You don't care."
01:06:58,420;01:06:59,460;"I don't know."
01:06:59,460;01:07:01,580;"He I don't think he got back to the 20."
01:07:01,580;01:07:03,700;"Troy did really well."
01:07:03,700;01:07:04,020;"Troy."
01:07:04,020;01:07:04,180;"Yeah."
01:07:04,180;01:07:05,820;"So Troy Brown was returning punts."
01:07:05,820;01:07:07,780;"And then all of a sudden he wasn't."
01:07:07,780;01:07:08,740;"And then he was again."
01:07:08,740;01:07:11,780;"And then there was no more punts."
01:07:11,780;01:07:13,580;"That's how this game seemed to go."
01:07:13,580;01:07:16,940;"You get that knee in the like through the face mask early."
01:07:16,940;01:07:18,740;"Yeah, I don't know if he broke his nose,"
01:07:18,740;01:07:20,380;"but he he came back on the field."
01:07:20,380;01:07:23,340;"He just had like the the tissue just wedged up in there."
01:07:23,340;01:07:24,540;"They play like that."
01:07:24,540;01:07:25,620;"Yeah, that's a feat."
01:07:25,620;01:07:26,060;"That's a feat."
01:07:26,060;01:07:29,580;"He's trying to start trotting out there with a lot of stuff of his nose."
01:07:29,580;01:07:30,580;"Yeah."
01:07:30,580;01:07:33,260;"You can see the red starting like leak through it."
01:07:33,260;01:07:33,660;"Yeah."
01:07:33,660;01:07:35,860;"Jesus Christ."
01:07:35,860;01:07:40,060;"Another interesting he hate me note is that upon retirement, Jake"
01:07:40,060;01:07:44,460;"the Lome got into like owning horses and shit like that."
01:07:44,460;01:07:48,980;"And one of the horses that he he raced, he had named she hate me."
01:07:48,980;01:07:50,620;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:07:50,620;01:07:51,140;"OK."
01:07:51,140;01:07:52,240;"doing the worst day to them."
01:07:52,240;01:07:54,060;"I don't know."
01:07:54,060;01:07:55,960;"It was a reference to that."
01:07:55,960;01:07:57,320;"Apparently, Spike Lee."
01:07:57,320;01:07:59,380;"He's probably a difficult horse, just like bit them all the time."
01:07:59,380;01:08:00,180;"So he's going to be a key."
01:08:00,180;01:08:00,860;"She hate me."
01:08:00,860;01:08:05,220;"There was also players in the XFL that were playing against."
01:08:05,220;01:08:08,820;"He hate me's team that put on their name plate."
01:08:08,820;01:08:12,660;"I hate he and the other guy put I hate he too."
01:08:12,660;01:08:15,460;"The number two or the letter T.O."
01:08:15,460;01:08:16,900;"T.O.O."
01:08:16,900;01:08:19,140;"Oh my God."
01:08:19,180;01:08:24,620;"Yeah. Imagine taking yourself seriously having I hate he too on your jersey,"
01:08:24,620;01:08:28,540;"which is a response to a teammates whose response to an opponent."
01:08:28,540;01:08:34,140;"What's great is like thinking about this through our modern lens of like,"
01:08:34,140;01:08:40,300;"this is the shit people do on Twitter now. But in these days, dudes were like getting jerseys made"
01:08:40,300;01:08:45,340;"with this. That was the only way you could get your name out was by like putting something ridiculous."
01:08:46,780;01:08:49,900;"Yeah, like these were guys trying to do the equivalent of going"
01:08:49,900;01:08:51,740;"by a lot of characters."
01:08:51,740;01:08:52,140;"I'm not a character."
01:08:52,140;01:08:52,700;"What's the thing?"
01:08:52,700;01:08:57,500;"Yeah, you got like 15 characters to fucking get your name out there."
01:08:57,500;01:08:57,980;"Make your name."
01:08:57,980;01:09:01,980;"Which honestly is probably the that is the defining piece of the XFL."
01:09:01,980;01:09:05,500;"You know, XFL he hate me is probably like the most."
01:09:05,500;01:09:11,420;"That XFL MVP Tommy Maddox actually starting some games for the."
01:09:11,420;01:09:16,620;"The other part I remember all the XFL clearly was the inside of the coin flip."
01:09:16,620;01:09:20,220;"They just put the ball in the middle. Oh the kick the kickoff rule. That was the greatest thing"
01:09:20,220;01:09:24,020;"You guys would run at each other. Yeah, and the guy like Tori Zazielle and like the first one"
01:09:24,020;01:09:30,500;"Injuries"
01:09:30,500;01:09:33,980;"Yeah"
01:09:33,980;01:09:40,860;"Like we should bring this back"
01:09:40,860;01:09:45,660;"Yeah, we did the bomb -"
01:09:45,660;01:09:49,740;"- You all do best and worst?"
01:09:49,740;01:09:51,260;"- Yeah, sure."
01:09:51,260;01:09:54,260;"So Bobby, growing up in the brown house,"
01:09:54,260;01:09:57,240;"we at dinner time, we only have to do best and worst"
01:09:57,240;01:10:00,460;"go on the table and give our best of the day"
01:10:00,460;01:10:01,300;"and the worst of the day."
01:10:01,300;01:10:04,700;"So we've brought that over to the podcast for the game."
01:10:04,700;01:10:06,540;"So you're more than one of your participants,"
01:10:06,540;01:10:07,860;"but we're putting you on the spot."
01:10:07,860;01:10:09,940;"So if you have any best and worst,"
01:10:09,940;01:10:14,500;"just of either the Super Bowl or this Panther season in general,"
01:10:14,500;01:10:15,500;"Feel free."
01:10:15,500;01:10:21,940;"Thankfully, your mother has, you know, spent enough time with her grandchildren that I'm"
01:10:21,940;01:10:23,580;"very familiar with best and worst."
01:10:23,580;01:10:27,500;"Oh, we say Bobby knows about best and worst."
01:10:27,500;01:10:28,780;"Best and worst, best and worst."
01:10:28,780;01:10:33,740;"I mean, enduringly the worst for me was the kickoff going out of bounds in this game."
01:10:33,740;01:10:37,860;"It's the thing I remember as the biggest like regret what the fuck moment."
01:10:37,860;01:10:38,860;"Yeah."
01:10:38,860;01:10:46,140;"I just remember at the end of that game, like tying it up in the end, it was a moment that"
01:10:46,140;01:10:49,340;"felt like it felt like the whole season."
01:10:49,340;01:10:54,580;"It was just like, this is it, a game we shouldn't win, but we're going to have a chance to win."
01:10:54,580;01:11:00,220;"And the kick out of bounds was just such a fucking punch in the stomach from a guy who"
01:11:00,220;01:11:03,660;"otherwise had just been so stalwart."
01:11:03,660;01:11:06,060;"Like John Casey kicked it out of bounds on it."
01:11:06,060;01:11:07,060;"On kick off?"
01:11:07,060;01:11:08,060;"Like what?"
01:11:08,060;01:11:09,560;"- Yeah, so that was my worst."
01:11:09,560;01:11:12,200;"Like I'll never forget that."
01:11:12,200;01:11:17,200;"I think best, best for this game was definitely"
01:11:17,200;01:11:20,420;"the Muhammad touchdown."
01:11:20,420;01:11:22,740;"It was just such a like, fuck you moment."
01:11:22,740;01:11:26,700;"- 'Cause it was third and 10."
01:11:26,700;01:11:29,440;"- Yeah, it was just like 15."
01:11:29,440;01:11:31,300;"And the first two passes had to look real bad."
01:11:31,300;01:11:34,260;"The Patriots, the defensive line where like"
01:11:34,260;01:11:37,740;"ragdolling, D'Lohm all over the place."
01:11:37,740;01:11:39,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:39,740;01:11:41,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:41,740;01:11:43,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:43,740;01:11:45,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:45,740;01:11:47,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:47,740;01:11:49,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:49,740;01:11:51,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:51,740;01:11:53,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:53,740;01:11:55,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:55,740;01:11:57,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:57,740;01:11:59,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:11:59,740;01:12:01,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:12:01,740;01:12:03,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:12:03,740;01:12:05,740;"I didn't know that I had to go to the game."
01:12:05,740;01:12:08,160;"I mean, it was like happening over like Christmas break,"
01:12:08,160;01:12:09,620;"I think, 'cause it was that time of year, you know what I mean?"
01:12:09,620;01:12:13,180;"So I was home and my buddies from home"
01:12:13,180;01:12:14,660;"who were Panthers fans were all over there."
01:12:14,660;01:12:16,500;"We're at this house and like,"
01:12:16,500;01:12:19,020;"this house was like a family, they had four kids"
01:12:19,020;01:12:20,660;"and it was like, it was like literally called"
01:12:20,660;01:12:22,460;"at the game house growing up."
01:12:22,460;01:12:23,300;"'Cause his parents went on, I was like,"
01:12:23,300;01:12:25,300;"""Game nuts on Friday, all these fucking kids over there."""
01:12:25,300;01:12:27,200;"Like literally like 30 kids over there."
01:12:27,200;01:12:31,620;"And we go over there and we're like in a back bedroom"
01:12:31,620;01:12:33,860;"watching this game and these people are not football fans."
01:12:33,860;01:12:36,260;"This is like where we went to play like board games, right?"
01:12:36,260;01:12:38,380;"And like Dungeons and Dragons."
01:12:38,380;01:12:41,340;"So like we're like watching a Panthers game hardcore"
01:12:41,340;01:12:44,380;"in the other room and I'm like losing my fucking shit."
01:12:44,380;01:12:46,780;"I'm like totally losing my shit."
01:12:46,780;01:12:49,980;"And the thing I remember from after that game was,"
01:12:49,980;01:12:52,620;"oh, you know what it was?"
01:12:52,620;01:12:55,860;"I was about to leave after that game to drive back"
01:12:55,860;01:13:00,860;"to Davidson and the oldest son in that family, Scott,"
01:13:00,860;01:13:02,340;"went there with me."
01:13:02,340;01:13:03,180;"He was a year older than me."
01:13:03,180;01:13:05,060;"So I was gonna give them a ride back."
01:13:05,060;01:13:06,820;"And I just remember their mom, Maxine,"
01:13:06,820;01:13:10,660;"who was like this really nice, like soft spoken woman."
01:13:10,660;01:13:12,700;"I just remember vividly her looking at me"
01:13:12,700;01:13:14,260;"in the living room."
01:13:14,260;01:13:16,020;"And like, I've done this one in my whole life."
01:13:16,020;01:13:17,780;"I've been around her a hundred times,"
01:13:17,780;01:13:20,400;"but I probably had like three direct conversations"
01:13:20,400;01:13:21,980;"with her ever and she just looks at me"
01:13:21,980;01:13:24,820;"and she just goes, she'd clearly heard my insanity"
01:13:24,820;01:13:28,700;"from the other room and just goes, I really love you."
01:13:28,700;01:13:30,220;"But if the Panthers had lost this game,"
01:13:30,220;01:13:32,460;"I was not gonna let my son drive back with you."
01:13:32,460;01:13:34,720;"(laughing)"
01:13:34,720;01:13:38,460;"- That was awesome."
01:13:38,460;01:13:41,620;"- A Maxine, classic Maxine."
01:13:41,620;01:13:42,980;"- Classic Maxine."
01:13:42,980;01:13:43,820;"- Always."
01:13:43,820;01:13:48,340;"- All right, well, my best is learning"
01:13:48,340;01:13:50,820;"that my brother-in-law plays under the dragons."
01:13:50,820;01:13:54,460;"- Listen, we can talk about that later."
01:13:54,460;01:13:55,600;"- All right, Daniel, Jagged,"
01:13:55,600;01:13:58,140;"- A lot of things happened on game night, okay?"
01:13:58,140;01:14:00,380;"- D&D's legit, my friend."
01:14:00,380;01:14:03,460;"I never played, but I'm very intrigued by it."
01:14:03,460;01:14:06,540;"- Hey, Greg, I've thought of it before."
01:14:06,540;01:14:07,900;"You gotta have somebody to run."
01:14:07,900;01:14:10,580;"- I need a dungeon master, yeah, right?"
01:14:10,580;01:14:14,540;"- Yeah, honestly, this podcast is too much of a commitment."
01:14:14,540;01:14:16,300;"I can't imagine a dungeon's in dragons."
01:14:16,300;01:14:17,740;"I feel like it's gonna be even more."
01:14:17,740;01:14:20,340;"- Yeah, you need somebody who knows what the doin' it runs."
01:14:20,340;01:14:22,060;"- Oh, so you need somebody who preps a whole,"
01:14:22,060;01:14:23,940;"like, eight pages of show notes every week,"
01:14:23,940;01:14:26,060;"edits the episodes, runs the run site."
01:14:26,060;01:14:27,980;"- So what I'm saying is I don't have enough time"
01:14:27,980;01:14:29,580;"'cause I'm doin' this podcast."
01:14:29,580;01:14:35,340;"of fun. Later, I can introduce you guys to go who used to work as a or a teacher for no fun,"
01:14:35,340;01:14:39,740;"but laid off in the pandemic. And now it's just a full time Dungeons and Dragons Dungeon Master."
01:14:39,740;01:14:42,540;"I meet with him on Wednesdays every three weeks. Don't worry about it."
01:14:42,540;01:14:48,540;"Oh, no, I've got a few friends like that too. They have a 3D front little mini,"
01:14:48,540;01:14:53,980;"they 3D print their people. So when you're in person, you can be your own little guy and they"
01:14:53,980;01:14:57,280;"set up all sorts of good times."
01:14:57,280;01:15:00,020;"So is that your worst or your best?"
01:15:00,020;01:15:00,980;"Danny, I can't remember."
01:15:00,980;01:15:02,320;"That was one of my best."
01:15:02,320;01:15:09,060;"No, my actual best for this game was Dion Branch catching his"
01:15:09,060;01:15:11,420;"first ever career playoff touchdown."
01:15:11,420;01:15:13,820;"Just happened to be in the zero goal."
01:15:13,820;01:15:18,060;"I don't happen to be a long one, actually."
01:15:18,060;01:15:19,660;"It was one that kind of kicked off the."
01:15:19,660;01:15:23,500;"Actually, no, his was the the play action one early."
01:15:23,500;01:15:25,500;"So that was good."
01:15:25,500;01:15:33,500;"And then my worst was Reliant Stadium as a stadium."
01:15:33,500;01:15:38,500;"I thought the grass was like the turf itself seemed pretty bad."
01:15:38,500;01:15:41,500;"Like nobody could stay in their feet for the whole game."
01:15:41,500;01:15:50,500;"And I'm going to blame the stadium for Adam Minitari's misses because he has only missed up until this point."
01:15:50,500;01:15:55,500;"point four field goals indoors, all four of them in this stadium."
01:15:55,500;01:16:00,020;"Because the other two were against the Houston Texans when they're playing in"
01:16:00,020;01:16:04,740;"Reliance Stadium earlier this season, season before, whenever that was."
01:16:04,740;01:16:08,900;">> Whatever, go ahead and blame all David Carr sacks on the turf, whatever."
01:16:08,900;01:16:11,540;">> Hey, you know what else you can blame on this turf?"
01:16:11,540;01:16:13,140;"John Casey kicking the ball out of bounds."
01:16:13,140;01:16:13,620;">> Only kick."
01:16:13,620;01:16:14,460;">> There we go."
01:16:14,460;01:16:15,300;">> There you go."
01:16:15,300;01:16:17,820;">> No double standards, all right?"
01:16:17,820;01:16:19,980;"Yeah, I mean, any, the commentators are wrong"
01:16:19,980;01:16:21,540;"and the rest really fucked that up."
01:16:21,540;01:16:23,860;"Yeah, but really it was the stadium."
01:16:23,860;01:16:26,420;"The whole thing was a joke, except for the two teams."
01:16:26,420;01:16:29,380;"That's a good segue into my best, actually."
01:16:29,380;01:16:30,860;"All right, give it to me."
01:16:30,860;01:16:34,340;"So I was watching this and there's so many plays"
01:16:34,340;01:16:39,140;"in this game that remind me of other big Patriots plays"
01:16:39,140;01:16:41,580;"that happened either before or after."
01:16:41,580;01:16:42,740;"I'm listening."
01:16:42,740;01:16:43,580;"So the Ad"
01:16:43,580;01:16:46,620;"of an a terry game winning fuel goal."
01:16:46,620;01:16:50,740;"Very similar to the one against the Texans earlier in the year, which."
01:16:50,740;01:16:54,540;"If you're going to go back, actually, watch one of the games from the season that you"
01:16:54,540;01:16:55,220;"don't maybe not remember."
01:16:55,220;01:16:55,900;"That's a good one."
01:16:55,900;01:16:56,980;"You think?"
01:16:56,980;01:16:57,820;"Yeah."
01:16:57,820;01:16:58,900;"The Texans game."
01:16:58,900;01:16:59,500;"Yeah."
01:16:59,500;01:17:02,140;"That was a close game the whole way through and it went all the"
01:17:02,140;01:17:03,940;"almost the whole way over time."
01:17:03,940;01:17:06,180;"That was the longest game in Tom Brady's career."
01:17:06,180;01:17:07,180;"That's true."
01:17:07,180;01:17:08,780;"I remember correct."
01:17:08,780;01:17:10,260;"I don't remember being a good game."
01:17:10,260;01:17:14,060;"The Bravewall Strip sack looked exactly like high tower."
01:17:14,060;01:17:16,220;"It gets a foul."
01:17:16,220;01:17:16,820;"It's yeah."
01:17:16,820;01:17:21,060;"That was like just mirror image flipped on the other side of the field, but"
01:17:21,060;01:17:24,460;"the same guess, like his rear and backup throw gets him right in the arm."
01:17:24,460;01:17:25,780;"He just drops it on the ball."
01:17:25,780;01:17:26,740;"It just chops the."
01:17:26,740;01:17:27,580;"Um, it was great."
01:17:27,580;01:17:32,700;"It was a coverage by Tyrone Pool on Steve Smith, where he pulls the, the"
01:17:32,700;01:17:35,300;"Steph play and he looks back for it."
01:17:35,300;01:17:36,060;"The Gilmore play."
01:17:36,060;01:17:36,300;"Yeah."
01:17:36,300;01:17:38,420;"That's it down with the offhand."
01:17:38,660;01:17:42,660;"Which is great because I think that was the only play Tyrone pool made the entire game."
01:17:42,660;01:17:46,860;"Yeah, he didn't have a good game, but he had that sick stuff Gilmore looking wanted."
01:17:46,860;01:17:47,360;"He did."
01:17:47,360;01:17:50,660;"There was a wig inciting of him hurtling people like in the Raiders game."
01:17:50,660;01:17:51,760;"True."
01:17:51,760;01:17:52,260;"Yeah."
01:17:52,260;01:17:56,160;"There's the direct snap to Kevin Falk, which looked a lot like the James White one, you know."
01:17:56,160;01:18:00,760;"So I was just getting a lot of flashbacks to other Peach's games in this one."
01:18:00,760;01:18:05,560;"It's like a malgation of all those other big plays sort of in this one with just different versions of it."
01:18:05,560;01:18:08,940;"that you don't actually quite remember those plays."
01:18:08,940;01:18:10,200;"Like if you had to pull one play out of this,"
01:18:10,200;01:18:12,360;"it's probably the Ray Bull touchdown."
01:18:12,360;01:18:13,760;"- Yeah."
01:18:13,760;01:18:16,960;"Which again is also reminiscent of Super Bowl next year,"
01:18:16,960;01:18:18,080;"in 2004."
01:18:18,080;01:18:18,920;"- Yeah."
01:18:18,920;01:18:19,760;"- Yeah, it's true."
01:18:19,760;01:18:20,600;"- It's a touchdown."
01:18:20,600;01:18:23,560;"So that's a great best."
01:18:23,560;01:18:25,120;"What do you got for your worst?"
01:18:25,120;01:18:28,560;"- Tom Brady's interception."
01:18:28,560;01:18:30,320;"- In the end zone."
01:18:30,320;01:18:32,840;"He's been doing that this season a few times,"
01:18:32,840;01:18:33,760;"mostly against the Colts,"
01:18:33,760;01:18:39,080;"where they drive down all and he's ready to put his foot on the team's throat and just"
01:18:39,080;01:18:43,360;"like ended as a contest and he throws that interception like deep in enemy territory"
01:18:43,360;01:18:49,640;"or in the end zone, give them life. It wasn't that right before the big. Yeah, that was right"
01:18:49,640;01:18:55,760;"before the 85 yard Muhammad, 85. Yeah. Yeah. Like literally, yeah, they're inside the"
01:18:55,760;01:18:59,640;"what the nine or something. Yeah. Three plays. Inside the 10 yard line, you throw an interception"
01:18:59,640;01:19:05,340;"on the goal line. Yep. And you're out, you know, 21 10 at that point, you go 28 10 with"
01:19:05,340;01:19:08,120;"the 748 left in the field goal. At least. Yeah."
01:19:08,120;01:19:12,720;"Fruz. And yep. So yeah, that was that was a bad one. I blocked that out of my mind. I"
01:19:12,720;01:19:19,800;"didn't even write it down. Fuck it. It's also sort of similar to not really, but the pick"
01:19:19,800;01:19:23,520;"63 in the Falcons game, you know, we're like, God damn it, we just finally get something"
01:19:23,520;01:19:28,160;"going. Yeah. All right, Greg, what you got for me, boy?"
01:19:28,160;01:19:33,160;"So going back to just wanted to mention this, the hurricane's goalie."
01:19:33,160;01:19:34,280;"I found the article on it."
01:19:34,280;01:19:35,280;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:35,280;01:19:36,280;"It's fucking hilarious."
01:19:36,280;01:19:40,720;"So the sky is they're playing in Toronto."
01:19:40,720;01:19:47,160;"He is like, he's the emergency goalie, but he lives and works in Toronto for like their"
01:19:47,160;01:19:49,240;"HL team."
01:19:49,240;01:19:53,400;"And he sometimes subs in and practices with Toronto."
01:19:53,400;01:19:56,880;"The maple leaves as just like the third goalie during practice."
01:19:56,880;01:19:59,400;"So I think he's the emergency goalie for both teams."
01:19:59,400;01:20:00,480;"I think that's how it works."
01:20:00,480;01:20:00,680;"Yeah."
01:20:00,680;01:20:02,160;"The Justics work out."
01:20:02,160;01:20:05,880;"So they both the starters for the Hurricanes get injured."
01:20:05,880;01:20:07,400;"This guy's a 42 year old."
01:20:07,400;01:20:10,400;"He's the Zamboni driver for an AHL team."
01:20:10,400;01:20:11,440;"That's right."
01:20:11,440;01:20:12,960;"He comes off the bench."
01:20:12,960;01:20:17,240;"He's wearing a Maple Leafs goalie face mask to helmet."
01:20:17,240;01:20:19,800;"[LAUGHING]"
01:20:19,800;01:20:22,720;"And he comes in and plays against the Maple Leafs"
01:20:22,720;01:20:24,400;"for the Hurricanes."
01:20:24,400;01:20:26,800;"gives up goals on his first two shots."
01:20:26,800;01:20:30,000;"And then settles down a block."
01:20:30,000;01:20:32,800;"It stops his last eight and ends up winning the game."
01:20:32,800;01:20:35,040;"Cause I reckon that's amazing."
01:20:35,040;01:20:36,960;"Yeah. And they're making a Disney movie about it."
01:20:36,960;01:20:38,280;"Nice."
01:20:38,280;01:20:39,480;"And they should."
01:20:39,480;01:20:40,920;"So pretty cool story."
01:20:40,920;01:20:46,240;"My best, I think, Rebel, you kind of stole it earlier, but he was."
01:20:46,240;01:20:50,240;"I think he had a case for MVP, you know, two sacks, fours,"
01:20:50,240;01:20:53,160;"fumble, tapping for loss and touchdown."
01:20:53,400;01:21:01,580;"pretty impressive game. Yeah. My worst. Not that they'd know in retrospect, but the all the"
01:21:01,580;01:21:05,280;"fawning they kept doing over Jerry Richardson every time they showed him in the box. It's"
01:21:05,280;01:21:16,240;"kind of like cringy at this point. He would do anything to win. So this is true. Did they"
01:21:16,240;01:21:21,360;"cut right before the kick where they cut to Robert Kraft and he's sitting there holding"
01:21:21,360;01:21:23,040;"hands of people next to him."
01:21:23,040;01:21:24,160;"My wrist right there."
01:21:24,160;01:21:26,880;"And I was like, oh, and then they cut the Jerry Richardson."
01:21:26,880;01:21:31,360;"He's sitting by himself legs crossed arms crossed, just looking so pissed off."
01:21:31,360;01:21:35,520;"Arms crossed across that like big old gut of his."
01:21:35,520;01:21:35,920;"Yeah."
01:21:35,920;01:21:37,040;"These are weirdly shaped man."
01:21:37,040;01:21:42,160;"Sometimes he was like a resting bitch face anyways, and he looked even more pissed off there."
01:21:42,160;01:21:42,480;"Yeah."
01:21:42,480;01:21:48,880;"Yeah, you want to hear the for any of those that never read up on what happened."
01:21:48,880;01:21:50,800;"Obviously he was forced to sell a team."
01:21:50,800;01:21:53,360;"So this is from the article I was reading."
01:21:53,360;01:21:55,640;"Friday was Gene's day when most staffers"
01:21:55,640;01:21:58,480;"of the Panthers team offices would wear denim to wear."
01:21:58,480;01:22:01,400;"The female employees knew what that meant."
01:22:01,400;01:22:04,120;"As a team's owner, Jerry Richardson made his rounds"
01:22:04,120;01:22:06,000;"on his way to a spacious office."
01:22:06,000;01:22:08,440;"He would ask women to turn around"
01:22:08,440;01:22:10,480;"so he could admire their back sides."
01:22:10,480;01:22:12,240;"(laughing)"
01:22:12,240;01:22:13,640;"- Very nice, great."
01:22:13,640;01:22:17,280;"- In his rolling southern draw, he'd offer comment,"
01:22:17,280;01:22:22,640;"drawing from a store of one liners he'd recycle each week among those in heaviest"
01:22:22,640;01:22:29,480;"rotation. Show me how you wiggle to get those jeans up. I thought you had to lay"
01:22:29,480;01:22:35,400;"down on your bed to fit into those jeans. Did you step into those jeans or did you"
01:22:35,400;01:22:36,640;"have to jump into them?"
01:22:36,640;01:22:42,600;"Oh my God. So the dream is creepiest old fucking man shit."
01:22:43,040;01:22:46,480;"Bob's face right now is classic."
01:22:46,480;01:22:47,680;"Very naughty."
01:22:47,680;01:22:48,480;"Yeah."
01:22:48,480;01:22:50,320;"Show me how you wiggle."
01:22:50,320;01:22:55,600;"Imagine a fucking billionaire team owner saying that to someone in your presence."
01:22:55,600;01:23:01,280;"A man who wiggles just like jiggling down the fucking hallway in Southgate."
01:23:01,280;01:23:03,680;"Yeah, he's wiggling to get his own fucking class."
01:23:03,680;01:23:07,680;"He knows from personal experience what it takes."
01:23:07,680;01:23:13,360;"Just here, they're expertly hemmed to fit his gut precisely."
01:23:13,360;01:23:17,840;"So watching Phil Sims and Greg Gumbel like fawn over him during a"
01:23:17,840;01:23:20,880;"Super Bowl was just like, oh, yeah, that's tough."
01:23:20,880;01:23:23,200;"So that's my worst. Fair enough."
01:23:23,200;01:23:26,000;"Who's the owner now? David Tepper."
01:23:26,000;01:23:29,920;"He's not a billionaire. He seems to be doing good things with the program."
01:23:29,920;01:23:31,680;"Lobby comments."
01:23:33,600;01:23:36,320;"I mean, I'm pretty disassociated at this point."
01:23:36,320;01:23:44,720;"My read on him is like he's cut from the like ambitious entrepreneur cloth."
01:23:44,720;01:23:47,040;"I did look like Jerry Richardson in those seats, but okay."
01:23:47,040;01:23:53,360;"All right. Well, this has been yet another successful season."
01:23:53,360;01:23:55,600;"Bobby, thank you for joining us."
01:23:55,600;01:23:56,800;"Indeed."
01:23:56,800;01:24:02,320;"Steve, Greg, thank you for joining me on this journey again."
01:24:02,320;01:24:03,880;"Greg, thanks for watching the game."
01:24:03,880;01:24:05,440;"Yeah, thanks for watching this game."
01:24:05,440;01:24:07,760;"Thank you for thanking me."
01:24:07,760;01:24:10,080;"Greg, thank you for thanking me for thanking you."
01:24:10,080;01:24:11,320;"You're welcome."
01:24:11,320;01:24:15,320;"And mom for listening."
01:24:15,320;01:24:17,120;"Sometimes you want me to walk for this thing."
01:24:17,120;01:24:18,800;"Shout out, mom."
01:24:18,800;01:24:20,080;"Shout out, mom. I love you."
01:24:20,080;01:24:22,680;"Yeah, for everything."
01:24:22,680;01:24:28,440;"Yeah, and so this wraps up the 2003 NFL season."
01:24:28,440;01:24:32,200;"We'll be back soon with the start of the 2004 season"
01:24:32,200;01:24:35,640;"when eventually we'll probably see the patients lose one day."
01:24:35,640;01:24:37,800;"Maggie keeps rolling, baby."
01:24:37,800;01:24:38,560;"It's been a while."
01:24:38,560;01:24:40,440;"I think we're 16 wins in so far."
01:24:40,440;01:24:42,920;"If only Donovan McNab didn't get tired."
01:24:42,920;01:24:47,480;"Yeah, no, that tummy."
01:24:47,480;01:24:48,800;"OK, he's got a belly."
01:24:48,800;01:24:50,440;"He gets some bad shellfish."

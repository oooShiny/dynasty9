00:06,760;00:08,200;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,200;00:12,640;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,640;00:15,960;"to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid."
00:15,960;00:17,200;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,200;00:18,200;"Go right ahead."
00:18,200;00:20,680;"I am not your mother."
00:20,680;00:23,440;"Okay."
00:23,440;00:29,760;"Hey, welcome back to the special edition really of the"
00:29,760;00:33,600;"pagers.dinesie podcast, a playoff edition. We have made it to"
00:33,600;00:37,320;"the playoffs boys. Congratulations. How you feeling about"
00:37,320;00:42,600;"that? Just like the rest of the Patriots nation in 2001. I"
00:42,600;00:46,680;"didn't think we'd make it this far. It's just another game."
00:48,520;00:49,780;"Business as usual."
00:49,780;00:52,380;"Uh, I don't believe you."
00:52,380;00:54,480;"I appreciate."
00:54,480;00:55,600;"I appreciate the tone."
00:55,600;01:00,040;"It's only the greatest game of the dynasty."
01:00,040;01:01,720;"I'm saying it."
01:01,720;01:02,800;"I'm saying it."
01:02,800;01:03,900;"Okay."
01:03,900;01:05,500;"Media coming out."
01:05,500;01:06,260;"Fire in."
01:06,260;01:07,860;"Let's let's start with that then."
01:07,860;01:09,500;"I want to."
01:09,500;01:10,020;"I want to."
01:10,020;01:12,820;"I want your take on this defend your hot take."
01:12,820;01:18,320;"Dude, this scene, I mean, if you love football, you got a"
01:18,320;01:24,240;"love this game. You know what I'm saying? Just the snow coming down and droves. Yeah, coming"
01:24,240;01:31,240;"down to the last play controversy. Brady putting his stamp on the league. It's just everything"
01:31,240;01:37,080;"like there's so many players that had like they're coming out party today to like Bruce"
01:37,080;01:44,520;"key, see more tie a lot like it was just an unbelievable game. It really was. I mean,"
01:44,520;01:47,220;"I'm not going to argue with you."
01:47,220;01:48,520;"I think it's definitely up there."
01:48,520;01:51,020;"I don't know if it's the best game ever."
01:51,020;01:55,720;"Yeah, but top five at the very least."
01:55,720;01:56,420;"I'm with Andy."
01:56,420;01:56,820;"Yeah."
01:56,820;02:01,020;"In memorable games, I think maybe the best atmosphere."
02:01,020;02:04,820;"Yeah, last game at Fox, but like this."
02:04,820;02:06,320;"So many of you say that this."
02:06,320;02:07,920;"Like it's unbelievable."
02:07,920;02:08,620;"Yeah."
02:08,620;02:12,820;"Maybe I would think I would go so far as to say best non-superable."
02:12,820;02:19,820;"Okay, okay. I can only think of one other game."
02:19,820;02:25,820;"Best non-super game that probably give this a run for its money and that was the one against the Ravens."
02:25,820;02:26,820;"Yeah, I'll see that too."
02:26,820;02:27,820;"That was a good game."
02:27,820;02:36,820;"But this is better than that because like to all the things Greg noted, right, Brady's coming out party in the snow last game of Fox, bro, sort of had a ton of character."
02:36,820;02:38,820;"That's true. Yeah."
02:38,820;02:45,100;"Yeah, just the imagery of every time guys would butt heads, the puff of snow would come"
02:45,100;02:47,020;"off the top of their helmets sort of thing."
02:47,020;02:52,060;"And the Raiders were in black or like, you know, the black trim on it made it even better"
02:52,060;02:55,980;"because the snow versus the black looked so sick."
02:55,980;02:57,500;"It was pretty fast."
02:57,500;03:01,860;"Anytime money gets tackled, they wake up and walk, they get up and they got a face full"
03:01,860;03:02,860;"of snow."
03:02,860;03:03,860;"Yeah."
03:03,860;03:07,560;"It's just every Antoine Smith run ended with it."
03:07,560;03:10,060;"It was like a complete face-mass, but it's no."
03:10,060;03:13,500;"It's the most football football game ever."
03:13,500;03:16,580;"Yeah, it's definitely up there."
03:16,580;03:17,420;"I will."
03:17,420;03:18,340;"Yeah, I'll give you that."
03:18,340;03:19,080;"All right."
03:19,080;03:20,240;"I think you've converted me."
03:20,240;03:22,240;"To the best ever."
03:22,240;03:22,940;"That was easy."
03:22,940;03:24,740;"Best ever."
03:24,740;03:27,020;"Best ever so far on this podcast, for sure."
03:27,020;03:29,180;"That's for sure."
03:29,180;03:32,980;"So let's talk about this game."
03:32,980;03:37,060;"this is like we said last ever game at Foxboro Stadium. It was actually supposed to be"
03:37,060;03:45,060;"a few weeks ago at their last home game, but it was supposed to be demolished by now already."
03:45,060;03:50,340;"Yeah, but it was still standing because they had one more game to play in it, and that was this one."
03:50,340;03:57,780;"So hell of a way to end. Going up against the Raiders who finished first in the AAC West,"
03:57,780;04:02,900;"and I remember them being good. I didn't remember how good they actually were."
04:02,900;04:10,340;"just in terms of numbers there rich Ganon was a pro bowler yet 27 touchdowns and"
04:10,340;04:13,940;"nine interceptions on this season which is the best like interception percentage"
04:13,940;04:17,740;"in the league yeah he was fourth in the league and touchdown passes fifth and"
04:17,740;04:22,220;"passing yards like you the wider seers were Tim Brown Jerry Rice who both had"
04:22,220;04:26,940;"over a thousand yards and both had nine receiving touchdowns like this was a"
04:26,940;04:28,460;"fucking stacked offense."
04:28,460;04:32,580;"I think they're getting old though, weren't they?"
04:32,580;04:36,340;"Yeah, I mean, I think this was like the end of Jared"
04:36,340;04:37,340;"Rice's career, obviously."
04:37,340;04:41,180;"I think this year, the year after was when he went to"
04:41,180;04:42,860;"Seattle for his last year."
04:42,860;04:43,660;"Yeah."
04:43,660;04:45,820;"They went to the Super Bowl the next year, though."
04:45,820;04:47,340;"They did."
04:47,340;04:47,540;"Yeah."
04:47,540;04:49,980;"As he on that team, I think I think he I think he was."
04:49,980;04:50,220;"Yeah."
04:50,220;04:51,180;"That makes sense."
04:51,180;04:53,380;"Right."
04:53,380;04:56,900;"Cause Gruden would Gruden would leave Oakland after this year."
04:56,900;05:00,740;"Alright, go to Tampa and then they would play each other in the Super Bowl next year."
05:00,740;05:05,780;"Alright, I actually have a really hardcore Raiders fan so we interviewed him about this."
05:05,780;05:09,300;"Oh, that's right. We did. Yeah, let's go to that real quick."
05:09,300;05:22,420;"Oh boy. Alright, we got my friend Navi joining us. Navi is the biggest Oakland Raiders fan that I"
05:22,420;05:25,860;"I know actually only Oakland Raiders and that I know"
05:25,860;05:29,700;"Oh, yeah"
05:29,700;05:32,860;"About a bad start"
05:32,860;05:36,900;"So I've known Navi for I don't know close 10 years or so"
05:36,900;05:41,620;"You've always been a doctor. I can don't says Navi Raiders guy"
05:41,620;05:50,060;"Everybody everybody keeps saying that but I don't know if they know the real sea brave"
05:50,620;05:52,620;"That's there. I'm saying that's not true"
05:52,620;05:55,620;"Delilah a great tradition"
05:55,620;06:01,980;"Great fourth July party and obvious. Maybe take too many blue-blue shots. Yeah"
06:01,980;06:05,580;"So this is our payback making him relive"
06:05,580;06:11,420;"The Patriots Raiders play well, he said before we started this he said he actually went back and rewashed his game"
06:11,420;06:19,200;"Yeah, that's crazy. Yeah, I should just rewatched it just finished up like an hour ago. Yeah, I mean it was an exciting game"
06:20,140;06:22,140;"Yeah, yes, yeah, I"
06:22,140;06:29,860;"Yeah, I think the it would be like us going back and watching the 2007 Super Bowl"
06:29,860;06:33,900;"It's an exciting game, but it doesn't end the way I want to I don't know if I'll watch it"
06:33,900;06:36,620;"Yeah, I mean it felt"
06:36,620;06:42,220;"It felt just dominance by the Raiders until the fourth quarter and you know second half actually Brady was just"
06:42,220;06:48,540;"long fire just think it dunk passes and you know the snow definitely came in a factor where everybody slipped in"
06:48,540;06:51,720;"I mean even David Patton was looking but he was still catching the ball"
06:51,720;06:56,640;"Yeah, David Patton's gonna catch more balls after you'd fallen down the beforehand. I felt like in this game"
06:56,640;06:59,540;"Yeah, I did exactly"
06:59,540;07:04,420;"You know, I think every time he cut a ball. That was like a first down like it was like a 10 yard pass"
07:04,420;07:10,380;"He would fall down get back at it. Yeah, he's like honest. You remember watching the game the first time Navi"
07:10,380;07:12,340;"Yeah"
07:12,340;07:16,420;"Hold me. Yeah, hang on. Let's let's rewind a little bit. So"
07:17,420;07:23,420;"Are you from the Oakland area originally? No, no, I'm born and raised in Northern, Virginia"
07:23,420;07:27,780;"Little backstory how they became a Raider fan is really yeah"
07:27,780;07:31,060;"Just"
07:31,060;07:35,400;"Hip-hop actually was like more like the one way that you know the Raider brand was always shown"
07:35,400;07:37,860;"I was like a little young kid. I love hip-hop"
07:37,860;07:45,660;"You know and then just hearing about the Raiders defense back in the days how like dirty how hardcore they were"
07:46,820;07:54,100;"Oh Jackson, you know, it was everywhere you playing, you know, the Bo Jackson technical game, but really how truly became reader fan was"
07:54,100;08:03,140;"Watching the Michigan Ohio State game and watching Charles Woods and just take that punt return back for a touchdown. Oh"
08:03,140;08:06,340;"Yeah, we did the Heisman pose at the end"
08:06,340;08:11,940;"Yeah, it was kind of like my first like, you know, college football game that actually like vividly you remember"
08:12,300;08:18,820;"My man that fucking just badass and little you know actually know he's drafted by the Raiders"
08:18,820;08:25,420;"Boom got all the color jerseys, you know for the trolls with I got the white got the black at the silver"
08:25,420;08:29,420;"You know just then on out it was just a show"
08:29,420;08:33,660;"See we have more version of capital for Greg. Yeah"
08:33,660;08:40,380;"With a tie law every single variation of Jersey like pro bowl tie law jerseys"
08:40,380;08:43,640;"which apparently making a probo white pull probo red"
08:43,640;08:48,240;"Red which never actually wore but he has it"
08:48,240;08:50,680;"Yeah, it was just like you know"
08:50,680;08:56,040;"Just like getting older and like you know just kind of like looking back at the Raiders"
08:56,040;09:01,800;"You know I'm looking at Jack Tatum Lester Hayes all them just whooping people's asses playing dirty"
09:01,800;09:07,160;"Ted Hedrick's the lab actors can go on and on you know the tradition like no other like"
09:07,680;09:12,320;"Then Raiders are just you know you can't put a city name and phone. They're just the Raiders"
09:12,320;09:16,600;"How do you feel about that movie do you know I love to move here?"
09:16,600;09:22,980;"I love it you go from a 13.3 sales income tax or whatever, you know state tax to a zero"
09:22,980;09:29,320;"No, sure all these all these players even look at it like hey, I get more money now. Yeah in my pocket. I"
09:29,320;09:32,440;"Still"
09:32,440;09:36,600;"for that exact same reason. Not just because it would be closer for me."
09:36,600;09:44,200;"Hey man, Meg, if that thing looks like, uh, what does that start with?"
09:44,200;09:48,280;"Yeah, it looks awesome. That's right. Yeah. That's right now."
09:48,280;09:52,680;"Yeah. It seems like the perfect fit though. The Raiders, like, like you said, that whole"
09:52,680;09:59,480;"brand of like the black hole plus it seems like a, like that's a way more of a fit than like the"
09:59,480;10:04,760;"chargers in LA. The charges in LA, they should be the no-mad team. They"
10:04,760;10:09,720;"shouldn't even have a home game. I know. They can't complain on the road."
10:09,720;10:16,760;"They haven't no one. Yeah, but yeah, I mean, the Vegas stadium, I mean, who's gonna say no to a"
10:16,760;10:25,160;"free $2 billion brand new stadium? Right, exactly. You know, but yeah, from there, nothing about the"
10:25,160;10:32,660;"Raiders and I've gone through the black hole, the dark, dark, dark days of being a Raiders fan."
10:32,660;10:33,860;"So I don't think any of them were."
10:33,860;10:35,160;"There were a few of them in there."
10:35,160;10:36,360;"This wasn't that time though."
10:36,360;10:39,760;"This was a good time to be a Raiders fan with the jungle."
10:39,760;10:40,760;"Yeah, this was a good time."
10:40,760;10:49,160;"So the, that Tuck Roll was the change of the, you know, the guard of the Raiders."
10:49,160;10:53,360;"So that team right there that played the Patriots and that Tuck Roll, that was that."
10:53,360;10:56,520;"and then following season was a very veteran team."
10:56,520;11:00,400;"Like you had barely any young players on that team."
11:00,400;11:03,480;"I mean, I think Charlie Gardner might've been"
11:03,480;11:04,880;"one of the youngest players on the team."
11:04,880;11:06,560;"Charles Woodson might've been one of the youngest players"
11:06,560;11:07,720;"on the team."
11:07,720;11:09,440;"- Yeah, they mentioned that in the broadcast too."
11:09,440;11:11,200;"- Yeah, they did mention that."
11:11,200;11:12,480;"You look back at it, you're looking at those,"
11:12,480;11:15,480;"like, you know, Eric Allen's up there."
11:15,480;11:17,200;"I mean, they did have a first round pitch,"
11:17,200;11:20,200;"Eric Gibson from Florida State, but I mean, he was,"
11:20,200;11:23,240;"you know, they're sprinkling in young guys,"
11:23,240;11:27,400;"But yeah, but I mean the Patriots are kind of a similar story too because"
11:27,400;11:33,600;"Belichick had literally they've been talking about it all season how they had gone in and brought in like"
11:33,600;11:37,700;"18 or 20 veteran free agents and all of them were like"
11:37,700;11:44,680;"10 plus year vets just to get that that sort of like set in the tone of the like what the team's gonna be"
11:44,680;11:49,640;"I mean you could have done that back in the day, but now I feel like it was a young man's game"
11:50,200;11:55,700;"You guys are just harder faster and just better, you know coming out you don't have"
11:55,700;12:01,880;"240 pound linebackers are playing three downs. No, well, yeah"
12:01,880;12:07,400;"Thumper that's just exactly the little I back cuz we're there just to stop the run so yeah"
12:07,400;12:12,880;"Yeah, yeah, Ryan Cox into the world right. Yeah, even the Teddy Bruce geez is I'm like I"
12:12,880;12:17,080;"Forgot about rum and fight for it was on leg on your team. Yeah"
12:18,440;12:21,720;"You know looking at who's that pleasant guy or something else on the deep"
12:21,720;12:25,640;"Yeah, I just remember playing out. I'm like, holy shit, man"
12:25,640;12:29,240;"It's like a memory like a trip back memory Lane. I know because you I"
12:29,240;12:35,800;"Just I'd honestly forgot Jerry Rice's even in this game. Oh man. I mean"
12:35,800;12:40,360;"Yeah, they both"
12:40,360;12:42,360;"Tim Brown both had a thousand yards each"
12:42,360;12:46,960;"When they only like 30 yards apart in the whole season - they're both over like 1100 yards"
12:47,200;12:51,120;"Yeah, I'm touched and then I'm trying to get right to the good"
12:51,120;12:59,200;"Outside of Sam Fran. I mean let's just forget about it Seattle Seahawks days, but he was a beast for the raid"
12:59,200;13:01,800;"I mean you look at it now. I was like"
13:01,800;13:04,560;"Guru didn't want to Antonio Brown to be his Jerry Rice"
13:04,560;13:08,320;"But let's not revisit that last summer debacle, but"
13:12,960;13:15,880;"That was a worse hangover I ever had but um no"
13:15,880;13:21,060;"I mean you had those two receivers who had Charlie Gardner who had like I don't know 75 catches on the year"
13:21,060;13:26,160;"James jet barely sprinkled in there then you have John Richie and"
13:26,160;13:32,160;"Our Ted N was rolling Williams before Doug joy and all these other guys came around but yeah"
13:32,160;13:35,600;"I mean John Richie was catching balls out the backfield. That's a big boy"
13:35,600;13:42,320;"Yeah, just the size of the players in these old games as I mean"
13:42,320;13:48,080;"a linebacker now is alignment. Yeah. Yeah. Every single one of these guys looks like they"
13:48,080;13:54,280;"could play fullback. If you're a problem in cities NFL. Definitely. Definitely. But"
13:54,280;14:00,480;"yeah, I mean, that team right there, man, like PTSD man, that talk rule is just right"
14:00,480;14:05,360;"here. I forgot about it. So you have to be other day and I was like this motherfucker."
14:05,360;14:08,360;"Well, that's what I say."
14:08,360;14:09,360;"Yeah."
14:09,360;14:10,360;"Yeah."
14:10,360;14:15,920;"I mean, that team was like off and on again team that year because I mean, they closed"
14:15,920;14:17,720;"the season out with three losses."
14:17,720;14:18,720;"They did."
14:18,720;14:19,720;"Yeah."
14:19,720;14:21,560;"So actually, I wanted to ask you about this because you'll probably know better than we"
14:21,560;14:27,680;"will because the last loss, which gave Patriots the two seed was to the New York Jets."
14:27,680;14:31,400;"And I feel like I remember something because then they had to play the Jets like say,"
14:31,400;14:34,000;"they had to play the Jader in the wild card."
14:34,000;14:35,000;"Yep."
14:35,000;14:42,120;"like I remember a story about how the Raiders played the first game in the kind of pretty"
14:42,120;14:48,040;"vanilla because they didn't want to give it. The Jets had to show what they had to be"
14:48,040;14:50,680;"because they need to win to get in the playoffs and the Raiders didn't."
14:50,680;14:57,720;"Yeah, it happened. I'm trying to remember that little thing there but I mean it's happened"
14:57,720;15:02,120;"quite a few times in the early 2000s where teams would actually do that. I wouldn't put"
15:02,120;15:05,960;"it passed, Gruden, you know, saying, Hey, let's just, you know,"
15:05,960;15:10,360;"just dog is one out, you know, I don't think he would actually"
15:10,360;15:13,480;"say it, but you know, he kept it very vanilla. I mean, they"
15:13,480;15:15,080;"were their judges last and next week."
15:15,080;15:17,720;"They did. Yeah. And that I actually watched a highlight for"
15:17,720;15:18,800;"that. That was a really good game."
15:18,800;15:23,760;"The 24 something and got sealed on an 80 yard touchdown run by"
15:23,760;15:24,880;"Charlie Garner."
15:24,880;15:27,480;"Charlie Garner local Virginia kid, man."
15:27,480;15:30,280;"I don't know. I had forgotten who Charlie Gardner was, to be"
15:30,280;15:31,200;"honest. I was like,"
15:31,720;15:33,920;"He was a beast for us."
15:33,920;15:35,760;"I mean, you had to"
15:35,760;15:37,480;"Who's your favorite player on that team?"
15:37,480;15:39,400;"My favorite player on that team was Charles"
15:39,400;15:40,280;"with his hands out."
15:40,280;15:42,280;"No, no. Yeah."
15:42,280;15:43,400;"I mean, if you want to go"
15:43,400;15:45,800;"away all the time."
15:45,800;15:47,080;"Yeah."
15:47,080;15:49,240;"Shoo."
15:49,240;15:51,400;"I mean, I really love Jack"
15:51,400;15:52,400;"Tate in this game."
15:52,400;15:55,040;"I feel kind of an asshole for saying, you know,"
15:55,040;15:56,040;"him."
15:56,040;15:57,200;"The guy was"
15:57,200;16:00,200;"insane and like just ruthless."
16:00,640;16:06,640;"Yeah, you know, yeah, a scumbag like after football, but I mean, yeah,"
16:06,640;16:10,200;"playing for the Raiders is was he a linebacker in those days?"
16:10,200;16:14,600;"You can hate it was that he was the inbox safety for them to strong"
16:14,600;16:16,920;"safety. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
16:16,920;16:21,200;"I mean, the cheat, you know, the obvious things would be charged with some"
16:21,200;16:27,280;"all time for Raider because that personally made me. But I would have to go."
16:27,280;16:29,280;"It's a toss-up between how he long and"
16:29,280;16:38,160;"You can't say Bojackner he wasn't there that long I'd say him and Marcus Allen"
16:38,160;16:47,240;"Marked down on all over the rescue full highlights that I watched. I mean living here. Yeah, I just can't stop bringing it up to all these guys around here"
16:47,240;16:49,720;"But now how long is my favorite raider?"
16:49,720;16:55,560;"One because he's a local he lives around here and I actually met the guy once funny story that I"
16:56,800;17:01,880;"literally opened the door to a friend's girlfriend's house and him and his younger son"
17:01,880;17:06,540;"We're at the front door and I was like home over I was like wait"
17:06,540;17:17,720;"Yeah, it was like a worse way to meet somebody"
17:17,720;17:23,640;"Yeah, and then you know bring it back to like the movie broken arrow if you ever watched that"
17:25,120;17:26,120;"Who was that?"
17:26,120;17:27,120;"A long time ago."
17:27,120;17:28,120;"Yeah."
17:28,120;17:29,120;"Remember that movie Broken Arrow?"
17:29,120;17:30,120;"Yeah."
17:30,120;17:31,120;"It was just later."
17:31,120;17:32,120;"Yeah."
17:32,120;17:33,120;"How long was in it?"
17:33,120;17:35,120;"I was in the rock."
17:35,120;17:36,120;"Yeah."
17:36,120;17:37,120;"Jesus."
17:37,120;17:40,120;"That's a throwback right there."
17:40,120;17:41,120;"No kidding."
17:41,120;17:42,120;"Yeah."
17:42,120;17:47,640;"So there's too many Raiders to say, but like my favorite all time Raider if I can't say"
17:47,640;17:49,120;"Trolls wasn't would be how we long."
17:49,120;17:50,120;"All right."
17:50,120;17:54,120;"How did you feel about that, uh, the Gruden trade when I went down?"
17:54,120;18:01,640;"down. That was the only cost for us. L. Davis, trading for a first round pick, we ended up being"
18:01,640;18:10,200;"Phil Buchanan from the U, my favorite college team, but still wasn't worth it. I mean fast forward"
18:10,200;18:15,560;"to next season, you know, both Cal hands are coach and yeah. Coming up, we got to play"
18:15,560;18:22,520;"Gruden and the Super Bowl and this guy knows literally every single play. And"
18:22,520;18:27,280;"from the stories that you know we heard is Callie Ann Liddley's ""Sabotage the Super"
18:27,280;18:30,840;"Bowl"" and played right into Gruden's hands and you could hear like an"
18:30,840;18:35,120;"highlights on NFL films James, John Lynch is literally saying that's the play."
18:35,120;18:39,440;"You know there's literally calling out the place. It's going here, it's going there."
18:39,440;18:42,200;"I'm just sitting here like all right this is the worst movie ever kind of done."
18:42,200;18:44,520;"like we could have kept good and got a Super Bowl."
18:44,520;18:45,760;"What a fucking Super Bowl."
18:45,760;18:46,400;"Yeah."
18:46,400;18:47,840;"All day."
18:47,840;18:49,080;"Good, like forces way out."
18:49,080;18:50,560;"I don't remember like how that all came about."
18:50,560;18:51,280;"No, he didn't force."
18:51,280;18:52,760;"He didn't force his way out at all."
18:52,760;18:59,840;"Um, I think it was something to do with ego a little bit, but I mean, we won't"
18:59,840;19:00,640;"know the true story."
19:00,640;19:06,000;"Good and obviously kick back and, you know, Mark Davis loves good and"
19:06,000;19:07,520;"and Al Day was always dead love."
19:07,520;19:07,760;"Good."
19:07,760;19:08,200;"And but."
19:08,200;19:10,560;"You know, who knows?"
19:11,080;19:15,440;"Yeah, there's a dark times between the two times he was there. Yeah."
19:15,440;19:19,240;"Really, there's probably something that happened behind closed doors, but"
19:19,240;19:25,240;"yeah, it's probably similar to the Brady Bellachek thing too. Like, you'll probably never know."
19:25,240;19:28,640;"You'll never know exactly what actually happened."
19:28,640;19:35,120;"David said, but yeah, we'll definitely never know because we don't want to ever say the next person aiming"
19:35,120;19:38,440;"Trask won't ever say who's how David's right hand woman"
19:38,440;19:46,300;"But you know that was the end of the Raiders because right then and there that was like that bad omen after that Super Bowl defeat"
19:46,300;19:47,800;"which I"
19:47,800;19:54,220;"Said of my friend's house in his basement took off, my jersey and didn't say word the rest of the game"
19:54,220;19:56,220;"Like we're gonna have kicked on like"
19:56,220;20:02,040;"And then here come I felt that for our first half in the Super Bowl before"
20:03,000;20:06,820;"Yes, yeah, it's paper and it's shitty. I rather"
20:06,820;20:12,560;"You know having anything else happen. I don't know what I can describe, but yeah, no I"
20:12,560;20:15,240;"It's a words bill. Yeah"
20:15,240;20:22,040;"I don't like we're kind of going through that with with the departure birdie - just with everything the way it's happened"
20:22,040;20:28,580;"Just it doesn't yeah, I don't know. I mean you guys you guys are spoiled you got oh absolutely"
20:28,580;20:31,640;"You know, you know"
20:32,280;20:36,320;"European fired and then your best target straight it and we got Brady leaving"
20:36,320;20:39,240;"Yeah, the self or the Celtics"
20:39,240;20:44,780;"Yeah, the Celtics in the Bruins. I think we're both in first place when both seasons got suspended so we'll never know what happened"
20:44,780;20:46,780;"I mean there so"
20:46,780;20:49,440;"Sports right now all"
20:49,440;20:54,780;"The next team I mean everyone knows I got what not football"
20:54,780;20:58,720;"They more basketball season, but those kids that were born on"
20:59,560;21:03,060;"That will never like never say shit about anybody else"
21:03,060;21:08,240;"Because they've seen so many championships come through that city. It's unreal"
21:08,240;21:11,920;"Yeah, it's bananas. I don't understand"
21:11,920;21:15,200;"I'm a little worried about what's gonna happen"
21:15,200;21:20,600;"Yeah, we'll see I mean it'll be you know trust the process pretty much right"
21:20,600;21:25,560;"You never know we trust I mean it's work so far"
21:25,800;21:31,920;"I've always I've always been interested in not what Raiders fans think of their owner like obviously we love RKK"
21:31,920;21:41,560;"Good guy, but he's a you know he needs to obviously sell some assets and get somebody with fatter pockets"
21:41,560;21:48,320;"Because him waiting for Vegas and all this Vegas money is gonna take time and I don't know what they think and he's definitely"
21:48,320;21:51,240;"Brought the franchise down. You know he's trying to do good"
21:52,080;21:55,340;"But you know cash flow is definitely an issue everybody knows that"
21:55,340;21:58,580;"You know well that's the rumors, but"
21:58,580;22:01,460;"You know on the way the contracts are being made"
22:01,460;22:05,380;"They're a little funny, you know, they're money upfront because there won't be money later"
22:05,380;22:11,700;"I don't know, but it's good guy good intentions shitty owner when it comes to like, you know pockets wise"
22:11,700;22:13,700;"He's probably one of the poorest owners"
22:13,700;22:17,380;"Now not later"
22:17,380;22:22,380;"Yeah, I think that's an awesome haircut though that definitely"
22:22,380;22:28,380;"comes right. Oh my gosh. That's a bad ass haircut. I've been on"
22:28,380;22:33,380;"Bring Back the Bullcut campaign for a long time now and Greg. You know, you"
22:33,380;22:36,380;"see him going up to those U of T games and those hockey games that weren't all"
22:36,380;22:43,380;"white were all white suit. Yes, the track suits. Yeah, he's. Yeah, man. He's"
22:43,380;22:46,540;"Yes, he is the most swag and out of all the NFL owners."
22:46,540;22:51,140;"It's almost like it's out negative swag, but it's kind of like looped back around."
22:51,140;22:52,580;"Exactly."
22:52,580;22:53,900;"It's so bad."
22:53,900;22:56,100;"Exactly."
22:56,100;22:56,780;"It's so bad."
22:56,780;22:58,660;"I agree."
22:58,660;22:59,220;"I agree."
22:59,220;23:02,740;"I'm just glad we're out of that shit hole stadium that smells like shit."
23:02,740;23:03,860;"Yeah."
23:03,860;23:07,140;"Well, I mean, this this is us in 2001."
23:07,140;23:08,020;"Get out of a shit."
23:08,020;23:09,860;"I'm going to give you then at the old."
23:09,860;23:11,060;"Later stadium."
23:11,060;23:16,180;"Uh, I didn't go to many. I only been there twice. Um, I've gone all around."
23:16,180;23:21,380;"My favorite scene in the business and watch a game was Nashville. So anytime the Raiders play"
23:21,380;23:26,100;"there, I'd always try and get there. Yeah, I mean Greg, go into that one. Yeah, yeah."
23:26,100;23:30,100;"You kicked out of my side. I didn't really enjoy it that much."
23:30,100;23:39,940;"I enjoyed it. We won recently down there. Um, was on TV. Got a text message from a mom."
23:39,940;23:41,940;"put your fucking jersey back on."
23:41,940;23:42,940;"Drunk ass."
23:42,940;23:43,940;"[LAUGHTER]"
23:43,940;23:45,940;"Were you sure it was again?"
23:45,940;23:46,940;"Uh, yup."
23:46,940;23:48,940;"Because we were in the anthem."
23:48,940;23:51,940;"We were right behind the goal post, second row."
23:51,940;23:53,940;"It was hot as balls that day."
23:53,940;23:54,940;"We were wearing black jerseys."
23:54,940;23:55,940;"Let Davis Murray scored."
23:55,940;23:57,940;"He threw the football, started celebrating."
23:57,940;23:58,940;"We took off our jersey."
23:58,940;23:59,940;"I took off our jersey."
23:59,940;24:00,940;"I was hammered."
24:00,940;24:02,940;"And waving it around."
24:02,940;24:03,940;"All happy and shit."
24:03,940;24:04,940;"And next night I get that text."
24:04,940;24:05,940;"I just put your fucking jersey back."
24:05,940;24:06,940;"And I'm like, all right."
24:06,940;24:19,420;"I love going there to the Raiders stadium, you know, for the games, but and it's not like shit and weed"
24:19,420;24:23,580;"- combo"
24:23,580;24:26,540;"That's what it looks like it smells like on TV. I"
24:26,540;24:32,940;"They're smoking in the systems. Oh, yeah, they're there everybody's high as balls there"
24:32,940;24:36,380;"They just don't give a fuck there"
24:36,380;24:38,300;"Yeah, that's on the fence."
24:38,300;24:40,380;"That's why it works perfectly for Vegas."
24:40,380;24:41,380;"Yeah."
24:41,380;24:42,380;"Yeah."
24:42,380;24:43,380;"Yeah."
24:43,380;24:44,380;"No rules, baby."
24:44,380;24:45,380;"Yeah."
24:45,380;24:50,340;"It'll be weird to see how Vegas turns out because I feel like the first few years, it'll be"
24:50,340;24:53,740;"like a show for all these away fans to come to."
24:53,740;24:55,940;"Yeah, of course."
24:55,940;24:59,340;"They got to spend like $800,000 for like a shitty seat."
24:59,340;25:00,580;"That's crazy."
25:00,580;25:03,940;"It's going to be insane for the prices in Vegas."
25:03,940;25:04,940;"We'll see."
25:04,940;25:10,020;"I'll be going there with Greer to see a bills game. So let's see how much money we fork over for tickets"
25:10,020;25:17,180;"But think about the in that game betting you can do from your seat. Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, you can make that money back"
25:17,180;25:19,740;"Yeah, that is true"
25:19,740;25:26,460;"It's very true. I'm not a big guy to go to games and watch them because I love watching all football games and like gambling"
25:26,460;25:30,940;"So it's like yeah, hope I go to a game. That's like a game. Where's the only game there?"
25:32,180;25:36,940;"I don't know if that's gonna be against the bills, but just throw that in a man"
25:36,940;25:42,460;"Their track record has not been good little we'll put that way"
25:42,460;25:51,020;"So"
25:51,020;25:55,660;"Yeah a couple more questions real quick as a writer's fan"
25:55,660;25:59,300;"How do you see the Patriots like what do you think of the Patriots?"
26:00,340;26:04,980;"At first I hated him and then I hated Brady a lot"
26:04,980;26:09,780;"But then like social media Brady coming out and just the way he like"
26:09,780;26:12,620;"Just put out these videos"
26:12,620;26:18,240;"Like his TV 12 stuff is I don't know I love Tom Brady the person"
26:18,240;26:22,660;"just like I'll like cool and like you know"
26:22,660;26:28,260;"Like all nature is and then there's Brady the Patriots. I mean you got to give respect"
26:28,260;26:31,480;"I've been young you hate you know teams"
26:31,480;26:35,720;"But yeah, I still fucking hate them for that"
26:35,720;26:44,480;"So I don't know if you'll actually have answer this one, but do you have a favorite Patriots Raiders game?"
26:44,480;26:48,560;"No"
26:48,560;26:53,920;"Guess it's kind of true"
26:55,960;27:01,440;"I don't know when's the last time we beat you guys couldn't tell you it's I think it's been a while"
27:01,440;27:06,860;"Yeah, the last time we got close was when grok"
27:06,860;27:09,960;"Was playing and I think"
27:09,960;27:13,440;"We barely lost that game. I think it was like a"
27:13,440;27:19,040;"It was a very close game if I remember it was like, I don't know 10 13 is only that"
27:19,040;27:24,360;"That's why we got yeah, you know, if I'm trying to think was even on the radar team that year"
27:24,360;27:38,680;"Yeah, so yeah, let's see the last time the Raiders beat the Patriots was 2002"
27:38,680;27:47,240;"week 11. No, that was the following season. Yeah, yeah, it would have been. Yeah, the revenge"
27:47,240;28:00,920;"I suppose yeah 27 27 20 the 27 20 yeah and then no that was kind of it and then before that was 19 well actually that's not true"
28:00,920;28:11,760;"81 when they were still in Oakland, but I'm sure the LA Raiders beat them at some point too. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, they did they deadly dad. I remember seeing a highlight"
28:11,760;28:15,480;"Yeah now the Raiders"
28:15,480;28:25,400;"Yeah, we haven't beat you guys up forever. I can't tell you what my favorite game. I"
28:25,400;28:32,480;"don't remember the 2002 games, if you're honest. It's a blur to me. I gotta like go back."
28:32,480;28:38,840;"Would you have always wondered what people thought of them drafting to Marcus Russell?"
28:38,840;28:41,240;"Like when you drafted him, were you hyped?"
28:41,240;28:42,240;"Fuck no."
28:42,240;28:49,240;"I believed in playing Kiffin. If he got Calvin Johnson, he would have found a way to do something else."
28:49,240;28:51,240;"Yeah, yeah."
28:51,240;28:58,240;"Yeah, it's, and then it's like, yeah, I mean, I would have loved to have him."
28:58,240;29:06,240;"Without the air and rock, no, Aaron Rodgers here was when we drafted Robert Gallery."
29:06,240;29:13,760;"Oh, undertaker, the guy from Iowa over, you know, Aaron Rodgers, we could have used a quarterback."
29:13,760;29:14,760;"Oops."
29:14,760;29:21,000;"Imagine Aaron Rodgers and Calvin Johnson, the same team and the Raiders."
29:21,000;29:22,000;"Oh, yeah."
29:22,000;29:23,000;"Yeah."
29:23,000;29:25,200;"That would have been borderline unstoppable."
29:25,200;29:26,200;"Very much."
29:26,200;29:30,760;"And then you got Jerry Porter over there, you know, it was our young buck receiver."
29:30,760;29:33,600;"That would have been a nice little few years there."
29:33,600;29:35,600;"That would have been all right, wouldn't it?"
29:35,600;29:42,000;"Instead you had that's cool. Raiders living in the water. What is the you know they called it a fumble"
29:42,000;29:50,880;"Steve around I'm pretty sure that's every single franchise fans other than the Patriots if we're being honest"
29:50,880;29:57,840;"Yeah, I should do it. We did and distract your franchise quarterback with the 199th pick done"
29:57,840;30:05,340;"I don't know when the next I'm gonna draft a quarterback that I mean I think our quarterback of the future is what you on the team and Marcus mario"
30:05,340;30:11,940;"But that's just me. Oh, that's a hot take. Yeah, you know, we don't really see the meat"
30:11,940;30:19,500;"Yeah, this might come out eight weeks from now so in two months that might actually be"
30:19,500;30:26,980;"I mean, they're pretty great in the system, but the guy's not mobile enough. He's not"
30:26,980;30:29,780;"confident enough to use his legs and"
30:30,580;30:33,380;"And to make smarter plays like the guy for fuck's sake"
30:33,380;30:36,900;"He ran out of bounds on fourth and goal or something like that"
30:36,900;30:38,900;"Like I remember like he was close as though"
30:38,900;30:41,940;"Just give somebody the time to make a play like give somebody a chance"
30:41,940;30:48,020;"Marcus mariota would have never done that stupid ass play and get booed out of your fucking stadium in the last game this season"
30:48,020;30:50,660;"I've just feel like you could step for the offense"
30:50,660;30:55,940;"That's just me but you know, it's made out of one quarterback. There's a reason why his contracts"
30:55,940;30:59,380;"Like packed with incentives"
31:00,020;31:01,020;"Oh, that's right. Yeah."
31:01,020;31:05,420;"I mean, you could two years, you can make up to $47 million."
31:05,420;31:06,320;"That's nuts."
31:06,320;31:07,320;"Even though he's a bass."
31:07,320;31:09,920;"Oh, yeah."
31:09,920;31:10,920;"Crazy."
31:10,920;31:13,120;"That's a lot like what acting you like."
31:13,120;31:14,920;"What the fuck like?"
31:14,920;31:16,920;"There's a small leash for Derek."
31:16,920;31:18,920;"I feel like."
31:18,920;31:20,920;"Yeah, does we seem like that?"
31:20,920;31:22,320;"It's good."
31:22,320;31:25,020;"I mean, with that contract the way it is, it just feels weird."
31:25,020;31:27,920;"I mean, yeah, they'll probably be happy with our for a few weeks."
31:27,920;31:29,820;"But like when they start losing and they like."
31:29,820;31:33,020;"You know, losing because the past games I work in are youth just fucking up."
31:33,020;31:34,900;"Mario's gonna be right there."
31:34,900;31:36,980;"That's true. Yeah."
31:36,980;31:41,220;"That's the actual first backup quarterback we've had that actually"
31:41,220;31:43,300;"challenged him to take his job."
31:43,300;31:45,460;"Yeah."
31:45,460;31:47,300;"The names of backup quarterback."
31:47,300;31:48,420;"So, no, it's not been."
31:48,420;31:53,900;"No, I think our best work has been Matt McLoyan."
31:53,900;31:58,020;"Oh my goodness."
31:59,620;32:03,340;"Best is a I think you're using that word loosely, but yeah, yeah"
32:03,340;32:09,380;"I'd even throw Bruce Gratkowski in because he beat Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh with Lewis Murphy. I remember that"
32:09,380;32:15,820;"Jason Campbell was decent like I heard but you know feeling Redskins guy, right?"
32:15,820;32:21,780;"Yeah, I mean he was decent play got hurt and then here comes huge accent tossing a first round pick a"
32:21,780;32:24,420;"Carson fun camera, but"
32:24,740;32:30,160;"Well, pom was that right at the time there I man, but he didn't want to play for the Raiders"
32:30,160;32:32,160;"He went from the Bengals to the Raiders come on"
32:32,160;32:35,240;"What were your thoughts on the rainy Moser?"
32:35,240;32:40,060;"Oh the rainy monster it was just garbage Andrew Walters"
32:40,060;32:44,620;"Tran through a rainy moss the ball and rainy moss did not want to be there the guy was"
32:44,620;32:46,880;"F-speed"
32:46,880;32:49,160;"He just didn't give a fuck he was getting paid"
32:50,240;32:55,240;"It's true. You like this when you came to the Patriots and was awesome or you're like, yeah, of course that happened"
32:55,240;32:58,400;"Of course that was gonna happen. Everybody knew that fucking happened"
32:58,400;33:04,280;"I just wish we were got something better than a fourth round pick. That's true. Yeah, they actually gave up more for Wes Welker that year"
33:04,280;33:06,280;"They gave up like a second and something else"
33:06,280;33:14,000;"Never fucking trade with the Patriots. I mean we gave up a first for fucking Richard Seymour"
33:14,000;33:19,080;"That's true when we the best thing Richard Seymour every day was punch being bad in the face"
33:19,840;33:21,840;"That's right. I"
33:21,840;33:26,200;"Know that that's gotta be like a top ten moment"
33:26,200;33:30,860;"Yeah, that's the way did you talk about that that Raiders defense and that attitude you talk"
33:30,860;33:36,120;"Yeah, I think that was actually the game that Bruce got casket through Lewis Murphy the game winning touchdown, too"
33:36,120;33:43,400;"Oh, you might remember this at all. Yeah that game was gonna do it was a complete shit show. I"
33:43,400;33:47,160;"Mean that's totally worth a first round pick though, right? Yeah"
33:48,520;33:55,140;"It makes sense fucking to respect brother. Yeah, we can all agree on that. Oh, yeah, I'll take him over"
33:55,140;33:58,240;"Who's a little guy?"
33:58,240;34:00,240;"We're not stupid. No"
34:00,240;34:03,600;"Then we go fucks"
34:03,600;34:07,980;"Hey, brash. I'll take big Ben over to brush out the greatest dealer quarterback"
34:07,980;34:15,000;"Oh, that's another hot take you full of them. That is yeah fire very brash. I was his stats were shit"
34:15,000;34:17,100;"I mean, you know, there was just more like"
34:18,080;34:21,460;"Yeah, he was like the Trent Dilfer of the team. I was gonna say yeah"
34:21,460;34:26,040;"That that what they call the steel curtain"
34:26,040;34:32,320;"Yeah, well the questions you got"
34:32,320;34:36,360;"That was all the ones I had"
34:36,360;34:42,720;"Have you got any questions? No, I definitely wanted to know how you felt about Randy Moss"
34:42,720;34:45,280;"I'm glad I got that out there"
34:45,280;34:48,840;"Yeah, what's funny actually is about the Randy Moss thing is"
34:48,840;34:52,800;"About Randy Moss Jersey"
34:52,800;34:54,520;"Oh no"
34:54,520;34:55,520;"And"
34:55,520;34:57,960;"Then I believe"
34:57,960;35:06,400;"We traded him one year later. No, no, no. Oh, sorry. Hold on rewind rewind so I had a"
35:06,400;35:09,480;"Napoleon Harris Jersey. He was a linebacker"
35:09,480;35:12,120;"I'm in the rain. Yeah"
35:12,120;35:14,680;"It was good, right?"
35:14,680;35:18,680;"And, you know, super excited, like, dang, I got a jersey."
35:18,680;35:20,280;"You know, the sign back is going to be here for a while."
35:20,280;35:22,680;"He's a beast, getting 150-some tackles."
35:22,680;35:26,180;"Next offseason, he was traded to Minnesota for reigning moss."
35:26,180;35:27,180;"I'm like, oh, shit."
35:27,180;35:31,080;"One of my sisters, you know, it's going to go, you know, right"
35:31,080;35:32,480;"in the closet, never used again."
35:32,480;35:35,080;"Spent like, I don't know, 50-60 bucks at the time for those"
35:35,080;35:35,580;"jerseys."
35:35,580;35:36,780;"Did I get a reigning?"
35:36,780;35:39,580;"That didn't last long."
35:39,580;35:43,580;"I mean, I just had to."
35:43,580;35:49,660;"I will say, and I remember this very clearly Greg in his infinite Jersey collection had"
35:49,660;35:52,460;"a Raiders Jerry Rice."
35:52,460;35:53,980;"I remember correctly."
35:53,980;35:54,980;"Did he?"
35:54,980;36:00,100;"I thought he had a Charles Woodson jersey because he would collect any jersey of defensive"
36:00,100;36:01,660;"backs who were number four."
36:01,660;36:02,660;"One four."
36:02,660;36:03,660;"Yeah."
36:03,660;36:06,460;"I'm almost positive because, no, he definitely did."
36:06,460;36:10,220;"There's a picture of me dressing up on Halloween where I have dad on backwards."
36:10,220;36:28,220;"the year that we had to put it backwards. I'll see if I can dig and have all the text with you. I'm actually 100% positive. Greg had a Jerry Rice rate of truth. That sounds familiar. I knew we had that same thing. But yeah, that would make sense too."
36:28,220;36:35,220;"that's a nice jersey there. I still have my temper on the deed of the jersey then I have a boat Jackson jersey I got from China."
36:35,220;36:42,220;"Don't have any of my Charles Wistinger'sies. Ooh, breaking news, Raiders and Eli Apple deal fall apart."
36:42,220;36:45,220;"I saw it earlier."
36:45,220;36:52,220;"Yeah, I don't have any of my Charles Wistinger'sies anymore. I don't know what happened and they probably got taken."
36:52,220;36:57,220;"You know, here and there, but a boat Jackson jersey will be there in my temper."
36:57,220;36:59,940;"Well, we'll see if Greg still has his trust"
36:59,940;37:03,220;"You can find it. Yeah"
37:03,220;37:10,400;"Thank you for having me on your podcast now. We appreciate it. Thanks for giving us a different perspective"
37:10,400;37:13,660;"Anytime"
37:13,660;37:16,620;"I love you as you mean that"
37:16,620;37:21,060;"All right later guys"
37:26,500;37:29,780;"Well after all that we're still not friends. So thanks Navi"
37:29,780;37:38,420;"Great transition. He just uses you for your fourth July parties. I get it. That's right. I'm sure he's not the only one"
37:38,420;37:40,740;"nope"
37:40,740;37:44,180;"So yeah, he not a big fan of"
37:44,180;37:47,300;"What's his name the"
37:47,300;37:50,260;"Bill Callahan. Yeah, not a big fan of him"
37:51,580;37:59,340;"Just completely understandable I think so he was a big grood fan. Oh, yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah"
37:59,340;38:01,340;"What do you guys think of groodin?"
38:01,340;38:08,500;"I don't know. I'm not as high on him as I feel like everybody else seems to be I"
38:08,500;38:11,260;"Feel like a lot of people hate on him"
38:11,260;38:14,500;"Ever since he did Monday night like"
38:14,500;38:18,660;"Yeah, I mean he was a bit of a caricature on Monday night"
38:18,660;38:21,380;"I think I was just him playing that that role, you know"
38:21,380;38:24,100;"Sheen"
38:24,100;38:29,080;"Yeah, and the QB camp that he does where he just loves everybody everybody"
38:29,080;38:33,620;"You got a lot of shit for that. I haven't heard him say critical thing at all"
38:33,620;38:37,340;"Unless I was like on hard knocks"
38:37,340;38:40,540;"I didn't even watch that"
38:40,540;38:48,020;"That he was good on hard. I liked him on hard knocks really I heard a lot of criticism about him specifically on hard knocks"
38:48,260;38:51,040;"Every coach gets criticism for that show though."
38:51,040;38:54,540;"I thought he was a good players coach."
38:54,540;38:57,340;"I don't know how good of an ex's nose guy is, but."
38:57,340;38:58,780;"- Yeah."
38:58,780;39:00,300;"He's a good motivator."
39:00,300;39:03,380;"- He was supposed to be a pretty good offensive mind, isn't he?"
39:03,380;39:05,300;"That's what I thought."
39:05,300;39:07,660;"- I think at this point in his career,"
39:07,660;39:09,320;"people were pretty high on him."
39:09,320;39:13,460;"- Well, let's put a number on the Raiders wins"
39:13,460;39:15,340;"here in the 2020 season."
39:18,100;39:19,100;"Mmm."
39:19,100;39:21,100;"Nine wins."
39:21,100;39:25,100;"Who's playing quarterback?"
39:25,100;39:30,100;"Is it still car?"
39:30,100;39:32,100;"Nathan Peterman."
39:32,100;39:34,100;"No, they brought in someone to challenge."
39:34,100;39:35,100;"Oh, yeah."
39:35,100;39:37,100;"Who they bring to you."
39:37,100;39:39,100;"He loves Peterman."
39:39,100;39:41,100;"Check this."
39:41,100;39:43,100;"They brought a mariota."
39:43,100;39:44,100;"That's right."
39:44,100;39:45,100;"Yeah."
39:45,100;39:46,100;"Because that was his hot."
39:46,100;39:52,220;"Snavi's hot day was yes very old will be the starter and the next franchise quarterback. Yes"
39:52,220;39:56,260;"So I'm definitely picking against Navi. Let me give you like six wins. I"
39:56,260;40:00,740;"Could see them doing okay"
40:00,740;40:06,540;"More than I'm going ten. Yeah, I'm going ten wins. I'm changing. I'm going to ten"
40:06,540;40:12,980;"Based on no research and not even knowing half the roster. I'm going ten wins"
40:12,980;40:14,980;"That's how hot takes are born Greg."
40:14,980;40:15,980;"That's right."
40:15,980;40:17,980;"And then you defend them."
40:17,980;40:18,980;"So you die."
40:18,980;40:22,980;"Even if you don't believe them when you're dying, you defend them till you die."
40:22,980;40:25,980;"Oh, you just cover them up with more hot takes."
40:25,980;40:26,980;"Oh, yeah."
40:26,980;40:28,980;"But what about this hot take?"
40:28,980;40:32,980;"What's you want to hear my worst ever sports take?"
40:32,980;40:33,980;"Of course."
40:33,980;40:34,980;"Always."
40:34,980;40:35,980;"Okay."
40:35,980;40:38,980;"Aaron Hernandez will be a better career player than Rob Gunkhouse."
40:38,980;40:39,980;"Oh, yeah."
40:39,980;40:40,980;"Oh, my."
40:40,980;40:42,900;"and it passionate about that one."
40:42,900;40:43,980;"- Yeah."
40:43,980;40:46,660;"- I was like, he's just a more fluid athlete."
40:46,660;40:49,320;"(laughing)"
40:49,320;40:50,160;"- Whoops."
40:50,160;40:51,920;"- That one went down in flames."
40:51,920;40:53,220;"(laughing)"
40:53,220;40:54,740;"- I'm gonna hail a gunfire."
40:54,740;40:56,600;"- Yeah, among other things."
40:56,600;40:59,180;"- All right, let's talk about the actual"
40:59,180;41:00,780;"fucking game he came here to talk about."
41:00,780;41:02,380;"(laughing)"
41:02,380;41:03,940;"- We'll talk about it all the way."
41:03,940;41:04,780;"- Yeah."
41:07,780;41:10,220;"Yeah. All right. So just real quick."
41:10,220;41:14,460;"I know Navi mentioned it in the in the interview, but"
41:14,460;41:17,980;"I want to touch on it again that the the"
41:17,980;41:21,340;"Raiders actually lost their last three games regular season."
41:21,340;41:26,580;"And it was a weird situation where in week 17, if they had won that game,"
41:26,580;41:30,540;"they would have gotten the two seed instead of the Patriots."
41:30,540;41:35,860;"But they lost to the Jets, who they then had to play the next week in the wildcard"
41:35,860;41:37,580;"game like six days later."
41:37,580;41:38,980;"and they beat the Jets."
41:38,980;41:40,780;"And it was one of those things I kind of remember"
41:40,780;41:42,820;"and he wasn't completely clear on it,"
41:42,820;41:47,820;"but it was something like the Raiders played super vanilla"
41:47,820;41:50,380;"in week 17, so they wouldn't give the Jets anything"
41:50,380;41:52,660;"just in case they didn't beat them."
41:52,660;41:55,940;"And then they pulled out all the stops in the playoffs"
41:55,940;41:59,260;"and right over them, the 38-24."
41:59,260;42:01,540;"So that's how the Raiders actually got here."
42:01,540;42:03,820;"Just like putting up numbers"
42:03,820;42:09,020;"And running back Charlie Gardner had like he iced the game with an 80"
42:09,020;42:11,100;"yard touchdown run with a few minutes left."
42:11,100;42:13,460;"I had no idea who Charlie Gardner was."
42:13,460;42:15,300;"I remember the game."
42:15,300;42:18,500;"But did you know, look,"
42:18,500;42:20,740;"play on 49ers?"
42:20,740;42:23,100;"Me?"
42:23,100;42:23,660;"Yeah."
42:23,660;42:24,300;"Yeah."
42:24,300;42:25,300;"Check."
42:25,300;42:25,900;"Yeah."
42:25,900;42:31,860;"And I started in Philly from 94 to 98 and then two years in San Francisco"
42:31,860;42:33,740;"before four years in Oakland."
42:33,740;42:38,080;"Wasn't like a back name her spec there too when the night is first. Yeah. Yeah."
42:38,080;42:41,200;"I remember this is when Stat check goes wrong."
42:41,200;42:44,000;"I'm it must be Garner, not Gardner."
42:44,000;42:45,500;"Yes."
42:45,500;42:49,960;"Charlie Gardner was a recurring character in the second season of Girl Meets World,"
42:49,960;42:53,000;"which turns out is a show."
42:53,000;42:55,400;"Oh, don't talk to Mike Mello about that though."
42:55,400;42:57,220;"It's very so."
42:57,220;42:59,040;"Does he know about Girl Meets World?"
42:59,040;43:00,020;"Not Boy Meets World."
43:00,020;43:02,400;"I think he basically wrote that."
43:02,400;43:08,360;"The reunion for a boy meets world he wrote the whole script and everything and tried to shop it around and then"
43:08,360;43:14,320;"That came out apparently I guess there was it was some similarities between what he wrote and what came out and so so"
43:14,320;43:19,120;"Yeah, sorry subtext. I'll talk. Yeah, I don't know that. Oh"
43:19,120;43:22,600;"Well, that's hilarious"
43:22,600;43:28,140;"Like Charlie Gardner good looking guy. Yeah, what about Charlie Garner?"
43:30,120;43:32,120;"Spell check"
43:32,120;43:37,240;"He's Charlie Garner the third by the way"
43:37,240;43:40,760;"So good for him"
43:40,760;43:50,520;"But yeah, you look pretty sprightly in this game though, I mean he looked on the level yeah, he was a tenacious guy, you know like a bulldog runner"
43:50,520;43:55,640;"I respect those guys. Yeah, he was just that he was the the stereotypical"
43:55,640;43:59,520;"Always keep your legs moving and good things will happen as a running backs what a guy"
43:59,520;44:02,580;"Yeah, like he didn't really"
44:02,580;44:08,820;"Make any moves he wasn't beating anybody. He just like would just keep going and eventually somebody would fall off"
44:08,820;44:11,180;"And he'd get an extra eight yards from it sort of thing"
44:11,180;44:20,800;"All right, I say that we do a best and worst for each quarter like one two and three and then we can talk about the fourth and overtime"
44:20,800;44:24,740;"Hey boy. All right. That's aggressive you go first"
44:27,240;44:29,240;"Best in the first quarter"
44:29,240;44:38,160;"Was the three screens in a row from the Patriots. Yeah, that's how they started the game. Yeah, even Phil running backs"
44:38,160;44:40,360;"Even Phil was calling them out"
44:40,360;44:42,480;"Yeah"
44:42,480;44:49,080;"The worst was over six on third downs both teams combined that was terrible"
44:49,080;44:52,840;"Yeah, it wasn't a lot of punting in that first quarter"
44:54,440;44:57,960;"There wasn't a lot of best I think in this first quarter"
44:57,960;45:03,320;"I'll go with the fact that they had the yellow line the yellow first down line was back for this game because it was a"
45:03,320;45:06,240;"Primetime game which thank fucking God because"
45:06,240;45:12,080;"You can actually see the the yard markers unless they had the the guys with the leaf blowers out there"
45:12,080;45:14,760;"during commercial breaks"
45:14,760;45:19,280;"Putting it on the end zone line - yeah. Oh, yeah, that was helpful"
45:21,400;45:26,880;"And that guy on the Raiders lost track of it. I won't play. Yeah, I was gonna be my worst for the second quarter"
45:26,880;45:29,940;"It was the yeah, when the papers punted it"
45:29,940;45:33,400;"Yeah, he let it he let it bounce. He was sitting in the end zone thinking he was on the five"
45:33,400;45:39,240;"What a bouncing in the end zone for an active. I remember that play too for some reason"
45:39,240;45:44,460;"Yeah, so I just you plays in this game that stick out on my memory and they're like kind of obscure"
45:44,460;45:50,040;"Yeah, yeah, I'm the same way. There was something that I completely forgot about though, which we'll get to"
45:50,040;45:59,560;"So that was my best. My worst was, oh, the Raiders on the first drive."
45:59,560;46:07,000;"Challenge the first down. Oh, yeah. And even though it looked like they got it, it still"
46:07,000;46:12,200;"got spotted short. So they didn't get the first down on third down and had to punt anyway."
46:12,200;46:16,680;"And the pun was. But that's why the game down so much. Like that's why there was a million"
46:16,680;46:20,680;"punts in the first half is because like literally the first drive challenge."
46:20,680;46:24,360;"And yeah, and challenges back then took like 45 minutes."
46:24,360;46:27,920;"Oh, by the time they got back on the punt, the ball was another three inches."
46:27,920;46:31,520;"And they were like, Oh, yeah, you win the challenge, but you don't get the first"
46:31,520;46:33,720;"down cause they moved the ball ahead two inches."
46:33,720;46:35,040;"So here's your time out back."
46:35,040;46:37,400;"And then we got to go back and explain that to each of the coaches."
46:37,400;46:39,080;"And just like, holy shit."
46:39,080;46:42,680;"Yeah, I said it was a first down though, right?"
46:42,680;46:43,200;"Yeah."
46:43,200;46:44,400;"It was supposed to be."
46:44,400;46:49,360;"should have been. They got the call around. That's the first screw job of the Raiders"
46:49,360;46:54,200;"of the night. Oh, that that actually reminds me so talking about that in because I went"
46:54,200;46:58,760;"to highlights of the Raiders Jets game the week before just to see how that went. And"
46:58,760;47:01,720;"the Jets got a whole bunch of calls that went against them too. Like they got the screw"
47:01,720;47:11,840;"job in that game. So maybe it's just a well, it's speaking of karma. What is it? 1976."
47:11,840;47:14,960;"the Phantom passing, the Phantom roughing the passer."
47:14,960;47:16,660;"Yep. Yeah. Yeah."
47:16,660;47:17,960;"Pass Raiders."
47:17,960;47:20,400;"Yeah. So now we're evens what you say."
47:20,400;47:25,240;"Well, no, I mean, I'm to clearly point out a hole in your logic."
47:25,240;47:29,000;"You're just, you're calling it karma because you want to justify that the"
47:29,000;47:31,480;"pads got the good end of the calls here."
47:31,480;47:36,480;"I mean, you can put words in my mouth all you want, but no."
47:36,480;47:37,400;"Yeah."
47:37,400;47:40,720;"The Raiders got jogged in this game."
47:41,120;47:41,620;"Yeah."
47:41,620;47:44,020;"Exactly. I knew I knew you're gonna."
47:44,020;47:45,860;"Yeah."
47:45,860;47:47,840;"I don't know what job they had a couple of"
47:47,840;47:48,840;"calls on against them."
47:48,840;47:51,800;"If Jacktively, if I was a Raiders fan, I'd be"
47:51,800;47:52,840;"pissed."
47:52,840;47:54,420;"What other you would be a"
47:54,420;47:55,580;"better sound."
47:55,580;48:00,440;"The well, we'll get to we'll get to the"
48:00,440;48:03,320;"Yeah, we will be the best one later."
48:03,320;48:06,680;"Yeah, let's get with your best conversation."
48:06,680;48:07,280;"Right."
48:07,280;48:08,280;"It was a good life."
48:09,560;48:12,560;"The worst is clearly Steve just springing this on us."
48:12,560;48:17,400;"I have no idea what any of this happened in what quarter."
48:17,400;48:19,680;"Yeah, Greg didn't watch the game clearly."
48:19,680;48:23,680;"No, I watched the game, but I'm not like writing best and worst for each quarter."
48:23,680;48:29,920;"But I mean, for the beginning of the game, the best has got to be the environment, right?"
48:29,920;48:36,040;"Yeah. Like when they pan to the crowd and as dudes with their shirts off and like the screen looks like"
48:36,040;48:39,920;"You're getting a bad reception because it's just white coming down and."
48:39,920;48:43,520;"No, it's just sitting down because the bleachers are colder."
48:43,520;48:43,960;"Yeah."
48:43,960;48:49,480;"There everybody was standing the entire game, the entire game, the entire game."
48:49,480;48:55,280;"And just it's just one of those four of those things when you turn on a snow game."
48:55,280;48:59,520;"The football and like you see the whole field covered in white except for the"
48:59,520;49:03,000;"lines that they've, you know, yeah, leaf blown."
49:03,000;49:04,760;"It's just, it's so cool."
49:05,200;49:13,960;"I remember we're in the library and like we're waiting for the game to start and I was looking outside the window and it's like the smell when I was like damn it's really coming down out there."
49:13,960;49:23,960;"I was like, so just so you know people who don't didn't live in the brown house growing up. No, the library isn't actually the library is just a room in our house."
49:23,960;49:26,260;"That's the library didn't even know."
49:26,260;49:26,960;"Had books."
49:26,960;49:28,360;"Books."
49:28,360;49:31,360;"Yeah, actually, because our father's a deadhead."
49:31,360;49:33,760;"It was called the Jerry Garcia Memorial Library."
49:33,760;49:34,600;"Yeah."
49:35,160;49:36,720;"And that's where we had the TV."
49:36,720;49:38,040;"Yeah."
49:38,040;49:40,200;"That's where we went to church."
49:40,200;49:42,200;"No, yeah, no reading happened in that room."
49:42,200;49:47,840;"But it is a unique thing to,"
49:47,840;49:50,680;"'cause I was trying to think of like how many like"
49:50,680;49:52,440;"true snow games are there, right?"
49:52,440;49:55,960;"'Cause it takes like a pretty precise timing"
49:55,960;49:59,400;"to hit a snow game perfect where it's,"
49:59,400;50:03,440;"you know, this game it snowed the entire way through."
50:03,440;50:05,640;"Yeah, it almost never happens."
50:05,640;50:07,240;"It was heavy snow."
50:07,240;50:08,440;"It was like a dusting."
50:08,440;50:10,120;"And it was--"
50:10,120;50:13,480;"I mean, think about how much snow fell in those three hours?"
50:13,480;50:14,240;"Yeah."
50:14,240;50:16,840;"Yeah, it was still legitimately accumulating."
50:16,840;50:19,760;"Yeah, because typically in a good snowstorm,"
50:19,760;50:24,760;"you only get two to three hours of real serious snow"
50:24,760;50:26,000;"anyways, right?"
50:26,000;50:29,120;"So you have to hit it perfectly during game time"
50:29,120;50:31,600;"to get a game like this."
50:31,600;50:33,760;"And it just nailed it."
50:33,760;50:35,680;"It didn't stop snowing the whole game."
50:35,680;50:38,560;"- It let up a little bit at halftime, it lightened up,"
50:38,560;50:40,440;"and then by fourth quarter of the time,"
50:40,440;50:42,240;"it started snowing heavy again too."
50:42,240;50:43,600;"- Yeah, it was awesome."
50:43,600;50:46,920;"- Yeah, fourth quarter over time was you could tell"
50:46,920;50:48,760;"it was really accumulating."
50:48,760;50:49,600;"- Yeah."
50:49,600;50:53,400;"- Yeah, that was a hot mess."
50:53,400;50:56,880;"- Yeah, I can mean, can you think off-stop of your head,"
50:56,880;51:00,160;"like five snow games that you've watched?"
51:00,160;51:05,000;"game. Yeah. Okay. The Titan. Yeah. The Titan Cardinals game. We went to"
51:05,000;51:08,560;"remember that. That's my first pages game. Yeah. Really? Yeah."
51:08,560;51:13,200;"Yeah. That was the end of the '08 season when the Patriots warped the shit out of the Cardinals"
51:13,200;51:21,120;"who eventually went to Super Bowl. Yeah. There was one in Chicago. The Patriots played in"
51:21,120;51:26,440;"Chicago and Brady threw a touchdown to Dion Branch with like three seconds left and a half"
51:26,440;51:27,280;"because he was wide open."
51:27,280;51:30,440;"But it wasn't accumulated really on that one, right?"
51:30,440;51:32,640;"I think I mean, the field was white."
51:32,640;51:33,400;"I remember that."
51:33,400;51:34,520;"I think it was still snow."
51:34,520;51:36,320;"I don't know how much it was accumulating."
51:36,320;51:37,240;"Yeah."
51:37,240;51:40,600;"But yeah, that's what four games in the past 20 years that we didn't think"
51:40,600;51:41,360;"about top pride."
51:41,360;51:45,320;"Of course, they flashback the snowplow game, which I forgot was"
51:45,320;51:46,480;"three to nothing."
51:46,480;51:48,080;"Well, yeah."
51:48,080;51:49,560;"I think that's a dolphin."
51:49,560;51:52,000;"But they they had the guy there."
51:52,000;51:53,880;"Didn't they gave to be over Jesus?"
51:53,880;51:54,480;"Yeah."
51:54,480;51:55,600;"Didn't they have the guy there?"
51:55,600;52:00,680;"Yeah. Oh, no, it was like maybe the end of the regular season."
52:00,680;52:04,080;"They had him come out and do like a wave to the crowd in like the last game"
52:04,080;52:05,560;"that they thought in Fox grow."
52:05,560;52:07,360;"Oh, yeah, that's what it was. Yeah."
52:07,360;52:08,600;"And we did talk about it already."
52:08,600;52:11,200;"Whenever that game was, oh, it wasn't it against the dolphins."
52:11,200;52:13,840;"Yeah. I think it was pretty sure."
52:13,840;52:15,840;"That makes sense."
52:15,840;52:17,360;"That's a dick move. I love it."
52:17,360;52:19,760;"Yeah. Greg, you want to shoot on that too?"
52:19,760;52:20,560;"Yeah."
52:20,560;52:25,560;"I like every good."
52:25,560;52:31,560;"Uh, so I would also say that, um, just the running game in general in the first quarter, not great."
52:31,560;52:33,560;"No."
52:33,560;52:37,560;"I just, Antoine Smith did not get going in this game."
52:37,560;52:40,560;"It go outside the first three screens."
52:40,560;52:42,560;"They didn't have shit else going on in the quarter."
52:42,560;52:44,560;"No, they really didn't."
52:44,560;52:47,560;"Like I said, that takes us to the second quarter."
52:47,560;52:54,100;"quarter. I think everybody's worst is probably James Jet catching a touchdown."
52:54,100;53:02,040;"With three fucking catches all year. Yeah, that's not crazy. But that's so like"
53:02,040;53:05,600;"Patriots defense too, is they take away the things you do best. And they actually"
53:05,600;53:09,920;"even talked about it in this game where I think it was John, they were talking"
53:09,920;53:13,600;"about John Gruden saying like we have no idea where they can throw at us but we"
53:13,600;53:16,840;"know they're gonna take away what we do well so and then James Jet catches a"
53:16,840;53:19,640;"touchdown, which is their better name for a wider"
53:19,640;53:22,240;"seeer than James jet. That's up there. Yeah."
53:22,240;53:26,080;"I mean, there was a rocket is mail. That's but that was"
53:26,080;53:30,920;"that was a nickname. That's true. But James jet like that's a"
53:30,920;53:36,840;"great fucking name. Maybe if you had like a silent D on the end,"
53:36,840;53:40,480;"you know, then you could be like TD at the end, but yeah."
53:40,480;53:44,440;"That's rough. That's good effort."
53:46,280;53:50,360;"Wait, what? Like J E T T and then I got D."
53:50,360;53:58,920;"He just wants a day. Oh, Steve, that that is the stretch of all stretches."
53:58,920;54:00,000;"No way, man."
54:00,000;54:01,000;"Silo."
54:01,000;54:05,240;"Or he just called James jetted."
54:05,240;54:07,080;"Yeah, you could."
54:07,080;54:11,760;"And then you go by James jet T D."
54:11,760;54:13,080;"He could."
54:13,080;54:14,760;"Maybe he did."
54:14,760;54:15,280;"Who knows?"
54:15,600;54:22,180;"Yeah, writers fans if he didn't he should have you'll have to reach out Stephen and let him know of that miss up"
54:22,180;54:34,820;"Second quarters had a different worst actually for what the first quarter the second quarter are we second quarter all right?"
54:34,820;54:38,560;"Right after that touchdown Brady gets a ball back and just"
54:40,120;54:47,840;"Sales one for an interception. Yeah, I I watched that play a few times. I don't know who he was throwing it to like what a"
54:47,840;54:53,460;"Like it's like we can't do anything offense. They score touchdown and move the ball a little bit and get a touchdown"
54:53,460;54:59,000;"We had the ball back Brady like two plays and just sales it throws a pick on like our 40"
54:59,000;55:04,660;"Yeah, that wasn't great. That was probably the low point. I think of this game at least for me"
55:05,520;55:13,700;"But he was forcing it. Oh definitely he definitely was but I don't even know who's forcing it too. There wasn't anybody like really in"
55:13,700;55:18,600;"Kind of a nice idea. I really two three feet over his head"
55:18,600;55:24,240;"It was long before he's kind of looked at it. Yeah, I think it was Troy Brown was the closest guy and he's like that was"
55:24,240;55:25,880;"That wasn't to me"
55:25,880;55:32,960;"Which I love Troy Brown. I think that's been well established. Mm-hmm did not have his best game this game"
55:34,080;55:35,080;"Charles Wood too."
55:35,080;55:39,360;"Well, I think also, I think it was the weather too."
55:39,360;55:40,000;"Didn't help him."
55:40,000;55:41,240;"He days quick."
55:41,240;55:43,280;"If you fumbled two punts."
55:43,280;55:46,920;"He wasn't beating anybody because he couldn't get his footing."
55:46,920;55:48,440;"So he couldn't, he couldn't juke anybody."
55:48,440;55:53,880;"Um, and they tried to do a reverse with him."
55:53,880;55:57,840;"I think it was in the second quarter and it got blown up and he lost like seven"
55:57,840;55:59,000;"or eight yards, which never happens."
55:59,000;56:00,160;"That's Troy Brown."
56:00,160;56:03,960;"We're talking about like you'll find a way to reverse field again and still get"
56:03,960;56:12,120;"first down and yeah didn't have a great as good. Yeah. Oh yeah. And we touched on this in the"
56:12,120;56:18,200;"interview, but it felt like every catch David Patton had, he had fallen over already in the"
56:18,200;56:22,040;"route. He would get up just in time to make the catch like half the time he was on his knees"
56:22,040;56:30,280;"still making the catch. And it was yeah, it was it was kind of. It was not the Troy Brown game in"
56:30,280;56:32,040;"in this game for sure."
56:32,040;56:37,560;"- And my best though is right after that pick Brady through."
56:37,560;56:40,840;"I think they maybe got one first down or not."
56:40,840;56:43,200;"They're kind of right outside field goal range,"
56:43,200;56:46,160;"probably right where they're going to take kick the field goal."
56:46,160;56:47,000;"- Yeah."
56:47,000;56:49,320;"- You know, a third and medium."
56:49,320;56:52,080;"When we blitzed and Otis came all the way across"
56:52,080;56:55,520;"the entire formation, picked up their best receiver Brown"
56:55,520;56:56,920;"coming on a crossing route."
56:56,920;56:57,760;"- Yep."
56:57,760;57:04,540;"I didn't think Otis was that fast to be honest, but he like closed it and made an awesome play on the ball to force me"
57:04,540;57:09,120;"to punt. That might have been the punt that went into the end zone. It was, yes."
57:09,120;57:19,440;"Otis is an unsung hero for this team. He really is. Yeah, for just the whole year. I mean, this game, he played"
57:19,440;57:26,240;"pretty well too, but yeah, I haven't watched these games. I mean, I've been surprised what a playmaker he was."
57:26,880;57:30,960;"See, that was one of the things that I remembered about this defense was Otis Smith for some reason."
57:30,960;57:34,560;"Him and Tylaw were just unbeatable."
57:34,560;57:39,280;"And I think this game was for on both sides, I think the"
57:39,280;57:44,960;"the defensive backs on in on both these defenses were top notch."
57:44,960;57:49,960;"It was like they were put on a clinic between Tylaw, Otis Smith and Charles Woodson."
57:49,960;57:54,880;"Like that's that's film that you could use to teach other"
57:55,440;58:00,900;"Cornabex how to play defense, you know who like made a huge impression on me on this game. Is he young in?"
58:00,900;58:03,760;"Wiggins"
58:03,760;58:04,560;"Yeah"
58:04,560;58:10,260;"Like and you know, I was right but like James jet like burned them burned us by touchdown"
58:10,260;58:17,160;"Wiggins came out of nowhere and fucked them too. Yeah, that's I had it's like the only time he did"
58:17,160;58:20,680;"Yeah, I had I wrote this down. This was his best game as a pro"
58:20,680;58:23,360;"He had 10 catches 70 yards"
58:24,160;58:28,920;"Yeah, and now he hosts the morning show for kiss one oh seven"
58:28,920;58:35,080;"Whatever and I bet he doesn't wear gloves doing that either. He's the only guy out there loves on w. Yeah"
58:35,080;58:44,220;"We're gonna do like a like a pop culture one today. I'm pretty sure he did please don't sports radio now"
58:44,220;58:48,120;"We're eating the morning or something like that. Yeah"
58:51,560;58:55,180;"Yeah, no, you Steve. You're right. I think he was the one out there that didn't have gloves on"
58:55,180;59:02,080;"And he was the leading receiver or at least one of them. It's amazing. Yeah, that was fantastic"
59:02,080;59:06,520;"So yeah, oh he did you let you let the patrons and catches"
59:06,520;59:09,920;"Him and Tim Brown both had 10 catches in this game"
59:09,920;59:21,080;"One of these things that it's not like the others on the third down conversion rate for both teams combined in the first half was one for 13"
59:21,080;59:30,600;"Yeah, I mean that kind of goes bad. I I felt like the rays are actually moving the ball. It felt"
59:30,600;59:34,680;"in the first half. I don't know. I was thinking quarter they slowed down as well after that touchdown."
59:34,680;59:38,920;"They did. Yeah. Well, in the first in the first quarter they were moving the ball. And I felt like"
59:38,920;59:44,360;"the the Patriots actually started like after the touchdown pass the Patriots started to just bring"
59:44,360;59:49,880;"pressure from everywhere. No blitzing it felt like every play and that slowed them down a bit. But"
59:50,760;59:52,480;"It felt like they were playing their game."
59:52,480;59:55,480;"The Patriots just, it felt like they're just going out there being super conservative."
59:55,480;59:56,840;"And I remembered that about this game."
59:56,840;59:57,560;"Yeah."
59:57,560;01:00:00,000;"In the first half, I'd be like, start rolling the ball."
01:00:00,000;01:00:01,520;"Like you're going to, you're going to get left."
01:00:01,520;01:00:03,680;"You don't pass rush on either team."
01:00:03,680;01:00:04,440;"Yeah."
01:00:04,440;01:00:07,800;"And, but the pages are content to just run it straight up the middle three times"
01:00:07,800;01:00:10,680;"with Antoine Smith and go three and out."
01:00:10,680;01:00:11,480;"Or, yeah."
01:00:11,480;01:00:14,400;"And you actually started to hear some booze in the second quarter with this."
01:00:14,400;01:00:18,400;"When they ran a draw on third and long."
01:00:18,600;01:00:21,000;"That's that's classic Bella check though"
01:00:21,000;01:00:24,600;"And like him"
01:00:24,600;01:00:27,880;"It's gotta be he I mean this this has been consistent"
01:00:27,880;01:00:32,240;"since this day right of him like playing the"
01:00:32,240;01:00:39,320;"Playing the game as it's like presenting itself rather than like playing your game, you know"
01:00:39,320;01:00:42,840;"We're gonna do this this this and that it's like all right"
01:00:42,840;01:00:45,160;"We're gonna try these couple things and see what works and then yeah"
01:00:45,160;01:00:47,960;"This is the guy that kicked off in overtime"
01:00:47,960;01:00:51,480;"time because he wanted the wind as best."
01:00:51,480;01:00:57,300;"You know, it's like that's, that's, that's to me saying I care more about like the external"
01:00:57,300;01:00:59,920;"factors than my own team, you know."
01:00:59,920;01:01:04,000;"Oh, so when you were shit on me the other day, when I said, Bellatrack was kicking a"
01:01:04,000;01:01:05,160;"short on purpose."
01:01:05,160;01:01:08,600;"Yeah, I, I disagree with it."
01:01:08,600;01:01:10,400;"I disagree with it."
01:01:10,400;01:01:16,920;"I honestly, and I mean, obviously he's a better coach than I am, right?"
01:01:16,920;01:01:19,960;"from like a player standpoint, if I was playing in this game, I'd be like,"
01:01:19,960;01:01:21,480;"dude, let's throw the ball."
01:01:21,480;01:01:24,080;"Like, let us make plays, you know?"
01:01:24,080;01:01:27,720;"So I could see I'll be frustrating for the players and for the fans, you know?"
01:01:27,720;01:01:28,360;"Yeah."
01:01:28,360;01:01:31,160;"But I think it was probably why he's better than us."
01:01:31,160;01:01:31,560;"Yeah."
01:01:31,560;01:01:32,880;"I was all that ends on Greg."
01:01:32,880;01:01:33,640;"Yeah."
01:01:33,640;01:01:36,480;"I mean, it was the right decision at the end."
01:01:36,480;01:01:39,600;"But yeah, and I think, but who knows, maybe they throw the ball."
01:01:39,600;01:01:42,200;"They come out aggressive in the beginning, win by three touchdowns."
01:01:42,200;01:01:42,640;"You don't know."
01:01:42,640;01:01:43,520;"That's true."
01:01:43,520;01:01:45,240;"But then it wouldn't be a classic, would it?"
01:01:45,240;01:01:46,360;"That's true."
01:01:46,360;01:01:52,960;"And also, I mean, they came out in the second half, I thought, chucking the ball around,"
01:01:52,960;01:01:55,960;"even though they're only down what, seven-nothing."
01:01:55,960;01:02:05,080;"Especially that first drive of the third quarter, Brady hit Patton on two long passes,"
01:02:05,080;01:02:09,840;"and they get it inside the five, and they're still chucking it into the end zone, and Brady"
01:02:09,840;01:02:12,640;"missed a couple of easier throws."
01:02:12,640;01:02:16,640;"If it did that, play what they always do, the hard play action, and he tosses it over"
01:02:16,640;01:02:22,920;"the line, and he overthrew how I'm assuming it was Wiggins."
01:02:22,920;01:02:27,760;"And then the play after he had somebody else wide open and just completely sailed it on"
01:02:27,760;01:02:30,160;"him too, and they had to settle for a field goal."
01:02:30,160;01:02:34,080;"Yeah, he sucks."
01:02:34,080;01:02:38,160;"He only threw 315 yards in a driving snowstorm."
01:02:38,160;01:02:39,720;"That's true."
01:02:39,720;01:02:43,260;"- Surprised the shit out of me after watching the first half."
01:02:43,260;01:02:44,840;"'Cause I don't, did you have any passing yards"
01:02:44,840;01:02:45,840;"in the first half?"
01:02:45,840;01:02:49,160;"- Yeah, if you take his four for nine with a pick"
01:02:49,160;01:02:51,640;"and he'd like threw like a real bullet to Troy Brown"
01:02:51,640;01:02:53,800;"right at the end of the second half."
01:02:53,800;01:02:54,640;"- Oh, that's right, yeah."
01:02:54,640;01:02:57,960;"- And I got confused because the announcers were,"
01:02:57,960;01:03:01,240;"they were saying that he has a nice stroke."
01:03:01,240;01:03:03,320;"Like is that football or not football?"
01:03:03,320;01:03:04,600;"- Football and not football."
01:03:04,600;01:03:06,440;"(laughs)"
01:03:06,440;01:03:08,000;"- He did have a nice stroke."
01:03:08,000;01:03:13,520;"Who did in fact Tom Brady made it he made his name off his stroke"
01:03:13,520;01:03:23,640;"Made a couple kids too. Yeah, just like that swimmer made a name off his stroke"
01:03:23,640;01:03:30,720;"Yeah, I think that like that bullet by Brady at the end looks pretty close the end of the second half"
01:03:30,720;01:03:33,440;"Yeah, I think it's the last drive. He was right flint through there"
01:03:34,720;01:03:39,760;"And they're like, all right, let's try open it up a little bit in the past game. Yeah, the Raiders did too."
01:03:39,760;01:03:50,480;"Yeah, that third quarter. It's kind of insane that they threw he threw the ball 52 times for 300 yards and they scored 16 points."
01:03:50,480;01:03:57,720;"I mean, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, and it didn't feel like, I mean, there was no like turnovers in the red zone."
01:03:57,720;01:04:01,200;"Usually when you get those kind of numbers, it's like a reason. Yeah."
01:04:01,200;01:04:04,340;"I don't know. I just think they got conservative that weird times"
01:04:04,340;01:04:07,800;"That's what it felt like yeah, then they were just I"
01:04:07,800;01:04:15,520;"Don't know it yeah all of a sudden the drive was just end and it never felt like they were at least in the first half it never felt like they're even"
01:04:15,520;01:04:18,560;"Challenging I think oh they had one drive"
01:04:18,560;01:04:21,040;"Yeah, the first drive of the game"
01:04:21,040;01:04:26,680;"They drove down, but then they tried to go for it on fourth and three kids were like just outside of field goal range"
01:04:26,680;01:04:30,800;"I think and didn't convert and that felt like that was as far as they got"
01:04:30,800;01:04:32,720;"at least in the first half."
01:04:32,720;01:04:35,120;"Yeah."
01:04:35,120;01:04:38,520;"At times it felt like they were just trying to run out the clock."
01:04:38,520;01:04:40,480;"I'm like, guys, it's a second quarter."
01:04:40,480;01:04:41,560;"Right."
01:04:41,560;01:04:42,040;"Yeah."
01:04:42,040;01:04:44,760;"And you're in your down seven nothing."
01:04:44,760;01:04:46,160;"Like you got to score at some point."
01:04:46,160;01:04:47,040;"Yeah."
01:04:47,040;01:04:51,960;"But yeah, I mean, if I told you at the first half, after the first half that,"
01:04:51,960;01:04:56,960;"um, Tom Brady would be the leading pass in this game, you probably would have"
01:04:56,960;01:04:57,720;"disagreed with me."
01:04:57,720;01:04:58,440;"Yeah."
01:04:59,040;01:05:02,040;"But because Rich Gannon, I thought was actually doing well now for us half."
01:05:02,040;01:05:03,560;"He's moving all of it."
01:05:03,560;01:05:05,320;"Yeah, we did better in the third."
01:05:05,320;01:05:06,400;"Like this."
01:05:06,400;01:05:07,600;"You heard of the Rysoton."
01:05:07,600;01:05:08,480;"Yeah."
01:05:08,480;01:05:09,040;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:09,040;01:05:13,400;"And yeah, I think Rice had a bunch of catches just in that third quarter, didn't he?"
01:05:13,400;01:05:14,200;"Yep."
01:05:14,200;01:05:16,240;"Till they stuck Tylon."
01:05:16,240;01:05:17,720;"Yeah."
01:05:17,720;01:05:19,000;"And then that was the end of that."
01:05:19,000;01:05:25,040;"But yeah, Rich Gannon, like you said, Greg, pretty through 50 times"
01:05:25,040;01:05:30,320;"to 312 yards, rich Ganon 31 attempts only had 159 yards."
01:05:30,320;01:05:33,600;"Yeah, see, it didn't feel like it played out like that."
01:05:33,600;01:05:34,360;"That's what I mean."
01:05:34,360;01:05:36,200;"Yeah, it didn't feel like that at all."
01:05:36,200;01:05:40,920;"But all right."
01:05:40,920;01:05:41,920;"Yeah, third quarter."
01:05:41,920;01:05:44,240;"Patriots settle for field goal."
01:05:44,240;01:05:45,960;"Raiders do the same thing."
01:05:45,960;01:05:50,080;"Raiders had two field goals in this game and the one that I had forgotten."
01:05:50,080;01:05:51,760;"Which I think we got to give."
01:05:51,760;01:05:52,600;"What's the name?"
01:05:52,600;01:05:58,520;"Janikowski, the Polish powder keg. Yeah. He kicked in in that third"
01:05:58,520;01:06:02,300;"quick. He could live in shit out of it. He picked a 45 yard field"
01:06:02,300;01:06:05,880;"with a good from probably about 60. Yeah. Yeah. The same one"
01:06:05,880;01:06:08,800;"that Vinita, he snuck through. He was hitting the back netting."
01:06:08,800;01:06:13,720;"Oh, you guys up. Yeah. I love Janikowski."
01:06:13,720;01:06:19,480;"That's the animal. Like, come on, like that guy is just a"
01:06:19,480;01:06:25,240;"mouth breather, you know, just a mon crawl. Yeah, but boy, can that man kick a football?"
01:06:25,240;01:06:30,600;"Yeah, you could just do one thing. Yeah. And they were like, we're riding this thing to the top."
01:06:30,600;01:06:35,160;"And but he never even tried doing anything else. Have you ever I think it was him where there's"
01:06:35,160;01:06:40,360;"videos of like on kick returns. And he's the last guy and he's like, well, what's the guy go?"
01:06:40,360;01:06:43,640;"He just even like tried to make a tackle trip. Like, I just like, no, fuck it. That's not my job."
01:06:43,640;01:06:47,960;"Yeah. And he clearly never like tried to work out or like take care of his body."
01:06:47,960;01:06:50,360;"Oh, yeah, no, he's just like a square."
01:06:50,360;01:06:51,120;"Yeah."
01:06:51,120;01:06:52,680;"It's like a rectangle."
01:06:52,680;01:07:01,640;"Yeah, he reminds me of it, you know, of our father, like running around on a soccer field,"
01:07:01,640;01:07:10,400;"like just the dad, but yeah, not exactly smooth motion, or anything, but could kick the shit out of things."
01:07:10,400;01:07:12,760;"And Jana, thank you."
01:07:12,760;01:07:13,440;"Good for him."
01:07:13,440;01:07:16,560;"I mean, that's a good place to be a point a million years, too."
01:07:16,560;01:07:16,960;"Yeah."
01:07:16,960;01:07:21,880;"Put you use like smoking heaters on the sideline like that hicker and probably was"
01:07:21,880;01:07:25,000;"He'd be so awesome"
01:07:25,000;01:07:29,080;"Yeah, I'll say his field goals are set up by tie law"
01:07:29,080;01:07:34,400;"Back to back red zone possessions tie laws or maybe our red zone, but"
01:07:34,400;01:07:38,920;"Within field goal range. They throw a tie log on both of them"
01:07:38,920;01:07:46,480;"Yeah, I'll put up clinic in this game. Yeah number 24 is both of them. Yeah, I'll play awesome"
01:07:46,480;01:07:51,680;"Yeah. He loved the team in tackles. You see that? No. Tyler. Yeah."
01:07:51,680;01:07:56,280;"12 tackles and two pass breakups. Holy shit. And both those passive"
01:07:56,280;01:08:00,360;"breakups on third down in the red zone. Yeah. I feel like more"
01:08:00,360;01:08:04,680;"pass breakups than that. I have to say. I think he. This is his"
01:08:04,680;01:08:07,640;"type of game though. You know, like a physical get your hands on"
01:08:07,640;01:08:11,960;"the guy. Yeah. It's just Tyler style like punish him whenever"
01:08:11,960;01:08:14,440;"you get a chance. He's an amazing tackler."
01:08:15,520;01:08:18,360;"If you've been like painting any back there, he would throw like six picks."
01:08:18,360;01:08:20,720;"Well, there's a"
01:08:20,720;01:08:22,240;"I forgot about."
01:08:22,240;01:08:24,840;"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, good call. Yeah."
01:08:24,840;01:08:30,120;"That's my favorite all time single performance."
01:08:30,120;01:08:32,520;"It's Tyler against Peyton Manning. Yeah."
01:08:32,520;01:08:39,080;"You know who flash a little bit in this quarter?"
01:08:39,080;01:08:42,240;"Who's putting note about his Bobby Hamilton?"
01:08:43,760;01:08:48,480;"Yeah, he was starting to get some pressure all by himself and actually even Navi mentioned him."
01:08:48,480;01:08:50,440;"Yeah, he's really."
01:08:50,440;01:08:50,840;"Yeah."
01:08:50,840;01:08:54,880;"Yeah, he's just like sneaky like Otis, like he talked about earlier."
01:08:54,880;01:08:59,280;"Kind of like a sneaky contributor to this dynasty."
01:08:59,280;01:09:00,040;"Yeah."
01:09:00,040;01:09:07,080;"Yeah, but he also one of those guys who doesn't move particularly athletically."
01:09:07,080;01:09:08,040;"No."
01:09:08,920;01:09:13,420;"It's like if Jana Kowski was playing defensive tackle or defensive"
01:09:13,420;01:09:16,300;"vendor, whatever it was, just a big goofy do."
01:09:16,300;01:09:18,180;"But man, can he move when he needs to?"
01:09:18,180;01:09:24,060;"But I got a question."
01:09:24,060;01:09:24,700;"Yeah."
01:09:24,700;01:09:29,300;"Who would you rather sleep with Jana Kowski or Robless burger?"
01:09:29,300;01:09:33,180;"Like we're just sharing a bed sleeping with."
01:09:33,180;01:09:34,660;"No, you know what I mean?"
01:09:34,660;01:09:36,180;"I think how nice his stroke is."
01:09:36,180;01:09:37,540;"You know what I mean."
01:09:37,540;01:09:43,220;"I feel like Jannikowski would be gentler."
01:09:43,220;01:09:44,280;"Yeah."
01:09:44,280;01:09:46,820;"Well, I'm just going to take it."
01:09:46,820;01:09:48,100;"I like knock you out."
01:09:48,100;01:09:50,480;"Have you seen Ross burger recently?"
01:09:50,480;01:09:51,820;"It's like a mountain man."
01:09:51,820;01:09:54,920;"He looks disgusting."
01:09:54,920;01:09:56,020;"Yeah."
01:09:56,020;01:09:57,900;"Disgusting."
01:09:57,900;01:10:00,900;"And this coming with a man who shaved only half his beard."
01:10:00,900;01:10:02,100;"Dude."
01:10:02,100;01:10:06,140;"Which happens?"
01:10:06,140;01:10:06,980;"- You shaved it."
01:10:06,980;01:10:07,800;"- The left or the right?"
01:10:07,800;01:10:08,640;"- I can't."
01:10:08,640;01:10:09,480;"- The left."
01:10:09,480;01:10:11,180;"- You shaved your left, okay."
01:10:11,180;01:10:12,020;"- Side beard."
01:10:12,020;01:10:14,620;"- Something."
01:10:14,620;01:10:16,900;"- So, good anecdote from that."
01:10:16,900;01:10:20,460;"When I was, I played soccer in college"
01:10:20,460;01:10:22,540;"until my senior year, and then my senior year,"
01:10:22,540;01:10:26,380;"I stopped playing, but I was still drinking aggressively."
01:10:26,380;01:10:28,220;"- That's a whole work."
01:10:28,220;01:10:31,500;"- I gained a couple pounds, you know, as you do."
01:10:31,500;01:10:33,060;"- As you do, yeah."
01:10:33,060;01:10:38,060;"And the moment of rock bottom where you turn your life"
01:10:38,060;01:10:40,320;"around and start eating healthier and shit,"
01:10:40,320;01:10:43,660;"was one of Ellie's old boyfriends told me"
01:10:43,660;01:10:45,420;"that I looked like Rothlessberger."
01:10:45,420;01:10:47,100;"(laughing)"
01:10:47,100;01:10:49,260;"I was like, I gotta do something about this."
01:10:49,260;01:10:53,620;"Is that the one that couldn't eat pizza?"
01:10:53,620;01:10:54,820;"- Yeah, Ian."
01:10:54,820;01:10:56,220;"- Yeah, oh yeah, 'cause remember we did"
01:10:56,220;01:10:58,540;"the Domino's 555 deal."
01:10:58,540;01:11:00,260;"Wasn't me and you Greg and him?"
01:11:00,260;01:11:01,420;"- Yeah, I think so."
01:11:01,420;01:11:02,860;"'cause we used to just do it and race."
01:11:02,860;01:11:05,460;"You could eat the pizza the quickest."
01:11:05,460;01:11:07,900;"And we both finished ours and he wouldn't let us"
01:11:07,900;01:11:09,740;"look at his box."
01:11:09,740;01:11:11,660;"And when we opened it, he had like three quarters"
01:11:11,660;01:11:12,500;"of a pizza left."
01:11:12,500;01:11:15,580;"So I played the album, finished it too."
01:11:15,580;01:11:20,820;"- Those days are beyond, those days are behind me, Andy."
01:11:20,820;01:11:21,900;"- Are they?"
01:11:21,900;01:11:23,740;"- I don't wanna end up looking at that again."
01:11:23,740;01:11:24,580;"- Not behind me, Ben."
01:11:24,580;01:11:25,580;"(laughing)"
01:11:25,580;01:11:26,740;"- I think Ben eats those five, five, five."
01:11:26,740;01:11:28,220;"- Yeah."
01:11:28,220;01:11:30,860;"- What about the brown double double, Greg?"
01:11:30,860;01:11:31,700;"You don't do that anymore?"
01:11:31,700;01:11:33,980;"- Yeah, those were dark days too."
01:11:33,980;01:11:35,540;"That was right around the same time."
01:11:35,540;01:11:37,420;"I can't believe we would do that."
01:11:37,420;01:11:38,260;"- Yeah."
01:11:38,260;01:11:41,060;"'Cause there's a thing going around."
01:11:41,060;01:11:43,060;"I saw it on Twitter the other day,"
01:11:43,060;01:11:46,620;"where it's like, oh, if somebody were to pay you $3,500,"
01:11:46,620;01:11:51,620;"but you had to eat, I think it was two,"
01:11:51,620;01:11:54,420;"what's the Burger King?"
01:11:54,420;01:11:57,660;"Not very McDonald's, Big Macs, two Big Macs,"
01:11:57,660;01:12:02,340;"two large fries and two things of nuggets"
01:12:02,340;01:12:05,480;"and four sodas in 90 minutes."
01:12:05,480;01:12:07,860;"90 minutes?"
01:12:07,860;01:12:09,300;"Yeah, would you do it?"
01:12:09,300;01:12:10,140;"Let's see."
01:12:10,140;01:12:10,980;"About $3,500."
01:12:10,980;01:12:11,820;"Yeah."
01:12:11,820;01:12:13,540;"I thought to myself, we used to do that for lunch"
01:12:13,540;01:12:15,940;"and then go continue to clean pools."
01:12:15,940;01:12:17,100;"Fuckin' stupid."
01:12:17,100;01:12:21,740;"I don't think my body could handle that anymore."
01:12:21,740;01:12:25,940;"Like if I eat dinner too fast now, I have mud butt."
01:12:25,940;01:12:29,820;"It could be healthy food, but I just went too quick."
01:12:29,820;01:12:34,340;"It's just I'm like a fragile stomach guy now."
01:12:34,340;01:12:35,340;"I am not."
01:12:35,340;01:12:40,060;"I've never really had speed of intake, speed of outtake."
01:12:40,060;01:12:42,220;"No, it's a real thing, dude."
01:12:42,220;01:12:43,700;"Did not know that."
01:12:43,700;01:12:44,700;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:44,700;01:12:46,740;"I think it's because I don't chew enough."
01:12:46,740;01:12:47,940;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:47,940;01:12:49,900;"I never chew enough."
01:12:49,900;01:12:50,900;"And then it just starts rumbling."
01:12:50,900;01:12:55,660;"I can feel the rumbling and like an hour later, I'm like, God damn it, Craig, chew your"
01:12:55,660;01:12:59,540;"food. I got salad poo is like crazy."
01:12:59,540;01:13:03,220;"That's all the roughage. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
01:13:03,220;01:13:07,300;"Cut down the leafy greens."
01:13:07,300;01:13:11,780;"That's not when I eat a salad. I only eat a fucking sounds. I have like massive"
01:13:11,780;01:13:12,500;"salads."
01:13:12,500;01:13:15,700;"These have like 10 pounds of lettuce."
01:13:15,700;01:13:19,540;"Yeah. Oh, man."
01:13:19,540;01:13:23,020;"Speaking of rough here, yeah, talk about this four quarter."
01:13:23,860;01:13:25,740;"Well, we did we just skip the third quarter."
01:13:25,740;01:13:27,820;"We talked about it."
01:13:27,820;01:13:30,500;"OK, I'm going to kick the couple field goals."
01:13:30,500;01:13:35,260;"OK, I don't want to block glass over this, but I forgot about the"
01:13:35,260;01:13:38,740;"incidental face mask penalty because that came out."
01:13:38,740;01:13:39,340;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:39,340;01:13:42,100;"Yeah, that's come up a couple times, like early in the season."
01:13:42,100;01:13:45,820;"Yeah, the incidental, which was what five yards and then, yeah."
01:13:45,820;01:13:48,780;"The intentional was 15."
01:13:48,780;01:13:50,780;"I kind of like that."
01:13:52,220;01:13:54,140;"I like to put it hard to like police, right?"
01:13:54,140;01:13:56,740;"Like what's in the dental and what's not."
01:13:56,740;01:13:58,100;"Well, I thought I'd change it."
01:13:58,100;01:14:00,780;"15 yards for something where you didn't mean to do it."
01:14:00,780;01:14:02,340;"Seems a bit extreme."
01:14:02,340;01:14:04,220;"Yeah, especially if you just brush it, you know."
01:14:04,220;01:14:04,860;"Yeah."
01:14:04,860;01:14:04,980;"Right."
01:14:04,980;01:14:07,220;"So that why not just meet in the middle and say all or 10?"
01:14:07,220;01:14:08,060;"Yeah."
01:14:08,060;01:14:09,580;"So they should have done."
01:14:09,580;01:14:10,420;"Oh, yeah."
01:14:10,420;01:14:11,900;"Look at us solving problems."
01:14:11,900;01:14:12,340;"Yeah."
01:14:12,340;01:14:14,540;"Where's the NFL?"
01:14:14,540;01:14:15,860;"Let's get them on the phone."
01:14:15,860;01:14:18,100;"Give Roger on the on the pod."
01:14:18,100;01:14:18,660;"Yeah."
01:14:18,660;01:14:19,260;"Oh, let's do it."
01:14:21,180;01:14:22,780;"That's what he doing now."
01:14:22,780;01:14:23,600;"Yeah."
01:14:23,600;01:14:29,660;"I saw that there was a, uh, there's a conspiracy there and going around that he's the one that"
01:14:29,660;01:14:32,540;"created this whole panic so that he doesn't get booed at the draft."
01:14:32,540;01:14:35,980;"You know, that has legs."
01:14:35,980;01:14:36,940;"Right."
01:14:36,940;01:14:40,060;"So I think we should find out where he's staying."
01:14:40,060;01:14:42,220;"He says, doesn't he have a house in Maine that he's probably saying it?"
01:14:42,220;01:14:43,140;"So we'll go there and boo him."
01:14:43,140;01:14:44,620;"He's got a house in Maine."
01:14:44,620;01:14:45,340;"Yeah."
01:14:45,340;01:14:46,980;"We're in Maine."
01:14:46,980;01:14:48,740;"Wow."
01:14:48,740;01:14:49,980;"I'm so sorry."
01:14:50,220;01:14:56,700;"Son of a bitch dude. How dare he like during the whole deflate gate some dude hired a plane to fly over his house"
01:14:56,700;01:15:00,740;"And people like leave signs and shit around his"
01:15:00,740;01:15:03,260;"front gate because of course the gated house"
01:15:03,260;01:15:06,300;"Yeah, I like his kind and man"
01:15:06,300;01:15:08,820;"No"
01:15:08,820;01:15:10,820;"Ginger's"
01:15:10,820;01:15:15,300;"John being like adjusted. Yeah rich people"
01:15:15,300;01:15:19,860;"We just rich people in general main doesn't like yeah, that's true. That's true"
01:15:19,860;01:15:21,860;"Yeah, that's why I like Maine."
01:15:21,860;01:15:23,860;"Does your poor?"
01:15:23,860;01:15:27,860;"Well, in personality, yes."
01:15:27,860;01:15:29,860;"[laughter]"
01:15:29,860;01:15:30,860;"That happens in girls."
01:15:30,860;01:15:32,860;"Richard looks, though, right?"
01:15:32,860;01:15:34,860;"Yes."
01:15:34,860;01:15:36,860;"Oh, Christ."
01:15:36,860;01:15:37,860;"All right, fourth quarter."
01:15:37,860;01:15:40,860;"Oh, actually, oh, one more thing in the third quarter."
01:15:40,860;01:15:44,860;"To kind of prime the pump of what was to come."
01:15:44,860;01:15:47,860;"Brady got Shrips Act."
01:15:47,860;01:15:52,860;"on his, well, on the second drive of the half."
01:15:52,860;01:15:54,420;"On the second down, yeah."
01:15:54,420;01:15:56,340;"Got strips that measure, recover his own fumble,"
01:15:56,340;01:16:00,340;"but in the sign of things to come, yeah."
01:16:00,340;01:16:02,660;"- Consider my pump primed."
01:16:02,660;01:16:03,680;"- Oh, baby."
01:16:03,680;01:16:05,920;"(laughing)"
01:16:05,920;01:16:09,920;"- Oh, man, the visual on that one is time."
01:16:09,920;01:16:10,940;"(laughing)"
01:16:10,940;01:16:12,060;"- I don't know if I can transition."
01:16:12,060;01:16:13,660;"You're gonna have to do it for me."
01:16:13,660;01:16:15,060;"- Well, build up the fourth quarter."
01:16:15,060;01:16:16,780;"Let's get this elated, like,"
01:16:16,780;01:16:20,380;"like you're doing the TV, like coming back from commercial"
01:16:20,380;01:16:22,400;"to start of the fourth."
01:16:22,400;01:16:23,500;"- Leave me into it."
01:16:23,500;01:16:26,940;"You seem to have something in mind."
01:16:26,940;01:16:28,620;"- No, you know what I mean, Steve."
01:16:28,620;01:16:30,980;"- What?"
01:16:30,980;01:16:33,220;"Can you lead us into the fourth quarter here?"
01:16:33,220;01:16:34,660;"Like build some tension a little bit."
01:16:34,660;01:16:38,180;"- Now, the moment you've all been waiting for."
01:16:38,180;01:16:40,660;"(laughing)"
01:16:40,660;01:16:45,660;"- Patriots, down by 10, the Patriots just got sacked"
01:16:46,100;01:16:51,020;"killing nice drive and the Raiders convert a quick first to open the fourth quarter."
01:16:51,020;01:16:53,140;"That's good."
01:16:53,140;01:16:54,500;"That was good."
01:16:54,500;01:16:55,740;"That was good."
01:16:55,740;01:16:56,980;"Is it accurate though?"
01:16:56,980;01:16:57,620;"Yes."
01:16:57,620;01:16:59,860;"No, it's a little bit else."
01:16:59,860;01:17:03,140;"Patriots finally put a nice drive together."
01:17:03,140;01:17:07,260;"Yeah, then they got sacked right around midfield."
01:17:07,260;01:17:11,140;"Yeah, back to the Raiders and they get the quick first and I was like, oh man, you"
01:17:11,140;01:17:13,260;"know, Raiders put a nice drive together there."
01:17:14,660;01:17:16,280;"They're inside 10"
01:17:16,280;01:17:18,800;"eight minutes left."
01:17:18,800;01:17:19,800;"Yeah."
01:17:19,800;01:17:23,740;"They had to burn a turn time out like 12 minutes left and third down."
01:17:23,740;01:17:24,840;"Oh, yeah."
01:17:24,840;01:17:25,040;"Yeah."
01:17:25,040;01:17:28,780;"They were cavalier with their timeouts, which I don't think I actually came back to"
01:17:28,780;01:17:32,780;"bite them, but felt pretty typical because they were actually talking about."
01:17:32,780;01:17:36,960;"Um, uh, fucking what's his name?"
01:17:36,960;01:17:41,540;"Rich Ganon, the quarterback and how he was a bit of a loose cannon."
01:17:41,540;01:17:43,060;"Ah, I didn't even mean to do that, but."
01:17:43,060;01:17:46,980;"- Fuck Christ."
01:17:46,980;01:17:53,060;"But yeah, the quote I wrote down was, I don't remember one of the commentaries that is talking"
01:17:53,060;01:17:58,220;"about when they interviewed John Gruden and what he had to say about Rich Gannen, it was,"
01:17:58,220;01:18:01,100;"you need a good night's sleep to deal with Rich Gannen on game day."
01:18:01,100;01:18:02,100;"He's high maintenance."
01:18:02,100;01:18:03,100;"- Yeah."
01:18:03,100;01:18:04,100;"- And so it's a good job."
01:18:04,100;01:18:06,540;"This was a night game because he got a lot of sleep."
01:18:06,540;01:18:11,100;"And apparently like the two of them, which is like bitch and mow each other, like during"
01:18:11,100;01:18:12,900;"games just like go after each other."
01:18:12,900;01:18:18,940;"Because Rich Ganon who'd been around since '87, which do you know who was drafted by?"
01:18:18,940;01:18:23,780;"Minnesota. No, you're New England Patriots."
01:18:23,780;01:18:25,580;"No. Yeah."
01:18:25,580;01:18:31,100;"The fourth round pick 98th overall in the 1987 draft by the New England Patriots."
01:18:31,100;01:18:32,740;"We drafted Rich Ganon."
01:18:32,740;01:18:34,380;"We drafted Rich Ganon."
01:18:34,380;01:18:35,740;"No, he's shit."
01:18:35,740;01:18:38,100;"Just goes to show what kind of times they were."
01:18:38,100;01:18:39,500;"And then just traded."
01:18:40,780;01:18:42,780;"I don't know how he left the team, but"
01:18:42,780;01:18:44,980;"how I never played here."
01:18:44,980;01:18:45,480;"Yeah."
01:18:45,480;01:18:46,080;"Yeah."
01:18:46,080;01:18:47,380;"Because he started."
01:18:47,380;01:18:48,980;"Yeah, his first year was in Minnesota."
01:18:48,980;01:18:50,680;"So never actually played for N"
01:18:50,680;01:18:51,180;"but he was drafted by them."
01:18:51,180;01:18:52,580;"Damn."
01:18:52,580;01:18:54,280;"So I don't know what happened there, but"
01:18:54,280;01:18:55,780;"I don't maybe listen to world."
01:18:55,780;01:18:58,180;"Tell us maybe a Minnesota Vikings fan."
01:18:58,180;01:18:59,080;"If there are any left."
01:18:59,080;01:19:02,180;"He had a pretty good career."
01:19:02,180;01:19:03,080;"Yeah."
01:19:03,080;01:19:03,580;"Yeah."
01:19:03,580;01:19:07,080;"But this was kind of the peak of his career"
01:19:07,080;01:19:09,380;"was like 99, 2000,"
01:19:09,780;01:19:13,420;"Well 99 through 2002 really made the level all four years"
01:19:13,420;01:19:16,100;"2002 he made he was a"
01:19:16,100;01:19:19,300;"all pro first team first email pro even"
01:19:19,300;01:19:24,180;"but yeah, the oh his Oakland days were where his"
01:19:24,180;01:19:27,180;"his real peak."
01:19:27,180;01:19:31,140;"Yeah, I don't any players say that."
01:19:31,140;01:19:33,700;"That's true."
01:19:33,700;01:19:38,980;"Well, it's an old school old school Raiders guys out there probably"
01:19:39,620;01:19:42,180;"You can definitely see Brady like turn it on this fourth quarter."
01:19:42,180;01:19:44,100;"Yeah."
01:19:44,100;01:19:48,060;"So yeah, like awesome delivery right as he's getting like form tackled."
01:19:48,060;01:19:49,660;"The Kevin fault."
01:19:49,660;01:19:50,340;"Yeah."
01:19:50,340;01:19:50,940;"So yeah."
01:19:50,940;01:19:56,180;"So in that his first like full drive of the fourth quarter, he, he went"
01:19:56,180;01:19:57,380;"nine straight completions."
01:19:57,380;01:19:58,460;"I think it was on that drive."
01:19:58,460;01:19:59,580;"Yeah."
01:19:59,580;01:20:01,260;"You let the ponies out of the stable."
01:20:01,260;01:20:01,580;"Yeah."
01:20:01,580;01:20:02,220;"There's a, you know what?"
01:20:02,220;01:20:02,540;"Fuck it."
01:20:02,540;01:20:05,220;"We're going to start trucking the ball because we're down to the reins off"
01:20:05,220;01:20:06,420;"and Tommy just took over."
01:20:08,380;01:20:13,380;"But in true page, his fashion did not throw a touchdown, but instead runs it in for"
01:20:13,380;01:20:16,180;"the touchdown, probably everybody who's listening to this actually remembers."
01:20:16,180;01:20:20,220;"But before that, what for the spike, I think,"
01:20:20,220;01:20:24,660;"and was the, uh, he started on like a wider receiver on the boundary."
01:20:24,660;01:20:27,060;"It was a patent, maybe who like impounds off his hands."
01:20:27,060;01:20:27,700;"Yeah."
01:20:27,700;01:20:31,020;"And then begins came right behind him and grabbed it and like, I would tap his feet"
01:20:31,020;01:20:31,580;"in bounds."
01:20:31,580;01:20:32,220;"Yeah."
01:20:32,220;01:20:35,620;"I was like, why wiggens was even there?"
01:20:35,620;01:20:36,780;"I don't know."
01:20:37,060;01:20:38,540;"I was at that point too. Yeah."
01:20:38,540;01:20:42,540;"There's a couple of plays where Wiggins was in suspect locations."
01:20:42,540;01:20:44,100;"There was."
01:20:44,100;01:20:45,220;"One more guy in the catch."
01:20:45,220;01:20:46,940;"Go for it and try to catch it."
01:20:46,940;01:20:47,380;"Yeah."
01:20:47,380;01:20:49,460;"Just like went right beyond him into Patton's hands."
01:20:49,460;01:20:50,100;"Yeah."
01:20:50,100;01:20:53,100;"Jesus Wiggins chill out."
01:20:53,100;01:20:54,900;"He was having himself a fucking day."
01:20:54,900;01:20:55,860;"He was having a great time."
01:20:55,860;01:20:56,620;"Yeah."
01:20:56,620;01:21:00,620;"I have a note on here because like on that Brady touchdown,"
01:21:00,620;01:21:02,940;"I mean, obviously we've all seen it a million times."
01:21:02,940;01:21:03,820;"Oh, yeah."
01:21:03,820;01:21:07,780;"Uh, I have beaker that old middle linebacker from the Raiders."
01:21:07,780;01:21:08,380;"Yep."
01:21:08,380;01:21:12,040;"He's like the OG Brian Erlacher is the same kind of like Brady"
01:21:12,040;01:21:15,820;"Juke's right goes left that he got her lacquer on in that bears game."
01:21:15,820;01:21:17,340;"Yeah."
01:21:17,340;01:21:18,580;"I thought that similar feel."
01:21:18,580;01:21:20,940;"It looked slow motion now."
01:21:20,940;01:21:21,460;"Yeah."
01:21:21,460;01:21:25,480;"I remember thinking it was pretty poor attempt at tackling because"
01:21:25,480;01:21:28,780;"Brady just kind of like fell forwards."
01:21:28,780;01:21:29,940;"Not so much juked."
01:21:31,780;01:21:34,440;"I have a stat check question for you, Greg."
01:21:34,440;01:21:35,280;"- Sure."
01:21:35,280;01:21:37,580;"- What's the longest TD runner Brady's career?"
01:21:37,580;01:21:39,560;"'Cause that was like eight yards"
01:21:39,560;01:21:40,880;"as longer than I remember."
01:21:40,880;01:21:43,880;"- Ooh, that's a great question."
01:21:43,880;01:21:48,360;"'Cause they're all like, there's a million one yarders."
01:21:48,360;01:21:51,220;"- Yeah, I mean, 22 yards."
01:21:51,220;01:21:52,680;"That was as long as run."
01:21:52,680;01:21:55,360;"I think you scored a 22 yard touchdown though."
01:21:55,360;01:21:56,860;"- Oh yeah, longest run."
01:21:56,860;01:21:59,400;"(laughs)"
01:21:59,400;01:22:00,640;"- And I love like the announcer's--"
01:22:00,640;01:22:01,480;"- Oh, yeah."
01:22:01,480;01:22:03,320;"Oh, look at Tom Brady celebrating"
01:22:03,320;01:22:06,160;"'cause he's so young, you know, you blew his mouth."
01:22:06,160;01:22:07,000;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:22:07,000;01:22:09,700;"- It made me think of that Julian Edelman"
01:22:09,700;01:22:11,800;"punt return touchdown against the Broncos."
01:22:11,800;01:22:15,000;"- Oh, where he ran down to."
01:22:15,000;01:22:17,040;"- Like, wait, were you with the end zone?"
01:22:17,040;01:22:21,540;"- I'm gonna say this may have been"
01:22:21,540;01:22:23,160;"his longest touchdown run."
01:22:23,160;01:22:25,840;"- How many yards was it?"
01:22:25,840;01:22:26,660;"- Six."
01:22:26,660;01:22:29,560;"- Yeah, he might be right."
01:22:29,560;01:22:32,360;"I don't think there's one that was longer."
01:22:32,360;01:22:33,360;"I don't."
01:22:33,360;01:22:34,360;"Yeah, because he didn't make it."
01:22:34,360;01:22:36,260;"And we're going to, uh, pagers."
01:22:36,260;01:22:38,860;"Dynasty.info if you do some searching."
01:22:38,860;01:22:42,260;"You know, that is wild."
01:22:42,260;01:22:43,060;"Yeah."
01:22:43,060;01:22:44,920;"Does he have a five road?"
01:22:44,920;01:22:49,460;"He does have a five yard touchdown scramble against the broncos."
01:22:49,460;01:22:51,060;"I don't remember this game."
01:22:51,060;01:22:52,360;"When was this?"
01:22:52,360;01:22:55,360;"2013, oh, the 2013 AFC championship."
01:22:55,360;01:22:56,760;"Yeah."
01:22:56,760;01:22:59,460;"He had a shoot moving that one."
01:22:59,460;01:23:03,780;"Yeah, so how about this Tom Brady playoff runner?"
01:23:03,780;01:23:06,180;"All his longest touchdown runs come in the playoffs."
01:23:06,180;01:23:10,700;"Oh, everything that's just Tom Brady."
01:23:10,700;01:23:14,420;"That's a stat longest touchdown run."
01:23:14,420;01:23:17,220;"Yeah, six Holy yards."
01:23:17,220;01:23:18,740;"He has a handful from four."
01:23:18,740;01:23:21,700;"Was this his first touchdown run as well?"
01:23:21,700;01:23:28,180;"Oh, remember one really pushing our capabilities here in the stats department."
01:23:28,180;01:23:30,260;"Yeah, that's a tough one."
01:23:30,260;01:23:34,260;"But we just watched every game this year, which is all the games he'd started at this"
01:23:34,260;01:23:35,260;"point."
01:23:35,260;01:23:36,260;"And I don't remember him."
01:23:36,260;01:23:37,780;"I don't remember any like QB sneaks."
01:23:37,780;01:23:38,780;"You're right."
01:23:38,780;01:23:39,780;"Yeah."
01:23:39,780;01:23:41,780;"I feel like this could be."
01:23:41,780;01:23:42,980;"Yeah, this is only run."
01:23:42,980;01:23:45,980;"It's only touchdown run of 2001."
01:23:45,980;01:23:48,900;"Look at that."
01:23:48,900;01:23:50,620;"His first and his longest."
01:23:50,620;01:23:54,820;"Yeah, it was all downhill from here."
01:23:54,820;01:23:58,020;"More uphill really for him if you watch him run."
01:23:58,020;01:24:02,220;"This is the first point in the game that it looked like we had a chance though."
01:24:02,220;01:24:03,220;"Yeah."
01:24:03,220;01:24:03,720;"Yeah."
01:24:03,720;01:24:07,380;"When they actually drove the ball down and they were just moving it easily."
01:24:07,380;01:24:10,900;"It seemed like even like even back to them, there was like a third in one."
01:24:10,900;01:24:13,100;"They did a quick, quick snap."
01:24:13,100;01:24:17,420;"Like we were definitely not ready and that took it under five minutes of play."
01:24:17,420;01:24:19,140;"And then you're like, Oh, I don't know."
01:24:19,140;01:24:19,340;"Yeah."
01:24:19,340;01:24:20,100;"Yeah."
01:24:20,100;01:24:21,420;"Cause the Raiders got that first down."
01:24:21,420;01:24:22,420;"Like you said, on that play."
01:24:22,420;01:24:23,980;"Yeah, which."
01:24:23,980;01:24:26,060;"Yeah."
01:24:26,060;01:24:30,260;"I feel like, yeah, it was, they almost held them"
01:24:30,260;01:24:31,960;"and then they didn't like it was third and short."
01:24:31,960;01:24:33,520;"And yeah, like you said, they did the quick snap."
01:24:33,520;01:24:34,740;"And they got like eight or nine yards"
01:24:34,740;01:24:35,900;"and that quick snap like stretch."
01:24:35,900;01:24:37,700;"Yeah, exactly."
01:24:37,700;01:24:40,400;"And then I have written down the pats,"
01:24:40,400;01:24:43,100;"get the ball back with 335 left,"
01:24:43,100;01:24:45,460;"get one first down and then punt it."
01:24:45,460;01:24:47,500;"So yeah, nowhere."
01:24:47,500;01:24:50,980;"Well, can we back up a little bit as far as like"
01:24:50,980;01:24:54,180;"these like fourth quarter comeback situations?"
01:24:54,180;01:24:55,620;"Like sure."
01:24:55,620;01:25:01,620;"It's it's gotten to a point now where it feels inevitable, right?"
01:25:01,620;01:25:02,420;"Oh, God."
01:25:02,420;01:25:04,620;"Like that Super Bowl against the Rams."
01:25:04,620;01:25:09,620;"You were like, yeah, you know, they're not scoring, but it's going to happen."
01:25:09,620;01:25:12,060;"You know, it's just a matter of when."
01:25:12,060;01:25:12,980;"Yeah."
01:25:12,980;01:25:14,860;"But I don't I don't get the feeling."
01:25:14,860;01:25:18,740;"And just from like reading a couple of the articles from around here, it it felt"
01:25:18,740;01:25:23,820;"like that was the opposite back then of it was a when does this fall apart?"
01:25:23,820;01:25:27,180;"not, you know, when are they gonna pull it out of their ass?"
01:25:27,180;01:25:30,660;"- And we've talked about that in regards to Drew Bledsoe as well"
01:25:30,660;01:25:33,240;"because that was kind of the knock on him"
01:25:33,240;01:25:35,740;"is he would hang in there the whole game"
01:25:35,740;01:25:38,140;"but then you'd have that last drive that you need to have"
01:25:38,140;01:25:39,900;"and something would go wrong."
01:25:39,900;01:25:41,180;"- Yeah. - Wasn't necessarily"
01:25:41,180;01:25:44,460;"Bledsoe's fault but often enough it was"
01:25:44,460;01:25:47,060;"like he'd throw a bad play or he's getting sacked,"
01:25:47,060;01:25:48,420;"he's throwing it over his back holes."
01:25:48,420;01:25:51,020;"- Yeah, that sort of shit."
01:25:51,020;01:25:52,620;"'Cause he just tried to put the team on his back"
01:25:52,620;01:25:55,800;"But yeah, this is kind of the beginning of that,"
01:25:55,800;01:25:59,000;"that different feel, like you said."
01:25:59,000;01:26:02,640;"- And that's where I think,"
01:26:02,640;01:26:05,440;"like Brady distinguishes himself,"
01:26:05,440;01:26:06,640;"not only from the rest of the league,"
01:26:06,640;01:26:08,800;"but from like the coaching staff,"
01:26:08,800;01:26:11,000;"where like the staff puts him in a place"
01:26:11,000;01:26:12,840;"where he can win games,"
01:26:12,840;01:26:15,640;"but like when it gets to crunch time"
01:26:15,640;01:26:17,800;"and you need this guy to start slinging the ball,"
01:26:17,800;01:26:20,160;"Tommy gets out there and just starts slinging."
01:26:20,160;01:26:24,200;"Yeah, like it just doesn't seem bothered by any sort of pressure."
01:26:24,200;01:26:27,280;"We just, it almost, he just thrives in it, you know?"
01:26:27,280;01:26:31,880;"It looks like he gets another gear when he's in those like crunch time moments."
01:26:31,880;01:26:33,880;"I've had to say this so many times."
01:26:33,880;01:26:38,000;"Oh, this bill checker Brady and it's like, he's both like bell check, puts you"
01:26:38,000;01:26:40,560;"in the position to get there and Brady has that extra gear."
01:26:40,560;01:26:41,360;"Yeah."
01:26:41,360;01:26:42,840;"Well, I'll check."
01:26:42,840;01:26:44,840;"Even though Brady'll win you the seatables."
01:26:44,840;01:26:45,200;"Yeah."
01:26:45,200;01:26:49,160;"And you could even see it from Brady's third start when he was playing the"
01:26:49,280;01:26:52,840;"Chargers and I know you guys weren't there for that episode. I think it's just me and Mike, but"
01:26:52,840;01:26:56,180;"He pulled him from like way down"
01:26:56,180;01:27:02,520;"Late to the point where I was watching the game and I'm thinking I think I'm watching the right game"
01:27:02,520;01:27:08,680;"I don't but they they come back and win this and this is literally his third start and the one where he threw his first"
01:27:08,680;01:27:12,200;"Touchdown pass to Terry when and he pulled him back and then won an overtime"
01:27:12,200;01:27:15,480;"That's his third game ever and so you kind of even saw it early"
01:27:17,000;01:27:19,720;"But then you don't really see it again the rest of this season"
01:27:19,720;01:27:23,440;"Up until this"
01:27:23,440;01:27:29,040;"Yeah, I would see it a lot more in the next few years"
01:27:29,040;01:27:33,720;"To the point where I am sure it was more surprising when it didn't happen"
01:27:33,720;01:27:36,720;"Yeah"
01:27:36,720;01:27:39,960;"Yeah"
01:27:42,120;01:27:45,480;"- If you didn't get Strips Act, he was about to."
01:27:45,480;01:27:47,440;"- And he still almost did."
01:27:47,440;01:27:48,960;"- I'm not sure, yes."
01:27:48,960;01:27:50,320;"- But that was the best thing about Brady,"
01:27:50,320;01:27:52,760;"is there was, there's so few times where you're like,"
01:27:52,760;01:27:54,920;"I would have, 'cause he just did."
01:27:54,920;01:27:57,320;"- Yeah, he always did."
01:27:57,320;01:27:59,440;"- Even like coming back against Atlanta,"
01:27:59,440;01:28:02,360;"where it'd be like, there was so many points in that game"
01:28:02,360;01:28:04,200;"where you would be like, even if they don't win this,"
01:28:04,200;01:28:07,480;"you're gonna look back fondly on how Brady played."
01:28:07,480;01:28:08,320;"- Yeah."
01:28:08,320;01:28:11,600;"- But that wasn't enough, he just, he still did it."
01:28:11,600;01:28:15,840;"which is like, I think he just as hard as getting there, you know?"
01:28:15,840;01:28:16,840;"Yeah."
01:28:16,840;01:28:21,520;"And go back to both your points about whether it's Bill or Tom."
01:28:21,520;01:28:28,280;"We can go back to the game where Bellatract took the wind in overtime against the Broncos"
01:28:28,280;01:28:29,280;"in that game."
01:28:29,280;01:28:31,560;"Because Brady pulled them all the way back in that game too, remember?"
01:28:31,560;01:28:33,920;"They went down like 24-0 to something at halftime."
01:28:33,920;01:28:34,920;"Mm-hmm."
01:28:34,920;01:28:35,920;"I was at that game."
01:28:35,920;01:28:36,920;"That was fucking freezing."
01:28:36,920;01:28:37,920;"Yeah."
01:28:37,920;01:28:41,560;"I was at that game where your beer was freezing because you weren't drinking it quick enough."
01:28:41,560;01:28:48,000;"Yeah, it was like two rows from the top of the stadium and it was like 10 degrees and"
01:28:48,000;01:28:56,560;"We did it. Yeah. Yeah, and we're down 24 nothing at halftime. Yeah, I came up you stay for that game"
01:28:56,560;01:29:02,760;"It's crazy. Yeah, we said that if if if the Patriots didn't score in their opening drive in the second half"
01:29:02,760;01:29:06,880;"We're gonna leave and then they scored and then it's good again and it scored again"
01:29:06,880;01:29:08,480;"and we're like, we ain't fucking leave."
01:29:08,480;01:29:10,920;"That might have been that Jules Plunter turn game"
01:29:10,920;01:29:12,920;"that I referenced earlier, right?"
01:29:12,920;01:29:15,480;"- Yeah, I think you did have one in that game."
01:29:15,480;01:29:17,720;"- No, I think it wasn't that one."
01:29:17,720;01:29:20,680;"- It was the Muff Welker one, we waved it off."
01:29:20,680;01:29:23,680;"- Yeah, yeah, but I think, I thought,"
01:29:23,680;01:29:26,720;"Edelman had a part return for Tushion in that game too though."
01:29:26,720;01:29:27,840;"Now he had that weird one,"
01:29:27,840;01:29:29,840;"we took like the bubble screen and they dove"
01:29:29,840;01:29:30,680;"from the five yard line."
01:29:30,680;01:29:33,000;"- Yeah, he did have that one, yeah, that was green."
01:29:33,000;01:29:33,880;"That was iconic."
01:29:33,880;01:29:36,440;"- Like, we're talking about those."
01:29:36,440;01:29:37,280;"So the Raiders game."
01:29:37,280;01:29:39,400;"(laughing)"
01:29:39,400;01:29:40,860;"- So now memory lane."
01:29:40,860;01:29:41,700;"- That's what we gotta do."
01:29:41,700;01:29:42,820;"That's what this is for."
01:29:42,820;01:29:47,560;"So yeah, well, let's talk about this comeback, shall we?"
01:29:47,560;01:29:48,560;"Patriots down."
01:29:48,560;01:29:50,800;"- Yeah, so 13 to three."
01:29:50,800;01:29:52,580;"- Down under five to play."
01:29:52,580;01:29:53,600;"- Yeah."
01:29:53,600;01:29:57,780;"- We blitz on the next third down, get the ball back."
01:29:57,780;01:29:59,060;"- Yep."
01:29:59,060;01:30:00,940;"- And go absolutely nowhere."
01:30:00,940;01:30:04,200;"They got one first down and then have to punt it right back."
01:30:04,200;01:30:05,120;"So."
01:30:05,120;01:30:05,960;"- Yeah."
01:30:05,960;01:30:08,400;"- Ready to get the ball with 241 left."
01:30:08,400;01:30:10,760;"- There's a sweet, another grab by Andrew Wiggins"
01:30:10,760;01:30:13,120;"and there with the bat, the ball between his two hands"
01:30:13,120;01:30:15,680;"and catches it just being super lucky again."
01:30:15,680;01:30:16,520;"- Yeah."
01:30:16,520;01:30:17,840;"(laughing)"
01:30:17,840;01:30:19,520;"- Such a dangerous."
01:30:19,520;01:30:22,000;"- Dude, Phil Sims gets hit by a snowball"
01:30:22,000;01:30:23,360;"from a guy in the ground."
01:30:23,360;01:30:25,000;"- Oh, that's right."
01:30:25,000;01:30:26,080;"That was awesome."
01:30:26,080;01:30:29,400;"- And he's like, ""Greg, I think that was aimed at you."""
01:30:29,400;01:30:30,560;"(laughing)"
01:30:30,560;01:30:33,520;"- You could tell he was like initially pissed, too."
01:30:33,520;01:30:35,640;"- He was, he's like, ""I can see the guy who did it."""
01:30:35,640;01:30:36,140;"Yeah."
01:30:36,140;01:30:40,940;"Dude, imagine being that guy that threw that."
01:30:40,940;01:30:45,740;"You can he can watch this game on YouTube for years to come and be like,"
01:30:45,740;01:30:46,640;"it was me."
01:30:46,640;01:30:51,240;"Honestly, I can imagine you being the guy that threw that."
01:30:51,240;01:30:52,740;"Oh, dude, he's a legend."
01:30:52,740;01:30:56,840;"It was that and he's got people like us watching this game here."
01:30:56,840;01:30:59,640;"And like, did you see that part where I can tell Sims get it?"
01:30:59,640;01:31:02,240;"Plot twist."
01:31:02,240;01:31:03,340;"I don't know who that is."
01:31:03,340;01:31:04,440;"Frozen beer."
01:31:04,440;01:31:06,600;"We can find out who that is."
01:31:06,600;01:31:07,760;"We should have them on the podcast."
01:31:07,760;01:31:08,400;"Yeah."
01:31:08,400;01:31:08,920;"Yeah."
01:31:08,920;01:31:09,640;"Guest of honor."
01:31:09,640;01:31:13,560;"Put an APB or whatever that thing is called."
01:31:13,560;01:31:15,000;"Yeah."
01:31:15,000;01:31:19,360;"So then the Patriots are three for 11 on third down."
01:31:19,360;01:31:22,200;"Yeah, not going away."
01:31:22,200;01:31:23,440;"247 left."
01:31:23,440;01:31:24,480;"Yeah."
01:31:24,480;01:31:24,720;"Yeah."
01:31:24,720;01:31:28,560;"Ray has got the ball back with 241 and basically you'll three and out."
01:31:28,560;01:31:32,320;"Can't come because they had a third one and couldn't convert again, which is"
01:31:32,960;01:31:34,960;"Second time see more"
01:31:34,960;01:31:38,200;"Seymour monster on that play. Oh my god. He were"
01:31:38,200;01:31:43,880;"Was the on the third but like lawyer came flying in on the second down to like both those guys"
01:31:43,880;01:31:49,440;"Loyalgies. How about that hit by Bruce key? Yeah, it's up the middle"
01:31:49,440;01:31:51,960;"lawyer Malloy I"
01:31:51,960;01:31:53,960;"Had that he was just"
01:31:53,960;01:31:59,120;"The only guy out there who looked like he could still like lay the wood because everybody else kind of like skating around"
01:31:59,440;01:32:03,920;"And every once in a while you see Loyola come out of nowhere and just thump somebody and he was the one"
01:32:03,920;01:32:06,360;"I was able to like actually get a thumping on somebody"
01:32:06,360;01:32:09,080;"That's fantastic him and actually"
01:32:09,080;01:32:11,800;"and"
01:32:11,800;01:32:17,120;"What's his name fuck I'll remember one day your friend's name Steve"
01:32:17,120;01:32:25,680;"Navi yeah, there you go. So Navi actually was the one to call this out that Roman Fyfer had a great game in this game"
01:32:26,440;01:32:29,440;"Like he was the only one that could tackle Charlie Garner, I thought"
01:32:29,440;01:32:37,600;"Apparently that was just me cool. Yeah, I did not that did not jump out to me at all"
01:32:37,600;01:32:44,080;"Oh, no, I didn't have a signed Roman Fiverr football card. So yeah for the Rams"
01:32:44,080;01:32:47,100;"But still I probably still have it somewhere kicking around"
01:32:47,100;01:32:50,280;"That'd be awesome. Hell yeah"
01:32:50,280;01:32:55,920;"Roman Fiverr guy was probably worth as much as you fucking Pokemon cards, Andy"
01:32:55,920;01:33:16,380;"the other you're Pokemon cards I can't talk about bro you know I had a Charizard holographic to the things worth more than money it's worth it's worth memories didn't you give that to my nephew did I yeah you gave my car so good."
01:33:16,380;01:33:23,020;"If you can use them to the memories."
01:33:23,020;01:33:33,500;"I never love memories and I guess it's really a bad game but you're pretty solid punter turn in this up until you fumbled it a second time so yeah and that actually leaves me."
01:33:33,500;01:33:42,780;"Now I'm gonna save the I'm gonna say something for you. I know you're saving. I don't know if you do I'm just gonna spoiler right now Larry is so too."
01:33:42,780;01:33:44,860;"- Motherfucker. - We think it's"
01:33:44,860;01:33:46,620;"- You think I can watch the game Andy?"
01:33:46,620;01:33:47,620;"- I think I can watch it."
01:33:47,620;01:33:49,540;"- You're looking at my fucking notes."
01:33:49,540;01:33:51,060;"- How am I looking at your notes, dude?"
01:33:51,060;01:33:54,100;"- I wanna say Larry is a unsung hero of this game."
01:33:54,100;01:33:55,300;"Without Larry is, you know,"
01:33:55,300;01:33:59,660;"it's two fumbles 'cause Troy Brown fumbled two puns"
01:33:59,660;01:34:01,980;"and Larry is a recover both of them."
01:34:01,980;01:34:03,300;"- Yeah, I said that one. - Yeah, without that,"
01:34:03,300;01:34:06,100;"two of those drives are ended immediately."
01:34:06,100;01:34:10,460;"One of those is the one that leads up to the fourth quarter."
01:34:10,460;01:34:12,180;"this one now, which."
01:34:12,180;01:34:16,760;"I don't know, does somebody want to take the reins"
01:34:16,760;01:34:17,600;"on this one?"
01:34:17,600;01:34:18,980;"'Cause this is a pretty important drive here."
01:34:18,980;01:34:20,860;"- That's all we're gonna say about Larry, is it?"
01:34:20,860;01:34:23,140;"- What else you got?"
01:34:23,140;01:34:26,140;"- I don't know. - It's like the team's captain."
01:34:26,140;01:34:29,580;"- Yeah, this is coming out party."
01:34:29,580;01:34:30,940;"- This is-- - Put a moment off."
01:34:30,940;01:34:32,780;"You can claim for a while at this point, right?"
01:34:32,780;01:34:33,620;"- Eddie."
01:34:33,620;01:34:34,460;"- I think so."
01:34:34,460;01:34:39,300;"Am I, I'll find him on this list?"
01:34:39,300;01:34:41,060;"Let's find out."
01:34:41,060;01:34:48,060;"Now he was only like, he's 27, been in the league for five years."
01:34:48,060;01:34:48,980;"Yeah."
01:34:48,980;01:34:49,980;"Yeah."
01:34:49,980;01:34:50,980;"So you've been around."
01:34:50,980;01:34:53,460;"I had made the Pro Bowl the year before."
01:34:53,460;01:34:55,380;"Yeah, I thought he was really awesome."
01:34:55,380;01:34:58,140;"Yeah, with Miami."
01:34:58,140;01:34:59,660;"But this is how he works here."
01:34:59,660;01:35:01,700;"I'm a special teamer though."
01:35:01,700;01:35:03,860;"Well, this is first year on the Patriots."
01:35:03,860;01:35:04,660;"It was, yes."
01:35:04,660;01:35:05,660;"Yes."
01:35:05,660;01:35:07,100;"Oh."
01:35:07,100;01:35:08,420;"Making his mark."
01:35:08,420;01:35:08,920;"Nice."
01:35:08,920;01:35:10,340;"First of eight years on the Patriots."
01:35:10,340;01:35:10,700;"Yeah."
01:35:10,700;01:35:11,140;"For him."
01:35:11,140;01:35:12,500;"That's what I want."
01:35:12,500;01:35:15,460;"Matt, he said, just like he's later was Matthew Slater."
01:35:15,460;01:35:19,540;"Yeah, wouldn't it be sweet to play in like a big game, but not"
01:35:19,540;01:35:23,380;"have the pressure of actually having to perform, but just like accidentally"
01:35:23,380;01:35:26,020;"fall on two fun bowls and be like, too, not contributed."
01:35:26,020;01:35:28,260;"You know, that's always been my dream."
01:35:28,260;01:35:30,460;"So that's exactly who I would be to."
01:35:30,460;01:35:31,340;"I would be that guy."
01:35:31,340;01:35:31,900;"Yeah."
01:35:31,900;01:35:36,060;"I would be the guy that can't blow it, but he can save it."
01:35:36,060;01:35:36,740;"You know?"
01:35:37,020;01:35:41,020;"Oh yeah, that role player who's probably the glue guy on the sidelines too."
01:35:41,020;01:35:44,620;"That's why we were captain, you know, great locker room guy."
01:35:44,620;01:35:45,380;"Yeah."
01:35:45,380;01:35:48,740;"Maybe not the most skill, but you know, yeah, I warmed up the"
01:35:48,740;01:35:50,300;"closer, so good in the bullpen."
01:35:50,300;01:35:56,580;"Yeah, but I mean, just like, but that kind of goes to the, the point of this"
01:35:56,580;01:36:01,860;"Bellacheck system too, as he has these guys in there, even in 2001, which maybe"
01:36:01,860;01:36:04,140;"some of that's a bit luckier this early, but."
01:36:05,300;01:36:09,500;"We also talked like way back at the beginning of this season,"
01:36:09,500;01:36:14,300;"how Bella Check had brought in a team different free agents."
01:36:14,300;01:36:16,400;"And they were all like 10 year veterans."
01:36:16,400;01:36:17,000;"Yeah."
01:36:17,000;01:36:22,000;"And so guys like Izzo is not quite that, but I mean, he's a veteran in this league"
01:36:22,000;01:36:23,900;"brought him in just to play special teams."
01:36:23,900;01:36:28,000;"And now he's got two fumble recoveries in what at this point is the most important in the season."
01:36:28,000;01:36:31,900;"It's a pro bowl, dolphin special teamer that he signs as a free agent."
01:36:31,900;01:36:32,500;"Right."
01:36:32,500;01:36:33,000;"Exactly."
01:36:33,000;01:36:34,600;"That's a classic dog check move."
01:36:35,100;01:36:36,060;"Yeah, Claire."
01:36:36,060;01:36:39,920;"Probably we get to him on the pay"
01:36:39,920;01:36:42,780;"him. Oh, probably. Yeah."
01:36:42,780;01:36:45,700;"And you'll pay those middle level guys more than any other"
01:36:45,700;01:36:48,340;"middle level guys will make. Yeah, the Bellagic system, right?"
01:36:48,340;01:36:52,660;"Definitely is. So yeah, so like you said, Troy Brown actually"
01:36:52,660;01:36:54,820;"a really good partner turn sleep fumbled it, but luckily the"
01:36:54,820;01:36:59,160;"patch recovered. So I started out, I think like right around"
01:36:59,160;01:37:03,940;"midfield, right? No, you went around there. Take I was at this"
01:37:03,940;01:37:06,380;"point in the game, it was really tough to tell where anybody was."
01:37:06,380;01:37:07,300;"Yeah."
01:37:07,300;01:37:08,420;"I had no idea."
01:37:08,420;01:37:15,860;"And like you could actually hear the, the, the announcer like in, in like not in"
01:37:15,860;01:37:19,140;"the broadcast, but like the announcer in the stadium announcing where the ball"
01:37:19,140;01:37:22,020;"was sometimes just because nobody had any fucking clue."
01:37:22,020;01:37:25,260;"I like the old school announcer too."
01:37:25,260;01:37:26,900;"Over the loudspeaker to."
01:37:26,900;01:37:27,500;"Yeah."
01:37:27,500;01:37:28,660;"It feels like a high school game."
01:37:28,660;01:37:29,620;"Yes."
01:37:29,620;01:37:32,860;"They should bring that back and while I'm Smith, Smith, Smith."
01:37:33,380;01:37:36,840;"Yeah. Six yard gate on the carry, carry, carry, carry."
01:37:36,840;01:37:37,680;"Yes."
01:37:37,680;01:37:39,880;"I love that."
01:37:39,880;01:37:41,080;"That's pretty sweet."
01:37:41,080;01:37:42,920;"It does have a good filter, doesn't it?"
01:37:42,920;01:37:43,580;"Yeah."
01:37:43,580;01:37:45,580;"Just gives me the right feel on it."
01:37:45,580;01:37:46,580;"It's like Christmas, you know?"
01:37:46,580;01:37:47,480;"Yeah."
01:37:47,480;01:37:51,480;"When you started watching this game, that's what you that's what you sent us."
01:37:51,480;01:37:54,380;"Because if you watch the game in the snow, it feels like Christmas."
01:37:54,380;01:37:55,080;"It's right."
01:37:55,080;01:37:55,580;"It does."
01:37:55,580;01:37:56,180;"Yeah."
01:37:56,180;01:38:03,180;"So first and 10 at their own 46, two minutes left,"
01:38:03,180;01:38:11,020;"down by three. Yep. It's Brady time. Brady moves the ball a little bit. And now all of a sudden,"
01:38:11,020;01:38:16,620;"it is second and 10 on the rate of 42 with a minute 47 left. They moved the ball a little bit,"
01:38:16,620;01:38:21,340;"not a ton. Brady had our first time. It's a simple in that move in the ball, which he did."
01:38:21,340;01:38:26,940;"I totally forgot about. Yeah. And this is this is the difference between this is what"
01:38:26,940;01:38:30,780;"Tom Brady brings to the the Patriots offense that Drew Blenzo doesn't remember."
01:38:30,780;01:38:32,780;"a big running element."
01:38:32,780;01:38:33,780;"Exactly."
01:38:33,780;01:38:37,780;"Which nobody's ever said about him since."
01:38:37,780;01:38:40,780;"Even though he's a thousand-yard rusher."
01:38:40,780;01:38:41,780;"Yeah."
01:38:41,780;01:38:46,780;"Oh man, that still gets to me."
01:38:46,780;01:38:48,780;"Yeah, so second and ten,"
01:38:48,780;01:38:51,780;"Raider 42, minute 47 left in the game."
01:38:51,780;01:38:54,780;"And his old college teammate"
01:38:54,780;01:38:58,780;"comes running off of his right side."
01:38:58,780;01:39:03,780;"very un-brady like at least now it is to not be."
01:39:03,780;01:39:06,740;"- But he got blown up a bunch in this season."
01:39:06,740;01:39:08,140;"- Yeah, I mean, I knew it was coming,"
01:39:08,140;01:39:11,580;"so I was watching for Woodson to come on that blitz,"
01:39:11,580;01:39:13,380;"and he didn't hide it."
01:39:13,380;01:39:16,260;"He took like three steps towards the line of scrimmage"
01:39:16,260;01:39:17,580;"before Brady hiked the ball."
01:39:17,580;01:39:20,020;"It was, you know, if you,"
01:39:20,020;01:39:22,700;"if I would assume most quarterbacks would see that coming,"
01:39:22,700;01:39:24,580;"at least these days, but."
01:39:24,580;01:39:25,660;"- Well, I mean, just overall,"
01:39:25,660;01:39:27,780;"the season Brady got blown up,"
01:39:27,780;01:39:31,780;"like Blindside hit a lot more than I remember."
01:39:31,780;01:39:33,780;"Yeah, I agree."
01:39:33,780;01:39:34,780;"He's a rookie."
01:39:34,780;01:39:37,780;"Blindside hit, Brady's taken like, couldn't tell you."
01:39:37,780;01:39:38,780;"Yeah."
01:39:38,780;01:39:44,780;"Well, he was also sacked, I think, the most in his career in this season."
01:39:44,780;01:39:45,780;"Really?"
01:39:45,780;01:39:48,780;"45 times, yeah."
01:39:48,780;01:39:53,780;"Surprise you didn't get hurt because he didn't have elongated tendons at this point either."
01:39:53,780;01:39:55,780;"Maybe he did get hurt."
01:39:55,780;01:40:01,940;"Well, he did get hurt just not this game. We'll get to that. It's true. It's true"
01:40:01,940;01:40:07,780;"Next week. Yeah, the real time is we're longer"
01:40:07,780;01:40:14,420;"So the commentate word like definitely a fumble"
01:40:14,420;01:40:20,820;"But then like they played it for the replay on the fans and you hear the fans all know about the tuck rule. Yeah"
01:40:23,460;01:40:26,580;"Don't give me that Steve everybody knew the tuck rule"
01:40:26,580;01:40:32,720;"You're out of your mind that's a tough call"
01:40:32,720;01:40:37,620;"They saw the slightest movement of the arm forwards and like any fan in the world"
01:40:37,620;01:40:41,120;"It's pissed drunk in the fourth quarter. They're going to complete"
01:40:41,120;01:40:47,900;"Yeah, which is exactly what happened, but we have a little existing of like if his arm is like not all the way back"
01:40:47,900;01:40:52,780;"Contucked in that's a incomplete versus a fumble. No, they had no idea"
01:40:52,780;01:40:59,980;"idea. I mean, they were ready to boo heavily when a wall Coleman, whoever the fuck it was, came back from his review."
01:40:59,980;01:41:12,340;"But yeah, I mean, we've talked about it. All right, we've seen this twice once in the Jets game, where it was Vinnie Testa Verde. I think it was the first Jets game, right? Where he did the same thing."
01:41:13,620;01:41:17,060;"And then just last week for us."
01:41:17,060;01:41:17,820;"Yeah."
01:41:17,820;01:41:21,300;"In the last game in the season where it was right."
01:41:21,300;01:41:23,300;"The end of the half in was it a winky?"
01:41:23,300;01:41:24,340;"Yep."
01:41:24,340;01:41:27,540;"It was Chris Winky was the quarterback and he it was exact same thing where"
01:41:27,540;01:41:33,020;"it was this botched Hail Mary and he it was almost exactly the same motion to"
01:41:33,020;01:41:34,020;"where he was tucking it down."
01:41:34,020;01:41:36,020;"He fumbled it and basically threw it right into the ground."
01:41:36,020;01:41:40,700;"All I'm saying recovered and could have walked in for a touchdown, but they blew it"
01:41:40,700;01:41:41,580;"dead. Same thing."
01:41:41,580;01:41:46,460;"is if you watch closely Woodson hits Brady in the head"
01:41:46,460;01:41:50,820;"with his arm, which is a personal foul 15 yards."
01:41:50,820;01:41:52,220;"And"
01:41:52,220;01:41:54,300;"I think first then, yep, Steve,"
01:41:54,300;01:41:56,660;"you know, incidental face mask."
01:41:56,660;01:41:59,540;"It was roughing the passer."
01:41:59,540;01:42:02,300;"That was a fumble."
01:42:02,300;01:42:06,180;"I'm just I'm just pissed the refs miss that rough in the passer call."
01:42:06,180;01:42:07,460;"It's a fumble now."
01:42:07,460;01:42:09,300;"It wasn't then, dude."
01:42:09,300;01:42:10,660;"It's it's a fumble."
01:42:11,060;01:42:14,900;"It was the right call at the time because there was a tuck rule at the time."
01:42:14,900;01:42:21,300;"Even that tuck rule, like that's meant to be like you lose control of it on a"
01:42:21,300;01:42:22,300;"pump fake, right?"
01:42:22,300;01:42:26,300;"No, no, it gets jarred loose."
01:42:26,300;01:42:30,940;"They were saying that the throwing motion encapsulates like the cocking the"
01:42:30,940;01:42:33,900;"all the way forward and then the pull back in and then as long as his arm is"
01:42:33,900;01:42:36,180;"moving forward, it's a fun way slipping doesn't matter."
01:42:36,180;01:42:37,340;"It doesn't have to slip out of your arm."
01:42:37,340;01:42:39,940;"I think it's a fumble."
01:42:39,940;01:42:50,940;"I mean if you look at it in real speed yeah it's like a fumble and today's day and age shirts a fumble but in today's day and age it's also a personal file hit to the head."
01:42:50,940;01:42:53,940;"Steve."
01:42:53,940;01:43:08,940;"I'd be ripped shit if I was a raider fan you know I mean like to get off on a technicality as not he is told the hundreds of times that call cost them to super bowls."
01:43:08,940;01:43:11,940;"Let's see who's convinced they're about to start their own dynasty."
01:43:11,940;01:43:13,940;"Yeah, he did say that."
01:43:13,940;01:43:17,940;"And Gruden wouldn't have left and then they would have won the next year too."
01:43:17,940;01:43:20,940;"Yeah, I mean, that's fair."
01:43:20,940;01:43:23,940;"They were a good team."
01:43:23,940;01:43:25,940;"But, you know, some teams can't like him."
01:43:25,940;01:43:28,940;"He completely ignores being the Steelers and the Rams."
01:43:28,940;01:43:31,940;"But, you know, it's not the point."
01:43:31,940;01:43:35,940;"And the fact that there's still like under two minutes left in this game."
01:43:35,940;01:43:36,940;"Yeah."
01:43:36,940;01:43:43,820;"are still losing technically. Yeah, but if they get that, the game's over. It's kneel down time."
01:43:43,820;01:43:49,100;"Yeah, sure. But the Steelers were a wagon. The Rams were even more of a wagon. Like those"
01:43:49,100;01:43:55,660;"are two best teams and that fell. Yeah. Yeah, they were like a class above everybody else."
01:43:55,660;01:43:57,580;"It was a Super Bowl. Okay."
01:43:57,580;01:44:05,980;"Yeah. Yeah. There's sometimes in your sports fan, and we have to admit that the other team got"
01:44:05,980;01:44:13,260;"jobbed. And to me, this is one of those cases, you know, where I could if I was on the other"
01:44:13,260;01:44:17,060;"side of this call, I would be ripped shit. Yeah. Yeah."
01:44:17,060;01:44:23,460;"Yeah. I mean, I have all the sympathy, I have all the sympathy in the world for for Raiders fans"
01:44:23,460;01:44:27,500;"for this. I'd be I'd be pissed that my parents were bringing us up as Raiders fans personally."
01:44:27,500;01:44:34,180;"But I have a note on here. I'm surprised Grinn's snow on his hat didn't melt. He's so hot."
01:44:34,180;01:44:37,300;"That's a good one."
01:44:37,300;01:44:39,500;"That's a great gumball thing to say."
01:44:39,500;01:44:42,940;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:44:42,940;01:44:45,820;"But even so, I have another point."
01:44:45,820;01:44:47,060;"They're on the 42."
01:44:47,060;01:44:48,780;"They couldn't keep the field goal there."
01:44:48,780;01:44:53,700;"If they stop them on the third and suing third and 10,"
01:44:53,700;01:44:55,300;"this would just be a footnote."
01:44:55,300;01:44:56,060;"Yep."
01:44:56,060;01:44:58,740;"And instead Brady hits Patton immediately"
01:44:58,740;01:45:01,220;"for a first down to 28."
01:45:01,220;01:45:01,720;"Yep."
01:45:01,720;01:45:03,660;"And this kind of goes back to Tom Brady again,"
01:45:03,660;01:45:09,660;"just not. He's been doing this all season. He's been up and down, but every time he makes"
01:45:09,660;01:45:13,700;"mistake like that or something, the next play, they won the Patriots, let him throw the ball."
01:45:13,700;01:45:17,620;"And two, he goes out and just slings it. And it usually good things happen."
01:45:17,620;01:45:25,060;"I mean, it's easy to say, but I'm looking, you're reeling from a call like that, not going"
01:45:25,060;01:45:29,940;"your way. Definitely. Yeah. That's a momentum shifter for sure. Sure. But it wasn't like"
01:45:31,380;01:45:33,100;"They had like, they had at least one more chance."
01:45:33,100;01:45:35,580;"And then I'm still over time and all that."
01:45:35,580;01:45:40,260;"Yeah, they got jobs."
01:45:40,260;01:45:43,780;"The creator disagree."
01:45:43,780;01:45:44,780;"The right call."
01:45:44,780;01:45:48,780;"Oh, I say, I say, what's your opinion on this, Andy?"
01:45:48,780;01:45:52,100;"I just told you, I mean, what?"
01:45:52,100;01:45:54,020;"Yeah, it was, it's a, it's a shitty rule."
01:45:54,020;01:45:58,820;"And I can understand why they feel like they got robbed, but it was called to the"
01:45:58,820;01:46:03,660;"letter of the law at the time. Just sucks that it got overturned too."
01:46:03,660;01:46:10,180;"You know, yeah. In the other ones, like I bet more rest than not would call that fumble."
01:46:10,180;01:46:12,020;"It's sort of a mind."
01:46:12,020;01:46:13,940;"It does Brian."
01:46:13,940;01:46:16,100;"First the Packers. Remember that?"
01:46:16,100;01:46:18,740;"Oh, they got raw catch or not. Yeah. Yeah."
01:46:18,740;01:46:19,740;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:46:19,740;01:46:21,580;"Which like that's a huge Greg."
01:46:21,580;01:46:28,500;"Greg, you really think that another referee in Foxborough in that game in that stadium is"
01:46:28,500;01:46:32,080;"is going to call that against the Patriots. Yeah. I don't know that they would."
01:46:32,080;01:46:36,060;"Dude, listen to the way that commentators are talking about it."
01:46:36,060;01:46:39,860;"I know, but I think home fetal advantage is a real thing, but it wouldn't have even"
01:46:39,860;01:46:43,700;"been a controversy if they were just like, if they didn't even review it, you know, it"
01:46:43,700;01:46:48,100;"wouldn't have been a controversy if the Patriots lost either. It's only because the Patriots"
01:46:48,100;01:46:54,100;"married to pull it out of the end. Yes. Exactly. And that game, that call changed the result"
01:46:54,100;01:46:56,300;"of the game. Yeah. Yeah."
01:46:56,300;01:47:03,500;"Yeah. That's what I'm saying. You can say like, Oh, letter of the law, this and that."
01:47:03,500;01:47:08,420;"Well, then fine. Fuck the law. You know what I'm saying? Like somebody made this law if"
01:47:08,420;01:47:14,940;"that's an eight, you know, that's why they had still be and that's even worse because"
01:47:14,940;01:47:20,340;"now you're admitting that the fucking call is dumb to begin with. Yeah, I agree. I would"
01:47:20,340;01:47:25,860;"just be ripped shit. I'd, I wouldn't be over it now, you know, 20 years later."
01:47:25,860;01:47:32,180;"Oh, I point though, is that they had chances to change ultimately and make it a footnote."
01:47:32,180;01:47:37,580;"They didn't. Yeah, but that's, you know, even in overtime, you can say that about any game."
01:47:37,580;01:47:46,980;"They made it play. Let's get there. So we all know what happens, right? Yeah. What happens?"
01:47:48,500;01:47:51,980;"Adam, Vinnitary, 45 yards out."
01:47:51,980;01:47:57,060;"When blown in his face, actually blown in his back, according to the commentators."
01:47:57,060;01:48:02,540;"Squeaks a 45 yard field goal in probably like six inches of snow at this point, like"
01:48:02,540;01:48:03,820;"it's just piling up around them."
01:48:03,820;01:48:10,780;"To another iconic reaction to like celebration, that little double hop"
01:48:10,780;01:48:14,660;"skipping and then the hard fist pump and the point of the silent dole."
01:48:14,660;01:48:16,220;"I did."
01:48:16,220;01:48:19,600;"I also assumed that like they cleared the snow"
01:48:19,600;01:48:25,600;"Not now and I clear there, but that's actually the later feel goal like this one"
01:48:25,600;01:48:33,220;"Kicked it in like three inches of snow. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, like you buried that and you couldn't even see the damn thing either"
01:48:33,220;01:48:36,220;"No, yeah, you just had to listen to the crowd. Yeah"
01:48:36,220;01:48:40,860;"Which is a pretty good call by the commentator actually"
01:48:40,860;01:48:44,500;"What which one?"
01:48:44,700;01:48:48,200;"Whoever whoever does the play-by-play"
01:48:48,200;01:48:55,520;"What was the call? Oh, well, you just he didn't lose it right because I feel like everybody lost sight of it"
01:48:55,520;01:48:58,640;"But he was I can tell hey, it's good cuz that's how I knew it was good"
01:48:58,640;01:49:04,300;"Yeah, call it good even before the refs. Yeah, cuz I indicated see it on the TV. Yeah"
01:49:04,300;01:49:06,820;"I thought you're gonna talk about how I"
01:49:06,820;01:49:09,580;"think it was"
01:49:10,060;01:49:16,300;"The radio broadcast probably of which I guess we probably didn't have here, but I came across it"
01:49:16,300;01:49:20,900;"Gino capital at this. Yeah. Yeah, Gill and Gino. Yeah"
01:49:20,900;01:49:26,540;"And the overtime field goalie base he said I'm just gonna let the crowds reaction tell you whether or not it's good"
01:49:26,540;01:49:32,980;"Like kick is down and then he just like didn't say anything and you just heard the crowd go bananas"
01:49:32,980;01:49:35,340;"That's yeah, like that's a great call"
01:49:36,780;01:49:42,200;"The and there are there's there's I can't remember what plays they were but there were a few plays in this game where I"
01:49:42,200;01:49:49,280;"Could hear their call my head just because I've seen the replays without their call on it so many times"
01:49:49,280;01:49:53,000;"Yeah, there's time to get"
01:49:53,000;01:49:55,280;"Yeah, I did miss the I"
01:49:55,280;01:50:02,640;"Don't remember at least on the calls in my head that they say that he missed four of his last five from 45 plus"
01:50:02,640;01:50:06,080;"They said he made for his last five"
01:50:06,080;01:50:13,440;"I had a I have a miss here. We should get Connor on the pod. We'll have him clear it up for us."
01:50:13,440;01:50:20,480;"Yeah, I do I do remember that of the ones that like when I was looking at it of the ones that"
01:50:20,480;01:50:25,840;"Vintitary would miss they were usually from longer. So that wouldn't surprise me"
01:50:25,840;01:50:32,080;"Yeah, I mean you can be an average kicker if you hit the big ones"
01:50:32,640;01:50:34,640;"Yeah, that's all you really need to do."
01:50:34,640;01:50:36,240;"Yeah, as long as you hit the late ones,"
01:50:36,240;01:50:37,680;"nobody remembers the early ones."
01:50:37,680;01:50:38,600;"Exactly."
01:50:38,600;01:50:42,500;"Which is basically what that whole argument was about was"
01:50:42,500;01:50:44,840;"Costowski's a more accurate kicker."
01:50:44,840;01:50:46,420;"But yeah,"
01:50:46,420;01:50:50,000;"Vintitary's going to go down as the better kicker because"
01:50:50,000;01:50:51,720;"because he's got the iconic kicks."
01:50:51,720;01:50:53,680;"The clutch. Yeah, the clutch kicks."
01:50:53,680;01:50:56,360;"Yeah, which I think is a fair assessment too of"
01:50:56,360;01:50:59,000;"how you grade those types of players."
01:50:59,000;01:51:01,160;"Yeah, great. Yeah, probably."
01:51:01,160;01:51:04,960;"I think there's probably some grayer in there because, I mean, you can also argue that"
01:51:04,960;01:51:08,440;"Koskowski didn't have the chance to make those iconic kicks."
01:51:08,440;01:51:12,160;"Like you just didn't have the opportunities, you know, he wasn't kicking game"
01:51:12,160;01:51:14,480;"winning field like he didn't have the opportunity to kick a game winning field"
01:51:14,480;01:51:15,920;"going to play off. So yeah."
01:51:15,920;01:51:20,800;"But yeah, I mean, like you said, I think you're right that when people look at it,"
01:51:20,800;01:51:22,640;"that's what they're going to, that's what they're going to remember."
01:51:22,640;01:51:23,440;"Yeah."
01:51:23,440;01:51:27,320;"So now we're over time."
01:51:30,360;01:51:35,860;"Because the Raiders actually got the ball back after that field goal 22 seconds left and just took a knee"
01:51:35,860;01:51:43,500;"Which probably bad decision. Yeah, I'm 22 seconds, but still like put up a try. I don't know snowing like crazy"
01:51:43,500;01:51:50,240;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, it might be the head of the ball game right here and I don't know if you guys noted"
01:51:50,240;01:51:56,240;"But rich Gann was he was definitely struggling fourth quarter. Yeah with like his grip"
01:51:56,240;01:51:59,560;"There's a couple like bubble screens that he floated him"
01:52:00,280;01:52:04,200;"And I was like, oh, I think this heavier snow is starting to get to them."
01:52:04,200;01:52:05,320;"Yeah, that's true."
01:52:05,320;01:52:08,840;"Yeah, I think they were talking about how the temperature drops and the balls were getting harder."
01:52:08,840;01:52:11,080;"Football and not football."
01:52:11,080;01:52:15,480;"Which I think is probably why"
01:52:15,480;01:52:19,000;"Vinitari's kick is a bit more impressive in the fourth quarter"
01:52:19,000;01:52:21,640;"with all that snow and cold than maybe"
01:52:21,640;01:52:27,000;"Janet Cowsky's was in the third quarter, even though they're both the exact same distance."
01:52:27,000;01:52:28,680;"Pretty much from the same spot on the field too."
01:52:28,680;01:52:29,520;"- Yeah."
01:52:29,520;01:52:33,040;"- Both 35 yarders going left to right."
01:52:33,040;01:52:36,600;"- Wait, now you, if you switch to the half or the quarter?"
01:52:36,600;01:52:37,840;"- You switch a quarter."
01:52:37,840;01:52:38,680;"- Yeah."
01:52:38,680;01:52:40,240;"- So it wants to the same spot."
01:52:40,240;01:52:42,440;"- Have you watched football before I see it?"
01:52:42,440;01:52:43,280;"- No, no."
01:52:43,280;01:52:45,040;"(laughing)"
01:52:45,040;01:52:46,880;"- Your first ever game is a good one to watch."
01:52:46,880;01:52:47,720;"- Yeah."
01:52:47,720;01:52:50,720;"- Thanks for having me guys."
01:52:50,720;01:52:52,160;"- Wait, they play quarters?"
01:52:52,160;01:52:54,400;"- That was periods."
01:52:54,400;01:52:56,200;"- Thought it was thirds."
01:52:56,200;01:52:57,360;"Just play four of them."
01:52:57,360;01:53:02,960;"over time. Over time, Raiders call heads, it's tails,"
01:53:02,960;01:53:03,720;"pages like the sea."
01:53:03,720;01:53:04,800;"Never fails."
01:53:04,800;01:53:07,260;"Patriots always win coin tosses."
01:53:07,260;01:53:07,920;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:53:07,920;01:53:07,920;"Yeah."
01:53:07,920;01:53:08,840;"That one's they do."
01:53:08,840;01:53:09,160;"Yeah."
01:53:09,160;01:53:09,520;"Yeah."
01:53:09,520;01:53:10,400;"Right."
01:53:10,400;01:53:14,240;"I just think of like things that would make me mad if I wasn't a Patriots fans."
01:53:14,240;01:53:18,040;"It's like, how the fuck do they always win the goddamn coin toss?"
01:53:18,040;01:53:19,640;"Always the important ones."
01:53:19,640;01:53:20,640;"Yeah."
01:53:20,640;01:53:22,120;"Well, it's like field go kicking."
01:53:22,120;01:53:23,960;"You don't have to win the early ones."
01:53:23,960;01:53:25,120;"Yeah, exactly."
01:53:25,120;01:53:26,720;"You got to win the four ones."
01:53:26,720;01:53:33,040;"I think it was like three that come to mind. Yeah, Falcon Super Bowl. Yeah."
01:53:33,040;01:53:41,440;"Cheats AFC champion game. This one. Yeah. Just overtime games in general. The ones that they need."
01:53:41,440;01:53:42,880;"Damn cheaters."
01:53:42,880;01:53:51,600;"But did you see that one of the guys out for the overtime coin toss was Drew blood. So"
01:53:52,400;01:53:58,080;"Really? That was pretty badass. Yeah. That is sweet. Yeah. So he does. I mean, obviously the"
01:53:58,080;01:54:01,920;"Raiders call the coin toss, but I like to think that Blood Zone had something to do with it."
01:54:01,920;01:54:07,920;"I think him where he was standing was blocking the wind. And so it didn't have that extra half"
01:54:07,920;01:54:11,680;"a flip. So because of that, Atlanta tells. Yeah."
01:54:11,680;01:54:18,240;"Ooh. Hey, I'm looking at the box score, by the way. Sorry to interrupt, but the kick off"
01:54:18,240;01:54:20,360;"the right, the end of regulation there."
01:54:20,360;01:54:20,960;"Hmm."
01:54:20,960;01:54:22,640;"Tackle made by Matt Chatham."
01:54:22,640;01:54:23,640;"Shout out."
01:54:23,640;01:54:25,120;"All right."
01:54:25,120;01:54:26,400;"Love it."
01:54:26,400;01:54:27,800;"Get him on the pod."
01:54:27,800;01:54:28,240;"All right."
01:54:28,240;01:54:29,120;"It's a great tackle."
01:54:29,120;01:54:30,640;"It was an unbelievable tackle."
01:54:30,640;01:54:31,760;"Or it was a good tackle."
01:54:31,760;01:54:32,200;"Yeah."
01:54:32,200;01:54:33,200;"Yeah."
01:54:33,200;01:54:35,760;"For that late in the, I mean, and he's one of those."
01:54:35,760;01:54:37,680;"That's why they didn't try and get any points."
01:54:37,680;01:54:38,680;"Yeah."
01:54:38,680;01:54:41,560;"Yeah, because they they pinned him deep late and he started"
01:54:41,560;01:54:42,720;"the dynasty."
01:54:42,720;01:54:43,720;"Yeah."
01:54:43,720;01:54:46,840;"Well, he's one of those role players that we talked about,"
01:54:46,840;01:54:48,680;"that this Patriot system is built on."
01:54:48,680;01:54:52,960;"He's one of those guys that you don't hear much about,"
01:54:52,960;01:54:55,220;"but he's that foundation"
01:54:55,220;01:54:57,720;"that all these other great things happen are built on."
01:54:57,720;01:55:00,960;"- I got a name for you on that same thing, JR Redmond."
01:55:00,960;01:55:05,960;"- Yeah, I would put his first drive over time, first play."
01:55:05,960;01:55:08,040;"I think it might be the exact same one"
01:55:08,040;01:55:13,040;"as that Rams Super Bowl Final Drive."
01:55:13,760;01:55:17,200;"So I actually wrote down all the plays in the last drive."
01:55:17,200;01:55:19,100;"So actually, and even before that,"
01:55:19,100;01:55:21,720;"I think another guy you can throw in here is Patrick Pass"
01:55:21,720;01:55:23,420;"'cause he's returning kickoffs in this game,"
01:55:23,420;01:55:26,240;"which I didn't realize he did that."
01:55:26,240;01:55:28,640;"I feel like they seem to have a different guy back there"
01:55:28,640;01:55:32,160;"every time because I remember for two weeks,"
01:55:32,160;01:55:33,700;"I had written down and we never brought it up"
01:55:33,700;01:55:35,260;"but there was some guy named Ben Kelly"
01:55:35,260;01:55:37,480;"who I'd never heard of and he was returning kicks"
01:55:37,480;01:55:39,400;"and that's all he did and he never saw it again."
01:55:39,400;01:55:41,560;"- Oh, speaking of that,"
01:55:41,560;01:55:44,360;"Riddick Parker was a starter on the Patriots for this game."
01:55:44,360;01:55:46,600;"Who? Yeah."
01:55:46,600;01:55:49,080;"You just make that up."
01:55:49,080;01:55:51,240;"No, it's one of my notes."
01:55:51,240;01:55:53,680;"Like when they did the introductions even."
01:55:53,680;01:55:54,360;"Holy shit."
01:55:54,360;01:55:54,960;"Positioned."
01:55:54,960;01:55:56,480;"Did he play defensive tackle?"
01:55:56,480;01:55:57,360;"Apparently."
01:55:57,360;01:55:58,880;"The crowd is correct."
01:55:58,880;01:55:59,880;"Yeah."
01:55:59,880;01:56:00,680;"Parker."
01:56:00,680;01:56:02,880;"What?"
01:56:02,880;01:56:04,320;"Never heard of him."
01:56:04,320;01:56:05,160;"Never heard of him."
01:56:05,160;01:56:05,880;"Never heard of him."
01:56:05,880;01:56:07,480;"Get started this game."
01:56:07,480;01:56:11,440;"His name on this list of Patriots starters I do not recognize."
01:56:11,440;01:56:15,480;"Hey, back to Umsen heroes because he's just"
01:56:15,480;01:56:16,000;"on."
01:56:16,000;01:56:17,400;"Yeah,"
01:56:17,400;01:56:18,160;"very on song."
01:56:18,160;01:56:21,040;"I mean, I the least song of them all."
01:56:21,040;01:56:27,320;"I mean, if the guys who are doing this stupid podcast, don't actually know who he is."
01:56:27,320;01:56:29,040;"That's that's that's pretty on some."
01:56:29,040;01:56:36,120;"As a Patrick pass, I should return this over time kickoff to the page 34."
01:56:36,120;01:56:36,920;"So that's a great start."
01:56:36,920;01:56:38,120;"Yeah."
01:56:39,280;01:56:44,440;"And then like you said, Steve, this was basically the Redmond and Wiggan show."
01:56:44,440;01:56:48,600;"It was a quick pass in the middle of Redmond and then a screen to Redmond"
01:56:48,600;01:56:51,720;"for the first down where you broke a tackle down the sideline, which is another"
01:56:51,720;01:56:53,480;"one of those like random plays I remembered."
01:56:53,480;01:56:53,720;"Yeah."
01:56:53,720;01:56:57,840;"And you broke it and ran for like 15 yards on like second and sixth sort of thing."
01:56:57,840;01:57:01,960;"Um, then it was quick out to Wiggins, screen of Redmond,"
01:57:01,960;01:57:05,560;"quick slant to Wiggins, middle to Wiggins, Redmond, run up the middle."
01:57:05,560;01:57:09,200;"And, uh, and then a quick pass to Troy Brown to break the streak."
01:57:09,200;01:57:14,420;"And this is where you get to the point where I forgot about this, but this is some balls"
01:57:14,420;01:57:15,420;"of shit too."
01:57:15,420;01:57:19,560;"Like this is some game winning play calling and all of it."
01:57:19,560;01:57:21,920;"The Pats have fourth and four on the 28 yard line."
01:57:21,920;01:57:26,120;"And instead of kicking the field goal there, even though, I mean, they're going in the"
01:57:26,120;01:57:27,120;"opposite direction."
01:57:27,120;01:57:29,240;"So they're kind of kicking into the wind."
01:57:29,240;01:57:30,240;"So what's that?"
01:57:30,240;01:57:32,240;"What's plus 17 plus 14?"
01:57:32,240;01:57:33,240;"I think it's 17."
01:57:33,240;01:57:36,240;"I know you line up seven yards behind the line."
01:57:36,240;01:57:37,240;"Yeah."
01:57:37,240;01:57:38,240;"Yeah."
01:57:38,240;01:57:41,480;"So it's the same field goal they had at the end of regulation."
01:57:41,480;01:57:43,720;"Yeah, give or take, but this one can't get us into the wind."
01:57:43,720;01:57:45,680;"So, you know, you know, fuck it, we're going for it."
01:57:45,680;01:57:46,760;"For sure."
01:57:46,760;01:57:47,960;"They go for it."
01:57:47,960;01:57:48,200;"Yeah."
01:57:48,200;01:57:52,840;"And I think it was Greg was talking about this play where Wiggens thought it"
01:57:52,840;01:57:54,520;"was to him, but it was actually to to Patton."
01:57:54,520;01:57:58,040;"And so Wiggens is diving out stretch for a ball that's not a"
01:57:58,040;01:57:59,040;"thrown to him."
01:57:59,040;01:58:03,440;"And and patents just like sitting in a mound of snow."
01:58:03,440;01:58:05,040;"Like he's falling down again."
01:58:05,040;01:58:05,240;"Yeah."
01:58:05,240;01:58:06,120;"You'd fall down."
01:58:06,120;01:58:06,560;"Yeah."
01:58:06,560;01:58:07,200;"It's crazy."
01:58:07,200;01:58:08,760;"- I already have the ground, you just can't see"
01:58:08,760;01:58:10,360;"'cause it's like three inches of snow"
01:58:10,360;01:58:12,520;"between the sand and the size."
01:58:12,520;01:58:15,200;"- Yeah, like imagine if Wiggins"
01:58:15,200;01:58:17,300;"like gets his hand on that."
01:58:17,300;01:58:19,700;"- Yeah, it knocks it out."
01:58:19,700;01:58:22,680;"(laughing)"
01:58:22,680;01:58:23,880;"- See, that's my fear."
01:58:23,880;01:58:26,560;"You know how I said my goal was to be the guy"
01:58:26,560;01:58:27,640;"that jumps on the fumble."
01:58:27,640;01:58:30,720;"My fear is I'm the guy that like goes to the ball,"
01:58:30,720;01:58:32,680;"misses it and like actually tips it away"
01:58:32,680;01:58:34,480;"from the intended receiver."
01:58:34,480;01:58:35,320;"- 'Cause you're trying to."
01:58:35,320;01:58:36,240;"- And everyone hates me for life."
01:58:36,240;01:58:37,240;"Yeah."
01:58:37,240;01:58:39,720;"You're supposed to be there."
01:58:39,720;01:58:44,340;"You're the Colombian soccer player that scores an own goal against the United States in the"
01:58:44,340;01:58:45,340;"World Cup."
01:58:45,340;01:58:47,640;"Laura, the Steve Bartman."
01:58:47,640;01:58:48,640;"Yeah."
01:58:48,640;01:58:49,640;"Yeah."
01:58:49,640;01:58:51,640;"The Bill Buckner."
01:58:51,640;01:58:54,640;"You're that asshole."
01:58:54,640;01:58:56,840;"But that's get out of jail free again."
01:58:56,840;01:58:57,840;"Yeah."
01:58:57,840;01:58:58,840;"Yeah."
01:58:58,840;01:58:59,840;"Is there any controversy in that one?"
01:58:59,840;01:59:00,840;"Great."
01:59:00,840;01:59:01,840;"You want to stir up?"
01:59:01,840;01:59:02,840;"No, that was a great play call."
01:59:02,840;01:59:03,840;"Great throw."
01:59:03,840;01:59:04,840;"All right."
01:59:04,840;01:59:07,560;"best play came up after that, staying in bounds."
01:59:07,560;01:59:08,920;"Yeah."
01:59:08,920;01:59:12,880;"So it was, yeah, because then at this point, it's just like"
01:59:12,880;01:59:15,080;"run the ball at the middle of Antoine."
01:59:15,080;01:59:17,720;"So two stripped and no gain, basically."
01:59:17,720;01:59:22,000;"And then on third down, I don't remember which commentary said, it's like, uh,"
01:59:22,000;01:59:23,480;"they have to pass it here."
01:59:23,480;01:59:27,160;"And I would be shocked if they didn't like do a play action throw and have very,"
01:59:27,160;01:59:28,320;"put the ball in various hands."
01:59:28,320;01:59:32,240;"And all they did was hand it off to Antoine, right tackle."
01:59:32,240;01:59:34,400;"And he ran for first down and fell down in bounds."
01:59:34,400;01:59:38,160;"Well, why is it a good play to land and bounce?"
01:59:38,160;01:59:40,160;"It's all your point."
01:59:40,160;01:59:40,480;"It is."
01:59:40,480;01:59:42,760;"And I don't think he eventually land and bounce."
01:59:42,760;01:59:45,040;"I was just going off what Steve said."
01:59:45,040;01:59:46,400;"Steve carried a comment."
01:59:46,400;01:59:50,520;"Yeah, you take take as much time off the clock as you can't just in case"
01:59:50,520;01:59:51,160;"him is the field goal."
01:59:51,160;01:59:51,680;"That's a good call."
01:59:51,680;01:59:52,520;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:59:52,520;01:59:55,120;"You know, like the just prepare for any."
01:59:55,120;01:59:56,720;"Oh, you can't wait for the tie."
01:59:56,720;02:00:02,200;"I thought it when he fell down that he did intentionally and I was like, wait a"
02:00:02,200;02:00:03,040;"second."
02:00:03,280;02:00:05,200;"I bet it was just like an instinct."
02:00:05,200;02:00:08,120;"That's just his mental conditioning of like..."
02:00:08,120;02:00:09,080;"I bet it is."
02:00:09,080;02:00:09,580;"Yeah."
02:00:09,580;02:00:10,480;"Well, you know what it is."
02:00:10,480;02:00:12,040;"He's like, ""Tite game."
02:00:12,040;02:00:16,160;"We're like in field goal range running down the game here."""
02:00:16,160;02:00:16,920;"Yep."
02:00:16,920;02:00:17,680;"It's like staying bounds."
02:00:17,680;02:00:19,120;"It says staying bounds, yeah."
02:00:19,120;02:00:21,960;"Because like, how piss you get when like,"
02:00:21,960;02:00:23,280;"you know that person's staying bounds,"
02:00:23,280;02:00:24,040;"they're not a bounds."
02:00:24,040;02:00:25,280;"And you're just like, ""Ah!"""
02:00:25,280;02:00:27,160;"Yeah, what are you doing?"
02:00:27,160;02:00:27,520;"Yeah."
02:00:27,520;02:00:30,680;"But I know here's a theory for you."
02:00:30,680;02:00:32,440;"The Patriots were going against the win."
02:00:32,440;02:00:42,040;"So if they don't score here, the rares are pinned deep and they would have less time to drive down with the wind to the other side to kick a field goal."
02:00:42,040;02:00:43,600;"And hopefully the page can hold them."
02:00:43,600;02:00:47,520;"And then if we get a second over time, now the page is on the way to the back."
02:00:47,520;02:00:49,240;"Boom, done."
02:00:49,240;02:00:53,600;"Wait, they have the wind right now."
02:00:53,600;02:00:54,680;"They're against the wind."
02:00:54,680;02:00:55,640;"They're against the wind right now."
02:00:55,640;02:00:57,920;"So if the rate, the rares will be pinned deep."
02:00:57,920;02:01:04,600;"So you want to milk as much clock off time off the clock now as you can before you try this field goal"
02:01:04,600;02:01:08,520;"Just so the Raiders don't have as much time to to use the wind to their advantage"
02:01:08,520;02:01:18,800;"Yeah, that's a deep cut that was tough big O and how and taunts been said as he's you can tell I do yoga"
02:01:18,800;02:01:25,080;"Cuz that was a fucking stretch, but it's probably true to go check a thought of that"
02:01:25,080;02:01:26,080;"It's a joke."
02:01:26,080;02:01:27,080;"It's a joke."
02:01:27,080;02:01:30,600;"Well, because it could go either way, too, right?"
02:01:30,600;02:01:31,600;"Yeah."
02:01:31,600;02:01:32,600;"Wouldn't you?"
02:01:32,600;02:01:35,000;"How does it go the other way?"
02:01:35,000;02:01:36,960;"You playing for a triple overtime break?"
02:01:36,960;02:01:40,480;"Well, because you're talking about so much time left that, like, if you're thinking about"
02:01:40,480;02:01:45,360;"like how long an average drive to how much time was left when they kick the field goal."
02:01:45,360;02:01:47,360;"Like seven minutes or something."
02:01:47,360;02:01:48,600;"I don't actually know."
02:01:48,600;02:01:49,600;"Yeah."
02:01:49,600;02:01:50,600;"That's a question."
02:01:50,600;02:01:53,720;"There's eight minutes left when he makes that run."
02:01:53,720;02:02:00,720;"Yeah, so but yeah, and then, you know, three more runs of the middle, which brings it down to six and a half minutes."
02:02:00,720;02:02:03,720;"So that's half the quarter up there."
02:02:03,720;02:02:08,720;"And they wouldn't be starting on the 34 like we did."
02:02:08,720;02:02:11,720;"Right, they'd be starting their own five yard line basically at this point."
02:02:11,720;02:02:12,720;"Yeah."
02:02:12,720;02:02:15,720;"So then you stop them deep in their own zone."
02:02:15,720;02:02:19,720;"Get the ball back and now you're against the wind again."
02:02:19,720;02:02:20,720;"But then the wind changes."
02:02:20,720;02:02:24,800;"Because yeah, yeah, then you run the clock out and you switch the other side and you kick an easy field goal"
02:02:24,800;02:02:29,080;"I think you guys are projecting too much for six and a half minutes. Nope. I"
02:02:29,080;02:02:35,260;"Think you're just goddamn hater get off this fucking podcast and go to join a Raiders podcast"
02:02:35,260;02:02:38,000;"Well, all right"
02:02:38,000;02:02:41,800;"There are any Raiders podcast. That's the Romanowski South Dale"
02:02:41,800;02:02:45,360;"On the pod"
02:02:45,360;02:02:49,040;"Charles Woodson"
02:02:49,040;02:02:51,040;"Yeah, that would be cool. Oh"
02:02:51,040;02:02:58,600;"Right you have Larry Rice Raiders Jersey. Yeah, I had a Jerry Rice and"
02:02:58,600;02:03:06,040;"I had a Charles Woodson. Yeah, I knew about the Charles Woodson. Yeah, the the black Raiders jerseys were sweet"
02:03:06,040;02:03:09,280;"Yeah, with the silver numbers. Yeah. Hmm. Yeah"
02:03:09,280;02:03:14,600;"So it was not much left in this game"
02:03:15,760;02:03:22,000;"Yeah, so it was just Antoine up the middle and then that kind of Brady quote-unquote sneak"
02:03:22,000;02:03:26,480;"Where he's basically just like moving the ball into the middle of the field to make the field go easier and"
02:03:26,480;02:03:28,400;"then"
02:03:28,400;02:03:33,520;"the Patriots lineup for a field goal and the Raiders try to ice the kicker"
02:03:33,520;02:03:37,080;"which was a great decision because that just lets the"
02:03:37,080;02:03:43,080;"Patriots line help clear the snow so that Venetari has an"
02:03:44,120;02:03:49,960;"an easier footing and an easier way to kick a field goal, which he does from 23 yards out"
02:03:49,960;02:03:56,600;"to win the game. And then you got snow angels, you got celebrations, and you've got football"
02:03:56,600;02:04:04,520;"for another week. Thank you. And the official retirement of Foxboro Stadium. Yeah. What a way to"
02:04:04,520;02:04:13,560;"go. Imagine being at that game. My god. Iconically. Yeah. The greatest game of the Patriots"
02:04:13,560;02:04:17,760;"I was so hyped watching this game over again."
02:04:17,760;02:04:20,240;"Yeah, ridiculous."
02:04:20,240;02:04:21,520;"It was very enjoyable."
02:04:21,520;02:04:22,720;"How was that?"
02:04:22,720;02:04:24,480;"I was still nervous watching it, though."
02:04:24,480;02:04:25,000;"Yeah."
02:04:25,000;02:04:26,200;"I'm so happy about it."
02:04:26,200;02:04:27,560;"Oh, oh, my God."
02:04:27,560;02:04:29,040;"It's happening."
02:04:29,040;02:04:30,840;"These boys better figure it out quick."
02:04:30,840;02:04:35,240;"I didn't get that feeling."
02:04:35,240;02:04:37,600;"Because you don't watch a game."
02:04:37,600;02:04:38,760;"I watched the game."
02:04:38,760;02:04:41,800;"How would I know about that thing that I called out Andy on?"
02:04:41,800;02:04:43,320;"Which one?"
02:04:43,320;02:04:48,320;"Larry is oh, that's good."
02:04:48,320;02:04:50,320;"I watched it."
02:04:50,320;02:04:51,320;"Here."
02:04:51,320;02:04:52,320;"Cut."
02:04:52,320;02:04:59,320;"My final note on all the pages and notes is just God."
02:04:59,320;02:05:01,320;"I miss sports."
02:05:01,320;02:05:02,320;"Yeah."
02:05:02,320;02:05:03,320;"I did."
02:05:03,320;02:05:10,320;"I feel like I'm all and I was like, oh, fuck."
02:05:10,320;02:05:11,320;"That's true."
02:05:11,320;02:05:18,120;"You got that life. Yeah. Yeah, it's that feeling. All right. So then give me your best and worst Steve. Oh"
02:05:18,120;02:05:21,360;"I wasn't prepared for this"
02:05:21,360;02:05:24,760;"You know, that's the way we're fucking good"
02:05:24,760;02:05:30,360;"Alright Greg give you a best and worst"
02:05:30,360;02:05:36,000;"Can someone go go first Andy? I got to think of mine. All right. All right"
02:05:36,000;02:05:39,320;"Let's see. I got a couple of best"
02:05:40,040;02:05:42,040;"There's small things one was"
02:05:42,040;02:05:46,720;"Richard Seymour horse calling the shit out of rich Ganon"
02:05:46,720;02:05:49,360;"Yeah, I think it was like the third quarter"
02:05:49,360;02:05:54,320;"Like when the very start and sue like it was just like you just"
02:05:54,320;02:06:01,600;"reached out one of those real long arms grabbed him by the back and just like just went straight limp himself and just"
02:06:01,600;02:06:05,880;"Fell straight the ground just yanks Gannon straight back and Gannon was pissed. I"
02:06:05,880;02:06:08,520;"Wonder how it feels to be that strong"
02:06:08,800;02:06:13,120;"We just grab a grown human and just like dead weight yourself just for that guy"
02:06:13,120;02:06:21,080;"Just not a pretty cool human being. Yeah an athletic human being not like big powerful man"
02:06:21,080;02:06:24,560;"Oh my god, so that was one and then there was another one"
02:06:24,560;02:06:32,440;"Charles Woodson was returning punts and so he fair caught one and Lonnie Paxson came over and just like punch the"
02:06:32,440;02:06:38,360;"ball out of his hand after the play was over just to be a dick cuz that was that it was just how that game was going"
02:06:38,360;02:06:46,680;"that point. And I love the pettiness of it. From Lonnie Paxton, your fucking long snapper,"
02:06:46,680;02:06:52,680;"who then would make himself famous for doing the snow angels after the game winner."
02:06:52,680;02:07:04,840;"Another iconic image. Yeah, I think this is, I remember this one now. My worst was the raiders,"
02:07:04,840;02:07:11,580;"They tried to go no huddle because apparently like that was a thing that they did and it would always try to catch people off guard and"
02:07:11,580;02:07:16,320;"Rich Gannon was his wily veteran and they tried to go no huddle and immediately a call for a false start"
02:07:16,320;02:07:19,380;"Yeah, I've done it again. Just never went back to it again"
02:07:19,380;02:07:23,720;"Get dumb bucks. Yeah, so good for them"
02:07:23,720;02:07:29,840;"No, I'm still on the road false starts that you get you idiots right"
02:07:29,840;02:07:31,400;"And I think it was in like the first quarter too"
02:07:31,400;02:07:33,160;"And I was supposed to be like yeah"
02:07:33,160;02:07:35,800;"I was making a big deal of his like all it I go in there"
02:07:35,800;02:07:38,940;"There are no huddling like this is gonna cause a patience problems all night"
02:07:38,940;02:07:42,680;"And then it just like never was actually because the full start all right"
02:07:42,680;02:07:45,080;"It feels like the Raiders"
02:07:45,080;02:07:55,320;"To any of you else have any who do we waste the ball in the quarters I got one more best gave it to me first huddle of the game"
02:07:56,680;02:07:58,680;"on brain trots out there and"
02:07:58,680;02:08:04,640;"You can see on the TV feed he like points to someone on a side line gives them like a nice grin"
02:08:04,640;02:08:11,480;"I just look super relaxed for like his first playoff game in the snow on you know"
02:08:11,480;02:08:14,320;"California boy. Yeah"
02:08:14,320;02:08:17,840;"Trots out there and point someone out and give them like a"
02:08:17,840;02:08:23,920;"mile and just like gets down to business he never did look shook at all throughout the"
02:08:23,920;02:08:30,760;"Yeah, that's my worst is that Tom doesn't play for us anymore."
02:08:30,760;02:08:36,360;"Yeah, today's the day that he he wrote that article to"
02:08:36,360;02:08:40,720;"I said, yeah, I read it."
02:08:40,720;02:08:43,360;"The Nile stage and then I was miserable."
02:08:43,360;02:08:46,360;"So I sent it to you guys so that you can share my misery because"
02:08:46,360;02:08:47,360;"miserable. I could link it."
02:08:47,360;02:08:49,200;"I saw what it was and I immediately iced out."
02:08:50,040;02:08:53,400;"I never read your texts anyway, so I just missed it."
02:08:53,400;02:08:56,160;"Well, that's because you can't read though, so I never expect you to do it."
02:08:56,160;02:08:59,520;"Can't read doesn't watch the games."
02:08:59,520;02:09:02,800;"Because it's like brain man."
02:09:02,800;02:09:05,160;"He just remembers these games without having to watch them again from when they"
02:09:05,160;02:09:05,880;"have a life."
02:09:05,880;02:09:06,880;"That's right."
02:09:06,880;02:09:12,360;"It's kind of a fucking scrapbook of all the boss and globe articles."
02:09:12,360;02:09:14,640;"Look at the pretty."
02:09:14,640;02:09:18,440;"Yeah, this this game did bring up a whole lot of memory."
02:09:18,440;02:09:22,680;"So like I really didn't sitting in the basement watching it"
02:09:22,680;02:09:26,380;"This is the one where dad scraped his hands on the ceiling, right?"
02:09:26,380;02:09:31,880;"No, that was a super ball as a super ball. Yeah, I remember that. I remember exactly where I run that one. I"
02:09:31,880;02:09:35,160;"remember scrapbooking"
02:09:35,160;02:09:43,480;"After the game, you know collecting all the Boston Globes cutting out all my favorite things get my mom to laminate him"
02:09:44,840;02:09:47,680;"Oh, that's right. She did, would you? Oh, yeah. I still have"
02:09:47,680;02:09:52,080;"the laminated poster boards with all the newspaper. How would you"
02:09:52,080;02:09:54,440;"think that cost? She was just running a preschool and you're"
02:09:54,440;02:09:59,160;"fucking using her entire lamination budget on you. You know,"
02:09:59,160;02:10:04,560;"I never considered that Andy. And they should shock it. 10 year old"
02:10:04,560;02:10:09,240;"Greg. Yeah. So it's a big ass piece of lamination. Yeah, it was"
02:10:09,240;02:10:12,280;"pretty big. It was worth it because he's"
02:10:12,280;02:10:19,080;"That's true. Yeah. So they've paid their money's worth."
02:10:19,080;02:10:25,800;"Oh, I had one last question I want to want to ask you boys."
02:10:25,800;02:10:32,000;"How much money would it take for you to attempt to tackle Antoine Smith in his"
02:10:32,000;02:10:36,920;"prime? Because I'm pretty sure I would break probably a couple bones."
02:10:36,920;02:10:40,000;"If I said to you, I'm going to do the was the Oklahoma drill."
02:10:40,560;02:10:44,820;"And if you, if you stop him from getting past you, I'll give you X amount of money."
02:10:44,820;02:10:47,380;"What would that money need to be for you to actually get in there?"
02:10:47,380;02:10:48,860;"I have to stop them."
02:10:48,860;02:10:51,820;"Yeah, it's a theoretical number because I'm not going to stop him."
02:10:51,820;02:10:52,740;"So I'm just going to."
02:10:52,740;02:10:54,020;"Or at least try."
02:10:54,020;02:10:55,620;"I mean, yeah, you're slow down."
02:10:55,620;02:11:00,460;"I'll try like with like 1% effort and just be like, eh, let him run by me."
02:11:00,460;02:11:03,780;"No, you actually have to make it a tackle attack."
02:11:03,780;02:11:05,460;"Cause I don't think he would run by wearing."
02:11:05,460;02:11:06,620;"Am I wearing a Ziploc Smith?"
02:11:06,620;02:11:07,100;"Yeah."
02:11:07,100;02:11:07,420;"Oh, yeah."
02:11:07,420;02:11:08,180;"Full pads."
02:11:08,500;02:11:12,260;"That's got to throw my body at him, let him truck stick me and then he's on his way."
02:11:12,260;02:11:12,900;"Yeah."
02:11:12,900;02:11:15,660;"Just once for like five, 10 grand."
02:11:15,660;02:11:18,780;"Here's a question."
02:11:18,780;02:11:23,020;"How much would you pay in today's dollars to attend this game if you knew."
02:11:23,020;02:11:25,100;"The outcomes."
02:11:25,100;02:11:25,460;"Yeah."
02:11:25,460;02:11:28,060;"I would take everybody."
02:11:28,060;02:11:29,020;"You know the outcome."
02:11:29,020;02:11:30,420;"No."
02:11:30,420;02:11:32,340;"You can train."
02:11:32,340;02:11:35,980;"You can pay like five grand go back in time and attend this game."
02:11:35,980;02:11:36,220;"Yeah."
02:11:36,220;02:11:37,780;"And then you transport it right back."
02:11:37,780;02:11:43,880;"I would like Antoine Smith to go back in time to watch this game without a doubt."
02:11:43,880;02:11:45,180;"Those two are equal."
02:11:45,180;02:11:46,880;"That's fair."
02:11:46,880;02:11:48,380;"I like that."
02:11:48,380;02:11:52,080;"Like he just hits me black out and then I wake up at the game."
02:11:52,080;02:11:52,780;"Boom."
02:11:52,780;02:11:53,880;"Oh, yeah."
02:11:53,880;02:11:54,780;"All right."
02:11:54,780;02:11:55,180;"All right."
02:11:55,180;02:11:59,780;"I'm pretty mortgage in the house, you know, probably true."
02:11:59,780;02:12:06,180;"Every dime I have 401k is just my wife's for one case."
02:12:06,180;02:12:09,540;"I'll take the penalty."
02:12:09,540;02:12:11,460;"Yeah."
02:12:11,460;02:12:13,140;"So I saw both the cars."
02:12:13,140;02:12:14,100;"I don't tell you."
02:12:14,100;02:12:18,380;"And absolutely I kind of came to go to, especially being the last game in the stadium too."
02:12:18,380;02:12:18,820;"Right."
02:12:18,820;02:12:19,300;"Oh God."
02:12:19,300;02:12:20,820;"Take the benches home with you."
02:12:20,820;02:12:23,660;"How long do you think it took people to get home from that though?"
02:12:23,660;02:12:28,020;"Over time, they're all far from the stadium and fucking eight thirty at night."
02:12:28,020;02:12:29,180;"Oh my God."
02:12:29,180;02:12:31,020;"In this with a foot of snow on the ground."
02:12:31,020;02:12:31,380;"Exactly."
02:12:31,380;02:12:31,780;"Yeah."
02:12:31,780;02:12:33,900;"That's been a coincidence since you."
02:12:35,180;02:12:36,580;"You got to probably still there."
02:12:36,580;02:12:40,280;"And you can't even like, like shovel it out too."
02:12:40,280;02:12:42,160;"Cause like, where are you going to put that snow?"
02:12:42,160;02:12:43,040;"Trying to get out."
02:12:43,040;02:12:44,240;"Oh, God."
02:12:44,240;02:12:48,260;"Probably the game was a Saturday game."
02:12:48,260;02:12:50,040;"And they were like, you know what?"
02:12:50,040;02:12:51,040;"We build a new stadium."
02:12:51,040;02:12:52,640;"We should just build in the same place."
02:12:52,640;02:12:54,380;"Cause it's really working out the trailer."
02:12:54,380;02:12:58,480;"Like an idiot."
02:12:58,480;02:13:03,960;"But now you can park there for free in one of the back lots, but you're not"
02:13:03,960;02:13:08,880;"to leave for an hour after the game. That's a good idea."
02:13:08,880;02:13:11,880;"Yeah. That's what I'd like to know. Yeah. Yeah."
02:13:11,880;02:13:15,800;"For the good of great. You lose this phone and then you lose"
02:13:15,800;02:13:19,080;"them and you stand around for two hours waiting to find out"
02:13:19,080;02:13:23,280;"where the fuck he is. So and also not pay for that privilege."
02:13:23,280;02:13:28,800;"Yeah, fair enough. And then Steve bitches for the rest of his"
02:13:28,800;02:13:30,480;"breathing life about it."
02:13:30,480;02:13:32,480;"I"
02:13:32,480;02:13:40,300;"All right, well you guys have anything else you want to talk about in this game. I think we've now pretty much"

00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,680;"I am not your mother."
00:19,680;00:28,880;"Alright, welcome to the second inaugural episode of the Patriots Dinesy Podcast."
00:28,880;00:30,880;"I'm your host to Andrew Brown"
00:30,880;00:36,540;"With me today. We have Mike mellow all the way from Los Angeles, California"
00:36,540;00:39,820;"producer director screenwriter actor"
00:39,820;00:45,960;"Wow, thank you for that. Yeah, well, I got a pump of tires up a little bit. I"
00:45,960;00:48,920;"Appreciate that they're a little flat these days"
00:48,920;00:57,160;"Well, I'm sure your town will shine through in this as well. I think so. Yeah, I do too"
00:57,760;01:01,720;"Speaking of talent, we also have joining us today Steve Brown one of my"
01:01,720;01:03,880;"brothers"
01:03,880;01:05,880;"The one that will actually join us today"
01:05,880;01:10,360;"Hey, what's up? I think I'm Steve a marketing and golf expert Steve Brown"
01:10,360;01:13,520;"So that I'm sure that'll come in handy as we talk about neither of those things"
01:13,520;01:16,320;"mm-hmm and"
01:16,320;01:23,360;"Also with him. We have a special guest tonight. We have Jeff Carr Steve's friend who is a 49ers fan"
01:23,360;01:25,360;"So we won't hold that against him"
01:25,360;01:28,700;"Jimmy G Jimmy grapes, maybe"
01:28,700;01:33,600;"To be fair he's a 49ers fan when this season's going on even though I live in New Hampshire"
01:33,600;01:42,840;"Yeah, well, I think growing up a lot of us were 49ers fans as well as Patriots fans perhaps"
01:42,840;01:47,240;"Because it was tough being a Patriots fan"
01:47,240;01:51,120;"Back in the late 80s early 90s"
01:52,240;01:58,240;"Well, yeah, that's why I watched the season 2000 recap video instead of all the games. Exactly. Yes, let's start there"
01:58,240;02:03,400;"There was some debate when we started this about when the actual dynasty started"
02:03,400;02:09,700;"And so the vote was to start in the 2001 season, but I think it's a good idea that we kind of"
02:09,700;02:12,440;"recap the 2000 season because"
02:12,440;02:14,800;"that was kind of"
02:14,800;02:21,760;"the official start date on paper when Bell check took over the team when Brady was drafted even though he didn't see any of Brady"
02:21,760;02:30,520;"So we watched in preparation for this the NFL films like season recap which was"
02:30,520;02:34,720;"probably generously titled building for tomorrow and when you have something"
02:34,720;02:41,440;"with that sort of name on it you know that the season didn't go well. I was"
02:41,440;02:45,640;"wondered like what the shitty teams do with these because everyone gets one of"
02:45,640;02:48,960;"these right? Yeah oh yeah I think they make one for every team every year."
02:48,960;02:52,760;"I think it was buying this like a 2019 dolphins one."
02:52,760;02:58,800;"Oh, I think completionists are buying these, but I'm pretty sure I remember seeing, uh,"
02:58,800;03:02,360;"like a, a Buccaneers one from back in the day when they're still wearing the"
03:02,360;03:03,080;"cream cycles."
03:03,080;03:04,120;"Mm."
03:04,120;03:09,200;"And it was sad because I mean, it was basically one replay over and over again,"
03:09,200;03:11,760;"because they just didn't have any positive moments on the season."
03:11,760;03:13,680;"That's going to be the dolphins this year."
03:13,680;03:14,320;"Yeah."
03:14,320;03:14,920;"Same idea."
03:14,920;03:15,520;"I don't know."
03:15,520;03:17,240;"They just made a quarterback switch."
03:17,240;03:17,600;"So."
03:18,880;03:19,880;"Look out."
03:19,880;03:25,480;"The same quarterback switch that the"
03:25,480;03:29,600;"well, the opposite kind of the same quarterback switch that the"
03:29,600;03:32,800;"Cardinals made. And then they made the"
03:32,800;03:33,800;"switch again."
03:33,800;03:34,360;"Right."
03:34,360;03:35,320;"See after. Yeah."
03:35,320;03:37,080;"Oops."
03:37,080;03:42,680;"All right. So yeah, so I guess there's no surprise then that"
03:42,680;03:45,360;"the Patriots finished five and 11 that season."
03:46,480;03:51,760;"And even before that, they were on a downwards trend anyway, because they had they went to Super"
03:51,760;03:59,120;"with Parcels and was at 96. And then he left for the Jets and brought a curse mart with him with"
03:59,120;04:07,360;"all that. Haulableu. And then any Tugbella check too. He did that's true. Yeah."
04:07,360;04:14,160;"He took with him. Yeah. Yeah. What's called a spade a spade here. Yeah. Well, I'm still blaming"
04:14,160;04:21,720;"on Parcells. But yeah, yeah, no, Bell check can do no wrong. So we're not going to blame"
04:21,720;04:27,080;"him on this podcast. Right. Yeah. Yeah, at least, at least, you know, one, we won't blame"
04:27,080;04:34,120;"him. And I'm talking about. So P. Carroll took over from, from Parcells and won one last"
04:34,120;04:38,680;"game every season he was there. So they were 11 and five when they went to Super Bowl,"
04:38,680;04:41,120;"then there were 10 and six in Carroll's first year."
04:41,120;04:44,800;"And then nine and seven and then eight,"
04:44,800;04:46,520;"eight, before they finally got rid of them,"
04:46,520;04:52,320;"they bring in Bella Check who went five and 11,"
04:52,320;04:55,800;"but beat some like surprisingly good teams weirdly."
04:55,800;05:01,440;"Two of their wins were at Denver against the Broncos"
05:01,440;05:02,960;"who finished 11 and five that season,"
05:02,960;05:05,560;"which they'd never win in Denver."
05:05,560;05:07,800;"And then they beat the Colts at home when the Colts"
05:07,800;05:09,560;"were still in the ASE East back then."
05:09,560;05:13,000;"And the Colts finished 10 and six in both those teams"
05:13,000;05:14,680;"with the playoffs."
05:14,680;05:16,280;"And they're one of their other wins."
05:16,280;05:18,740;"One of the only other wins they had was against"
05:18,740;05:22,140;"this Bengals team that we're starting the season with."
05:22,140;05:27,920;"And that's kind of all there was to the 2000s,"
05:27,920;05:30,040;"even there wasn't much to talk about."
05:30,040;05:31,520;"- I beg to differ."
05:31,520;05:32,880;"There was a lot going on, man."
05:32,880;05:34,760;"Oh yeah, I got notes, man."
05:34,760;05:36,320;"It's called Show Prep."
05:36,320;05:38,320;"- All right, let's hear, 'cause Isaac knows too,"
05:38,320;05:40,720;"but all I could find were issues,"
05:40,720;05:42,680;"and I didn't wanna start on the--"
05:42,680;05:43,760;"- Oh, no, no."
05:43,760;05:47,440;"- Oh, they're not, I mean, issues are,"
05:47,440;05:49,720;"that's a relatable term, I guess."
05:49,720;05:53,560;"I mean, there, things happen, right?"
05:53,560;05:55,880;"And we were talking about 'em."
05:55,880;05:58,600;"My first note is that I can't believe this video exists,"
05:58,600;06:00,080;"so that was the top one."
06:00,080;06:01,960;"I'm right there with the two."
06:01,960;06:02,800;"- On YouTube."
06:02,800;06:05,320;"- Things you can find on the internet,"
06:05,320;06:07,320;"is pretty impressive."
06:07,320;06:11,640;"- I mean, I was more interested with like,"
06:11,640;06:15,800;"you know, the way that Bella check became the head coach."
06:15,800;06:18,480;"Things that were happening with Terry Glenn,"
06:18,480;06:20,880;"the Taiwan incident."
06:20,880;06:24,040;"So I mean, this is like before social media."
06:24,040;06:26,880;"So I guess people might not remember care or whatever,"
06:26,880;06:28,120;"but if this stuff was happening today,"
06:28,120;06:30,520;"I think it would be a little bit different."
06:30,520;06:32,880;"So I don't know if people remember some of that stuff,"
06:32,880;06:35,120;"but I think it's fun to talk about."
06:35,120;06:37,580;"- Yeah, no, absolutely."
06:37,580;06:40,320;"Yeah, 'cause that was the candidate incident."
06:40,320;06:41,440;"Is that what you're talking about?"
06:41,440;06:44,080;"- Oh, yeah, with Terry Lennon Taiwan."
06:44,080;06:46,000;"- Yeah, and Troy Brown, actually."
06:46,000;06:47,760;"- Oh, and Troy Brown, okay."
06:47,760;06:49,800;"That's an unlikely one."
06:49,800;06:51,200;"- Yeah, it was them three that went"
06:51,200;06:53,320;"because they played a game,"
06:53,320;06:56,120;"from what I understand, they played a game in Buffalo"
06:56,120;06:57,160;"in the winter."
06:57,160;06:58,720;"And so the weather was real bad"
06:58,720;07:01,200;"and the three of them were not big flyers."
07:01,200;07:03,960;"So they stayed up there an extra night"
07:03,960;07:08,220;"because they didn't want to fly in the snow,"
07:08,220;07:11,720;"went to, I want to say Montreal"
07:11,720;07:13,520;"or Niagara or something like that,"
07:13,520;07:17,760;"and got into some trouble on the way back, I believe."
07:17,760;07:19,600;"I can't remember exactly what it was, do you remember?"
07:19,600;07:23,480;"- I mean, I'm pretty sure that Tylog got arrested for ecstasy."
07:23,480;07:27,240;"- Yeah, but, because I think they found it"
07:27,240;07:29,840;"in the car on the way back, but he said,"
07:29,840;07:31,460;"is like his cousins or something."
07:31,460;07:33,440;"He's a Hall of Famer."
07:33,440;07:35,260;"So I mean, I don't care, but."
07:35,260;07:38,240;"Troy Brown doesn't need ecstasy, Steven."
07:38,240;07:40,220;"Yeah, you see those eyes."
07:40,220;07:43,240;"He's just generally happy football is his drug."
07:43,240;07:49,760;"And now look at Pat Chung, gets busted as burger alarm trips automatically."
07:49,760;07:52,740;"And and who's still who's still a part of the team?"
07:52,740;07:54,640;"Troy Brown coincidence."
07:54,640;07:56,120;"That's true."
07:56,120;07:57,560;"I didn't even think about that."
07:57,560;08:00,080;"the coaching staff had shown gets popped."
08:00,080;08:01,080;"Jeez."
08:01,080;08:02,080;"Oh boy."
08:02,080;08:04,080;"So that was something."
08:04,080;08:07,720;"I'm gonna take your slide already."
08:07,720;08:11,640;"It's just stuff that happened, you know?"
08:11,640;08:12,640;"Yeah, that's true."
08:12,640;08:17,600;"I mean, I have read the Troy Brown autobiography and he did address it in there."
08:17,600;08:19,400;"So what did he say?"
08:19,400;08:20,400;"I would say that."
08:20,400;08:22,520;"Anything recap video was kind of nice."
08:22,520;08:26,160;"There is like a blindside hit on Peyton Manning, which I really liked."
08:26,160;08:28,560;"Did you watch that part over and over again?"
08:28,560;08:30,080;"I didn't rewind that part."
08:30,080;08:30,580;"Yeah."
08:30,580;08:31,980;"Well, they like played like three times too."
08:31,980;08:33,920;"So I got to watch it like 12."
08:33,920;08:34,420;"Yeah."
08:34,420;08:38,120;"That's what I was talking about when I was saying there weren't a whole lot of highlights"
08:38,120;08:39,120;"for some of these teams."
08:39,120;08:41,760;"There was a lot of repeats I felt in this video."
08:41,760;08:42,760;"Oh, yeah."
08:42,760;08:43,760;"Yeah."
08:43,760;08:47,480;"I mean, the highlights from me, I don't know if you guys remember this or not, but"
08:47,480;08:51,600;"I mean, there was the Michael Bishop Hale, Mary versus the Cole to like read before the"
08:51,600;08:52,600;"half."
08:52,600;08:53,600;"So that was pretty awesome."
08:53,600;08:58,600;"top 20 plays of the Patriots that year."
08:58,600;08:59,600;"Okay."
08:59,600;09:03,600;"That was almost a real hot day."
09:03,600;09:11,600;"There's the fake field goal against the Colts, you know, and then there's a Tibaki Jones"
09:11,600;09:12,600;"interception."
09:12,600;09:13,600;"So they beat the Colts."
09:13,600;09:14,600;"That was pretty cool."
09:14,600;09:17,520;"We saw a little bit of, of Glyn."
09:17,520;09:23,560;"So that was nice before we never saw him again."
09:23,560;09:25,920;"see that pretty much covers it."
09:25,920;09:30,360;"I thought it was interesting how better quality the chief's prime time in game was."
09:30,360;09:31,960;"Yes."
09:31,960;09:36,640;"Video quality was way better on that and like Willy was miked up, which was awesome."
09:36,640;09:37,440;"Oh, yeah."
09:37,440;09:37,880;"That's right."
09:37,880;09:42,600;"The McGinnis in his prime at that point, I think, kind of early 2000s was his prime"
09:42,600;09:50,800;"and that dude kind of looked like a grown man playing with smaller children on the"
09:50,800;09:51,640;"on the same field."
09:51,640;09:53,080;"He was just so much bigger."
09:53,120;09:55,320;"I felt like everybody in these highlights are bigger."
09:55,320;10:00,040;"Like you they all look like they're a team full of fullbacks on offense."
10:00,040;10:02,320;"And just because it's wearing massive shoulder pads."
10:02,320;10:03,760;"Yeah, I think that's part of it."
10:03,760;10:07,160;"But I think they're also just like like defenses were bigger because"
10:07,160;10:12,800;"it was still a run first league back in the early 2000s, like late 90s."
10:12,800;10:16,120;"There wasn't this focus on the passing game."
10:16,120;10:17,640;"So people were just massive."
10:17,640;10:19,200;"Like you look at Loyamaloy and he wouldn't."
10:19,520;10:23,360;"I don't think last as a safety in today's NFL."
10:23,360;10:24,360;"No way."
10:24,360;10:29,280;"It was telling that they're like, Oh, true blood cells passed for 3,000 yards"
10:29,280;10:30,760;"in like seven straight seasons."
10:30,760;10:31,760;"Yes."
10:31,760;10:34,160;"That was one of the stats."
10:34,160;10:34,720;"Yeah."
10:34,720;10:38,800;"That is crazy, though, that that was like a major accomplishment."
10:38,800;10:41,800;"And then you have, I mean, what do you guys think about that too?"
10:41,800;10:43,760;"I mean, obviously the rules have changed and everything, but yeah."
10:43,760;10:45,280;"Like big deal."
10:45,280;10:47,760;"And then you had the next generation that was hitting four."
10:47,760;10:51,900;"now you have my homes and breeze her pretty much doing it every season."
10:51,900;10:53,280;"Maybe not breeze anymore, but"
10:53,280;10:59,880;"5,000 is now going to be the, uh, the sort of goal."
10:59,880;11:01,400;"I think so."
11:01,400;11:07,220;"And I think that just makes, uh, what Dan Marino did back in the day"
11:07,220;11:10,280;"throwing for 5,000 yards back when everybody's still throwing for three"
11:10,280;11:11,520;"that much more impressive."
11:11,520;11:16,320;"Yeah, it does seem like somebody does it."
11:17,080;11:21,640;"Every year or gets real close to every year nowadays. It's just not quite the same"
11:21,640;11:25,240;"Yeah, so that is an interesting point"
11:25,240;11:31,640;"And it was fun to look back on but 70 years straight doing that blood so slinging it that's something"
11:31,640;11:37,860;"Jeff's got a hot take just sort of an ESPN today that they think my home is gonna be the first hundred thousand-year guy"
11:37,860;11:45,360;"Oh, I I could see that I could also see Brady playing till he's 48 and hitting it as well though"
11:45,360;11:50,360;"So, because he's at 70 something thousand, 78 thousand."
11:50,360;11:54,240;"So, with the lead the way it is,"
11:54,240;11:57,880;"if Brady can throw 5,000 yards another five years, why not?"
11:57,880;12:02,960;"I don't know if Brady's ever thrown for 5,000 yards."
12:02,960;12:04,000;"He has."
12:04,000;12:04,840;"Yeah, yes."
12:04,840;12:05,920;"One, I think."
12:05,920;12:06,960;"In '07, right?"
12:06,960;12:11,480;"Yeah, well, you might have done it twice actually."
12:11,480;12:12,640;"He's gonna do it again this year."
12:12,640;12:13,840;"We can all agree on that."
12:13,840;12:19,180;"Fingers crossed. I mean, yeah, he's gonna do it every year from now on. I'm pretty sure"
12:19,180;12:23,520;"Also"
12:23,520;12:25,960;"I think you have made"
12:25,960;12:28,880;"On the coaching staff"
12:28,880;12:34,960;"On the pads that year, which is pretty interesting with Eric Mangini and Rob Ryan"
12:34,960;12:37,920;"Scott Pioli was still there"
12:37,920;12:42,440;"Yeah, there was a surprisingly amount of big names back in these days"
12:42,440;12:44,760;"Yeah, you got Rob Ryan as your linebacker coach."
12:44,760;12:46,040;"Yeah."
12:46,040;12:47,360;"Underneath Eric Mangini's."
12:47,360;12:47,720;"Yeah."
12:47,720;12:52,440;"Oh, yeah, Eric Mangini was a defensive backs coach at that point, wasn't he?"
12:52,440;12:55,600;"I think so."
12:55,600;12:57,200;"Oh, I'm looking at 2000."
12:57,200;12:59,920;"But yeah, I think just the"
12:59,920;13:01,800;"American coaches that were."
13:01,800;13:02,160;"Yeah."
13:02,160;13:05,040;"Yeah, Eric Mangini defensive backs."
13:05,040;13:08,760;"Rob Ryan as your linebackers guy."
13:08,760;13:11,920;"I didn't realize Rob Ryan was attached to the Patriots in that way."
13:11,920;13:19,120;"Yeah, I just think of him as Rex Ryan's long hair hair brother."
13:19,120;13:20,120;"Yeah."
13:20,120;13:21,120;"Exactly."
13:21,120;13:27,400;"But I looked into it further and there's some other guys that nobody really mentions"
13:27,400;13:28,880;"but check this out."
13:28,880;13:30,520;"You're at Jeff Davidson."
13:30,520;13:31,520;"Oh, no."
13:31,520;13:32,520;"Hey, Jeff Davidson."
13:32,520;13:33,520;"Yeah."
13:33,520;13:36,920;"Oh, line assistant coach today."
13:36,920;13:39,960;"Oh, line coach Detroit lines."
13:39,960;13:40,960;"Next guy, right?"
13:40,960;13:42,000;"still in the league. Okay."
13:42,000;13:48,160;"Mark Paul, assistant strength and conditioning coach now head"
13:48,160;13:51,520;"strength and conditioning coach of the Dallas Cowboys and"
13:51,520;13:56,480;"the Wayne Walker defensive assistant. He's kicking around as"
13:56,480;14:00,920;"DV coach at Cleveland. So that's something that most people"
14:00,920;14:01,680;"don't talk about."
14:01,680;14:06,880;"That's true. Because you always hear about how all the the"
14:06,880;14:12,120;"Bell check disciples go out and fail because you'll hear the guys taking the head coach positions"
14:12,120;14:14,560;"But the fact that all these other guys are still in the league"
14:14,560;14:20,440;"I mean, I know you know one that was Josh McDaniel's first year"
14:20,440;14:22,440;"out of the track"
14:22,440;14:24,440;"technically still in the league but"
14:24,440;14:27,440;"Yeah, and I think Brian Dable is still in the league as well as me"
14:27,440;14:29,440;"- This is the..."
14:29,440;14:31,780;"(indistinct)"
14:31,780;14:35,160;"- Whoa."
14:35,160;14:41,160;"- And Maddie Walsh was on the staff at this point."
14:41,160;14:43,120;"Do you remember that guy?"
14:43,120;14:43,960;"- I do remember that one."
14:43,960;14:44,800;"- Yeah."
14:44,800;14:48,000;"- There's a little video assistant fellow"
14:48,000;14:49,600;"that may have had something to do"
14:49,600;14:52,280;"with the old Spygate situation."
14:52,280;14:53,880;"He was kicking around."
14:53,880;14:54,720;"- The prads."
14:54,720;14:55,640;"- Yes."
14:55,640;14:56,480;"- Oh, Brian Dave."
14:56,480;15:03,480;"I was going to say Brian Dable is the offensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills right now."
15:03,480;15:15,480;"See? I mean, it's a beautiful thing. But yeah, this Matty Walsh guy has to be said in the media guide. I was looking at over and it is written that he auditioned to be an MTV VJ"
15:15,480;15:20,480;"and he's single. So that's a good professional."
15:20,480;15:21,680;"That's a good professional."
15:21,680;15:23,960;"Rather me right there."
15:23,960;15:30,640;"And finally, last but not least, I would venture to get."
15:30,640;15:33,840;"I don't, I'm, that's too controversial for me to speak on."
15:33,840;15:41,200;"But last but not least, the Raybine used to be the quarterbacks coach"
15:41,200;15:42,120;"and L.T. is dead."
15:42,120;15:43,600;"So yes."
15:43,600;15:43,840;"Yeah."
15:43,840;15:46,960;"Cause he died between the 2000, 2001."
15:47,960;15:52,200;"Unfortunately, it's a circumstance. Yeah, you passed after a stress test. Yeah"
15:52,200;15:55,960;"So I'm a guy that draft Brady"
15:55,960;15:59,640;"Right. Oh, that's right. Yes"
15:59,640;16:03,280;"So I think that's a good segue into this"
16:03,280;16:09,040;"2001 season because there were some things that happened during the off season"
16:09,040;16:12,560;"And that was one of the big ones was"
16:12,560;16:16,960;"The death of their wider secret coach because I think that was"
16:16,960;16:19,960;"was kind of like playing for..."
16:19,960;16:24,480;"I was Robert Kraft's wife's name."
16:24,480;16:25,320;"- Myra."
16:25,320;16:26,160;"- Myra."
16:26,160;16:27,000;"- Myra, yeah."
16:27,000;16:28,000;"So playing for Myra Kraft that year"
16:28,000;16:29,240;"when they had the stickers on the helmet."
16:29,240;16:31,040;"It felt kind of similar to that."
16:31,040;16:34,320;"It was kind of one of those people"
16:34,320;16:35,520;"who have been there for a while"
16:35,520;16:39,640;"and everybody talked highly of them."
16:39,640;16:41,920;"And so, and it was kind of an unexpected death."
16:43,480;16:48,480;"But the other big news was Terry Glenn,"
16:48,480;16:54,980;"because he got popped for smoking weed"
16:54,980;16:58,120;"during the off season, was suspended for games"
16:58,120;17:01,800;"by the league, and then decided not to show up"
17:01,800;17:04,280;"to training camp, 'cause I think he was,"
17:04,280;17:07,200;"there was like some money stuff going on as well."
17:07,200;17:08,800;"So Bella checked her around just to spend"
17:08,800;17:10,280;"in them for the entire season."
17:11,280;17:14,040;"which I think was a precursor to everything"
17:14,040;17:16,560;"he was gonna do for the next 20 years."
17:16,560;17:21,560;"And the NFLPA, the NFL, everybody was involved,"
17:21,560;17:23,520;"they were trying to figure out if this was within the rules"
17:23,520;17:24,520;"and me knowing Belichick,"
17:24,520;17:27,520;"he probably studied it up and down before doing it."
17:27,520;17:29,440;"- Exactly, yeah."
17:29,440;17:32,080;"'Cause there were wars gonna set some sort of precedent"
17:32,080;17:34,760;"if Terry Glenn challenged this"
17:34,760;17:35,720;"and then it got overturned"
17:35,720;17:38,400;"and now the players have all this power."
17:38,400;17:42,720;"But I'm gonna say that didn't happen because we didn't really hear much from"
17:42,720;17:45,360;"Terry Glenn after that other than get everyone says, you know,"
17:45,360;17:49,160;"Bell check and make these crazy moves because he has so much tenure in New"
17:49,160;17:50,720;"England, but peruse he doesn't."
17:50,720;17:53,440;"This is the second year and he's suspending Terry Glenn."
17:53,440;17:54,840;"Is there best receiver by far?"
17:54,840;17:55,640;"Yeah."
17:55,640;17:57,800;"I mean, manual really."
17:57,800;17:58,600;"Yeah."
17:58,600;17:59,240;"I know man."
17:59,240;18:00,040;"That's insane."
18:00,040;18:01,880;"Does he have a super low wearing?"
18:01,880;18:07,440;"You got to imagine he does use unless you got cut further further on,"
18:07,760;18:09,680;"But they usually give everybody who played that year."
18:09,680;18:11,640;"That's yeah, I guess."
18:11,640;18:13,680;"So I mean, I think he has like our starting"
18:13,680;18:14,760;"safety has one."
18:14,760;18:16,480;"What?"
18:16,480;18:17,760;"I don't remember this guy."
18:17,760;18:20,720;"He doesn't want to, though."
18:20,720;18:25,680;"I think in the third point, this is absolutely blown up by Corey Dillon."
18:25,680;18:26,480;"Yeah."
18:26,480;18:29,640;"He's like, ""Bout is off Corey Dillon."""
18:29,640;18:30,640;"Like he's made a rubber."
18:30,640;18:31,800;"He just goes flying."
18:31,800;18:37,160;"Yeah, there was a few, especially this week one game."
18:37,160;18:40,860;"And those are a few people that I didn't even recognize the names, never mind."
18:40,860;18:43,020;"Oh, yeah, I remember that guy."
18:43,020;18:47,500;"It was just like a whole bunch of not even remembering that they were on the team outside"
18:47,500;18:48,940;"of like David Patton."
18:48,940;18:50,100;"Yeah."
18:50,100;18:54,500;"So that was the thing is because Terry Glenn was suspended for the year, David Patton,"
18:54,500;19:00,860;"they actually had in the Boston Globe, I pulled up some of the old Boston Globe articles from"
19:00,860;19:01,860;"around this time."
19:01,860;19:10,260;"one of them was basically about how he was working at some place like carrying bags of coffee beans"
19:10,260;19:15,460;"and like tearing up his hands before I got the call that he was going to be playing for the Patriots."
19:15,460;19:21,700;"And we all know how that turned out. Yeah, he's a divine intervention."
19:21,700;19:27,860;"Yeah, exactly. Because the carrying coffee was God's punishment for him because he hadn't learned"
19:27,860;19:33,120;"his lessons yet, but apparently just enough. He got the call from Bill Belichick once"
19:33,120;19:37,660;"Terry Glenn was out for the year. We know how that turned out for both of them, for"
19:37,660;19:41,760;"both Terry Glenn and the little speed stare."
19:41,760;19:48,060;"Now, Glenn, though, the interesting thing about him was that he had signed a new contract"
19:48,060;19:49,060;"the previous year."
19:49,060;19:51,260;"Yeah, it was kind of a monster one."
19:51,260;19:57,260;"It was. Yeah, at the time, it was 60 years, 50 mil with 11 guaranteed, which is not much"
19:57,260;20:00,420;"by today's standards, but back then it was pretty decent."
20:00,420;20:02,260;"Yeah, that's top-"
20:02,260;20:03,260;"for the time."
20:03,260;20:04,260;"Right."
20:04,260;20:06,820;"I mean, some of the other deals that happened."
20:06,820;20:13,780;"Well, and then I also saw that I didn't realize this, but Pete Carroll had suspended"
20:13,780;20:17,780;"him before Belichick got there as well."
20:17,780;20:19,180;"So I didn't see that."
20:19,180;20:21,020;"Yeah, in '99."
20:21,020;20:23,820;"So there was already a little bit of a precedent there."
20:23,820;20:24,820;"Yeah, yeah."
20:24,820;20:25,820;"Yeah."
20:25,820;20:31,540;"Yeah, I remember him always having a tumultuous relationship, because even when Parcels was"
20:31,540;20:37,460;"run in the team and they had that press conference about Terry Glenn had an injury and Parcells"
20:37,460;20:41,860;"didn't believe that he was injured. He thought he was sitting out and so they asked him how Terry"
20:41,860;20:48,020;"Glenn was and he said, ""Yeah, she's fine."" Right. In true Parcells fashion. That's like the only"
20:48,020;20:54,100;"thing I remember about Terry Glenn. That sparked the whole, ""If you want me to be the cook,"
20:54,100;20:56,740;"you got to let me buy the groceries."" Exactly."
20:56,740;20:59,740;"Robert Kraft and Terry Glande pretty much hated him."
20:59,740;21:03,100;"Yeah, because Terry Glenn was Robert Kraft,"
21:03,100;21:05,660;"draft, make not Bill Bellaghex."
21:05,660;21:06,540;"Right."
21:06,540;21:08,060;"Bill Parcels, really."
21:08,060;21:08,540;"Right."
21:08,540;21:08,900;"Right."
21:08,900;21:14,340;"And then, you know, obviously Terry Gland passed in a accident,"
21:14,340;21:19,300;"but pretty much every interview that I heard after that incident was that,"
21:19,300;21:20,380;"you know, he was a good guy."
21:20,380;21:22,340;"He was just troubled, never really figured it out."
21:22,340;21:26,700;"So it's kind of a sad story in that sense, because he had the talent."
21:26,700;21:31,700;"but and the style by just didn't quite put it together."
21:31,700;21:33,580;"- Yeah, I felt like one of those guys"
21:33,580;21:36,900;"where it came easy to him before coming into the pros."
21:36,900;21:38,880;"So it never really seemed like he gave,"
21:38,880;21:41,780;"but like had to give much effort coming in"
21:41,780;21:43,820;"to know how to do that once he got there."
21:43,820;21:44,740;"- Yeah."
21:44,740;21:47,540;"- And so yeah, you just never really put it all together."
21:47,540;21:51,700;"Whereas the opposite side of that would probably be Troy Brown"
21:51,700;21:53,080;"who didn't quite have the talent,"
21:53,080;21:56,020;"but just worked his balls off"
21:56,020;21:57,460;"and I kept making the team."
21:57,460;21:59,980;"And from his biography that I read,"
21:59,980;22:04,060;"basically the only, like he kind of just hung around barely"
22:04,060;22:07,700;"by the skin of his teeth on the Parcels and Carols teams,"
22:07,700;22:11,740;"but Belichick kind of day one came to him says,"
22:11,740;22:16,300;"I remember you from when I was the defensive coach"
22:16,300;22:19,380;"when I was here last and I've watched a bunch of tape on you"
22:19,380;22:20,220;"and I know what you can do."
22:20,220;22:23,620;"So we're gonna basically feature you in this offense."
22:23,620;22:25,940;"- 1200 yards, five touchdowns is here."
22:25,940;22:30,420;"- Yeah, yeah, in 2001 was his best year as a receiver"
22:30,420;22:32,820;"'cause he was kind of the number one guy"
22:32,820;22:35,780;"because like I said, who else was it?"
22:35,780;22:37,060;"Especially the beginning."
22:37,060;22:42,180;"- Yeah, I mean, even in 2000, he almost got a thousand yards"
22:42,180;22:44,260;"and it was like nine, 50 or something like that."
22:44,260;22:48,100;"So given that team, 944 yards and four touchdowns"
22:48,100;22:53,100;"the year before 12.9 return average in 2000 as well."
22:53,660;22:57,660;"So he was on his way to be a part of the team in that fashion."
22:57,660;22:59,580;"The original West Walker."
22:59,580;23:00,780;"Exactly."
23:00,780;23:06,380;"I he was kind of the original gunner, Olshevsky, if you will."
23:06,380;23:07,620;"Oh boy."
23:07,620;23:09,620;"Oh, that's a hot take."
23:09,620;23:14,140;"Oh, you know it is."
23:14,140;23:16,500;"All right."
23:16,500;23:18,460;"So let's, uh, that's kind of the lead up."
23:18,460;23:22,140;"So let's, let's, because we're haven't actually talked about the game yet."
23:22,140;23:24,740;"We're at about a half hour in here."
23:24,740;23:26,700;"But is there anything else you want"
23:26,700;23:31,140;"to touch on real quick before we do get to the game?"
23:31,140;23:33,940;"I mean, Willie and the Unisynx Chris"
23:33,940;23:36,620;"Laid had a pretty nice bromance."
23:36,620;23:36,980;"Yeah."
23:36,980;23:38,060;"I missed that."
23:38,060;23:40,620;"And bought it from me."
23:40,620;23:42,740;"Couple notable draft picks for this year"
23:42,740;23:46,660;"was the first round pick was Richard Seymour."
23:46,660;23:49,180;"And they also drafted Matt Light in the second round."
23:49,180;23:50,180;"So two big names."
23:50,180;23:51,940;"That was kind of the only names I recognized"
23:51,940;23:58,680;"from this draft. There was a bunch of turnover from the 2000 season. The"
23:58,680;24:01,400;"announcer's in this game actually pointed out there was 38 new players"
24:01,400;24:07,120;"from a year ago and 18 of those were free agents. So Belichick basically just"
24:07,120;24:11,880;"gutted the team that he had before, brought in a bunch of veteran guys. And"
24:11,880;24:16,160;"I think that was his way of trying to set the tone for what this locker room"
24:16,160;24:19,800;"was going to be, which I think still holds today. He has, I mean, he's created"
24:19,800;24:24,660;"that core now that doesn't change as much, because he got braided it's there the whole"
24:24,660;24:30,040;"time. But that was his kind of method from the get go was to fill that culture of accountability"
24:30,040;24:35,480;"and bringing in the guys who knew what they were doing to help the young team kind of"
24:35,480;24:36,480;"gel a little bit."
24:36,480;24:42,840;"And if you didn't know that, just watch this first game because the commentators wouldn't"
24:42,840;24:48,200;"get off that topic for basically the whole third quarter when the pages stopped playing"
24:48,200;24:49,200;"football."
24:49,200;24:53,120;"Well, it's interesting too, because a lot of the guys are older guys."
24:53,120;24:57,520;"Like you said, veterans and their, you know, they had a little veterans."
24:57,520;24:58,520;"Right."
24:58,520;25:00,320;"They have a little bit of like a chip on their shoulder."
25:00,320;25:05,800;"They had an attitude, which is interesting because it fit with the Bella check type attitude."
25:05,800;25:10,000;"It wasn't like this arrogant type thing, but like Brian Cox, I remember he was like flipping"
25:10,000;25:12,760;"people off and then he became a patriot, you know?"
25:12,760;25:13,760;"Yeah."
25:13,760;25:14,760;"I was trying to bring up."
25:14,760;25:18,320;"have like an entire like neck roll on his shoulder."
25:18,320;25:19,320;"Oh my god."
25:19,320;25:21,480;"That went like almost above the back of his helmet."
25:21,480;25:23,400;"It was awesome."
25:23,400;25:27,960;"Looked like the headrest for your car seat."
25:27,960;25:29,760;"It was awesome."
25:29,760;25:30,400;"So all right."
25:30,400;25:33,520;"And oh, the one last thing that they kept harping on too"
25:33,520;25:36,160;"was that this season they had replacement referees, which"
25:36,160;25:37,760;"I did not remember."
25:37,760;25:39,080;"Yeah, I do remember that."
25:39,080;25:41,600;"And we lasted like I think three weeks or the first two"
25:41,600;25:42,760;"weeks."
25:42,760;25:43,260;"Yeah."
25:43,260;25:46,260;"I mean, that doesn't surprise me considering what happened after week one."
25:46,260;25:51,220;"But yeah, it was kind of when I was reading the papers leading up to it."
25:51,220;25:54,020;"And afterwards it like half the articles are about these replacement"
25:54,020;25:56,140;"refs and how they did and how they were going to do."
25:56,140;25:59,300;"And every time they made a call in the fields like, Oh, these"
25:59,300;26:01,380;"replacement refs look like real referees."
26:01,380;26:01,980;"Okay."
26:01,980;26:04,820;"Now, then that happened like a couple of years ago as well."
26:04,820;26:05,500;"Am I mistaken?"
26:05,500;26:05,860;"It did."
26:05,860;26:06,180;"Yeah."
26:06,180;26:09,500;"Because it doesn't age of social media."
26:09,500;26:11,020;"So it was way magnified."
26:11,020;26:11,540;"Yeah."
26:11,540;26:12,100;"Right."
26:12,100;26:12,460;"Right."
26:12,780;26:16,020;"blown up because they they miscalled a Hail Mary for"
26:16,020;26:19,920;"Seattle, the screen base packers game, right?"
26:19,920;26:23,260;"Yep. And one call is incomplete, one call to catch."
26:23,260;26:26,020;"And they have the picture of one guy waving it off and one guy with his hands up."
26:26,020;26:31,820;"So so the NFL still hasn't learned their lesson from 20 years ago, I guess."
26:31,820;26:35,300;"No, yeah, I'm sure we'll have that coming up soon again, whatever the next"
26:35,300;26:36,740;"NBA is for them."
26:36,740;26:41,180;"All right. So yeah, let's finally get to this game."
26:41,300;26:52,540;"Um, this was a week one of the 2001 season, like we said, again, it was in Cincinnati against the Bengals who the year before had not done well."
26:52,540;26:57,980;"They were, uh, I think that four and 12 or something like that."
26:57,980;26:59,060;"Something, something real bad."
26:59,060;27:06,660;"Yeah, they're four and 12 year before, but their only real contributor, especially on offense was Corey Dillon."
27:07,940;27:12,320;"Like the only two names I recognized from the Bengals roster other than John Kittner."
27:12,320;27:16,360;"And I didn't recognize that for a good reason was Corey Dillon and Ticchio"
27:16,360;27:16,880;"Spikes."
27:16,880;27:19,100;"Peter Walker."
27:19,100;27:21,060;"I remember him and he was pretty good in this game."
27:21,060;27:22,240;"Yeah, that's true."
27:22,240;27:24,080;"I I vaguely remember his name."
27:24,080;27:28,640;"I don't remember him being as good as he was being hyped up to be, but the man"
27:28,640;27:31,480;"made some quality catches in this game, the very least."
27:31,480;27:31,980;"Yeah."
27:31,980;27:33,160;"That one hand to grab a suite."
27:33,160;27:33,500;"Yeah."
27:33,500;27:34,600;"Oh, that was Darnay Scott."
27:34,600;27:34,940;"Sorry."
27:34,940;27:35,480;"That wasn't."
27:35,480;27:35,960;"Oh, yeah."
27:35,960;27:37,560;"Darnay Scott's legit."
27:37,560;27:42,560;"Yeah, yeah. For some reason, I always had Darnay Scott in my head as a quarterback."
27:42,560;27:46,160;"And I don't know why. I don't know who I'm confusing him with, but it was someone like"
27:46,160;27:47,160;"that."
27:47,160;27:50,760;"When Chad Johnson was on their team, but he didn't play at all."
27:50,760;27:55,220;"Yeah, because this was his rookie season. And so the right, the commentators made some"
27:55,220;27:58,360;"comment about how he looked good in preseason and they were excited to see what he could"
27:58,360;28:04,640;"do. I don't think they quite understood what they had on that. But yeah, speaking of the"
28:04,640;28:09,640;"commentators, I thought that was quite a quality crew for such a game that was"
28:09,640;28:14,200;"probably not touted to be a like one of the A list games."
28:14,200;28:19,040;"It was just Johnson back in the day who makes everything sound really exciting."
28:19,040;28:22,560;"I didn't think Brent Jones added much, but Sam Wiesch,"
28:22,560;28:27,480;"the old coach of the Cincinnati Bengals actually did a, I thought a really good job."
28:27,480;28:31,400;"Well, I thought that other guy sounded like Tony Romo a little bit."
28:31,400;28:33,560;"Which are like, I Brent Jones."
28:33,960;28:34,960;"Yeah."
28:34,960;28:35,960;"Really?"
28:35,960;28:37,320;"I was like, Tony Romo?"
28:37,320;28:37,760;"No."
28:37,760;28:41,040;"I didn't catch that."
28:41,040;28:45,040;"But yeah, I thought like Sam, why is he kind of had that like you could tell he"
28:45,040;28:51,800;"just came from coaching because he was all about like calling out the players"
28:51,800;28:53,560;"who were getting away with penalties and stuff like that."
28:53,560;28:59,400;"Like he caught some guy, some offensive lineman holding twice on one play."
28:59,400;29:00,880;"Like, I don't know how he got away with one."
29:00,880;29:01,280;"Never mind."
29:01,280;29:02,280;"Two of them."
29:02,280;29:02,960;"It was all up and on."
29:02,960;29:05,420;"Jeff, Jeff members Brent Jones from his playing days."
29:05,420;29:09,740;"Yeah, Brent Jones was a 49ers tight end, I believe."
29:09,740;29:12,040;"He was like Steve Young's goat to."
29:12,040;29:12,600;"Yeah."
29:12,600;29:12,800;"Yeah."
29:12,800;29:13,140;"Yeah."
29:13,140;29:18,820;"Because they had some, uh, they had some banter halfway through, uh, because"
29:18,820;29:23,320;"Brent Jones is 49ers actually beat Sam Wiesz's bangles in the Super Bowl."
29:23,320;29:27,540;"And so Sam Wiesz's comment was something along the lines of, yeah, they beat us"
29:27,540;29:29,140;"because we couldn't cover their tight ends."
29:30,180;29:33,340;"I don't know if that was actually true or not, or if he was just pandering to his audience."
29:33,340;29:40,860;"But to your point, after watching some of the 2000s and I mean, I didn't realize"
29:40,860;29:47,700;"that there is such a difference in sort of level of quality between teams, but the"
29:47,700;29:51,140;"announcing unit was pretty on point on this one."
29:51,140;29:52,020;"Yeah."
29:52,020;29:56,740;"I was surprised because usually, because yeah, I watched some of the 2000 games too."
29:56,740;30:01,860;"And you had some, I don't know, Dan Kricky and who was the other guy that did them with"
30:01,860;30:06,460;"them and they were just not, not the top crew."
30:06,460;30:12,340;"I don't think it's kind of like getting Dan Deodor if these days or someone like that."
30:12,340;30:17,540;"I don't even think he's doing it anymore, but just those."
30:17,540;30:20,700;"Oh, no, who did the last recent Patriots game?"
30:20,700;30:23,420;"It was a iron eagle and Dan Fouts."
30:23,420;30:24,220;"Yeah."
30:24,220;30:25,620;"It's like getting that crew."
30:25,620;30:25,980;"Yeah."
30:25,980;30:29,020;"because we're about all Scotty's old act. Do you like him?"
30:29,020;30:35,020;"I like to go though, but only because he's such a huge Homer. I kind of enjoy that,"
30:35,020;30:39,100;"especially because he's a local guy. I enjoy that same with like Gil and Gino back in the day."
30:39,100;30:43,980;"Was that a recap video just had just Gil and Gino? It was amazing."
30:43,980;30:50,300;"Yeah, all those are. Yeah, no, I love hearing those two call again because they were just kind of like"
30:52,620;30:56,180;"That was like the history for me is hearing their voices."
30:56,180;30:56,660;"Oh, yeah."
30:56,660;31:01,660;"Mom used to mute the TV and then put the radio underneath it and be on Jana."
31:01,660;31:06,300;"I'm pretty sure that's where we got our hatred of TV commentators, actually, was"
31:06,300;31:09,540;"from she would yell at the TV with the best of them."
31:09,540;31:15,900;"Some other general things about this game that I found interesting was"
31:15,900;31:17,540;"that extra points still from the one you had line."
31:17,540;31:21,300;"And yet there were people that still almost missed them."
31:21,300;31:27,900;"And the fans in Cincinnati in this game were like super hard."
31:27,900;31:30,620;"It was amazing."
31:30,620;31:34,100;"Yeah, those a whole bunch of mustaches."
31:34,100;31:41,540;"It's almost like the 80s hadn't left Cincinnati yet in 2001, but they had the hard hat, but"
31:41,540;31:42,940;"with the colors."
31:42,940;31:44,740;"It was beautiful."
31:44,740;31:45,740;"All right."
31:45,740;31:47,940;"Let's see what else we get here."
31:47,940;31:49,380;"Let's do like best and worst."
31:49,380;31:50,380;"I got a good worst."
31:50,380;31:51,380;"All right."
31:51,380;31:52,660;"Well, yeah."
31:52,660;31:58,100;"Is there anything else you want to touch on before we do that?"
31:58,100;32:01,380;"I mean, there is quite a bit on here."
32:01,380;32:05,060;"I mean, it was such a--"
32:05,060;32:06,780;"I mean, nothing really happened in this game."
32:06,780;32:09,740;"It was one of the more boring games I've ever watched."
32:09,740;32:13,700;"But there are--"
32:13,700;32:15,220;"you see certain signs of things."
32:15,220;32:19,660;"I mean, you saw the toughness of the team"
32:19,660;32:22,740;"in the first half, I mean, it kind of like gave up in the second half, but"
32:22,740;32:26,500;"Bletso was slinging it, taking the hits as usual."
32:26,500;32:32,620;"And he had just signed a contract that was supposed to basically be his career"
32:32,620;32:35,180;"contract where he was supposed to retire in New England."
32:35,180;32:37,420;"Um, and that he was just coming off of that."
32:37,420;32:41,900;"So he was sort of supposed to be the savior of the, uh, the franchise at that"
32:41,900;32:42,260;"point."
32:42,260;32:43,540;"Yeah."
32:43,540;32:46,860;"I actually wrote down the, the comment that the commentator said it said, uh,"
32:47,260;32:54,100;"Oh, here's Drew blood. So they signed a multi-million he signed a multi-year multi-million dollar contract that should keep him a patriot through the end of his career."
32:54,100;32:54,780;"Yep."
32:54,780;32:57,980;"Week one of the two years."
32:57,980;32:59,260;"Yeah."
32:59,260;33:05,180;"Well, it's crazy because they also said that he was the second second longest with the team."
33:05,180;33:07,780;"Probably have like active players and far was number one."
33:07,780;33:09,540;"He was out like nine years."
33:09,540;33:11,060;"So you look at Brady now."
33:11,060;33:12,620;"He's going on 20."
33:12,620;33:14,780;"I mean, that's just unheard of."
33:14,780;33:16,340;"It really is."
33:16,340;33:25,140;"Yeah, 20 years in the league is for a non kicker is out of control, but they have all"
33:25,140;33:27,860;"those with the same team is even more so."
33:27,860;33:36,900;"Because even Brett Farve, who's like the poster child of longevity, how many teams did he"
33:36,900;33:37,900;"end up playing for?"
33:37,900;33:38,900;"Three at the end of the day?"
33:38,900;33:42,060;"Because it was most of it with the Packers."
33:42,060;33:43,060;"And then the gym."
33:43,060;33:44,060;"Yeah, and the Vikings and my guests."
33:44,060;33:45,060;"Yeah."
33:45,060;33:46,060;"I think that was it, right?"
33:46,060;33:51,980;"you know well actually he was with the Falcons oh yeah originally he was"
33:51,980;33:57,820;"trapped yeah yeah yeah even just guys man crushes ended up going somewhere else"
33:57,820;34:05,620;"like Montana went to the Chiefs yeah Steve younger he started it with Tampa"
34:05,620;34:08,820;"I wanted to say he went to the hospital, but that would be"
34:08,820;34:16,660;"Yikes"
34:16,660;34:25,500;"Yeah, I think that just just touching on Drew blood so again he"
34:25,500;34:32,660;"I was surprised at how mobile he was because in the few couple of games that I watch of the 2000 season and then this game"
34:33,260;34:37,560;"He was not afraid to take off which was surprising because he was like six eight"
34:37,560;34:42,280;"180 pounds like it was not a massive dude. He just kind of tall gangly guy"
34:42,280;34:47,460;"But he was not afraid to like take off and try to lower the boom on people which you know"
34:47,460;34:51,820;"Let's see how that comes back to bite him. Well, that was the other thing though"
34:51,820;34:56,080;"It's like throughout the game and I think throughout the 2000 season from what I saw"
34:56,080;35:01,060;"Every announcer pointed out man. I don't know if the coach likes him doing this. Oh man"
35:01,060;35:07,200;"I don't know how long you gonna stay in there. So I mean obviously foreshadowing but it happened every game"
35:07,200;35:10,580;"which I mean you can say it's a lines fault but"
35:10,580;35:15,140;"Bletzel, I don't know man like he held the ball on"
35:15,140;35:22,420;"Hold on for a little too long. He I mean those rollouts didn't help the across the body across the field"
35:22,420;35:27,860;"I mean so I don't know if it's his fault or the old lines fault or they didn't have receivers or what but it was"
35:27,860;35:29,960;"awful to watch"
35:29,960;35:37,000;"Yeah, it felt like at least early in the 2000 season that I watched a lot of it was the O-lines fault"
35:37,000;35:38,760;"but I think"
35:38,760;35:41,600;"There's equal blame to go around because he would like"
35:41,600;35:48,440;"Double clutch or even triple clutched on some players if his first guy was no open it took him a while to go through his progressions and"
35:48,440;35:54,080;"Because the roll line wasn't stellar. I think led to a lot of sacks"
35:54,080;35:59,560;"But it wasn't just their fault either right he kind of"
35:59,560;36:05,780;"of, seem like there's always one of those plays where he's falling down and he's just"
36:05,780;36:10,380;"kind of hucking the ball up without looking at where it's going and you just kind of pray"
36:10,380;36:13,360;"that it's not an interception because everyone's in a while it would be."
36:13,360;36:16,600;"Wow. I hope you guys watch this game all the way through because right at the end there's"
36:16,600;36:22,560;"a guy wearing a gigantic furry bengals head like a cat head."
36:22,560;36:28,720;"I miss that one. I watched all that too but I don't remember seeing that. Oh yeah. I think"
36:28,720;36:31,720;"Towards the end of the fourth quarter I was kind of hoping this game would just end"
36:31,720;36:39,760;"Yeah, I kind of felt like that. I mean they made it competitive at the end somehow I have no idea how but"
36:39,760;36:42,960;"It was a pretty pretty rough one"
36:42,960;36:45,720;"I mean I'm looking at you know from the Bengals perspective"
36:45,720;36:49,320;"You have Corey Dylan who's just like a monster and it was like great to see that"
36:49,320;36:52,800;"I don't know why they didn't need more but that's a thing. Yeah"
36:52,800;36:57,000;"You look at like our running backs. I'm looking at it like"
36:57,920;37:03,240;"Redman Antoine Smith and Kevin Faulk and Kevin I think Antoine Smith or maybe Kevin five"
37:03,240;37:08,680;"I don't remember one of those was the top pressure with 33 yards. So I mean pretty awful all around"
37:08,680;37:15,600;"I'd say I I was surprised how much they were trying to get their full-back mark Edwards involved"
37:15,600;37:17,800;"Like yeah, like"
37:17,800;37:20,360;"Throwing screens to them"
37:20,360;37:22,440;"That's my worst"
37:22,440;37:27,120;"The second half first drive was three plays calling Mark Edwards number."
37:27,120;37:30,840;"First down and it's like, oh, well, that didn't work."
37:30,840;37:31,440;"Duh."
37:31,440;37:32,920;"That's shocking."
37:32,920;37:34,800;"I love that guy."
37:34,800;37:39,320;"You use, uh, I mean, yeah, he's basically Devlin now, I think."
37:39,320;37:41,840;"Maybe you touched them all a little bit more, but same guy."
37:41,840;37:42,040;"Yeah."
37:42,040;37:48,920;"I think he's Devlin, but without the, um, town around him on offense to, um,"
37:48,920;37:50,200;"to take away his touches."
37:50,200;37:51,920;"Oh, yeah."
37:51,960;37:52,460;"Okay."
37:52,460;37:53,460;"That makes sense."
37:53,460;37:55,560;"All right, guys, I got a roll soon."
37:55,560;37:56,360;"All right."
37:56,360;37:58,300;"Hey, wait, we still have so much to do."
37:58,300;37:59,060;"Hold on a second."
37:59,060;37:59,560;"Yeah."
37:59,560;38:02,960;"We asked him to stack two cells then."
38:02,960;38:04,580;"You guys can talk to yourselves because you guys"
38:04,580;38:06,000;"are doing a great job of that."
38:06,000;38:07,160;"That's why I just give me--"
38:07,160;38:09,040;"Steve, just give me your best and worst."
38:09,040;38:11,560;"And I'll cut it in where it needs to go."
38:11,560;38:15,520;"Well, you heard my worst of starting the second half"
38:15,520;38:16,920;"and just dishing the ball tomorrow."
38:16,920;38:19,080;"OK, where it's over and over again."
38:19,080;38:21,320;"Yeah, that was a surprising play call."
38:21,320;38:23,800;"But what are you going to do?"
38:23,800;38:24,360;"I guess."
38:24,360;38:25,840;"I'm liable."
38:25,840;38:26,400;"Yeah."
38:26,400;38:28,760;"What was your best?"
38:28,760;38:30,800;"Actually, honestly, watching Corey Dillon"
38:30,800;38:32,520;"and just getting a sneak preview of what he's going to do"
38:32,520;38:33,720;"in the Patriots."
38:33,720;38:34,240;"That's true."
38:34,240;38:34,680;"Yeah."
38:34,680;38:35,160;"Yeah."
38:35,160;38:39,280;"I mean, he looked apart that he could--"
38:39,280;38:41,120;"he was fast and he was strong."
38:41,120;38:41,640;"And he don't--"
38:41,640;38:43,080;"He's fast, or a big guy."
38:43,080;38:43,920;"Yeah."
38:43,920;38:45,880;"Yeah."
38:45,880;38:49,040;"All right, cool."
38:49,040;38:49,440;"All right."
38:49,440;38:50,680;"Come on, it means good night."
38:50,680;38:51,520;"All right."
38:51,520;38:52,340;"Take it."
38:52,340;38:53,000;"But yeah."
38:53,000;38:56,880;"All right."
38:56,880;38:59,240;"Well, now he's gone."
38:59,240;39:01,280;"No, real real podcast."
39:01,280;39:01,960;"Oh, boy."
39:01,960;39:04,400;"That was awkward."
39:04,400;39:06,040;"And I thought he was."
39:06,040;39:07,280;"I thought he was gone too."
39:07,280;39:09,560;"And I was going to see some nasty stuff."
39:09,560;39:10,640;"No, I didn't hear the beat."
39:10,640;39:11,160;"I got it."
39:11,160;39:12,640;"Didn't."
39:12,640;39:12,840;"All right."
39:12,840;39:13,340;"Now."
39:13,340;39:17,560;"All right."
39:17,560;39:19,680;"Now he's actually gone."
39:19,680;39:21,000;"Are you lying or?"
39:21,000;39:25,920;"No, I just saw his name drop off the participants list."
39:25,920;39:28,320;"You can check out the participants list."
39:28,320;39:29,880;"Oh, yeah."
39:29,880;39:33,040;"But yeah, I can't believe we didn't even touch on like the kicking game."
39:33,040;39:34,880;"And that was like the highlight of this whole thing."
39:34,880;39:37,360;"You have the really?"
39:37,360;39:39,240;"Yeah, you have."
39:39,240;39:40,800;"Venetary, right?"
39:40,800;39:41,160;"Yeah."
39:41,160;39:45,480;"I mean, money and snow already at that point, building a name for himself."
39:45,480;39:46,880;"The opposite."
39:46,880;39:49,200;"You have Neil Rackers, which."
39:49,200;39:55,280;"I mean, the year before he went, I can't believe they kept him, but he went 12 for 21."
39:55,280;39:58,040;"Oh, that's rough."
39:58,040;40:00,800;"That's like the opposite end of the spectrum there."
40:00,800;40:02,520;"Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
40:02,520;40:07,480;"And then we have like the greatest punter of all time on our team."
40:07,480;40:11,920;"Apparently, you really realize how nasty this guy was."
40:11,920;40:17,960;"I it felt like the way they were talking about him, it didn't feel like he was the best"
40:17,960;40:18,800;"punter of all time."
40:18,800;40:24,800;"it felt like he was the punter who had lasted along us on the worst teams."
40:24,800;40:25,280;"Yeah."
40:25,280;40:25,760;"Yeah."
40:25,760;40:28,520;"It felt like the Vinny Testa Verde type of."
40:28,520;40:28,720;"Yeah."
40:28,720;40:32,840;"Cause they, cause one of these things, like I did the math and Lee Johnson has"
40:32,840;40:35,280;"a over 28 miles of punting yards."
40:35,280;40:36,720;"Yeah."
40:36,720;40:38,160;"It's insane."
40:38,160;40:42,320;"And I mean, one of the highlights of the game was at 76 yard punt."
40:42,320;40:43,280;"Yes."
40:43,280;40:43,560;"Yeah."
40:43,560;40:46,120;"I had there in two in the four quarters."
40:47,080;40:50,400;"If that was like the Patriots team today, that shit would have been down to"
40:50,400;40:51,120;"Apple one."
40:51,120;40:54,280;"So we're actually, I mean, it would be a 76 yard punt."
40:54,280;40:55,320;"Like for real."
40:55,320;40:56,400;"Yeah."
40:56,400;40:56,840;"Oh, yeah."
40:56,840;41:02,080;"But it was like, I was surprised at how quickly they were jumping on those."
41:02,080;41:04,920;"Like as soon as the ball hit the ground, all those like jumped on and didn't"
41:04,920;41:07,160;"like let it bounce and see where it would end up."
41:07,160;41:09,840;"It was very unpaid."
41:09,840;41:10,640;"Like it felt like."
41:10,640;41:11,160;"Yeah."
41:11,160;41:16,320;"I mean, it was kind of a right sloppy execution, but I mean, yeah, I do"
41:16,320;41:17,320;"It was cool."
41:17,320;41:22,320;"You know, it's a shame that the punter is one of my highlights."
41:22,320;41:28,320;"But hey, yeah, so far the punter and the highlights."
41:28,320;41:34,320;"Well, hey, those are the building blocks of Bellatex teams."
41:34,320;41:37,040;"Yeah, I mean, you're not wrong."
41:37,040;41:41,320;"I think Troy Brown was also a highlight if we're going to talk about highlights."
41:41,320;41:46,240;"Yeah, if you want to be real about it, then I mean, if we're doing the play, you know,"
41:46,240;41:48,440;"player of the game here, he's obviously the one."
41:48,440;41:51,080;"You know, what do you have?"
41:51,080;41:53,920;"100, 170 yards or something like that in the touchdown?"
41:53,920;41:56,600;"I'm like, yeah, yeah, that touchdown in the second quarter."
41:56,600;42:01,680;"And just felt like he was the only guy who was doing any sort of like big"
42:01,680;42:02,800;"plays on offense."
42:02,800;42:04,240;"Like they didn't have any real big players."
42:04,240;42:06,600;"They had one past the tight end."
42:06,600;42:10,600;"I think that was probably the longest technical play."
42:10,600;42:12,360;"I think it was the Jermaine Wiggins maybe."
42:12,360;42:16,080;"Um, but it was Troy Brown, who was the only one getting open."
42:16,080;42:20,720;"like every time they needed something, like in the fourth quarter where they were like"
42:20,720;42:26,440;"stuck in their own territory, like on the touchdown drive, um, the last drive they were"
42:26,440;42:30,720;"on there, like they're inside their own 10. And it was third and third and long and,"
42:30,720;42:36,920;"um, somehow blood so fitted through two defenders to a falling over Troy Brown. So like, you"
42:36,920;42:41,880;"know, that's, that's what I remember. Like I didn't actually remember anything from this"
42:41,880;42:46,280;"game, but that play I think was the most familiar out of all of it."
42:46,280;42:52,040;"Yeah, it was interesting. Same for me. I was wondering as we kind of look back at"
42:52,040;42:57,600;"these games, how much I would actually remember this one didn't really stick with me."
42:57,600;43:00,360;"No, I had no memory of this game whatsoever."
43:00,360;43:06,000;"And I thought I remember the storylines around it, you know, but I remember like"
43:06,000;43:09,080;"the buying cocks signing, which I was pretty into Roman Pfeiffer."
43:09,640;43:15,880;"But, and there was also interesting speaking to those guys, I mean, part of the issue,"
43:15,880;43:20,040;"I think with the defense was they were saying, and I looked into a couple other things like"
43:20,040;43:25,720;"Richard Seymour was out, you know, Ted Johnson was, was out."
43:25,720;43:30,120;"He was dealing with an injury, which kind of reminded me a little bit of the Gronk injury"
43:30,120;43:32,320;"on that like field goal that like shattered his arm."
43:32,320;43:35,400;"But yeah, because he was, it was in preseason."
43:35,400;43:37,160;"He was on like, punt duty or something like that."
43:37,160;43:37,800;"Yep."
43:38,360;43:42,840;"and got some sort of hip injury, or I can't remember exactly what they said."
43:42,840;43:43,760;"It was some leg injury."
43:43,760;43:44,800;"Yeah."
43:44,800;43:48,480;"And then because the papers were all up in arms about like, Oh, well, this is why"
43:48,480;43:53,320;"you don't have your starters playing punt on in the preseason."
43:53,320;43:55,920;"I thought, well, that's, that's who Belichick is."
43:55,920;43:56,680;"They just don't know this."
43:56,680;43:57,360;"Yeah."
43:57,360;43:58,120;"Right."
43:58,120;44:03,120;"I mean, I mean, he, there was never a departure from that, but it was also"
44:03,120;44:07,320;"interesting because I don't know if you saw the, the stuff that just came out"
44:07,320;44:10,220;"with Tijansen about talking about Belichick and their relationship."
44:10,220;44:15,220;"But I guess they had a rocky relationship for pretty much the entire,"
44:15,220;44:21,320;"the maybe first three years that you, you work with like a Belichick."
44:21,320;44:26,120;"And then Belichick sort of went up to him and kind of was accountable for the way"
44:26,120;44:27,420;"he was treating him or whatever."
44:27,420;44:33,120;"Maybe it stemmed from this, but they sort of made amends and then things"
44:33,120;44:34,920;"were solid from that point on."
44:35,520;44:39,080;"- Yeah, 'cause I remember when Ted Johnson retired"
44:39,080;44:43,840;"or shortly afterwards, there was a lot of talk about him"
44:43,840;44:46,160;"talking about how the pages kind of took advantage of him"
44:46,160;44:48,480;"'cause he was the runstufferin."
44:48,480;44:51,120;"He was a guy that was always like the one the clock has"
44:51,120;44:55,520;"and he felt like they hadn't really protected him very well"
44:55,520;44:58,080;"from like head injuries and things like that, I think."
44:58,080;44:59,800;"So I remember that coming out when it,"
44:59,800;45:02,160;"like when he first retired and that was like kind of"
45:02,160;45:04,760;"some of the reasoning why he did it, why he retired."
45:04,760;45:06,360;"Yeah. It's kind of, yeah."
45:06,360;45:12,120;"But yeah, so he just came out and was kind of talking about sort of"
45:12,120;45:18,200;"Belichick's personality and demeanor, how he treats his players, but then like how he gets them back. So, like the,"
45:18,200;45:24,800;"I mean, it's also, I mean, this is for another another day, but he is also talking about how the buttler thing,"
45:24,800;45:30,880;"how he was benching the Super Bowl. And obviously it was serious. And then Belichick reached out to him afterwards and kind of made a men."
45:30,880;45:36,100;"And so Ted Johnson's point was that it might have been a tactic on Bellagex part to treat"
45:36,100;45:40,300;"people the way that he does and kind of play the puppets here, but for another day."
45:40,300;45:41,300;"Yeah."
45:41,300;45:45,660;"I mean, you can kind of see that being his MO, whether it is or isn't."
45:45,660;45:51,740;"But yeah, you see that kind of that mystique around himself, I think."
45:51,740;45:52,740;"Yeah."
45:52,740;45:53,740;"And it works."
45:53,740;45:59,580;"You know, if you're looking for results, I mean, can't argue, but exactly."
45:59,580;46:01,680;"And then yeah, and then I just had a good."
46:01,680;46:06,060;"I was just going to say, I think the reason that Corey Dillon had such a good"
46:06,060;46:09,540;"game was because it was no Ted Johnson or Richard Seymour because he rushed for"
46:09,540;46:12,480;"like 140 yards in this game, something along those lines."
46:12,480;46:18,780;"I think the team ran for like 140, but I think 157 actually."
46:18,780;46:21,620;"Corey Dilla, I know he had over a hundred."
46:21,620;46:22,500;"He did."
46:22,500;46:23,660;"Yeah."
46:23,660;46:28,140;"Oh yeah, it was 104, but yeah, that has a team that ran for like a buck 50."
46:29,220;46:32,920;"And I think part of it was just that it was hot as balls,"
46:32,920;46:35,720;"apparently, and you could just see the offense start to,"
46:35,720;46:39,520;"but the defense start to kind of lose their steam slowly"
46:39,520;46:41,840;"every drive because the offense in the third quarter"
46:41,840;46:42,680;"couldn't stay on the field."
46:42,680;46:46,840;"But I think not having those two players,"
46:46,840;46:50,440;"those two like run defense specialists on the field"
46:50,440;46:52,320;"didn't help either."
46:52,320;46:56,360;"Yeah, and then also the, they were saying that Willie"
46:56,360;47:01,960;"the Guinness just what he was sort of trying to get back from back surgery and then Taiwan"
47:01,960;47:05,000;"had to put in your degree. So there's a lot of stuff going on."
47:05,000;47:12,520;"Yeah, they were down to like the skeleton crew by the end of it. And I think I don't think this"
47:12,520;47:19,160;"game should have been this close. Because I mean, it ended 23 17. The patients were still kind of"
47:19,160;47:26,840;"in it, but I think it was only because for some reason, the Bengals offensive play calling"
47:26,840;47:33,060;"decided to keep throwing the ball for no reason and making all sorts of weird, strange decisions."
47:33,060;47:39,120;"They didn't run a play action pass until two minutes left in the first half when they"
47:39,120;47:43,880;"were gashing the Patriots on the run game."
47:43,880;47:49,680;"like they just decided not to try a play action, which would have been the most obvious answer, I thought."
47:49,680;47:56,560;"But they also decided to punt from the Patriots 35, which is a star."
47:56,560;47:57,440;"Yeah."
47:57,440;47:58,720;"But hey, that was a hell of a punt."
47:58,720;48:02,360;"Hey, it better be because he's punted like 20 yards."
48:02,360;48:05,720;"I mean, you need to land."
48:05,720;48:09,440;"Yeah, I mean, I got it inside the 10, but I mean, it's not like they put it on the one."
48:10,480;48:13,840;"I think that set up the Patriots scoring drive, didn't it?"
48:13,840;48:17,320;"Because that was when they were pinned deep and then managed to drive the"
48:17,320;48:18,200;"length of the score."
48:18,200;48:20,480;"That's that to keep it because they were up to 13."
48:20,480;48:23,160;"And then the Patriots scored and kept it close."
48:23,160;48:29,120;"Right. Yeah. And I mean, if we're talking about how they were running things,"
48:29,120;48:33,080;"the, the maddening thing watching this game was that, you know, they're,"
48:33,080;48:36,880;"they're running a basically a four minute drill at the end of the half, the, the"
48:36,880;48:40,240;"paths are. And I mean, it basically looks like there's like a"
48:40,240;48:42,920;"minute and a half left on the clock. I mean, there is no"
48:42,920;48:47,360;"awareness. People are freaking out there. They're hurrying. So"
48:47,360;48:50,880;"it's it's so different from what's a Brady run, often run at"
48:50,880;48:56,240;"a time. And then it ends with a sack, but it takes a sack and"
48:56,240;48:58,920;"then the next place is the way of game. So they got pushed out a"
48:58,920;49:01,600;"field will range of enters a disaster. And then at the end of"
49:01,600;49:11,920;"game. The two minute drill again was a disaster. I mean, it ended horribly. And I think that"
49:11,920;49:16,800;"this is a pattern in sort of that era, the Blutso era of fortune."
49:16,800;49:23,600;"Yeah, you can kind of feel why when Bray took over, Bell check was so comfortable with it,"
49:23,600;49:29,200;"because it felt like a lot of these games, even in the 2000 season, the"
49:30,800;49:33,040;"Patrets kind of played to keep it close at the end."
49:33,040;49:37,840;"And then they kind of set the offense up to have that one last drive"
49:37,840;49:43,680;"to win it. And it just didn't ever really happen because it felt like Bledsoe couldn't"
49:43,680;49:50,080;"run that two-minute offense. It seemed like there was a lot of people"
49:50,080;49:57,040;"creating other reasons why it wasn't Bledsoe. But at the end of the day, he was kind of"
49:58,640;50:02,760;"the one that was always there in the middle of it, not working."
50:02,760;50:03,800;"Right."
50:03,800;50:09,200;"But and then as soon as Brady comes in, he wasn't playing out of his"
50:09,200;50:13,040;"minds the rest of the game, but he was just managing to find a way at"
50:13,040;50:16,080;"the end of these games to finish them and get the win."
50:16,080;50:18,360;"Yeah, I think composure."
50:18,360;50:21,360;"I mean, the, the announcements we're talking about how Blutso is always cool"
50:21,360;50:22,320;"one of those moments."
50:22,320;50:25,280;"And for me, I think that was a big difference."
50:25,320;50:33,580;"like you're alluding to is that it was just a different demeanor where I think you'd just panic to be honest."
50:33,580;50:40,560;"But yeah, it felt to me more like this might be too strong or whatever."
50:40,560;50:43,160;"It felt more like a defeatist attitude."
50:43,160;50:45,040;"We are again."
50:45,040;50:46,800;"We have to bring this team back."
50:46,800;50:47,840;"I put it on my shoulders."
50:47,840;50:49,560;"Let's give this a shot."
50:49,560;50:50,360;"See what happens."
50:50,360;50:55,040;"It wasn't like it didn't feel like the fire you would see, especially in Brady's early years."
50:55,040;50:57,760;"Oh, yeah, you're right."
50:57,760;51:00,920;"Telling out the play of the lie, like screaming at people to get in the right position sort"
51:00,920;51:03,160;"of thing, you know?"
51:03,160;51:05,760;"I quite gave a shit."
51:05,760;51:06,760;"Yeah."
51:06,760;51:07,760;"So I agree."
51:07,760;51:09,760;"Well, I mean, that's tough to say."
51:09,760;51:10,760;"It is."
51:10,760;51:11,760;"Yeah."
51:11,760;51:15,940;"And I think with blood so being where he was in his career too and how much punishment"
51:15,940;51:23,720;"he had taken, I don't really hold it against him in any way because I mean, I never played"
51:23,720;51:28,200;"any professional sports, but you know, playing men's open soccer on a Thursday night."
51:28,200;51:32,040;"If you're on a shitty team, you kind of, you know what you're getting yourself into."
51:32,040;51:37,520;"Even if you're the best player on that team, you kind of, it wears on you, just not being"
51:37,520;51:40,560;"on good teams for a while."
51:40,560;51:48,240;"So I can understand why he would feel that way, but it wasn't successful for any of them."
51:48,240;51:52,680;"I definitely played a lot of pickup flag football and I was consistently one of the better players"
51:52,680;51:56,500;"on the team. So we have a sort of similar."
51:56,500;52:00,820;"Quite, I guess he could say, but that's what I mean."
52:00,820;52:03,900;"Oh, okay. I was gonna say, because I like that you were you were"
52:03,900;52:05,980;"alluding to me actually being the better player on my soccer team."
52:05,980;52:07,380;"Cause I definitely was not."
52:07,380;52:09,780;"I don't know about that."
52:09,780;52:15,900;"Yeah. I mean, I always thought that you were going to take the MLS route, but"
52:15,900;52:17,420;"you know, you're proving me wrong."
52:17,420;52:19,980;"Yeah, we used to the podcast route instead."
52:19,980;52:21,780;"Much more lucrative."
52:21,780;52:25,380;"That's right. You want to do best moments here?"
52:25,380;52:33,860;"Yeah, before we do, I just wanted to touch on that last drive because I thought the replacement"
52:33,860;52:38,340;"refs kind of reared their head there because that last drive, even though I don't think"
52:38,340;52:43,940;"the pages would have won it, it was still some bullshit calls because it was the one early."
52:43,940;52:49,220;"I was saying it was like first to second down where a free Russia came in on blood,"
52:49,220;52:53,040;"And he kind of shrugged him off and made the throat of to Troy Brown"
52:53,040;52:59,840;"But they called him in the grasp like immediately. Yep. And so they gave him the sack and and brought away back"
52:59,840;53:04,200;"So it was instead of it being like second and five. It was second in like 18"
53:04,200;53:06,760;"Was it like kind of on the way down?"
53:06,760;53:10,240;"So it kind of looked like it but I mean he still got off"
53:10,240;53:13,300;"Yeah, but it like it's not something you would have blown dead"
53:13,300;53:18,380;"You were just waiting to see how the play ended sort of thing. There's like a real quick trigger finger on that whistle"
53:18,380;53:26,180;"And then the next player was probably a sack because this is Drew"
53:26,180;53:29,740;"blood. So in the two minute trail. But so it was a third and like real long"
53:29,740;53:34,880;"third and 18 or something like that. And blood. So actually made the the"
53:34,880;53:42,020;"past to I don't know why to see if it was I don't think it was Patton. I want to"
53:42,020;53:47,660;"say it was probably bird Emmanuel. But he went down to made it made a diving"
53:47,660;53:55,420;"catch. Yep. Like it didn't look like, like it may not have been a catch, but it wasn't"
53:55,420;53:58,900;"anything that you could overturn with replay and replay, I think was still pretty new in"
53:58,900;54:04,100;"these days. But they overturned that and called it and completed even those no like definitive"
54:04,100;54:10,180;"evidence. So now it's like fourth and 18 from your own 20 yard line. And they decide to"
54:10,180;54:14,620;"like going back to what you said, roll bloods out to his left as a right handed quarterback."
54:14,620;54:22,100;"then he, all the time, the purpose took a sack on the sideline throwing it, like, like,"
54:22,100;54:26,340;"just kind of shoveling it to whoever off in the line was in the vicinity."
54:26,340;54:27,780;"So it wasn't an official sack."
54:27,780;54:29,460;"Yeah."
54:29,460;54:34,820;"I mean, it's kind of sad because, you know, we didn't really get to see too much more of"
54:34,820;54:36,140;"him moving forward."
54:36,140;54:41,220;"So that's sort of one of his last big plays."
54:41,220;54:43,380;"And it is what it is."
54:43,420;54:48,020;"I mean, fortunately, I don't think anybody really remembers the specifics, but looking"
54:48,020;54:50,320;"back, it hurts a little bit."
54:50,320;54:51,280;"Yeah."
54:51,280;54:55,400;"Like I said, I didn't remember any of this game, but a lot of it kind of felt familiar"
54:55,400;55:03,580;"and that kind of the the abject failure at the end of these games."
55:03,580;55:05,820;"It's like, Oh, yeah, no, this, I remember this."
55:05,820;55:09,340;"I remember when this just used to be the norm where, you know, they'd be closed,"
55:09,340;55:12,940;"but they could never quite close the door because, you know, they get a penalty"
55:12,940;55:17,140;"that would go against them and then they would just kind of fall apart from there."
55:17,140;55:20,540;"Or you know, a play wouldn't go their way early in that last drive and they just like"
55:20,540;55:23,620;"couldn't, couldn't make up for it, you know."
55:23,620;55:24,620;"Yep."
55:24,620;55:25,620;"Right."
55:25,620;55:27,820;"Now, you know Brady gets sacked and it's third and 17 is like, oh well, he'll, he'll find"
55:27,820;55:34,620;"Amen Dolo over the middle against the, the Jaguars for 23 yards in a playoff game because"
55:34,620;55:38,820;"that, that's just like, they just rebound and you kind of expect it now most from these,"
55:38,820;55:40,140;"these Patriots teams these days."
55:40,140;55:43,200;"is back then, like, the expectation was exactly the opposite."
55:43,200;55:49,820;"Yeah, I mean, I think that's the epitome of the entire"
55:49,820;55:53,700;"Bledzo era minus the Super Bowl."
55:53,700;55:54,720;"Yeah."
55:54,720;55:59,340;"And I think the Super Bowl was kind of almost not wanting to believe that it was"
55:59,340;56:01,660;"happening because this never happens to us as well."
56:01,660;56:03,100;"Yeah."
56:03,100;56:04,700;"I mean, that was the perfect storm anyway."
56:04,700;56:08,180;"I mean, the team around them was something else, but"
56:08,700;56:09,700;"Yeah."
56:09,700;56:16,060;"Clearly putting it on his shoulders like we've mentioned at Nazin at this point and I feel"
56:16,060;56:24,780;"like we're not trying to bash a Dribledzo here but just watching some of his highlights"
56:24,780;56:26,580;"brings that some painful memory."
56:26,580;56:30,540;"Yeah, I think just especially because this was kind of later on in his career too."
56:30,540;56:35,220;"So late career Dribledzo, I think he'd just been beaten down at this point because I"
56:35,220;56:37,700;"I mean, he was setting records before that."
56:37,700;56:40,620;"Like in his prime, he was a top quarter."
56:40,620;56:44,220;"I had great fond memories of some of those games"
56:44,220;56:49,100;"when he's throwing 70 attempts to come back from 24 down"
56:49,100;56:51,420;"or whatever it was against the Vikings."
56:51,420;56:54,180;"Like games like that that I still stick out, but."
56:54,180;56:58,620;"2001, it wasn't for him."
56:58,620;57:03,340;"- Yeah, he had seen better days."
57:03,340;57:06,380;"I mean, he played a part in 2001, we get to that later, but."
57:06,380;57:07,380;"Yeah."
57:07,380;57:08,380;"Yeah."
57:08,380;57:09,380;"Very true."
57:09,380;57:11,380;"Yeah, almost in fairytale fashion."
57:11,380;57:14,500;"But yeah, like I said, we'll get to that when we get there."
57:14,500;57:16,420;"So yeah, let's do our best and worst."
57:16,420;57:17,420;"You want to go first?"
57:17,420;57:18,420;"Yeah."
57:18,420;57:23,180;"I mean, if we're doing, I don't know if we're doing the three best moments or the three"
57:23,180;57:24,180;"worst."
57:24,180;57:28,300;"I mean, I think we kind of talked about these ad nauseums."
57:28,300;57:30,220;"I just want to pick one of each, I think."
57:30,220;57:33,300;"That's all I have left in my list that we haven't talked about."
57:33,300;57:35,780;"All right, I mean, all right, fine."
57:35,780;57:39,420;"The best moment was in a fumble."
57:39,420;57:45,460;"It was probably one of the best fumbles I've seen outside"
57:45,460;57:47,660;"of the front fumble where, I mean,"
57:47,660;57:50,300;"he basically fumbled with nobody touching it."
57:50,300;57:53,180;"He just lost sight of the ball."
57:53,180;57:55,020;"I don't know what happened."
57:55,020;57:57,820;"- It looked like he was trying to find the laces"
57:57,820;57:59,460;"and then couldn't, so he decided to throw it anyway."
57:59,460;58:00,460;"And just like,"
58:00,460;58:02,180;"- Okay, yeah."
58:02,180;58:04,160;"He just like squeezed out of his hand."
58:04,160;58:06,320;"He just really needed the laces for that."
58:06,320;58:08,300;"- Yeah, and it goes flying backwards."
58:08,300;58:11,500;"And it's amazing because then like you see Bruce,"
58:11,500;58:13,480;"just like flying over people trying to get to him."
58:13,480;58:17,040;"So it was kind of a fun visual to kind of see the ball"
58:17,040;58:18,620;"just fly to this guy's hand and then Bruce"
58:18,620;58:20,300;"he comes into the screen."
58:20,300;58:23,420;"So that was probably..."
58:23,420;58:24,940;"- That was actually gonna be my best"
58:24,940;58:28,740;"was seeing Bruce, he doing his run full tilt"
58:28,740;58:30,260;"at the blocker and just jump over him,"
58:30,260;58:32,180;"that flip into the quarterback?"
58:32,180;58:34,060;"- Yep."
58:34,060;58:36,420;"- That was kind of like his signature thing,"
58:36,420;58:38,580;"was just running at the guy and just jumping over him"
58:38,580;58:40,260;"or trying to and always getting clipped on the legs"
58:40,260;58:43,540;"and always like ending up tackling the quarterback"
58:43,540;58:47,460;"with his ass cheeks or the back of his legs sort of thing."
58:47,460;58:48,900;"- Yep, yep."
58:48,900;58:53,380;"And then an honorable mention from me will be Bledto"
58:53,380;58:56,140;"scrambling to the right, diving for first down,"
58:56,140;58:57,940;"helicopters and-"
58:57,940;58:58,780;"- Yes."
58:58,780;59:04,780;"That was pretty awesome. I mean he scrambled all over the place like you mentioned, but that was that was an awesome play"
59:04,780;59:10,640;"Yeah, because he had that one and he also had he tried the the cue the quarterback sneak on fourth and two"
59:10,640;59:15,740;"Oh, yeah, yeah, which was a ballsy gutsy call and I don't think"
59:15,740;59:19,980;"It was something Belichick was too fond of like he was saying"
59:19,980;59:25,820;"I think it may have been thinking outside the box, but he got a yard and three quarters, which definitely didn't help"
59:25,820;59:26,660;"- Right."
59:26,660;59:31,880;"- And then worse moments, I would say,"
59:31,880;59:36,880;"the 64 yard return that they had after the Patriots"
59:36,880;59:40,980;"first touchdown was sort of back-breaking, I feel like."
59:40,980;59:43,660;"- I was surprised at how,"
59:43,660;59:48,060;"on Patriot, like the special teams looked,"
59:48,060;59:50,940;"like they didn't be very crisp on any of the execution"
59:50,940;59:51,780;"anywhere."
59:51,780;59:53,340;"- Yeah, that was rough,"
59:53,340;59:56,420;"'cause I mean, you light out the gate,"
59:56,420;59:57,740;"you're scoring a touchdown,"
59:57,740;01:00:01,100;"you're the lowly patriot, so it's this boost,"
01:00:01,100;01:00:05,460;"and then literally, next play, it's sort of shattered."
01:00:05,460;01:00:07,460;"- Yeah, no, you're absolutely right, it did."
01:00:07,460;01:00:11,980;"- And then I'll throw out an honorable mention"
01:00:11,980;01:00:13,660;"for this as well."
01:00:13,660;01:00:15,820;"It's more of a cringe-worthy thing,"
01:00:15,820;01:00:18,060;"but I don't know if you heard the announcer go like,"
01:00:18,060;01:00:21,100;"""Oh, Greg Robinson, Orlando, what kind of a guy"
01:00:21,100;01:00:26,060;"two names and then the other announcer goes, ""Oh, he took on his dad's"
01:00:26,060;01:00:29,180;"every past."" I'm like, ""Oh, that is well."""
01:00:29,180;01:00:36,300;"You could just, you could feel the silence after that too, yeah."
01:00:36,300;01:00:39,580;"That was pretty awesome."
01:00:39,580;01:00:43,820;"Brutally, I think that was, like, that was a brand-owned special that was."
01:00:43,820;01:00:45,580;"Okay, yeah."
01:00:45,580;01:00:50,780;"Two names, and Gus Johnson was like, ""Well, actually, he took his dad's name because his dad passed"
01:00:50,780;01:00:53,360;"and like, oh boy."
01:00:53,360;01:00:57,160;"- I mean, that's some comedy right there."
01:00:57,160;01:00:58,740;"- Yeah, that was classic."
01:00:58,740;01:01:01,820;"All right, so add to that,"
01:01:01,820;01:01:03,420;"I'll give you some honorable mentions too,"
01:01:03,420;01:01:05,060;"some things that we didn't touch on yet."
01:01:05,060;01:01:08,860;"I liked how excited the commentating team was"
01:01:08,860;01:01:12,020;"about what they called the shadow box."
01:01:12,020;01:01:13,180;"- Oh, which was okay, yes."
01:01:13,180;01:01:15,220;"- Scores from around the league."
01:01:15,220;01:01:16,300;"- Yes, it's brand new things."
01:01:16,300;01:01:17,940;"Like you might notice in the top corner"
01:01:17,940;01:01:19,540;"we have what we're calling the shadow box."
01:01:19,540;01:01:22,540;"is going to show you updated scores around the league as they happen."
01:01:22,540;01:01:24,700;"Well, yeah, I mean,"
01:01:24,700;01:01:27,940;"did they have the score on the screen at the same time?"
01:01:27,940;01:01:31,780;"Cause I don't remember ever seeing the score, but I was seeing the other game"
01:01:31,780;01:01:32,780;"scores."
01:01:32,780;01:01:36,900;"No, they did have the score in the, the top left hand corner, but it was,"
01:01:36,900;01:01:38,860;"but it was constantly super hard to read."
01:01:38,860;01:01:40,820;"Oh, okay."
01:01:40,820;01:01:43,340;"But yeah, but then the"
01:01:43,340;01:01:47,380;"where they had what they were calling the shadow box, which is just like a gray"
01:01:47,380;01:01:48,700;"box with white scores in it."
01:01:48,700;01:01:57,700;"they were super excited to be announcing that week one. They were able to show scores of other games while this game was happening."
01:01:57,700;01:02:03,700;"Which I really thought they'd already been doing, but apparently not."
01:02:03,700;01:02:12,700;"And then the honorable mention for the worst was the upcoming schedule."
01:02:12,700;01:02:20,420;"Which I was not particularly funny, but they kept showing the paths playing the Panthers next week."
01:02:20,420;01:02:22,320;"Oh, right, right."
01:02:22,320;01:02:26,520;"Kept tripping me up and I was thinking, am I watching the wrong game here?"
01:02:26,520;01:02:27,620;"I had to go double check."
01:02:27,620;01:02:29,380;"I'm like, no, this is the right thing, those game."
01:02:29,380;01:02:31,180;"Why are they saying the Panthers were next week?"
01:02:31,180;01:02:38,180;"And then it finally clicked that between this game and the game schedule for next week was when 9/11 happened."
01:02:38,180;01:02:40,780;"So they canceled those games and pushed them to the end of the season."
01:02:41,660;01:02:46,140;"Yeah, so a little bit of a downer 10 this because why not right?"
01:02:46,140;01:02:47,300;"It gives everybody that's true."
01:02:47,300;01:02:48,900;"I mean, I can turn it around if you want."
01:02:48,900;01:02:50,220;"Yes, please."
01:02:50,220;01:02:56,420;"I could tell you that because of that, though, they played the jets and that's"
01:02:56,420;01:02:58,980;"the Maluis hit, which the bloods allowed."
01:02:58,980;01:03:04,460;"So it could be said that Tom Brady and the dynasty happened because of 9/11."
01:03:04,460;01:03:08,460;"Oh, wait, wait, it bring that up a notch."
01:03:08,460;01:03:09,540;"All right."
01:03:10,620;01:03:11,820;"I guess that's it guys."
01:03:11,820;01:03:16,660;"And on that note, we'll, uh, we'll be back."
01:03:16,660;01:03:24,020;"We'll react next time to talk about, uh, 2001 week two, which as we all know now is, uh,"
01:03:24,020;01:03:29,300;"not against the Carolina Panthers, but we'll be reverse the New York Jets in the game that"
01:03:29,300;01:03:29,900;"changed at all."
01:03:29,900;01:03:34,060;"So thanks for joining us and we will talk to you next time."
01:03:34,060;01:03:36,020;"Later."
01:03:36,020;01:03:37,060;"Whoa."
01:03:37,060;01:03:37,900;"Bye."

00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,640;"I am not your mother."
00:18,640;00:27,520;"Welcome back to the pages dicey podcast, the podcast where we're going back."
00:27,520;00:30,420;"My brother and I are rewatching every game of the pages"
00:30,420;00:34,060;"dice era, including this one, unfortunately."
00:34,060;00:36,520;"I'm your host, Danny Brown."
00:36,520;00:39,180;"With me are the aforementioned brothers."
00:39,180;00:40,260;"Steven, how are you?"
00:40,260;00:41,380;"Good."
00:41,380;00:43,540;"Do you ever get weird looks when you tell people about this"
00:43,540;00:44,700;"podcast and what you're doing?"
00:44,700;00:46,140;"You guys just don't tell them."
00:46,140;00:50,940;"Made it a secret podcast for you guys."
00:50,940;00:52,700;"You don't tell people in your lives that you do this."
00:52,700;00:53,740;"I tell some people."
00:53,740;00:54,820;"I only tell people they ask."
00:54,820;00:56,780;"Oh, I tell people."
00:57,180;00:58,440;"And I bet I know."
00:58,440;01:00,140;"It does."
01:00,140;01:01,600;"They got every game."
01:01,600;01:02,820;"And they got."
01:02,820;01:03,280;"Yeah."
01:03,280;01:04,720;"Do you watch the whole game?"
01:04,720;01:05,920;"Mostly."
01:05,920;01:08,400;"I did not watch all of this game, though."
01:08,400;01:11,460;"I watched until about 11 minutes left and then I turned it off."
01:11,460;01:12,260;"Yeah."
01:12,260;01:17,460;"Well, so I I have limited time these days and I was a little angry by the end of"
01:17,460;01:20,940;"watching this one that we actually decided to watch this whole fucking game and did this"
01:20,940;01:21,440;"episode."
01:21,440;01:23,640;"Boo hoo, Andy."
01:23,640;01:26,140;"They lose one game in like 35."
01:26,140;01:27,420;"- This is what I'm saying."
01:27,420;01:29,300;"I forgot how to do it."
01:29,300;01:32,620;"- Forgot how to watch ""Pager's Losses."""
01:32,620;01:33,460;"- The good game."
01:33,460;01:36,420;"- It wasn't until the end."
01:36,420;01:37,620;"- I did not watch it now."
01:37,620;01:40,580;"(laughing)"
01:40,580;01:43,220;"But there was a good highlight package,"
01:43,220;01:44,700;"like a good 13 minute highlight."
01:44,700;01:45,940;"- Well, the extended one, yeah, yeah."
01:45,940;01:48,460;"- Yeah, where you get a good flow of the game."
01:48,460;01:50,420;"- Yeah, all right, we'll link all those"
01:50,420;01:51,780;"'cause we've had people asking for them"
01:51,780;01:52,620;"where to watch these."
01:52,620;01:54,740;"So this, the game is on YouTube,"
01:54,740;01:57,260;"highlights on YouTube and the extended highlights also on YouTube."
01:57,260;01:59,980;"Well, let's put a watchability score on it right away."
01:59,980;02:01,460;"Well, it's a name game."
02:01,460;02:05,820;"This game legit, well, it's it wasn't named by the Patriots."
02:05,820;02:12,740;"No, but when you're a Miami franchise who hasn't won anything since the 1970s."
02:12,740;02:17,020;"Let's see if Steve can name it because he clearly likes his face."
02:17,020;02:18,180;"I can tell he doesn't understand."
02:18,180;02:19,580;"Game as a nickname."
02:19,980;02:25,140;"And it's the most douchey nickname you could ever name a game."
02:25,140;02:26,780;"That touchy feely game."
02:26,780;02:29,140;"Love it."
02:29,140;02:32,140;"No, AJ Fili is a quarterback."
02:32,140;02:34,260;"And that's so fucking sad for this defense."
02:34,260;02:37,020;"Well, I don't think it was the defense."
02:37,020;02:39,740;"It really did anything one day night football comeback game."
02:39,740;02:41,820;"That's not very douchey."
02:41,820;02:48,740;"That's just it was called the night that courage war orange, which for the record."
02:49,180;02:51,060;"courage, orange, don't rhyme."
02:51,060;02:52,180;"They don't."
02:52,180;02:55,580;"I think the joke is that orange doesn't rhyme with anything, right?"
02:55,580;02:55,580;"Yeah."
02:55,580;02:56,460;"Yeah."
02:56,460;02:57,660;"You're like a kid."
02:57,660;03:00,740;"Did an M&M rhyme with Dorhinge?"
03:00,740;03:03,060;"For your courageous."
03:03,060;03:06,100;"Some writer for the Bleacher report."
03:06,100;03:07,380;"Yeah."
03:07,380;03:08,980;"Oh, yeah, definitely a definite dolphin."
03:08,980;03:10,940;"It's a journalist that obviously."
03:10,940;03:14,660;"Well, obviously, I don't know about obviously."
03:14,660;03:16,780;"It's so sad."
03:17,260;03:18,580;"Could you could you give it a better name?"
03:18,580;03:19,060;"Great."
03:19,060;03:19,420;"Yes."
03:19,420;03:20,620;"I don't get the courage part."
03:20,620;03:21,100;"What would they?"
03:21,100;03:22,900;"Well, they."
03:22,900;03:27,820;"So the idea was that the dolphins came in at two and 11."
03:27,820;03:29,540;"Patriots are what?"
03:29,540;03:31,540;"11 and 1, 12 and 1."
03:31,540;03:32,020;"Yeah."
03:32,020;03:32,900;"Yeah."
03:32,900;03:37,700;"And the dolphins, the wheels fell off earlier this season"
03:37,700;03:41,900;"when Ricky Williams retired like the day before training camp."
03:41,900;03:44,940;"So he could go rock to Europe and smoke a bunch of weed."
03:44,940;03:46,740;"Yeah."
03:46,740;03:49,040;"That's not weed shame on 421 Andy."
03:49,040;03:49,380;"Okay."
03:49,380;03:50,220;"I'm not weed shame in."
03:50,220;03:51,980;"I'm just saying that that was his reason for quitting."
03:51,980;03:52,140;"Right."
03:52,140;03:55,220;"Cause the league wouldn't let him smoke weed."
03:55,220;03:57,500;"So he says, okay, I'm going to go do it myself then."
03:57,500;03:58,500;"Now look at him."
03:58,500;03:59,340;"Right."
03:59,340;03:59,700;"Yeah."
03:59,700;04:06,780;"Um, and so they actually had two other games, postponed due to"
04:06,780;04:07,660;"hurricanes as well."
04:07,660;04:09,780;"Uh, so they came in."
04:09,780;04:12,620;"This is a Monday night game, you know, supposed to be highly"
04:12,620;04:13,420;"tired and late for these."
04:14,900;04:17,100;"Well, yeah, well, did he retire? Did he get fired?"
04:17,100;04:18,220;"They got fired."
04:18,220;04:21,660;"Oh, because they were talking about the interim head coach, whoever the fuck he was."
04:21,660;04:24,060;"Was it?"
04:24,060;04:25,060;"No name."
04:25,060;04:27,340;"He was"
04:27,340;04:29,500;"Jim Bates."
04:29,500;04:31,700;"And from head coach,"
04:31,700;04:34,300;"coach Bell check in Cleveland too, and Saban."
04:34,300;04:35,900;"Did he?"
04:35,900;04:40,700;"I miss it. I know the I saw the Saban piece, but Jim Bates said Jim Bates is on that stuff."
04:43,260;04:45,180;"Well, Jim Bates claimed fame."
04:45,180;04:46,660;"He's one to know against Bill Belichick."
04:46,660;04:53,580;"Because as Steve alluded to, they would not rehire him at the end of this season,"
04:53,580;04:56,420;"even though there was a lot of talk about how he would get an interview."
04:56,420;05:03,700;"But they would instead go with then LSU had coach"
05:03,700;05:07,980;"McSaven and there was a lot of excitement around that."
05:07,980;05:11,020;"because they say even hadn't he just won the championship?"
05:11,020;05:14,860;"Football, call football championship."
05:14,860;05:16,580;"- Probably wins it every other year."
05:16,580;05:17,420;"- Yeah."
05:17,420;05:20,540;"- But I mean, even back in 2004, I don't see."
05:20,540;05:22,420;"- He would have shut the fuck up about it in this game."
05:22,420;05:23,980;"- Yeah, he was winning the Hell's."
05:23,980;05:24,820;"- He'd see."
05:24,820;05:25,660;"- Yeah."
05:25,660;05:26,500;"So constantly."
05:26,500;05:29,540;"But yeah, basically in the Pats went up,"
05:29,540;05:33,940;"they were up 28-17 in the fourth,"
05:33,940;05:36,580;"with like four minutes left."
05:36,580;05:38,640;"Patriot Square to make a 20-17."
05:38,640;05:39,480;"- Yeah."
05:39,480;05:40,320;"- And so everybody's like,"
05:40,320;05:42,860;"""Oh, well, you know, most teams, you know, two and 11,"
05:42,860;05:44,980;"you're down, you don't have any of your players."""
05:44,980;05:47,160;"And they were actually missing Zach Thomas as well"
05:47,160;05:48,500;"in this game for a men jury."
05:48,500;05:51,980;"So they just like down a bunch of players down late."
05:51,980;05:55,220;"- Spread was 10 and a half points too."
05:55,220;05:56,060;"- Yeah."
05:56,060;05:56,900;"And they still came back."
05:56,900;05:58,660;"- We must've been feeling pretty good."
05:58,660;06:00,680;"- Because up 11, four minutes left,"
06:00,680;06:02,080;"spread 10 and a half."
06:02,080;06:04,340;"- Happening as it always did, you know?"
06:04,340;06:05,180;"All season."
06:05,180;06:06,340;"- And the league."
06:06,340;06:07,840;"- Yep."
06:07,840;06:11,720;"And then for some reason, Tom Brady turned back"
06:11,720;06:13,480;"into Drew Bledsoe, sorry, mom."
06:13,480;06:15,200;"But it's true."
06:15,200;06:18,720;"Throwing the back-breaking interception"
06:18,720;06:22,280;"as he's falling over, throwing it basically over his shoulder,"
06:22,280;06:25,480;"gets intercepted and returns like the 10-yard line"
06:25,480;06:28,320;"to set up."
06:28,320;06:31,520;"I touched down and bring it within a couple of points,"
06:31,520;06:35,680;"2023, 'cause they tried the two-point conversion and failed."
06:35,680;06:39,320;"And then a few..."
06:39,320;06:41,600;"- I'm not sure if that's right."
06:41,600;06:42,440;"- Yeah, you got it wrong."
06:42,440;06:44,400;"They scored a touchdown, missed two-punga version,"
06:44,400;06:45,400;"then you threw a pick."
06:45,400;06:47,200;"- And then two minutes left."
06:47,200;06:49,240;"- How courageous of them."
06:49,240;06:50,500;"- So courageous dude."
06:50,500;06:55,560;"We're talking about professional athletes here."
06:55,560;06:57,760;"It's not some fucking like scrub YNC 18."
06:57,760;06:59,080;"They're getting paid millions of dollars"
06:59,080;06:59,920;"to play these games."
06:59,920;07:02,240;"Like what else are they gonna do, not show up?"
07:02,240;07:03,200;"- And it's not like if you lose,"
07:03,200;07:04,520;"they're gonna fucking kill you."
07:04,520;07:07,520;"- Yeah, Tom Brady threw four interceptions."
07:07,520;07:08,680;"- Yeah, this isn't cool."
07:08,680;07:10,240;"- Brady melted down."
07:10,240;07:12,040;"- Yeah, as I'm saying, he turned into"
07:12,040;07:13,040;"Drew Blood's about the end there."
07:13,040;07:14,760;"Throw in interceptions all over the place."
07:14,760;07:18,400;"- But I mean, the second time that there were orange,"
07:18,400;07:20,000;"that's the other part of that statement, right?"
07:20,000;07:22,320;"- Exactly, yeah, there's the only right orange jerseys."
07:22,320;07:24,640;"- I mean, to be fair, the orange jerseys were sweet."
07:24,640;07:26,000;"- The green circles?"
07:26,000;07:26,840;"- Yeah."
07:26,840;07:27,680;"- I don't even mean green circles,"
07:27,680;07:30,760;"they're like orange, orange, like four to orange, yeah."
07:30,760;07:32,920;"- Yeah, like traffic cone orange?"
07:32,920;07:34,920;"like half time oranges orange."
07:34,920;07:35,760;"- Yes."
07:35,760;07:37,280;"- Those are more yellow."
07:37,280;07:39,440;"- Half time oranges are the shit."
07:39,440;07:40,280;"- Yep."
07:40,280;07:42,440;"- And I cooked soccer and always make the parents"
07:42,440;07:44,840;"bring those and I'd eat like half."
07:44,840;07:46,680;"- You put it in your mouth like a little orange milk."
07:46,680;07:47,520;"- Yeah."
07:47,520;07:48,360;"- Yeah."
07:48,360;07:49,840;"- I do it every single time."
07:49,840;07:51,680;"- That's true."
07:51,680;07:53,840;"I might start bringing them to my over 30s."
07:53,840;07:54,680;"- Do it."
07:54,680;07:55,760;"- Oh, that's not bad."
07:55,760;07:56,600;"- I love that shit."
07:56,600;07:57,760;"- That's a strong play."
07:57,760;07:58,600;"That's a strong play."
07:58,600;07:59,440;"- Yeah, throw back."
07:59,440;08:00,440;"Especially for the over 30s."
08:00,440;08:01,360;"- Orange slices?"
08:01,360;08:03,960;"Yeah, 'cause that generation was fucking with oranges."
08:03,960;08:06,960;"- The parents would be bringing snacks,"
08:06,960;08:10,840;"like Capri Suns and fruit snacks and stuff."
08:10,840;08:12,960;"And I'm like, ""You're fruit snacks."""
08:12,960;08:14,800;"We need, again, oranges."
08:14,800;08:15,640;"- Oranges."
08:15,640;08:17,440;"- I'm only doing this for the oranges, so."
08:17,440;08:19,360;"- Maybe I'll accept a go-gird."
08:19,360;08:22,100;"(both laughing)"
08:22,100;08:25,320;"- Can I bring oranges and snacks?"
08:25,320;08:27,840;"I don't give a shit, as long as there's oranges here."
08:27,840;08:29,520;"You guys come on, you know,"
08:29,520;08:31,720;"figured out months yourselves, who's bringing oranges this week?"
08:31,720;08:35,880;"Oh, yeah. Okay, then."
08:35,880;08:40,240;"Oranges. But yeah, so that's that's the where the name came from."
08:40,240;08:46,800;"So this is now two games, two regular season games in seasons"
08:46,800;08:49,600;"where the dolphins have not made the playoffs that they have"
08:49,600;08:52,640;"named just from beating the Patriots."
08:52,640;08:54,600;"Right."
08:54,600;08:55,440;"The other game."
08:55,440;08:58,000;"The Miami miracle."
08:58,000;08:58,560;"Yeah."
08:59,200;09:01,980;"I mean, you know, you got to take what you get culture in their hand."
09:01,980;09:03,400;"Banners are just making play off."
09:03,400;09:08,580;"So yeah, but this is why nobody's doing a podcast about all dolphins games."
09:08,580;09:08,900;"I think."
09:08,900;09:10,020;"Yeah."
09:10,020;09:11,700;"Cause that's that's some sad shit."
09:11,700;09:12,860;"I don't know."
09:12,860;09:18,320;"There's, I feel like as new England fans, we don't really see the other side of it."
09:18,320;09:19,580;"No, right."
09:19,580;09:22,500;"Like when your team sucks and you have nothing to root for."
09:22,500;09:26,800;"And then the big bad team comes into town and you beat them."
09:26,820;09:29,940;"Like that is a very satisfying win."
09:29,940;09:33,220;"'Cause it's really one of the only reasons"
09:33,220;09:34,220;"you have to celebrate."
09:34,220;09:37,700;"So it's like, I can see, like that's corny,"
09:37,700;09:40,540;"courage wearing orange, that's corny as shit."
09:40,540;09:42,620;"But from a fan base, I would never be like,"
09:42,620;09:44,100;"you're not allowed to celebrate this"
09:44,100;09:46,220;"because you're still too, you know?"
09:46,220;09:50,140;"Like if you win and your team has nothing to hold onto"
09:50,140;09:53,060;"and they still win, like that's fucking worth celebrating"
09:53,060;09:53,900;"for sure."
09:53,900;09:56,580;"- Oh yeah, no, feel free to celebrate it."
09:56,580;10:03,580;"but naming it. That's like all the bills fans naming the wild card win over the Patriots."
10:03,580;10:06,260;"The perfect game. Yeah."
10:06,260;10:07,940;"Because I scored touch on the drugs."
10:07,940;10:09,900;"And now that you just say 13 seconds."
10:09,900;10:10,940;"Exactly. Yeah."
10:10,940;10:16,900;"13 seconds is fucking two words that just made my summer so much better."
10:16,900;10:17,900;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
10:17,900;10:24,060;"Because anytime I talk to my bills friends, friends, they can't say a goddamn word."
10:24,060;10:26,300;"No, I'll just say 13 seconds."
10:26,300;10:28,740;"It's got to hurt so bad."
10:28,740;10:29,740;"It does."
10:29,740;10:32,340;"It's got to fucking break their tiny little hearts."
10:32,340;10:33,340;"Yeah."
10:33,340;10:35,340;"We're just in these four minutes."
10:35,340;10:37,540;"Yeah, that's tough."
10:37,540;10:39,900;"Oh, man."
10:39,900;10:43,540;"Also one of the coldest games in pro player stadium history."
10:43,540;10:44,540;"Really?"
10:44,540;10:45,540;"Really?"
10:45,540;10:47,900;"52 degrees of kickoff that got into the 40s."
10:47,900;10:48,900;"Goddamn."
10:48,900;10:51,540;"You think that patience should be in their element?"
10:51,540;10:52,540;"Yeah."
10:52,540;10:57,540;"That brings me to my point that the Patriots"
10:57,540;11:01,780;"is fucking struggle in Miami, right?"
11:01,780;11:02,940;"Just generally."
11:02,940;11:04,820;"- Yeah, we've talked about it on this podcast before."
11:04,820;11:06,660;"- We have, but I just wanted to revisit it,"
11:06,660;11:08,620;"just how bad it is."
11:08,620;11:09,940;"- Yeah, as I forgot."
11:09,940;11:14,140;"- Right, so the Patriots under Bill Belichick,"
11:14,140;11:18,300;"out of 22 games, how many of those games in Miami,"
11:18,300;11:20,140;"do you think the Patriots have won?"
11:20,140;11:20,980;"- 10."
11:21,980;11:24,760;"less than half, it might even be like seven."
11:24,760;11:28,940;"- It was nine, clear, not far off."
11:28,940;11:31,620;"Nine and 13 in Miami under Belichick,"
11:31,620;11:33,960;"so 409 won percentage."
11:33,960;11:38,960;"All time, Belichick actually has more than half of the wins"
11:38,960;11:40,800;"in Miami for the Patriots,"
11:40,800;11:44,260;"'cause they are 17 and 40 all time in Miami."
11:44,260;11:45,820;"- That's so brutal."
11:45,820;11:49,380;"- That's really, that's rough, that's bad."
11:49,380;11:51,700;"And like, there doesn't seem to be a reason."
11:51,700;11:59,060;"It's not like the dolphins ever give them trouble at home because at home, the Patriots"
11:59,060;12:01,340;"have like the opposite record."
12:01,340;12:02,340;"Oops."
12:02,340;12:05,260;"I have it too."
12:05,260;12:11,620;"They are 17 and 5 at home against the dolphins under ballot check."
12:11,620;12:19,680;"But for some reason, in Miami, every year, you know, I feel like the media has started"
12:19,680;12:23,240;"to blow it out of proportion a bit, where it's this house of horrors and they've never"
12:23,240;12:24,540;"won there."
12:24,540;12:30,880;"But I think there's definitely something happening in Miami where the patients cannot win there."
12:30,880;12:35,680;"Even when you're going up against a 211 Miami team who lost Ricky Williams and is now starting"
12:35,680;12:37,880;"AJ Fili, their backup quarterback."
12:37,880;12:46,520;"Yeah, this is a it's the buggleboo, you know, those things are real, where it's like players"
12:46,520;12:49,960;"thinking like they can say yeah we don't listen that shit we don't care about"
12:49,960;12:54,360;"whatever we just take one game at a time yada yada yada but they think about that"
12:54,360;12:59,040;"shit you know like like any human does where it's like oh we always lose here"
12:59,040;13:02,680;"and then like maybe you play a little more tense or the other team being like"
13:02,680;13:07,160;"oh we always playing pretty well at home yep and they come in with a little more"
13:07,160;13:11,200;"belief and that you know like they're right a little more like organized or"
13:11,200;13:14,600;"cookies you know it's and it doesn't necessarily matter early in the game but"
13:14,600;13:16,640;"when it, if it's still close down the stretch."
13:16,640;13:17,880;"- Yeah. - Oh, fuck, here we go again."
13:17,880;13:19,520;"If you're always losing. - Yeah."
13:19,520;13:21,520;"And we've all played in those games too, where you're like,"
13:21,520;13:23,360;"we should be fucking winning this game."
13:23,360;13:24,760;"And you start getting frustrated"
13:24,760;13:27,400;"and then you make decisions you wouldn't normally make."
13:27,400;13:30,000;"Maybe you're trying to stack and throw the ball straight up,"
13:30,000;13:33,600;"you know, like that's not a brilliant play."
13:33,600;13:35,920;"Maybe he's not in Miami and maybe he doesn't make that,"
13:35,920;13:37,480;"you know, right? - Right."
13:37,480;13:38,880;"- I've got to line these teams up."
13:38,880;13:40,760;"They're probably gonna win 99 out of 100."
13:40,760;13:44,080;"This is just a 100."
13:44,080;13:45,880;"their pictures are wagging this year."
13:45,880;13:47,360;"And the dolphins are a mess."
13:47,360;13:54,400;"I mean, to that point, yeah, when the Patriots lost the lead in the third quarter or something."
13:54,400;13:59,520;"Because yeah, the, no, right at the end."
13:59,520;14:03,160;"Yeah. 123 left the pages lost the lead at the end."
14:03,160;14:06,880;"And it was the third time this season they have trailed in a football game."
14:06,880;14:08,080;"That's pretty good."
14:08,080;14:11,800;"Trailed the Colts and the Steelers were standing when she lost."
14:11,800;14:16,800;"Dolphins improved to one in nine when trailing to start the fourth quarter."
14:16,800;14:22,800;"I mean, I don't think we can overstate how bad this often scene was."
14:22,800;14:33,800;"Um, can we not in week six try our best their game with the Buffalo Bills was the only time in the NFL since 1968 that the last two winless teams met each other."
14:33,800;14:42,200;"other day. Do you say the bills? The bills. Oh, both in the same division to stop. Yeah."
14:42,200;14:48,840;"This is the bills recovered though, I think. I feel this is the beginning of because"
14:48,840;14:56,760;"do you know who won that game? The bills, right? This is where the dolphins and jets and the"
14:56,760;15:03,560;"bills all go downhill pretty consistently. Well, the bills finish nine and seven on the season."
15:03,560;15:07,800;"They reeled off a bunch of wins toward the end."
15:07,800;15:14,240;"But like five, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, you know, this is like the malaise of"
15:14,240;15:16,760;"the AFC East era about to begin right now."
15:16,760;15:21,040;"I mean, it wasn't, it wasn't great."
15:21,040;15:22,040;"But the Jets were good this year."
15:22,040;15:23,040;"They finished 10 and six."
15:23,040;15:27,560;"This is still, I think, isn't this still the end of the Chad Pennington era when he was"
15:27,560;15:32,800;"still encourages Martin, all that, basically the team that Bella check in Parcel is built"
15:32,800;15:35,720;"all over there still going to like the end of that team though."
15:35,720;15:37,280;"I don't think painting places in the end."
15:37,280;15:38,120;"That's true."
15:38,120;15:41,800;"But I mean, Paige finished 14 and two and the jets still finished 10 and six and"
15:41,800;15:46,400;"the bills finished nine and seven in a team with a wagon or in a division with a wagon."
15:46,400;15:50,400;"So what are the dolphins finished?"
15:50,400;15:51,800;"Should they get an four and 12?"
15:51,800;15:54,480;"They had a decent defense though."
15:54,480;15:56,280;"There were eighth in the NFL in defense."
15:56,280;15:56,880;"Yeah."
15:56,880;15:58,160;"For yards."
15:58,160;15:59,120;"Yeah."
15:59,120;16:02,560;"I mean, this was a, I mean, it's a typical Taylor Patrick's"
16:02,560;16:09,560;"your tan. Yeah. It's like Thomas. Like there's some names back there. Sammy Knight. Yeah. Sammy Knight."
16:09,560;16:15,080;"I don't know if I'd throw him in that conversation. I would hit a hundred tackles in the season. Four picks, two"
16:15,080;16:23,360;"four swumbles. Maybe he's up there. Jason Tiller is our best player at all. Yeah. Absolutely disruptive."
16:23,360;16:30,240;"Look at how it's a man. I was like, he was so hard to hate. It's true. I had no problem. It comes"
16:30,240;16:34,200;"easy to me though. So I understand you're saying. But yeah, so that my"
16:34,200;16:37,200;"end office be one team. Taylor, you know, Taylor seemed like a"
16:37,200;16:39,720;"better football player. Free knee was just a past Russia."
16:39,720;16:44,400;"Yeah, free was for and free knee was, um, I think he depended on his"
16:44,400;16:47,240;"speed so much so that he was a lot better when you played him in"
16:47,240;16:52,100;"Indianapolis than when he came to New England. I don't know, I"
16:52,100;16:55,120;"thought that too. But then free knee was pretty good at the end of"
16:55,120;16:58,400;"his career when he wasn't as fast. That's true. Well, I think he"
16:58,400;17:01,560;"kind of change his game towards the other career. Yeah. But yeah,"
17:01,560;17:07,880;"that's like that that spin move from Vreen was just it was like, it"
17:07,880;17:11,160;"must have been so good. Because like everyone knew it was coming."
17:11,160;17:14,000;"And still there wasn't a man in the league that could stop it. And"
17:14,000;17:14,920;"it's like, how?"
17:14,920;17:20,360;"Set them up all game for it, you know, yeah, it must have been"
17:20,360;17:22,680;"just impossible to defend because it just seemed like it."
17:22,680;17:27,040;"I think it because it he coupled it with his speed move that you had to"
17:27,040;17:29,160;"And his speed was so fast off that corner,"
17:29,160;17:32,480;"you had to basically almost cheat to make sure you stop that."
17:32,480;17:35,280;"And if you're cheating to stop that,"
17:35,280;17:37,880;"he can then just be with that spin move."
17:37,880;17:38,720;"- Yeah."
17:38,720;17:42,360;"Jason Taylor, we're in the thick of his prime too."
17:42,360;17:45,040;"2002, he had 18 and a half sacks."
17:45,040;17:46,360;"- New boy."
17:46,360;17:47,280;"- That's a lot."
17:47,280;17:50,840;"- 2003, he had 13, 2004, nine and a half,"
17:50,840;17:52,960;"then 12, 13 and a half and 11."
17:52,960;17:54,760;"So we're in like the meat,"
17:54,760;17:57,160;"his down year in the meat of his prime."
17:57,160;17:58,160;"- Right."
17:58,160;18:00,840;"- But he still had what, one sack in this game, two sacks,"
18:00,840;18:02,560;"something like that."
18:02,560;18:04,640;"He definitely got to Brady Bunch."
18:04,640;18:06,400;"- And I'll Kevin Paul got nine yards"
18:06,400;18:08,520;"and he still chased him down."
18:08,520;18:09,360;"- Yeah."
18:09,360;18:11,080;"- Strip the ball after Kevin Paul was on the ground,"
18:11,080;18:12,760;"you know, just playing all the way through."
18:12,760;18:13,760;"- Oh yeah."
18:13,760;18:16,320;"- Where Frini would be like 20 yards in a, you know,"
18:16,320;18:17,800;"back field."
18:17,800;18:18,800;"- Yeah, that's true."
18:18,800;18:20,720;"Yeah, Frini would overrun things along."
18:20,720;18:22,200;"- Been on the screen super hard."
18:22,200;18:23,040;"- Yeah."
18:23,920;18:24,760;"Here's a question."
18:24,760;18:26,360;"A whole theoretical question."
18:26,360;18:31,000;"Who is the Patriots' dynasty best ever past Russia?"
18:31,000;18:34,280;"Best ever past Russia?"
18:34,280;18:35,200;"Mm-hmm."
18:35,200;18:36,640;"Just pure Russian quarterback."
18:36,640;18:38,120;"Woo."
18:38,120;18:39,360;"William Aginnist."
18:39,360;18:40,200;"Ooh."
18:40,200;18:41,960;"Okay, you guys had different answers."
18:41,960;18:43,160;"We've discussed."
18:43,160;18:44,520;"Steve, what did you say?"
18:44,520;18:46,000;"Chandler Jones."
18:46,000;18:47,040;"That's pretty good one too."
18:47,040;18:47,880;"Yeah."
18:47,880;18:50,600;"pure past Russia, he was the best."
18:50,600;18:55,160;"Willie McGinn is set the record NFL record for sacks in a post season."
18:55,160;18:59,800;"So I think he, I think he, I don't know if he still has it, but he"
18:59,800;19:01,840;"was the most ever sacks in NFL in the post season."
19:01,840;19:03,600;"So I think that counts."
19:03,600;19:04,240;"I'm still doing it too."
19:04,240;19:04,920;"He's a beast."
19:04,920;19:05,840;"That's true."
19:05,840;19:10,120;"But I don't think he played on the pages long enough for him to be like."
19:10,120;19:13,840;"But if you're saying who was our best pass rusher for whatever period"
19:13,840;19:15,800;"of time they're on the team, that's definitely Chandler."
19:15,800;19:19,240;"I can't think of anyone who is just a peer pass rusher if he was."
19:19,240;19:24,740;"Most talented, I would say, is probably Chandler Jones from purely pass rushing."
19:24,740;19:30,140;"Best or most legendary will, he's probably that person."
19:30,140;19:32,000;"I mean, they've rented a few of them."
19:32,000;19:35,040;"Um, I feel like they mow through them all the time."
19:35,040;19:35,600;"Yeah."
19:35,600;19:39,820;"They usually do like one year rentals of some elite pass rush or off the end."
19:39,820;19:46,620;"Um, like who was that guy from the Browns they had around the Falcon Super Bowl era?"
19:46,620;19:47,980;"Oh, they had, um,"
19:48,940;19:49,440;"Oh, yeah."
19:49,440;19:50,100;"Well, long as well."
19:50,100;19:50,860;"Dreds."
19:50,860;19:51,160;"Yeah."
19:51,160;19:51,160;"Yeah."
19:51,160;19:52,160;"Yeah."
19:52,160;19:53,260;"Uh, Jamal sheared."
19:53,260;19:53,820;"Was I?"
19:53,820;19:54,820;"Yeah."
19:54,820;19:58,260;"So they've always kind of rented them the high end guys."
19:58,260;20:01,100;"But I think like if we're talking about guys, they've drafted."
20:01,100;20:03,820;"I'd say Chandler Jones and or will let me get us one of them."
20:03,820;20:08,860;"My favorite are the scrub guys who get a bunch of sacks and then make a shitload of money."
20:08,860;20:10,020;"Tell me you've been to Kane."
20:10,020;20:11,020;"[LAUGHTER]"
20:11,020;20:11,980;"Or what was his name?"
20:11,980;20:13,700;"Like Mark Anderson or something Anderson?"
20:13,700;20:14,300;"Oh, yes."
20:14,300;20:14,820;"That's right."
20:14,820;20:15,820;"Mark Anderson."
20:15,820;20:16,980;"And then a half sacks one year."
20:16,980;20:17,500;"And so--"
20:17,500;20:18,000;"Wow."
20:18,000;20:19,480;"That's a Paul Steve."
20:19,480;20:20,300;"That is a Paul."
20:20,300;20:21,140;"That's not bad though."
20:21,140;20:24,160;"You can almost say the same about trade flowers."
20:24,160;20:27,400;"Not that you got the sacks, but the pages put him"
20:27,400;20:29,000;"in such a good position that he went off"
20:29,000;20:33,480;"and got a big old payday from the trade."
20:33,480;20:35,920;"And now might come back this year."
20:35,920;20:36,920;"Is the rumor?"
20:36,920;20:38,880;"I think that that does not done yet."
20:38,880;20:40,880;"Same with Jamie Collins here, right?"
20:40,880;20:42,800;"Yeah, a key mix."
20:42,800;20:43,960;"Yeah, yeah."
20:43,960;20:44,960;"A lot of--"
20:44,960;20:45,720;"Albanoy."
20:45,720;20:48,280;"- Calvin, no way, yeah, it's Boweschru."
20:48,280;20:51,320;"All right, what about this?"
20:51,320;20:56,320;"Who is the best project that the Patriots have ever,"
20:56,320;21:02,560;"like converted into a legitimate football player?"
21:02,560;21:04,960;"- I know where you're going with this."
21:04,960;21:05,800;"- Yeah."
21:05,800;21:06,640;"- 'Cause they would, they would talk"
21:06,640;21:07,480;"about this incessant."
21:07,480;21:08,720;"- Constantly, yeah."
21:08,720;21:10,880;"But are there any others?"
21:10,880;21:13,640;"- Project hasn't had no name recognition prior"
21:13,640;21:14,960;"to getting to anyone."
21:14,960;21:17,160;"Or even just like, yeah, or just."
21:17,160;21:19,960;"Is Randy Moss's dad as he stands here?"
21:19,960;21:21,040;"Oh, Randy Moss is pretty good one."
21:21,040;21:25,680;"I was thinking because they talked constantly about Stephen Neil, but how he's a converted"
21:25,680;21:26,680;"wrestler."
21:26,680;21:31,080;"So kind of like somebody who had some sort of raw talent that they molded into something"
21:31,080;21:32,080;"else."
21:32,080;21:34,320;"I think you can throw Edelman in that list."
21:34,320;21:35,320;"Yeah."
21:35,320;21:41,080;"A wildcat quarterback who turned into one of the best slot receivers in the NFL history."
21:41,080;21:42,960;"That's from Volmer."
21:42,960;21:47,960;"Volmars ago when I think. I think there's a decent amount of alignment probably. Yeah."
21:47,960;21:54,960;"Anybody else? Any basketball players? You can even say Yakum Johnson. Yakum Johnson."
21:54,960;22:06,960;"Yakum Johnson, I put him in there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Anybody else? I feel like there's been some other converted play."
22:06,960;22:13,260;"converted. Tom super Tom to you. Yeah. I don't know if he he"
22:13,260;22:17,540;"was more converted by Parcells back there. I think maybe you"
22:17,540;22:20,860;"can say the guys from Navy court cardona, you know, oh, yeah."
22:20,860;22:22,840;"Yeah. Mike Rebel."
22:22,840;22:24,940;"Rebel? Oh, yeah."
22:24,940;22:28,200;"Rebel private. Anybody any? Well, yeah, that's it."
22:28,200;22:30,220;"Rebel to shit. Even West Walker."
22:30,220;22:35,180;"Oh, West Walker is one I thought you were thinking of. Oh, no."
22:35,640;22:40,180;"Now, now I was thinking of Steven Nail, who didn't play for"
22:40,180;22:41,500;"Paul in college."
22:41,500;22:44,040;"Interceptions in this game was on third and 10 knee through a"
22:44,040;22:46,380;"huge deep ball all the way down to the 20 yard line."
22:46,380;22:49,680;"And I have a note says, probably better than kicking it to West"
22:49,680;22:50,280;"Walker again."
22:50,280;22:51,180;"Right."
22:51,180;22:52,460;"Yes."
22:52,460;22:57,520;"I mean, even the last game that I did the episode by myself with"
22:57,520;23:01,040;"when we saw a Welker, um, West Wechler."
23:01,040;23:02,260;"You'll have to listen to that one."
23:02,260;23:03,260;"Yeah, you should."
23:03,260;23:03,700;"It's great."
23:03,700;23:04,420;"It's fascinating."
23:04,960;23:06,360;"You'll learn something. I promise Steve."
23:06,360;23:09,400;"Yeah, but do I want to know this?"
23:09,400;23:11,080;"I don't care."
23:11,080;23:18,280;"Yeah, no, he was, I think even more effective in this is I think every kick"
23:18,280;23:20,120;"return was well past the 30."
23:20,120;23:24,680;"He was doing kick returns and he's doing punt returns as well, which he returned"
23:24,680;23:28,320;"his first punt return return all the way down to the New England two three yard"
23:28,320;23:30,240;"lines up like that set up the first touchdown score."
23:31,600;23:35,120;"So I think at the end of the first quarter, they showed some stat where"
23:35,120;23:40,520;"the dolphins had negative nine total offensive yards and the game was tied at seven."
23:40,520;23:41,440;"Yeah."
23:41,440;23:46,360;"Basically because Wes Walker and his kid returns and his power returns and Tom"
23:46,360;23:47,280;"Bray throwing interceptions."
23:47,280;23:49,120;"I mean, they're, they're trotting out there."
23:49,120;23:52,800;"Marty Booker, tight end, Darius Thompson."
23:52,800;23:55,080;"Yeah, I'd never heard of that guy."
23:55,080;24:00,200;"And he, Michael, Brian Gilmore, Chris Chambers, Donald Lee."
24:00,200;24:02,500;"These are the people who were playing over West Walker at this point."
24:02,500;24:03,360;"Right."
24:03,360;24:03,700;"Yeah."
24:03,700;24:04,340;"No West Waggle."
24:04,340;24:05,900;"Well, we're clear."
24:05,900;24:09,140;"West Walker didn't have a reception this season, I don't believe."
24:09,140;24:10,940;"Correct."
24:10,940;24:12,240;"Using nobody at this point."
24:12,240;24:12,540;"Yeah."
24:12,540;24:16,640;"You can get a shot on a tune 14 or four and 12 or whatever they ended up."
24:16,640;24:17,480;"Teen is crazy."
24:17,480;24:18,080;"Right."
24:18,080;24:20,840;"And yeah, well, I mean, he's returning kicks and stuff, but yeah."
24:20,840;24:23,980;"Makes you wonder how many guys are out there."
24:23,980;24:26,260;"You know, kick return ability and be like, wow, I wonder if we can get"
24:26,260;24:27,440;"them in the ball in different ways."
24:27,440;24:28,080;"Right."
24:28,080;24:31,620;"You would think they at least try with some like wide receiver screens or like"
24:31,620;24:34,380;"having them on reverses and things like that."
24:34,380;24:36,960;"Basically what the pages do was, you know, Troy Brown and such."
24:36,960;24:40,640;"Wait, did he get traded to Sandy eight now?"
24:40,640;24:45,120;"You got drafted by same year ago, but I think didn't stick with the team."
24:45,120;24:46,860;"And then you'll have to listen to the episode."
24:46,860;24:48,040;"So I went into all of it."
24:48,040;24:52,240;"It was very wonderful."
24:52,240;24:54,240;"They go learn something, Steve."
24:54,240;24:55,200;"Hey, right, Steve?"
24:56,680;25:02,520;"Did you guys watch the, um, the, the Brady documentary with Welker in it?"
25:02,520;25:08,280;"It's the one where he drops the pass and the Super Bowl against the second one"
25:08,280;25:09,080;"against the Giants."
25:09,080;25:10,320;"Yeah, I know the pass."
25:10,320;25:13,000;"But it was, it was heart wrenching, man."
25:13,000;25:13,720;"Was it?"
25:13,720;25:16,240;"Dude, he's still like beat up about it."
25:16,240;25:17,480;"I would be."
25:17,480;25:23,120;"Dude, I almost fucking, because he was like, I feel like it like canceled out"
25:23,120;25:25,880;"everything I had done for the Patriots at that point."
25:25,880;25:28,200;"And like, I felt like the whole fame base"
25:28,200;25:31,520;"like didn't respect me anymore and stuff like that."
25:31,520;25:35,400;"And I actually almost like looked up his whatever Twitter"
25:35,400;25:37,160;"to send him a message and be like, no dude,"
25:37,160;25:38,800;"we still love you."
25:38,800;25:39,640;"- Damn right."
25:39,640;25:40,640;"- I just like, I don't know."
25:40,640;25:43,400;"It really like almost wrenched my heart apart here"
25:43,400;25:46,560;"in this guy that like clearly put everything"
25:46,560;25:47,480;"could have into it."
25:47,480;25:51,120;"And like that's a catchy makes 99 times out of 100."
25:51,120;25:53,960;"And it's just football that sometimes it just doesn't,"
25:53,960;25:55,760;"you know, it's not like he did anything wrong."
25:55,760;25:57,720;"you just drop a pass."
25:57,720;26:01,640;"And that kind of defines his Patriots legacy to a degree."
26:01,640;26:03,040;"- And the other day that wasn't like"
26:03,040;26:04,760;"the reason they lost the game either, right?"
26:04,760;26:05,600;"- Right."
26:05,600;26:08,000;"And it's like, those kind of things are like whatever."
26:08,000;26:11,240;"It's like things where it's,"
26:11,240;26:15,120;"you make a dumb mistake or you do something stupid."
26:15,120;26:16,680;"That's where it's like,"
26:16,680;26:18,720;"you could have made a different decision."
26:18,720;26:19,680;"You didn't make a decision."
26:19,680;26:21,680;"It just bought him in the hands and bounced off."
26:21,680;26:22,520;"- Yeah."
26:22,520;26:24,120;"- That's what it is."
26:24,120;26:31,240;"fucking nightmare fuel. Imagine, imagine like the whole like off season for West"
26:31,240;26:35,720;"Welker after that. Just being like every night, just thinking it over being like,"
26:35,720;26:40,280;"what the fuck? He's like, and there's nothing you can be like, I wish I did this"
26:40,280;26:44,040;"different because you can't do anything different. No, no, there's no different."
26:44,040;26:47,640;"It's gotta be fucking terrible to deal with. That's rough. Yep."
26:49,240;26:55,720;"I too was lying in bed a lot saying what the fuck yeah it was a lot of my head"
26:55,720;27:01,960;"Oh god well I have a story I have a similar story maybe this is why it resonated with me is because"
27:01,960;27:10,760;"at UNH right so I was on the soccer team and they I never played anything like that so I didn't"
27:10,760;27:15,800;"have any goals you know throughout my whole career but senior day they'd have to start all the"
27:15,800;27:19,340;"seniors. And there's like, they'll put you in there for like"
27:19,340;27:23,020;"15, 20 minutes. And then they thank you for the real guys."
27:23,020;27:29,240;"And like five minutes into that game, like a ball came across"
27:29,240;27:34,540;"and I had like a gaping net. And I pushed it wide. And like,"
27:34,540;27:37,340;"you know, mom was there, you know, this whole like performs"
27:37,340;27:39,940;"beforehand. Like if I had met it, that would have been such like a"
27:39,940;27:42,340;"fuck you, you know, would have been so like."
27:43,380;27:45,000;"Liberalling. Yeah."
27:45,000;27:46,300;"Redeeming. Yeah."
27:46,300;27:47,500;"I fucking missed it."
27:47,500;27:50,580;"And then like, I'm like, well, that's why I don't play."
27:50,580;27:53,700;"You know, like you go through all these things in your head of like, yeah,"
27:53,700;27:55,500;"you know, wonder you missed it because you fucking suck."
27:55,500;27:59,780;"You know, it's like, it was, it took me a while to like get over it."
27:59,780;28:00,820;"Oh, yeah."
28:00,820;28:03,180;"It's like you're playing at the pro player stadium."
28:03,180;28:07,540;"Yeah, I've missed so many penalty kicks."
28:07,540;28:11,540;"Dinged him off the posts."
28:11,540;28:13,620;"Keeper makes a good save, whatever it is."
28:13,620;28:17,300;"Push it just wide that I just don't take me anymore."
28:17,300;28:23,500;"And I'm talking like, you know, middle school, high school, like college"
28:23,500;28:26,180;"rec sports, just I just, I can't do it."
28:26,180;28:28,780;"Yeah, it's just in my head."
28:28,780;28:31,140;"I just, I know I'm going to miss as soon as I can."
28:31,140;28:32,460;"And we're playing in front of nobody."
28:32,460;28:34,340;"These guys have no one from millions."
28:34,340;28:34,580;"Yeah."
28:34,580;28:39,060;"You're on prime time television getting hate messages after I went down to"
28:39,060;28:40,560;"- Which is fucking nuts."
28:40,560;28:41,400;"- The threats."
28:41,400;28:42,240;"- Your family."
28:42,240;28:43,080;"Anybody."
28:43,080;28:43,920;"- Fuckin' people."
28:43,920;28:46,320;"- I support heckling players,"
28:46,320;28:49,440;"but anybody that like sends threat messages on the,"
28:49,440;28:52,160;"you know, like that is the most ridiculous shit."
28:52,160;28:54,320;"So who's speaking to you if you've ever done that?"
28:54,320;28:55,800;"You're a fucking idiot."
28:55,800;28:57,120;"- Exactly."
28:57,120;28:58,200;"- Like grow up."
28:58,200;29:00,120;"You can say funny shit in heckle."
29:00,120;29:02,480;"- I'm an idiot, trust me."
29:02,480;29:03,880;"I'm an idiot, so I know idiots."
29:03,880;29:08,000;"You can heckle all you want as always in good nature,"
29:08,000;29:10,920;"you're threatening people's families you're fucking jackass."
29:10,920;29:14,880;"Well, there's a fuck on a jackass."
29:14,880;29:16,680;"Getting on my fucking pistol here."
29:16,680;29:18,360;"You know, worked up."
29:18,360;29:21,520;"So you just replaying that miss goal and your head over and over."
29:21,520;29:22,480;"Oh, yeah."
29:22,480;29:23,920;"He's a well-cred dude."
29:23,920;29:24,960;"I feel bad for him."
29:24,960;29:25,960;"Yeah."
29:25,960;29:28,720;"Did he ever win a Super Bowl?"
29:28,720;29:30,040;"No, I keep what?"
29:30,040;29:31,360;"Do you not win with the Broncos?"
29:31,360;29:32,280;"That's what I was wondering."
29:32,280;29:33,880;"You know, the Broncos 13-14."
29:35,280;29:36,720;"I know they lost to the."
29:36,720;29:44,000;"Um, they lost to the Seahawks when he was part of that team where Manning was just"
29:44,000;29:45,720;"chuck and touch down for fun."
29:45,720;29:48,480;"And broke Brady's record, right?"
29:48,480;29:50,200;"Was that year?"
29:50,200;29:51,600;"Yeah."
29:51,600;29:53,120;"I don't know if he was still on the team."
29:53,120;29:55,640;"And he was there in 13 and 14."
29:55,640;29:56,320;"Okay."
29:56,320;29:57,680;"So he probably did win in the 14."
29:57,680;29:59,280;"Cause that was."
29:59,280;30:02,040;"24."
30:02,040;30:02,880;"Oh wait, 14."
30:02,880;30:03,720;"They lost."
30:03,720;30:08,480;"Yeah, he was on that one with a BDC."
30:08,480;30:10,280;"No, he was the only one who lost the Seahawks."
30:10,280;30:11,280;"Right."
30:11,280;30:15,720;"Yeah, I mean, so he's in a minis and he never wants to be a bull for best."
30:15,720;30:21,820;"He went to Super Bowl with two of the best off offenses in NFL history and he's zero"
30:21,820;30:22,820;"Super Bowls to show for it."
30:22,820;30:25,200;"It was a big part of both of them too."
30:25,200;30:27,160;"Maybe it's maybe he's the problem."
30:27,160;30:28,800;"Seems like it."
30:28,800;30:31,840;"You have five seasons with more than 110 catches."
30:31,840;30:32,840;"That's crazy."
30:32,840;30:33,680;"Yeah."
30:33,680;30:36,680;"- 10,000 combined yards rushing, receiving on his career."
30:36,680;30:38,200;"- Unbelievable."
30:38,200;30:39,040;"- Pro-boller?"
30:39,040;30:40,840;"I mean, Hall of Famer?"
30:40,840;30:41,680;"- I would say so."
30:41,680;30:44,760;"- Dude, he's married to a swimsuit model"
30:44,760;30:48,000;"in 2005 Mrs. Hooters, pageant winner."
30:48,000;30:50,200;"(laughing)"
30:50,200;30:51,920;"- All right, I don't feel bad for him anymore."
30:51,920;30:54,280;"- No, going down that rabbit hole."
30:54,280;30:55,880;"Oh, and he's a,"
30:55,880;30:57,720;"he coaches on the 49ers now too, right?"
30:57,720;30:59,520;"- Yes, he does."
30:59,520;31:01,320;"- So he's lost another super ball as a coach."
31:01,320;31:02,240;"- That's right."
31:02,240;31:05,740;"Yeah. Yeah. That's tough. So it's"
31:05,740;31:09,200;"tough to curse. Yeah. So don't hire"
31:09,200;31:11,540;"Wes Walker. If you want to win. If you"
31:11,540;31:13,140;"want to go to Super Bowl, what's your"
31:13,140;31:16,940;"plan for? All right. What else? Tom Brady?"
31:16,940;31:20,340;"Not so good. Oh, it says meltdown game."
31:20,340;31:23,000;"Yeah, this is. It's just that that one"
31:23,000;31:25,880;"game that he just struggled. Although,"
31:25,880;31:28,760;"to be fair, they did post that the last"
31:28,760;31:30,320;"time they met, these two teams met."
31:31,440;31:34,740;"Brady had season lows in pretty much every category,"
31:34,740;31:38,180;"including finishing the game with seven completions"
31:38,180;31:39,680;"for 69 passing yards."
31:39,680;31:42,060;"Nice."
31:42,060;31:44,860;"To be fair, two of those completions would touch dance."
31:44,860;31:46,420;"But not great."
31:46,420;31:48,060;"They only had 204 total yards."
31:48,060;31:51,460;"So, I mean, he struggled last time,"
31:51,460;31:52,300;"but they still got the win,"
31:52,300;31:54,060;"but this was like a legit meltdown."
31:54,060;32:00,060;"Even they mentioned that Tom Brady,"
32:00,060;32:04,580;"This is what week 15 had a couple of passes batted down in this game."
32:04,580;32:09,460;"There were the first passes he had batted or tipped the entire season,"
32:09,460;32:13,060;"which is weird because I feel like it happens like it leads once a game."
32:13,060;32:15,060;"Yeah, that's that was crazy."
32:15,060;32:17,060;"He gets past the batter all the time."
32:17,060;32:22,820;"He was 18 for 29, 171 yards, three touchdowns, four interceptions,"
32:22,820;32:24,620;"sackcloths. That's rough."
32:24,620;32:27,420;"This touchdown's are sick though. Yeah."
32:27,420;32:28,660;"Some good touch."
32:28,660;32:34,420;"fast again. Falk was money. Yeah. This is the I think the only receiving touchdown Corey"
32:34,420;32:40,260;"Dillon ever gets from Brady. Yeah, it is. And it's the first time he had a touchdown catch"
32:40,260;32:44,340;"since 2001 with the Bengals. Yeah. I don't think he finishes with many."
32:44,340;32:48,740;"You know, that's always like a great trivia question, wherever."
32:48,740;32:56,820;"The Daniel Graham was pretty good. That's all right. I don't know if he had like a he wasn't like"
32:56,820;33:02,820;"terrible, but it wasn't very good either. See, like, the dolphins defenses given him problems more than he was just being really bad, you know?"
33:02,820;33:06,820;"Yeah, yeah, I mean, he's only 18 for 29. It's not great."
33:06,820;33:13,820;"If you just look at passer rating, he was outplayed by AJ Fielding, which is not great."
33:13,820;33:19,820;"Yes, like, yeah, any person is in that statements opposite AJ Field, they should feel bad."
33:19,820;33:27,520;"Yeah. I mean, it's also not great when I think Troy Brown on defense got a bit exposed in this game too."
33:27,520;33:29,220;"You got picked on a little bit."
33:29,220;33:30,720;"Oh, I dare you."
33:30,720;33:37,420;"I know it's tough to say, but he also was tied for second in the team in tackles with five."
33:37,420;33:45,420;"And three other people had six including, you know, the usual suspects, McGinnis to fight for."
33:45,420;33:47,920;"And that's not a Samuel, sadly."
33:47,920;33:52,120;"So I was just one of those games, you know, not great."
33:52,120;33:55,640;"Like, I feel he had like three near picks dropped too."
33:55,640;33:57,960;"Oh yeah, that's not the same I should have had at least two."
33:57,960;33:58,960;"Yeah."
33:58,960;34:01,560;"So I was just, well, those games were the best."
34:01,560;34:02,880;"It just didn't go your way."
34:02,880;34:05,800;"Really kind of coming on these really these games where you still really."
34:05,800;34:06,800;"Yeah."
34:06,800;34:07,800;"Yeah."
34:07,800;34:13,440;"I bet there's some interesting statistics you could do about Brady's meltdown games."
34:13,440;34:15,160;"In what way?"
34:15,160;34:23,280;"like interceptions average per game compared to like how much of a deviation those ones"
34:23,280;34:28,720;"are when he like goes crazy and melts down because it feels like it's either zero or"
34:28,720;34:33,080;"four, you know? Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's like no in between because I just been going"
34:33,080;34:40,440;"through his game logs. Yeah. And there seems to be about the same amount of like two to"
34:40,440;34:44,120;"the four game picks as there are one game,"
34:44,120;34:46,120;"one interception games, right?"
34:46,120;34:47,800;"Which I would think is probably not true"
34:47,800;34:49,040;"for most quarterbacks."
34:49,040;34:51,140;"- Yeah, I'd probably spread them out"
34:51,140;34:52,880;"kind of evenly. - Yeah."
34:52,880;34:57,560;"So, and there's quite a few like four interceptions,"
34:57,560;34:58,400;"which is, - He has."
34:58,400;35:00,080;"- Wow, interior new Brady is."
35:00,080;35:02,040;"Six games with four interceptions."
35:02,040;35:05,240;"Which is the most he's ever thrown."
35:05,240;35:08,000;"He hasn't thrown more than four."
35:08,000;35:09,280;"- Never win that."
35:09,280;35:12,280;"It was like, I feel like it was more everyone needed."
35:12,280;35:15,200;"Peterman came in for the bills and through like five interceptions in the half."
35:15,200;35:16,560;"Yeah, that was awesome."
35:16,560;35:20,200;"And then everyone started comparing him to help last time Brady and so on,"
35:20,200;35:24,200;"like five interceptions, like total and it's been like two and a half years."
35:24,200;35:26,240;"All right."
35:26,240;35:26,840;"So here we go."
35:26,840;35:32,360;"So Brady is 0 and six when he throws four interceptions, which makes sense."
35:32,360;35:36,880;"He did almost win."
35:37,000;35:38,640;"Let's see."
35:38,640;35:40,600;"One of those games was against the Bills."
35:40,600;35:44,680;"I think that was against Fitzpatrick in 2011,"
35:44,680;35:47,000;"where they lost 31-34 right at the end."
35:47,000;35:50,240;"Kept it close with the Colts,"
35:50,240;35:51,320;"went through zero touchdowns,"
35:51,320;35:53,000;"four interceptions in 2006,"
35:53,000;35:55,200;"and they lost by 27."
35:55,200;35:58,760;"2005, he threw four against the Chiefs"
35:58,760;36:00,560;"with a touchdown,"
36:00,560;36:03,360;"and that wasn't that close, it lost by 10."
36:03,360;36:04,520;"This game, three touchdowns,"
36:04,520;36:06,120;"four interceptions lost by Point."
36:06,120;36:09,920;"2003, week one where they lost 31 nothing."
36:09,920;36:13,440;"And then 2001, week seven, where I threw four interceptions, I think in the second half,"
36:13,440;36:18,640;"remember, we saw, they actually got blown up by the Broncos."
36:18,640;36:23,720;"So those are the six games."
36:23,720;36:26,720;"Between two and three interceptions, he is 24 and 19."
36:26,720;36:34,320;"So every many games that is 43 games, where he's thrown two or three interceptions."
36:34,320;36:36,320;"That's pretty good."
36:36,320;36:42,320;"Zero one exceptions. He has two hundred and seventy five games."
36:42,320;36:46,320;"So I found that tweet. I think, you know,"
36:46,320;36:50,320;"Nathan Peterman five interceptions since four o'clock Eastern time."
36:50,320;36:53,320;"Tom Brady five interceptions since January 4th, 2016."
36:53,320;36:56,320;"November 19th, 2017."
36:56,320;36:59,320;"That's tough."
36:59,320;37:01,320;"Yeah."
37:01,320;37:02,320;"Yeah."
37:02,320;37:03,320;"Burrito."
37:03,320;37:05,320;"It's got such a Brett Favinum."
37:05,320;37:10,240;"It's just the quickest way to ruin that guy's confidence."
37:10,240;37:12,320;"He was never the same after that either."
37:12,320;37:13,320;"Yeah."
37:13,320;37:14,320;"Well, I mean, he keeps around."
37:14,320;37:15,320;"Yeah."
37:15,320;37:19,800;"Well, there was talk that he might get another shot at a starting job because he's back."
37:19,800;37:21,560;"He was backing up."
37:21,560;37:24,720;"He's in Buffalo right now, right?"
37:24,720;37:25,720;"Backing up."
37:25,720;37:26,720;"What's his face?"
37:26,720;37:27,960;"You're thinking of Mitch."
37:27,960;37:29,720;"I love kissing Teddy's Trubisky."
37:29,720;37:30,720;"Oh, yeah."
37:30,720;37:32,600;"- Oh, maybe. - Yeah, that's Mitch."
37:32,600;37:33,440;"- He is getting a shot."
37:33,440;37:34,840;"He's gonna shove the Steelers."
37:34,840;37:36,760;"- Well, that's right."
37:36,760;37:38,100;"- Right."
37:38,100;37:39,440;"- Calling Kaepernick, baby."
37:39,440;37:40,600;"He's coming back."
37:40,600;37:41,440;"- Okay. - Yeah."
37:41,440;37:46,420;"- I hope it happens."
37:46,420;37:47,260;"- Me too."
37:47,260;37:48,360;"- 100%."
37:48,360;37:49,600;"- I wanna watch it"
37:49,600;37:52,600;"and I wanna turn it into a mother fucking circus."
37:52,600;37:55,340;"(laughing)"
37:55,340;37:56,180;"- Oh, God."
37:56,180;37:58,960;"- That's exactly what I need to do."
37:58,960;38:02,080;"- It'd be interesting, it'd be an interesting,"
38:02,080;38:03,800;"I don't know, just like, I don't know,"
38:03,800;38:06,040;"has anyone ever taken like four years off"
38:06,040;38:08,000;"as a quarterback and then come back and play?"
38:08,000;38:08,840;"- Yeah, yeah."
38:08,840;38:10,600;"- And it's like quarterback, I don't think so."
38:10,600;38:12,000;"I mean, who's the one that came out of retirement"
38:12,000;38:13,880;"for their Rams this year?"
38:13,880;38:16,320;"The safety, who's his name?"
38:16,320;38:18,600;"- Oh yeah, the guy he said beard."
38:18,600;38:19,440;"- Yeah, yeah."
38:19,440;38:21,720;"So it's been done."
38:21,720;38:23,440;"- Four years old, I feel like it's even four years old."
38:23,440;38:24,720;"- Four years long time, yeah."
38:24,720;38:28,280;"Yeah, it might even be longer."
38:28,280;38:30,960;"- Straight up black ball."
38:30,960;38:32,320;"And there's no way you can say he wasn't"
38:32,320;38:34,840;"'cause there are quality quarterbacks that are out there"
38:34,840;38:38,000;"just a bunch of AJ feelings out there."
38:38,000;38:40,920;"- Yeah, he's a lot of starter, that's the problem."
38:40,920;38:44,240;"If he was starter talent, I bet he would've got a job."
38:44,240;38:47,480;"But no one wants to deal with the shit"
38:47,480;38:50,800;"that comes with it for a backup right now."
38:50,800;38:54,240;"- Yeah, like Tim Tebow except the opposite"
38:54,240;38:55,680;"of that spectrum."
38:55,680;38:57,200;"- Right."
38:57,200;39:00,280;"I would have put him on par with like Robert Griffin,"
39:00,280;39:03,880;"where he showed like flashes of brilliance,"
39:03,880;39:07,480;"but then by the, you know, a couple years later,"
39:07,480;39:11,120;"you're like, ""Hmm, I'm not so sure this guy really has it anymore."""
39:11,120;39:12,600;"A Griffin stock around for a while"
39:12,600;39:15,120;"is a backup service will back up, right?"
39:15,120;39:17,640;"- Yeah, isn't the Ravens for a while?"
39:17,640;39:19,560;"- Capric probably could have done that."
39:19,560;39:22,840;"- And maybe he still can."
39:22,840;39:26,920;"- Maybe last season, he was one in 10."
39:26,920;39:29,120;"- I'm fixing touchdowns for interceptions though."
39:29,120;39:30,760;"- That's horrible."
39:30,760;39:35,760;"- I remember thinking he didn't have the athleticism though."
39:35,760;39:37,160;"- Really?"
39:37,160;39:38,080;"- 'Cause they played the Patriots that year"
39:38,080;39:40,160;"and I remember there was like one play"
39:40,160;39:42,920;"where he was like, ""Turn in the corner."""
39:42,920;39:44,640;"Where in his career he would have just like"
39:44,640;39:46,800;"started striding away from everybody."
39:46,800;39:48,520;"Like someone caught him from behind and I was like,"
39:48,520;39:52,520;"""Loo, if he loses that piece of his game,"
39:52,520;39:55,960;"this is like a completely different player we're looking at."""
39:55,960;39:58,000;"I mean, you might as it heard or something, I don't know."
39:58,000;39:58,840;"Yeah."
39:58,840;40:01,200;"So what 2012 is a breakout year, right?"
40:01,200;40:05,360;"63 carries 415 yards, five touchdowns."
40:05,360;40:07,040;"2016 in the last season,"
40:07,040;40:10,920;"69 carries 468 yards and two touchdowns."
40:10,920;40:15,320;"So it was actually pretty similar."
40:15,320;40:22,040;"In 2015, he struggled, but that may have been a season"
40:22,040;40:22,800;"when he was hurt."
40:22,800;40:25,080;"Hard to tell."
40:25,080;40:28,440;"was the last one's last night played 2016. So we're talking"
40:28,440;40:30,840;"a year, dude."
40:30,840;40:34,360;"Yes, a long time. And he's a vegan."
40:34,360;40:39,800;"Ancient. Hey, wasn't a isn't there a patron? Is it vegan?"
40:39,800;40:45,000;"Well, T.O. is still playing now. So, you know, I mean, it's possible. T.O. is again,"
40:45,000;40:46,120;"plays in this Super Bowl."
40:46,120;40:50,680;"That's true. He does. But what does that have to do with this? Anything?"
40:51,720;40:55,080;"deal is literally playing right now. He plays in that fan control football to be."
40:55,080;40:58,840;"All right. Well, that doesn't count. Yeah. Yeah. He's got to touch down last week."
40:58,840;41:02,920;"That's I feel like we should get into that. That seems like our game."
41:02,920;41:06,040;"I am into that. Are you? Yeah. We all pick teams."
41:06,040;41:09,400;"Okay. Do you control the, do you control the teams?"
41:09,400;41:15,080;"I don't know how it works. I was just the chair. I'll put it down on this with you guys."
41:15,080;41:18,920;"Well, that's not being into it. That's just being a degenerate gambler."
41:18,920;41:20,600;"Yeah, have you watched any of the games?"
41:20,600;41:22,200;"No, it's been like,"
41:22,200;41:23,920;"one week."
41:23,920;41:24,680;"Well, I'm into it."
41:24,680;41:25,840;"Relax."
41:25,840;41:28,320;"I will do another thing."
41:28,320;41:31,800;"I will do a fucking deep dive into this"
41:31,800;41:34,640;"and I will get way too involved."
41:34,640;41:36,280;"It's going to become another fourth and louder,"
41:36,280;41:37,560;"whatever it was, the kiss."
41:37,560;41:39,360;"Oh, that was great too."
41:39,360;41:41,520;"So I'm saying maybe maybe it'll have to be."
41:41,520;41:46,520;"OK, how about you come each week with an update on how"
41:46,520;41:47,840;"this thing is going?"
41:47,840;41:50,320;"I can't promise that will happen."
41:50,320;41:52,480;"- You didn't even know that TO is playing."
41:52,480;41:54,160;"- That's right, yeah, 'cause I'm not into it."
41:54,160;41:56,040;"You're the one that said you were into it."
41:56,040;41:57,920;"- I don't know, trying to put boss playing."
41:57,920;42:00,280;"- Oh, they have collective NFTs."
42:00,280;42:01,200;"That's good."
42:01,200;42:04,200;"Dude, tell me NFTs are the dumbest shit in the world."
42:04,200;42:06,040;"- Dumbest shit in the world."
42:06,040;42:08,480;"- I'm a nerd and I am into crypto"
42:08,480;42:11,080;"and even I think NFTs are dumbest shit."
42:11,080;42:11,920;"- Yeah."
42:11,920;42:16,480;"- Dude, when fucking Paris Selfens on TV"
42:16,480;42:23,800;"trying to talk condescendingly to me about fucking NFTs, dude."
42:23,800;42:25,360;"Yeah, man."
42:25,360;42:25,960;"Yes."
42:25,960;42:27,520;"Like what a what a world."
42:27,520;42:31,480;"You're the cash me outside girls big into NFTs."
42:31,480;42:32,440;"All right."
42:32,440;42:33,720;"But cash me outside."
42:33,720;42:38,000;"I heard that she just bought like a $16 million house too though."
42:38,000;42:40,880;"So I mean, say what you will."
42:40,880;42:45,920;"I don't have these are the people who's who made that girl rich are also the ones"
42:45,920;42:48,260;"sending death threats to their favorite players."
42:48,260;42:50,920;"I think that's true."
42:50,920;42:55,040;"They also watched the Kardashians on a regular basis."
42:55,040;42:59,480;"I found the original real world on streaming."
42:59,480;43:00,480;"Oh, yeah."
43:00,480;43:02,680;"Like season one, episode one."
43:02,680;43:03,880;"Yeah."
43:03,880;43:05,480;"It's wild."
43:05,480;43:06,440;"Yeah."
43:06,440;43:07,200;"I feel like those are--"
43:07,200;43:08,440;"--there are no idea."
43:08,440;43:13,040;"Those are all the ones that are being like blatantly racist."
43:13,040;43:13,540;"Yeah."
43:13,540;43:14,040;"There is."
43:14,040;43:15,600;"The Boston concept of--"
43:15,600;43:17,960;"Yeah, this is like going to be for public consumption."
43:17,960;43:20,280;"There's no, there's no concept like I could get free."
43:20,280;43:22,160;"Which is what the idea was."
43:22,160;43:22,400;"Yes."
43:22,400;43:23,400;"Originally."
43:23,400;43:24,960;"When people stopped being free."
43:24,960;43:27,040;"The profit after that is the flow that though."
43:27,040;43:28,400;"It's the best."
43:28,400;43:31,040;"Doesn't some dude slap a chick?"
43:31,040;43:31,720;"Yeah, I think so."
43:31,720;43:33,200;"All right."
43:33,200;43:35,240;"He like stops her in the car and like opens the door"
43:35,240;43:38,840;"and is slapped her in the face and then closes the car door."
43:38,840;43:42,120;"I think wasn't it there was a gig and then he's the one that did it"
43:42,120;43:44,580;"because she was like being super homo-"
43:44,580;43:47,980;"He just like fucking slaps the shit out of her."
43:47,980;43:48,980;"Yeah."
43:48,980;43:49,980;"Pretty sick, man."
43:49,980;43:52,260;"I was at the park on Easter."
43:52,260;43:54,260;"Shit went down."
43:54,260;43:56,340;"Apparently some guy slapped a girl."
43:56,340;43:59,100;"The whole park was a buzz with it."
43:59,100;44:02,060;"Cops came and everything did."
44:02,060;44:06,900;"And I was like, it was getting pretty testy, so I started to leave."
44:06,900;44:13,180;"And I'm like walking out the exit of the park and a car pulls up."
44:13,180;44:18,900;"And the guy fucking opens his door and I can see the barrel of a gun, like a long barrel"
44:18,900;44:19,900;"gun in it."
44:19,900;44:23,540;"And he's like yelling at some people."
44:23,540;44:25,660;"And then he like closes his door and speeds off."
44:25,660;44:30,180;"And I was like, what the fuck is going on the Lord's day, no less."
44:30,180;44:33,140;"I'm like trying to watch the Celtics."
44:33,140;44:34,140;"It was unbelievable."
44:34,140;44:36,140;"Just trying to eat my chocolate bunnies."
44:36,140;44:37,140;"Yeah."
44:37,140;44:40,980;"I have a little nap in the sun and people are fucking bringing guns to the park."
44:40,980;44:41,980;"Acting up."
44:41,980;44:42,980;"That's not cool."
44:42,980;44:46,820;"Those people are also sending death threats to players."
44:46,820;44:48,580;"Ridiculous."
44:48,580;44:50,060;"Knock it off."
44:50,060;44:51,020;"That's you."
44:51,020;44:52,340;"I mean, what do you think mom would say?"
44:52,340;44:54,300;"Sometimes a naughty boy."
44:54,300;44:55,740;"No, I'm not my bad."
44:55,740;44:56,500;"Very naughty."
44:56,500;44:58,820;"I'm excited for you to get new sound by Sandy."
44:58,820;44:59,780;"You're talking about it."
44:59,780;45:00,580;"Oh, yeah."
45:00,580;45:04,620;"Well, I mean, you keep making me do episodes and watching fucking"
45:04,620;45:06,620;"pages losing to Miami and Miami."
45:06,620;45:11,020;"Oh, well, spoiler alert, Andy, the pages don't lose another game"
45:11,020;45:12,020;"for the rest of the season."
45:12,460;45:16,200;"Luckily, that is true. Yeah, that's awesome. I wonder how long they're"
45:16,200;45:19,600;"I can see their scoring streak will go because they have an"
45:19,600;45:22,640;"escort first in 19 consecutive games, including this one where they"
45:22,640;45:25,820;"ran down, scored touchdown immediately, where it looked like this game"
45:25,820;45:26,320;"was over."
45:26,320;45:28,820;"And then immediately got the dolphin go three and out by"
45:28,820;45:31,880;"absolutely, it's definitely them. And you see those games over."
45:31,880;45:33,720;"Right. It felt over from the beginning."
45:33,720;45:34,800;"And then it just was."
45:34,800;45:35,360;"Yeah."
45:35,360;45:39,640;"Which I think it was the Welker pun return that kind of"
45:40,280;45:40,780;"Yeah."
45:40,780;45:43,060;"Jump started things and got the dolphins back"
45:43,060;45:45,800;"anyway, which is brutal."
45:45,800;45:46,920;"Fucking walker."
45:46,920;45:51,520;"We got any current news to discuss about the NFL?"
45:51,520;45:54,560;"Ooh, I was thinking we should make some draft predictions"
45:54,560;45:57,080;"since it is only from today."
45:57,080;45:58,400;"OK."
45:58,400;46:02,840;"What position do the pages draft in round one?"
46:02,840;46:07,720;"Or what position is the pages first draft"
46:07,720;46:09,480;"pick play because that's fair."
46:09,480;46:10,440;"Very good chance."
46:10,440;46:11,440;"It's not a round one."
46:11,440;46:11,960;"Fair enough."
46:11,960;46:12,440;"Fair enough."
46:12,440;46:15,640;"Well, no, let's leave it as what's their first round pick"
46:15,640;46:20,000;"with an option being NA that they trade out."
46:20,000;46:21,440;"I don't think they trade out."
46:21,440;46:22,560;"I think they trade out."
46:22,560;46:24,000;"I don't."
46:24,000;46:25,560;"They might trade back, but I think they'll still"
46:25,560;46:27,360;"pick in the first round because you have that fifth year"
46:27,360;46:28,000;"option."
46:28,000;46:29,320;"It's much more valuable."
46:29,320;46:33,640;"I think they trade up and go get that fat boy from Georgia."
46:33,640;46:34,960;"Well, the defensive lineman."
46:34,960;46:36,680;"Yep."
46:36,680;46:37,680;"That guy is awesome."
46:37,680;46:38,760;"He is awesome."
46:38,760;46:40,520;"What a fucking freak dude."
46:40,520;46:42,000;"And they can't stop the run."
46:42,000;46:44,480;"That was there when they play shit on"
46:44,480;46:45,960;"defenses because they can't stop the run."
46:45,960;46:47,120;"It's a bug a bull."
46:47,120;46:47,920;"That's true."
46:47,920;46:49,040;"That's a yeah."
46:49,040;46:51,800;"And team up a bar more in the middle."
46:51,800;46:52,720;"And the beasts in there."
46:52,720;46:53,080;"Yeah."
46:53,080;46:53,560;"Yeah."
46:53,560;46:55,040;"Yeah."
46:55,040;46:57,960;"And then you can you're going to dedicate the rest of the"
46:57,960;46:59,720;"defense to just stopping the pass."
46:59,720;47:00,480;"The pass, right."
47:00,480;47:03,320;"Yeah, while still getting pressure on the quarterback."
47:03,320;47:05,880;"You have to think that guys in your next"
47:05,880;47:06,880;"I think they do it."
47:06,880;47:08,880;"Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised."
47:08,880;47:09,880;"Greg."
47:09,880;47:11,880;"I'm going wide receiver."
47:11,880;47:12,880;"Okay."
47:12,880;47:21,880;"The guy from Bama, you know, Bella Czech loves his little boy crush on Nick Saban."
47:21,880;47:23,880;"What are you?"
47:23,880;47:27,880;"The guy that, no, James has got fucked up his leg."
47:27,880;47:28,880;"Oh, yeah."
47:28,880;47:29,880;"That makes sense because then."
47:29,880;47:32,880;"And it's a value pick, you know, I don't know."
47:32,880;47:34,080;"I don't know if you'll fall."
47:34,080;47:37,880;"I don't have a minute to read enough about that, but I've heard he's a late first rounder."
47:37,880;47:38,880;"Right."
47:38,880;47:43,640;"Because of the injury and because he was back to the ladder of the season, which would make"
47:43,640;47:47,560;"sense with this team too, because they already have a stable of wide receivers."
47:47,560;47:50,400;"So if you can kind of bring him along slowly, that makes sense."
47:50,400;47:51,560;"Yeah, I can see that."
47:51,560;47:55,520;"And they've never really been afraid to draft guys with injury concerns."
47:55,520;47:58,320;"I mean, usually they've done that all the time."
47:58,320;47:59,320;"Yeah."
47:59,320;48:03,680;"I think I feel like they've kind of almost had to just because they usually pick in the 30s"
48:03,680;48:06,200;"So they're the bottom end of every round"
48:06,200;48:10,240;"So they kind of have to take those flyers, but yeah, I can see that"
48:10,240;48:19,080;"Well since that's the way you guys are going I have to be different so I think I will do the safe bet and"
48:19,080;48:22,600;"He will draft a tackle or a guard"
48:22,600;48:25,960;"And often is that safe that"
48:26,520;48:29,680;"Because it just feels so bell check in."
48:29,680;48:32,520;"Everybody's got to work up about weapons or"
48:32,520;48:34,760;"loading up on the defensive line."
48:34,760;48:37,600;"He's going to be like, I like this guard out of Purdue."
48:37,600;48:38,920;"I'm something, you know?"
48:38,920;48:45,960;"Yeah, I think the whole mock draft thing is literally people just like shooting in the dark."
48:45,960;48:47,360;"I hate mock drafts."
48:47,360;48:51,720;"Well, they can't leave the trade, so it's like, it's immediately impossible."
48:51,720;48:52,520;"Yeah."
48:52,520;49:00,520;"I was thinking though, you know how like certain like during March madness, they say, oh, if you get a perfect practice, we'll give you 10 million dollars."
49:00,520;49:01,020;"Yeah."
49:01,020;49:06,520;"They should do it. If you get the perfect first round, we'll give you 10 million dollars because that's got to be harder to predict."
49:06,520;49:07,520;"I think they do."
49:07,520;49:07,520;"I think they do."
49:07,520;49:11,520;"I think they I saw something this year for the first time and I was like, oh, that's kind of interesting."
49:11,520;49:12,520;"Yeah."
49:12,520;49:15,520;"Because you have to predict the trades. You have that."
49:15,520;49:17,520;"It's literally impossible to pick that."
49:17,520;49:18,520;"Yeah."
49:18,520;49:21,800;"But everybody reads mock drafts against themselves."
49:21,800;49:22,840;"I have to have about this."
49:22,840;49:24,180;"- Oh yeah."
49:24,180;49:27,440;"- They're not talking to GMs or anything, right?"
49:27,440;49:29,520;"The exacts are just guessing."
49:29,520;49:30,920;"- Yeah, but everybody does it."
49:30,920;49:33,160;"'Cause there's some tool out there now, right?"
49:33,160;49:35,480;"But let me know which site that does it."
49:35,480;49:37,480;"But you can just do your own."
49:37,480;49:42,000;"And Twitter, all of April is just full of people."
49:42,000;49:43,120;"Like, oh, what do you think of this mock draft?"
49:43,120;49:44,400;"What do you think of this mock draft?"
49:44,400;49:46,120;"Hey guys, look, I did a mock draft."
49:47,440;49:52,020;"And it's the team they root for is like, oh, yeah, this guy just dropped for no reason"
49:52,020;49:53,540;"down to fucking 25th."
49:53,540;49:56,580;"Projected about five right."
49:56,580;49:57,140;"Snipe."
49:57,140;49:58,180;"Yeah."
49:58,180;50:02,080;"I saw one where they just every single pages pick was a trade."
50:02,080;50:03,420;"Oh, yeah."
50:03,420;50:05,420;"No other picks are like future picks."
50:05,420;50:06,620;"Yes."
50:06,620;50:12,020;"My friend, my friend Brian does it and tries to break the, uh, tries to break the,"
50:12,020;50:21,380;"the draft, the mock draft system and his draft that he did, where he traded every time that"
50:21,380;50:28,500;"he could, he ended up making 89 picks and 41 trades. He ended up with nine tackles, five"
50:28,500;50:33,060;"guards, five centers, five quarterbacks, seven wide receivers, nine running back, seven tight"
50:33,060;50:38,580;"ends, six defensive linemen, eight linebackers, six quarterbacks, eight safeties, three bunters,"
50:38,580;50:40,260;"just re-kickers in two longest average."
50:40,260;50:42,700;"- It's a whole team."
50:42,700;50:44,540;"- Technically feasible."
50:44,540;50:48,300;"Yeah, it's 89 picks."
50:48,300;50:50,260;"- And made for answer to that."
50:50,260;50:51,260;"- Yeah."
50:51,260;50:54,140;"You would actually have to make cuts on your draft picks"
50:54,140;50:55,540;"to get down to the 53."
50:55,540;50:57,900;"- That's what you get this."
50:57,900;50:59,900;"(laughs)"
50:59,900;51:03,980;"- So that's your team plus your whole team plus a"
51:03,980;51:06,700;"- Practice squad."
51:06,700;51:08,020;"squad plus cuts."
51:08,020;51:10,500;"Can be rude Ukraine with that."
51:10,500;51:11,420;"You could."
51:11,420;51:12,980;"Well, apparently you couldn't."
51:12,980;51:14,180;"Yeah."
51:14,180;51:16,100;"You could defend Ukraine with it."
51:16,100;51:22,780;"So do the Patriots draft that punter, the punt God Greg."
51:22,780;51:24,100;"I fucking hope so."
51:24,100;51:28,540;"I think everybody in New England is hoping that he goes like they just like."
51:28,540;51:31,340;"I don't think anybody would be mad if a page like in the fifth round, be like"
51:31,340;51:34,580;"where draft the punter fifth round, third round."
51:35,500;51:39,160;"I have seen him go forth around in a bunch of mark drafts right first round did"
51:39,160;51:43,320;"There's not a round high enough that I would get mad"
51:43,320;51:49,940;"Think the drafts and craps shoot anyways anyone grades draft is another thing. That's completely fuck. Oh god"
51:49,940;51:52,260;"Oh shit, it's like oh great your draft"
51:52,260;51:57,860;"No one knows anyway, so he might as well get the guys that I want to root for yeah"
51:57,860;52:01,660;"Yeah, and one of those guys is this fucking punter that booms them"
52:02,980;52:07,060;"Let's let's do it first time pick. I don't care. Let's go. Let's go. Oh"
52:07,060;52:12,860;"Yeah, it's always get great draft grades, but that's because they're picking at the top of the draft every time. Yeah"
52:12,860;52:15,300;"Right. Yeah. Yeah"
52:15,300;52:16,820;"That would be the Jaguars"
52:16,820;52:18,820;"Nail it every year a plus"
52:18,820;52:22,020;"Like well you have the first overall pick I should fucking hope so"
52:22,020;52:25,380;"Do you think DBO Samuel gets traded?"
52:25,380;52:28,900;"No, oh, yeah, or DBO. What is it?"
52:29,540;52:31,660;"And then DK and AJ, they're all,"
52:31,660;52:33,660;"and Terry McLaren, they're all sort of in that same class."
52:33,660;52:35,680;"- I can see DK and Matt calf getting traded"
52:35,680;52:38,340;"'cause I think the Seahawks are blowing shit up."
52:38,340;52:42,100;"But I don't know about the other ones."
52:42,100;52:42,940;"They're all in a rookie country."
52:42,940;52:43,860;"- Who's the best?"
52:43,860;52:45,380;"Who's the best side of that group?"
52:45,380;52:47,420;"- Deebo?"
52:47,420;52:48,260;"- Yeah."
52:48,260;52:49,420;"- Deebo."
52:49,420;52:52,260;"Deebo would be awesome on the page."
52:52,260;52:54,020;"It's like what a guy you wanna root for."
52:54,020;52:55,860;"- AJ would be it too though."
52:55,860;52:56,700;"- Yeah."
52:56,700;52:57,540;"'Cause I mean, he's one of the--"
52:57,540;52:59,340;"- But there's some Jeff Altpatriots."
52:59,340;53:00,880;"- Yeah, that's true."
53:00,880;53:02,920;"- He's got that mean structure, I think."
53:02,920;53:05,680;"He's such a little bulldog and like,"
53:05,680;53:07,680;"it's gonna look Troy Brown in two where it's like,"
53:07,680;53:10,520;"he's always like doing a little bit more"
53:10,520;53:13,680;"than you would have hoped, like would be best, you know?"
53:13,680;53:14,680;"- Yeah."
53:14,680;53:17,520;"- Guys, he was unbelievable in the playoffs."
53:17,520;53:18,360;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:18,360;53:20,720;"I'll give you that."
53:20,720;53:22,680;"- But he'll probably break down in like two years"
53:22,680;53:23,960;"the way he plays."
53:23,960;53:24,800;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:24,800;53:26,960;"- He's a perfect guy of a short career."
53:26,960;53:28,160;"- Yeah."
53:28,160;53:30,120;"Yeah, I got him in a walker."
53:30,120;53:33,880;"Just no regard for their safety whatsoever."
53:33,880;53:35,600;"- And they give him snaps at running back."
53:35,600;53:36,840;"I don't blame him for one."
53:36,840;53:39,960;"- Yeah, that's an interesting dynamic to that, right?"
53:39,960;53:43,440;"It's like they're giving him snaps at running back,"
53:43,440;53:46,560;"which we know like short running back snaps"
53:46,560;53:48,080;"these shortest careers, yeah."
53:48,080;53:49,640;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:49,640;53:51,360;"And he's probably just going along with it"
53:51,360;53:55,000;"because he wants to win, but at some point"
53:55,000;53:56,680;"that needs to get consideration."
53:56,680;53:57,520;"- Yeah, I don't know."
53:57,520;53:59,000;"and I'm making shit."
53:59,000;53:59,840;"- Yeah, it's true."
53:59,840;54:04,480;"So Steve, last week, Greg, you were in here for this."
54:04,480;54:08,240;"We saw Tom Brady throw a completion too."
54:08,240;54:10,520;"Do you remember who it was, Steve?"
54:10,520;54:11,640;"- Patrick Bass."
54:11,640;54:14,300;"- No, it was the backup tight end."
54:14,300;54:19,060;"- Oh, Jed Weaver."
54:19,060;54:21,120;"- Yes, I think that's who it was."
54:21,120;54:23,480;"So somebody named Jed Weaver."
54:23,480;54:24,960;"- No, that's a picture."
54:26,520;54:29,560;"Also, I guess the place for the angels Tom Weaver, isn't it?"
54:29,560;54:31,720;"That's a different picture."
54:31,720;54:34,280;"The Jed Weaver is a picture. All right."
54:34,280;54:35,080;"Jen apparently."
54:35,080;54:39,240;"Jed with a D for dumbass."
54:39,240;54:42,120;"Oh, Jared Weaver. I'm thinking Jared."
54:42,120;54:48,680;"Yeah. So he made a reception. I'd never heard of him."
54:48,680;54:52,920;"You know, I've been doing a lot of work with Tom Brady touch on past and stuff."
54:52,920;54:57,920;"I'm like one of the few people who have caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady who did not catch a touchdown."
54:57,920;55:04,720;"So I got curious to see how many people have caught a pass from Tom Brady,"
55:04,720;55:07,520;"but have not caught a touchdown pass from Tom Brady."
55:07,520;55:10,920;"And so I found the list of it. A couple questions for you."
55:10,920;55:18,120;"The first question is, which do you think is higher? The amount of people who have caught a pass from Tom Brady"
55:18,120;55:21,480;"who have not scored a touchdown or who have scored a touchdown?"
55:21,480;55:24,000;"Not scored a touchdown."
55:24,000;55:27,360;"Steve, I'm going to say scored a touchdown."
55:27,360;55:32,520;"He has thrown more touchdowns to he has thrown more passes to people who have"
55:32,520;55:33,960;"scored a touchdown than not."
55:33,960;55:35,480;"By how many?"
55:35,480;55:40,280;"He has thrown to 49 players who have not scored a touchdown."
55:40,280;55:42,240;"That's a low."
55:42,240;55:43,200;"Right."
55:43,200;55:44,480;"Can I name one?"
55:44,480;55:47,040;"Um, I bet you're probably"
55:47,040;55:47,880;"- Generally."
55:47,880;55:50,960;"- Steven Ridley is on that list, yes."
55:50,960;55:52,600;"(laughing)"
55:52,600;55:54,960;"- Look at your boy, look at your boy."
55:54,960;55:56,840;"- Can you name-- - Like on this podcast."
55:56,840;55:59,400;"- The Tom Brady has thrown touchdown passes"
55:59,400;56:01,640;"to 92 different receivers at the moment."
56:01,640;56:03,440;"And he has thrown-- - He was 92."
56:03,440;56:04,880;"- Yeah, I've done this foracle."
56:04,880;56:09,240;"So, but can you name the person who has the most"
56:09,240;56:13,720;"receptions without a touchdown pass from Tom Brady?"
56:13,720;56:15,040;"- Is it in his salon Ridley?"
56:15,040;56:16,760;"- It is not Steven Ridley."
56:16,760;56:18,360;"He is a fourth on the list."
56:18,360;56:24,840;"- I will for the top three, two of them play running back."
56:24,840;56:28,720;"And one of them is actually a wide receiver."
56:28,720;56:29,660;"- Lawrence Moroni."
56:29,660;56:34,920;"- Lawrence Moroni has, I think he caught one touchdown pass."
56:34,920;56:37,560;"- Patrick Pass."
56:37,560;56:38,920;"- He didn't fumble with that."
56:38,920;56:41,480;"- Patrick Pass has caught a touchdown pass."
56:41,480;56:43,960;"- He's having some count on playoffs."
56:43,960;56:45,520;"- Yep."
56:45,520;56:47,620;"I believe so. I believe I checked it for playoffs. Yeah."
56:47,620;56:49,920;"I'm pretty sure Heath Evans only has playoff touchdown."
56:49,920;56:53,520;"Yep, Heath Evans is not on this list."
56:53,520;56:59,420;"And I'm"
56:59,420;57:01,820;"got one. Yeah, I appreciate he's got one."
57:01,820;57:05,820;"Oh, yeah, he had one on screenplay against the Saints in 2001."
57:05,820;57:07,320;"It's a long one."
57:07,320;57:10,720;"Sammy Morris. Sammy Morris is number one."
57:13,120;57:17,200;"36 receptions, 36 receptions."
57:17,200;57:17,800;"No touchdowns."
57:17,800;57:21,880;"Because he was the running back on that 2007 team, right?"
57:21,880;57:24,760;"So we caught a bunch of balls, but he never actually scored a touchdown."
57:24,760;57:25,440;"I don't know."
57:25,440;57:26,320;"Only on that team too."
57:26,320;57:30,400;"Uh, yes, I believe he was."
57:30,400;57:30,560;"Yeah."
57:30,560;57:31,160;"Yeah."
57:31,160;57:38,960;"Uh, number two, uh, red, yep, Fred Taylor's on there, but he's number 16."
57:38,960;57:40,960;"Got four balls."
57:40,960;57:42,920;"Nice."
57:43,000;57:48,000;"Number two, law firm and Jarvis Greenhouse."
57:48,000;57:51,660;"28 catches 290 yards, zero touchdowns."
57:51,660;57:54,520;"And number three,"
57:54,520;57:55,880;"they had the fourth touchdown game."
57:55,880;57:57,480;"Is he on there?"
57:57,480;57:58,800;"- The Sonny Gray."
57:58,800;58:00,440;"- Oh, yeah."
58:00,440;58:01,640;"It was the name."
58:01,640;58:03,000;"- Sonny Gray."
58:03,000;58:05,880;"- Jonas Gray, one catch, seven yards."
58:05,880;58:07,160;"Jonas Gray."
58:07,160;58:10,280;"- Jonas, the lost Jonas brother."
58:10,280;58:11,680;"- Right."
58:11,680;58:16,680;"So number three, a recent guy who only caught a touchdown"
58:16,680;58:20,900;"well into his NFL career."
58:20,900;58:21,740;"- Jacobi."
58:21,740;58:23,840;"- Jacobi Myers, 25 catches."
58:23,840;58:26,120;"I believe he has the most yards."
58:26,120;58:28,560;"Yeah, Jacobi Myers is the most yards"
58:28,560;58:29,880;"without catching a touchdown."
58:29,880;58:30,720;"- Oh, hot take."
58:30,720;58:33,120;"Jacobi Myers, you have 100 catch seasons here."
58:33,120;58:37,280;"- Well, Jacobi has, didn't he have like the NFL record"
58:37,280;58:39,280;"for most yards before catching a touchdown?"
58:39,280;58:40,840;"- Oh, yeah, I believe he did."
58:40,840;58:42,680;"Yeah. And the most receptions are something as well."
58:42,680;58:43,440;"Yeah."
58:43,440;58:46,240;"And that other dude came in and caught like two in his first game."
58:46,240;58:47,680;"Yeah."
58:47,680;58:48,200;"That's a fuck."
58:48,200;58:49,200;"He'd chill out."
58:49,200;58:56,920;"Also, I was a funny, funny story about that too is back to that story of me missing"
58:56,920;58:58,320;"that goal in that soccer game."
58:58,320;59:03,480;"You are just removing the kid, another kid on the team who had played a ton,"
59:03,480;59:06,120;"but had never scored."
59:06,120;59:10,480;"And he came up after me after the game was like, did you had scored that after"
59:10,480;59:11,960;"I've played all these years and that's cried."
59:11,960;59:12,880;"I would have been so pissed."
59:12,880;59:16,280;"Yeah, I just do that."
59:16,280;59:16,840;"Yeah."
59:16,840;59:18,000;"Yeah."
59:18,000;59:19,600;"I feel that."
59:19,600;59:20,720;"I'm not a guy Greg."
59:20,720;59:21,240;"Mr."
59:21,240;59:21,840;"No, on purpose."
59:21,840;59:22,160;"Yeah."
59:22,160;59:23,480;"I'm just a good teammate."
59:23,480;59:24,480;"Great locker room guy."
59:24,480;59:25,840;"You get the air, the glue."
59:25,840;59:26,800;"Mm hmm."
59:26,800;59:27,360;"That's true."
59:27,360;59:30,280;"Also on this list, uh, so any Michelle,"
59:30,280;59:33,400;"JR Redmond, Leshan McCoy, the next top ones."
59:33,400;59:36,960;"And, uh, boy was on the Patriots."
59:36,960;59:37,920;"No."
59:39,400;59:43,700;"Differently from the Buccaneers, but so caught a bunch of balls, but never petitioned"
59:43,700;59:45,700;"14 catches."
59:45,700;59:51,140;"Also, I think the longest the person who played with Tom Brady, the longest never"
59:51,140;59:56,200;"catch a touchdown would be Matthew Slater caught one ball, 46 yarder."
59:56,200;59:57,920;"Bomb."
59:57,920;59:59,460;"What year was that?"
59:59,460;01:00:01,580;"Uh, that's a very question."
01:00:01,580;01:00:02,340;"Let me see if I can find it."
01:00:02,340;01:00:05,020;"Um, I'm pretty sure we have the highlight in the"
01:00:05,020;01:00:06,940;"Was it against Denver in that playoff game?"
01:00:06,940;01:00:09,860;"No, 2011, I believe it was against Miami."
01:00:09,860;01:00:14,740;"Oh, wait, that's not that's a defensive play."
01:00:14,740;01:00:19,620;"His receiving isn't listed until way down less."
01:00:19,620;01:00:24,100;"OK, games receiving one catch 46 yards, 2011."
01:00:24,100;01:00:27,060;"Well, I'm excited for that."
01:00:27,060;01:00:29,020;"Yeah, so we'll get to that eventually."
01:00:29,020;01:00:33,500;"It was quite a catch, I will say."
01:00:33,500;01:00:43,420;"target one catch. He's got 11 at Miami. I believe it was the same game with Wes Welkers 99."
01:00:43,420;01:00:50,060;"I touched down. It was that game. So not too, not too bad. Another name game in Miami."
01:00:50,060;01:00:56,060;"Yeah, I suppose it's true. Was that in Miami? Yes. I think so."
01:00:56,060;01:01:01,580;"So not too bad. All right. Anything else on this game, boys? Let's do the best and worst."
01:01:01,580;01:01:03,060;"I get a lot. All right."
01:01:03,060;01:01:04,580;"Then I think Steve, you should go first."
01:01:04,580;01:01:06,740;"Well, let me go first because I only have one."
01:01:06,740;01:01:07,900;"Greg, you go first."
01:01:07,900;01:01:09,100;"All right."
01:01:09,100;01:01:10,060;"All right."
01:01:10,060;01:01:13,780;"My worst is Harrison spearing that dude."
01:01:13,780;01:01:15,100;"Yeah, that play."
01:01:15,100;01:01:16,260;"That was pretty dirty."
01:01:16,260;01:01:20,220;"It was because although to be fair,"
01:01:20,220;01:01:23,260;"in the previous game against the Bengals,"
01:01:23,260;01:01:27,820;"he did almost the exact same thing except the guy wasn't ruled down."
01:01:28,020;01:01:31,260;"Um, cause the fumble, which the Patriots recovered and then turned it into a touchdown."
01:01:31,260;01:01:34,680;"As the bangles were driving into the red zone."
01:01:34,680;01:01:36,420;"Well, in that case, so"
01:01:36,420;01:01:39,620;"throwing it by the sword,"
01:01:39,620;01:01:43,020;"brown and snowman into a man's back as he's lying face down on the ground."
01:01:43,020;01:01:43,520;"Yeah."
01:01:43,520;01:01:44,020;"Yeah."
01:01:44,020;01:01:45,020;"That was a little."
01:01:45,020;01:01:47,220;"Jesus dude."
01:01:47,220;01:01:47,720;"Chill."
01:01:47,720;01:01:48,420;"Yeah."
01:01:48,420;01:01:49,220;"Bureau."
01:01:49,220;01:01:54,460;"Um, my best was, I don't know if you guys saw this, but"
01:01:55,140;01:01:58,840;"Falk got like absolutely blasted,"
01:01:58,840;01:02:01,200;"just running a little bubble screen thing."
01:02:01,200;01:02:04,780;"Dropped the ball, it was like a blind side thing."
01:02:04,780;01:02:06,380;"And then he just like popped up quickly"
01:02:06,380;01:02:07,700;"and like dap the guy up."
01:02:07,700;01:02:08,780;"I just thought it was pretty sweet."
01:02:08,780;01:02:09,620;"- Yeah, he did it."
01:02:09,620;01:02:10,660;"(laughing)"
01:02:10,660;01:02:11,600;"- Falk's the man."
01:02:11,600;01:02:14,020;"- Yeah, Kevin's awesome."
01:02:14,020;01:02:16,060;"- WD-33."
01:02:16,060;01:02:16,900;"- That's right."
01:02:16,900;01:02:19,660;"- Keeping that offense matriculating down the field."
01:02:19,660;01:02:22,140;"All right, Steve, what's your best and worst?"
01:02:22,140;01:02:23,780;"- I have lots."
01:02:23,780;01:02:24,620;"- Okay."
01:02:24,620;01:02:26,220;"Do you want me to go first?"
01:02:26,220;01:02:27,420;"I'm going to get started then."
01:02:27,420;01:02:28,220;"Okay."
01:02:28,220;01:02:28,720;"All right."
01:02:28,720;01:02:29,720;"I'll go."
01:02:29,720;01:02:30,720;"All right."
01:02:30,720;01:02:31,720;"Mmm."
01:02:31,720;01:02:35,220;"The worst was the Brady pick break."
01:02:35,220;01:02:36,220;"Not even the last one."
01:02:36,220;01:02:38,820;"The number two or whatever it was."
01:02:38,820;01:02:43,740;"Where you just didn't throw it right to the safety and then they had personal fall on"
01:02:43,740;01:02:44,740;"top of that."
01:02:44,740;01:02:46,500;"Oh yeah, that's right on the return."
01:02:46,500;01:02:48,900;"Oh, now like not great."
01:02:48,900;01:02:50,700;"I get a lot of bests."
01:02:50,700;01:02:51,700;"Oh, okay."
01:02:51,700;01:02:54,700;"We talked about Stephen Neal."
01:02:54,700;01:02:58,700;"He wrestled Ricky Williams in college."
01:02:58,700;01:03:00,700;"Yeah, and beat him."
01:03:00,700;01:03:03,700;"Well, yeah, the did one two NCAA championships."
01:03:03,700;01:03:05,700;"I think he was undefeated in college as well."
01:03:05,700;01:03:06,700;"Like he just never lost."
01:03:06,700;01:03:08,700;"He's an absolute beast wrestler."
01:03:08,700;01:03:09,700;"Yeah."
01:03:09,700;01:03:14,700;"And he waited three years after college to go get an agent and try and go to that."
01:03:14,700;01:03:17,700;"Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's three years."
01:03:17,700;01:03:18,700;"Yeah."
01:03:18,700;01:03:19,700;"And there's like, you know what?"
01:03:19,700;01:03:24,660;"like, I want to play football. So there you go. There's a there's an instance of somebody"
01:03:24,660;01:03:32,020;"taking a few years off. Yeah, not six. I'm Kaepernick, but three. Three, yeah. But I guess he had zero"
01:03:32,020;01:03:40,660;"NFL playing experience before that too. Exactly. The another best was the Dolphins sweet,"
01:03:40,660;01:03:42,900;"Sweet double reverse pass"
01:03:42,900;01:03:46,980;"And their execution on that one. Yeah, they"
01:03:46,980;01:03:50,580;"Hey, what is it because the commentators"
01:03:50,580;01:03:57,780;"Spoiler my best commentators. I'll Michael's John Madden another fucking John Madden game. I love John Madden now"
01:03:57,780;01:04:03,940;"Wow how far you've come in you're welcome. I know I was just this"
01:04:03,940;01:04:06,740;"I mean it's not mad"
01:04:06,740;01:04:08,580;"- Yeah. - And on the praise."
01:04:08,580;01:04:10,460;"- Oh man, it's great."
01:04:10,460;01:04:14,460;"But yeah, so he was talking about how you shouldn't be having"
01:04:14,460;01:04:16,980;"players who don't do hand-offs, making hand-offs,"
01:04:16,980;01:04:20,540;"because this is what happens and they fumble the hand-off."
01:04:20,540;01:04:21,380;"- Yeah."
01:04:21,380;01:04:22,220;"- On the other hand- - And players are right."
01:04:22,220;01:04:24,140;"You're receiving hand-offs, receiving hand-offs,"
01:04:24,140;01:04:25,940;"especially from players who are not using hand-guit-offs,"
01:04:25,940;01:04:27,060;"now you get a double."
01:04:27,060;01:04:28,820;"- Exactly, that's what he was saying."
01:04:28,820;01:04:31,580;"- Yeah, yeah, John Madison, man."
01:04:31,580;01:04:33,260;"- He's intense Will Fork, just belly flop"
01:04:33,260;01:04:34,820;"on that football too, it was amazing."
01:04:36,180;01:04:40,700;"the Dolphins at this point has scored 13 points in the third quarter."
01:04:40,700;01:04:42,700;"All the season games."
01:04:42,700;01:04:48,900;"I'll have their best quarter historically and to be further"
01:04:48,900;01:04:53,980;"scored a touchdown in the third quarter week 15 and you got 14 or 13"
01:04:53,980;01:04:54,500;"for them."
01:04:54,500;01:04:57,460;"It was week 14 and yeah, 13 points in the third."
01:04:57,460;01:04:59,220;"It's funny."
01:04:59,220;01:05:00,980;"They got to touch down and so they're good."
01:05:03,140;01:05:10,500;"And then my two best bests are the videos they had of both Mike"
01:05:10,500;01:05:17,860;"Rebel for some reason they're featuring him. Yeah. And because he went back to college to get his"
01:05:17,860;01:05:22,900;"degree because he had one class. Yes. And he said if you can have one nickname, what's it going to be?"
01:05:22,900;01:05:32,740;"And he said, how would we call money Mike Rebel? Which that's ridiculous. It's so bad. It's like a"
01:05:32,740;01:05:37,940;"fast Willy Parker. Yeah, yeah, yeah. To be fair, he was fast. I don't know."
01:05:37,940;01:05:44,180;"Ravel's money. So money, dude. Money, Mike. Money, Mike."
01:05:44,180;01:05:51,220;"And then the one with Jason Taylor. Mm hmm. Talking about how great Tom Brady was."
01:05:51,220;01:05:55,620;"Yeah, he's like, I know Manning's got all the stats, but Brady's a winner. So if I had to start a team,"
01:05:55,620;01:05:59,220;"I'm definitely picking Brady. Yeah, did you say like, I would just throw a bunch of money at Tom"
01:05:59,220;01:06:07,420;"He's a man. Awesome. All about Tom Brady and I love it. Secretly love him. So fair enough."
01:06:07,420;01:06:19,220;"Yeah. All right. I will do this because my best of this New England team more on Troy"
01:06:19,220;01:06:23,780;"list to down on the field and Michelle to Foya Michelle. Yeah. All the Patriots team"
01:06:23,780;01:06:28,980;"philosophy is simple. Each player knows his role and nobody cares who gets the credit."
01:06:28,980;01:06:32,540;"Troy Brown is getting a little extra credit from his teammates this season"
01:06:32,540;01:06:37,020;"for contributing in every phase of the game. He is the team's third all-time"
01:06:37,020;01:06:41,580;"leading receiver and yet he's tied for the team lead in interceptions this season."
01:06:41,580;01:06:46,200;"Not only that he's a regular on special teams. In fact Tom Brady told me earlier"
01:06:46,200;01:06:51,100;"this season no one has been better than Brown."
01:06:51,100;01:06:56,420;"It's fun for us to watch him because to think that a pro-ball receiver could go"
01:06:56,420;01:07:00,720;"over and played defense and played away he's played."
01:07:00,720;01:07:02,020;"What a lift it's provided."
01:07:02,020;01:07:05,620;"What it shows is that nobody is afraid to do anything."
01:07:05,620;01:07:08,100;"Nobody is afraid to try to help the team."
01:07:08,100;01:07:11,020;"Nobody's afraid to go out there and do anything they can"
01:07:11,020;01:07:12,020;"to contribute."
01:07:12,020;01:07:14,860;"I mean, he's been a best player in this team for a long time."
01:07:14,860;01:07:17,420;"It's still the same way it is."
01:07:17,420;01:07:20,220;"- I asked Brown, which is the tougher position to play,"
01:07:20,220;01:07:21,940;"wide receiver or quarterback?"
01:07:21,940;01:07:24,420;"He said, corner back by far."
01:07:24,420;01:07:27,460;"And he said he thought Al that it would get easier over the course of the season,"
01:07:27,460;01:07:32,220;"but it's only getting tougher as teams continue to collect tape and figure out how he's playing."
01:07:32,220;01:07:36,780;"Troy Brown, he has been, as I say, the embodiment,"
01:07:36,780;01:07:40,500;"very much so of this New England paint tree, a team, whatever you need,"
01:07:40,500;01:07:43,260;"somebody seems to step up and New England will get the ball first."
01:07:43,260;01:07:45,420;"So Lindo Mari will kick off for Miami."
01:07:45,420;01:07:49,460;"So I mean, maybe that should just be the intro of our podcast."
01:07:50,820;01:07:54,840;"Just have a Monday night crew talking about how great Tom Brady is."
01:07:54,840;01:07:59,900;"But Troy Brown is and with Tom Brady talking about how Troy Brown is the best"
01:07:59,900;01:08:01,220;"player on the Patriots."
01:08:01,220;01:08:02,460;"I agree with that."
01:08:02,460;01:08:04,020;"Phenomenal way to start a football game."
01:08:04,020;01:08:05,100;"That is nice."
01:08:05,100;01:08:05,740;"Yeah."
01:08:05,740;01:08:09,140;"So that was that was my best by far."
01:08:09,140;01:08:15,300;"Um, also, I like the fact that we had a Sammy Morris sighting who would eventually"
01:08:15,300;01:08:18,860;"as we know, play for those Patriots, but not catch a touchdown from Tom Brady,"
01:08:18,860;01:08:20,060;"but he would rush for a few."
01:08:20,780;01:08:23,300;"I was always a big Sammy Morris fan when he came to the pets."
01:08:23,300;01:08:24,900;"I feel like he was on the arena."
01:08:24,900;01:08:27,500;"And I feel hot take a lot of Greg."
01:08:27,500;01:08:28,220;"This one's for you."
01:08:28,220;01:08:32,700;"OK, the Patriots, the reason that they didn't win the Super Bowl in 2007"
01:08:32,700;01:08:33,860;"is because Sammy Morris got hurt."
01:08:33,860;01:08:37,180;"And they just lost all semblance of a ground game."
01:08:37,180;01:08:40,900;"I think if they were able to still have Sammy Morris in there, he was super"
01:08:40,900;01:08:41,900;"effective."
01:08:41,900;01:08:43,900;"They would have won that Super Bowl."
01:08:43,900;01:08:45,060;"It's pretty hot take."
01:08:45,060;01:08:45,580;"There you go."
01:08:45,580;01:08:46,300;"It is hot."
01:08:46,300;01:08:47,020;"Yeah."
01:08:47,020;01:08:50,060;"So don't at me as they say."
01:08:50,060;01:08:53,860;"And also I feel like we're doing this."
01:08:53,860;01:08:55,340;"That take was mid bro."
01:08:55,340;01:08:58,660;"I feel like we're doing this on a regular basis."
01:08:58,660;01:09:00,780;"I think this is going to be a segment."
01:09:00,780;01:09:02,540;"You didn't understand that did you Steve?"
01:09:02,540;01:09:03,860;"I didn't get it at all."
01:09:03,860;01:09:05,740;"You told mid me is always said."
01:09:05,740;01:09:07,220;"Mid that take you."
01:09:07,220;01:09:11,980;"That's like the new way kids are calling things like"
01:09:11,980;01:09:14,020;"me, or lady, or lame."
01:09:14,020;01:09:15,220;"Something is mid."
01:09:15,220;01:09:17,780;"I'm more of a bus and guy."
01:09:17,780;01:09:18,780;"How many?"
01:09:18,780;01:09:19,780;"(laughing)"
01:09:19,780;01:09:21,780;"- Boston rules, dude."
01:09:21,780;01:09:23,780;"I gotta give you that one."
01:09:23,780;01:09:26,780;"- I use it incorrectly, but I like it."
01:09:26,780;01:09:27,780;"- No kidding."
01:09:27,780;01:09:29,780;"- I like it if something's busy."
01:09:29,780;01:09:32,780;"Like, oh, this place is busing, you know?"
01:09:32,780;01:09:33,780;"It's like, it's a lack of a line."
01:09:33,780;01:09:35,780;"- Busting at the seams, yeah."
01:09:35,780;01:09:36,780;"- Yeah, really."
01:09:36,780;01:09:37,780;"- Not unexpectedly good."
01:09:37,780;01:09:38,780;"- Ah, typical."
01:09:38,780;01:09:43,780;"- All right, but yeah, I wanted to, uh, bus in with the boys, me and the dogs hanging out,"
01:09:43,780;01:09:44,780;"or busing around."
01:09:44,780;01:09:45,780;"- Yeah, food can be busing."
01:09:45,780;01:09:46,620;"- Boston, yeah."
01:09:46,620;01:09:47,700;"- Oh yeah, anything you can do Boston."
01:09:47,700;01:09:49,540;"- This fucking burger is Boston."
01:09:49,540;01:09:51,340;"(laughing)"
01:09:51,340;01:09:52,160;"God damn it."
01:09:52,160;01:09:54,380;"- We're in New York and Ellie didn't even know what it meant."
01:09:54,380;01:09:55,740;"- It's getting old."
01:09:55,740;01:09:57,700;"- And I was like, come on, Ellie."
01:09:57,700;01:09:59,700;"And then like a couple of days later,"
01:09:59,700;01:10:01,980;"she sends me a screenshot from one of her teachers saying,"
01:10:01,980;01:10:04,260;"oh, this three coffee place is giving out coffee,"
01:10:04,260;01:10:05,100;"it's busted."
01:10:05,100;01:10:07,820;"(laughing)"
01:10:07,820;01:10:09,700;"- And Steve's like, it means dizzy."
01:10:09,700;01:10:11,540;"(laughing)"
01:10:11,540;01:10:13,140;"- That's what I realized that it was wrong,"
01:10:13,140;01:10:13,980;"I had to go."
01:10:13,980;01:10:16,300;"Oh, shit. That's why it's supposed to use it."
01:10:16,300;01:10:19,180;"Oh, shit. That's awesome."
01:10:19,180;01:10:23,380;"Yeah. So while speaking of bussing, I want to do a new segment."
01:10:23,380;01:10:26,820;"It's about bussing with the Browns."
01:10:26,820;01:10:28,460;"Sure. Oh, yeah."
01:10:28,460;01:10:32,900;"I like this. Get a jingle for that, Billy bussing."
01:10:32,900;01:10:38,100;"Because it's basically how was Bill Belichick a genius in this game?"
01:10:38,100;01:10:40,460;"So it's going to be Greg's favorite. Yeah."
01:10:42,020;01:10:42,980;"Because we had something last week."
01:10:42,980;01:10:44,660;"I don't know what it was, you, Steve."
01:10:44,660;01:10:46,060;"Something last week."
01:10:46,060;01:10:47,860;"Yeah, but it was something about Bill Bellechek being a genius."
01:10:47,860;01:10:51,700;"So this week, Bill Bellechek rolled out something"
01:10:51,700;01:10:53,780;"that John Madden had never seen before."
01:10:53,780;01:10:56,060;"And when you've done that to John Madden,"
01:10:56,060;01:10:58,820;"I think you can qualify that as something that's genius."
01:10:58,820;01:11:00,740;"In this case, he rolled out a defense"
01:11:00,740;01:11:05,860;"with zero defensive lineman because the Dolphins decided"
01:11:05,860;01:11:08,220;"that they weren't going to run the ball."
01:11:08,220;01:11:10,380;"Probably because they had Sammy Morris end."
01:11:10,380;01:11:11,580;"Who was the other guy?"
01:11:11,580;01:11:13,660;"Travis Minor, I believe, for the two running backs."
01:11:13,660;01:11:14,220;"Yeah."
01:11:14,220;01:11:17,700;"Um, so the page, we're just not going to respect the, because they, they weren't"
01:11:17,700;01:11:20,300;"throwing the ball on, or they weren't running the ball in first and so they put"
01:11:20,300;01:11:24,900;"out six linebackers and five defensive backs and go off the field every single"
01:11:24,900;01:11:27,060;"time that they, they rolled that out."
01:11:27,060;01:11:33,180;"So, and it was one of those things where they had, you know, nobody, um, in a three"
01:11:33,180;01:11:35,980;"point position, like everybody was standing around, milling around like they do."
01:11:36,500;01:11:40,460;"the the amoeba defense, but also with no Lyman, which"
01:11:40,460;01:11:42,760;"John Madden was"
01:11:42,760;01:11:45,500;"the age is uncommon, but right."
01:11:45,500;01:11:48,700;"I would kind of expect to see that in today's day and age, because nobody runs"
01:11:48,700;01:11:51,820;"up anyway. There's get some pass for us specialists out there."
01:11:51,820;01:11:57,440;"But I think that checks kind of going the other way, where he is phasing out"
01:11:57,440;01:11:58,440;"linebackers altogether."
01:11:58,440;01:12:03,400;"And I think he's going to do what the Dutch did in the 70s and play total football"
01:12:04,160;01:12:07,320;"and have a positionless defense and everybody's going to be a safety."
01:12:07,320;01:12:11,960;"And oversized safety who can cover and also tackle and also Russa"
01:12:11,960;01:12:15,040;"passion. So how's that for a hot take, Greg?"
01:12:15,040;01:12:18,400;"Positionals defense. Stop listening."
01:12:18,400;01:12:21,840;"I want to hear the knowledge."
01:12:21,840;01:12:22,640;"Check genius."
01:12:22,640;01:12:25,200;"Be how much of a blubbering little bitch."
01:12:25,200;01:12:25,960;"Who egg you?"
01:12:25,960;01:12:31,800;"Dolphins, 20 carries 52 yards."
01:12:31,800;01:12:32,960;"Not great."
01:12:33,080;01:12:33,680;"That's what I mean."
01:12:33,680;01:12:35,080;"You touched down, still."
01:12:35,080;01:12:40,120;"Did you know that Jason Taylor married Zach Thomas's wife?"
01:12:40,120;01:12:42,040;"What?"
01:12:42,040;01:12:43,040;"Yeah."
01:12:43,040;01:12:45,440;"But his wife sister."
01:12:45,440;01:12:46,280;"Sorry."
01:12:46,280;01:12:50,640;"I was going to say I didn't didn't Zach Thomas and Kevin"
01:12:50,640;01:12:54,120;"Euclid have a family member in common or something like that."
01:12:54,120;01:12:56,240;"Brady Brady."
01:12:56,240;01:12:58,360;"Was it all the most married Brady sister?"
01:12:58,360;01:13:00,040;"Yeah, that's what it was."
01:13:00,040;01:13:00,560;"All right."
01:13:00,800;01:13:05,200;"Also, Jason Taylor's sister is Joy Taylor from the Colin Coward show."
01:13:05,200;01:13:06,400;"Yeah. You don't know that?"
01:13:06,400;01:13:08,120;"No. Oh, yeah."
01:13:08,120;01:13:09,200;"I don't know who that is."
01:13:09,200;01:13:12,560;"It's like the second host."
01:13:12,560;01:13:13,600;"Yeah."
01:13:13,600;01:13:14,440;"The Colin Coward."
01:13:14,440;01:13:17,560;"Where he's always tell you, he's always like, Joy, Joy, I got something to say, Joy."
01:13:17,560;01:13:18,680;"Yeah."
01:13:18,680;01:13:20,360;"No, I was Colin Coward."
01:13:20,360;01:13:23,040;"Don't don't play dumb with me."
01:13:23,040;01:13:25,760;"We know see it because we had."
01:13:25,760;01:13:28,640;"No, wait, no, does she work?"
01:13:28,640;01:13:32,240;"We had that guest on who worked for Colin Coward."
01:13:32,240;01:13:34,880;"Really? Manufactured the hot takes for him, yeah."
01:13:34,880;01:13:36,000;"Yep."
01:13:36,000;01:13:37,360;"Oh, cool. What did he say?"
01:13:37,360;01:13:41,200;"We were just like, how the hell do you like, do you actually believe these hot takes?"
01:13:41,200;01:13:43,280;"And they said, you know, they don't."
01:13:43,280;01:13:44,080;"Right."
01:13:44,080;01:13:46,480;"They all they care about is getting people riled up."
01:13:46,480;01:13:48,560;"Tonya refox, that's who it was."
01:13:48,560;01:13:49,600;"That's right."
01:13:49,600;01:13:52,720;"That's interesting."
01:13:52,720;01:13:55,680;"She also shared Steve's hate for Brett Favre though."
01:13:55,680;01:13:56,640;"So they bonded on that."
01:13:56,640;01:13:57,520;"Yes."
01:13:57,520;01:14:04,480;"And she relayed a story of Brett Favre not knowing what a cover to defense was. He didn't understand the idea of cover"
01:14:04,480;01:14:09,520;"- That was one of the playoff episodes, I feel like, of the 2000."
01:14:09,520;01:14:13,520;"- No, I don't remember. I thought it was the Green Bay episode. That's why we're talking about Brett Favre."
01:14:13,520;01:14:17,520;"- I don't know. Maybe. - Yeah."
01:14:17,520;01:14:20,320;"- Because in so many fucking episodes, I can't keep them straight."
01:14:20,320;01:14:22,080;"- There have been a lot of episodes. This is correct."
01:14:22,080;01:14:23,040;"- How many are we on right now?"
01:14:24,560;01:14:27,560;"84 or something like that mid 80s."
01:14:27,560;01:14:30,920;"Hey, Kelly, you're live on the pod."
01:14:30,920;01:14:32,600;"Okay."
01:14:32,600;01:14:35,040;"I just want to say hi."
01:14:35,040;01:14:37,160;"Yeah, I want to say anything for the fans."
01:14:37,160;01:14:39,400;"I love you."
01:14:39,400;01:14:41,000;"I miss you so much."
01:14:41,000;01:14:42,440;"Kelly, what you have for dinner tonight?"
01:14:42,440;01:14:43,240;"All right."
01:14:43,240;01:14:44,000;"Bye, Kelly."
01:14:44,000;01:14:47,200;"Oh, goodness."
01:14:47,200;01:14:48,200;"All right."
01:14:48,200;01:14:50,760;"I think on that note, it's just, hey, yeah, we we are."
01:14:50,760;01:14:51,760;"Appreciate that."
01:14:54,120;01:14:56,880;"On that note, do you have anything else you'd like to talk about in this game?"
01:14:56,880;01:14:59,800;"What's next week?"
01:14:59,800;01:15:02,000;"Next week."
01:15:02,000;01:15:05,080;"Pages travel to giant stadium"
01:15:05,080;01:15:09,200;"to play the New York football jets."
01:15:09,200;01:15:11,640;"Yeah. Next week is going to be Boston."
01:15:11,640;01:15:15,120;"Boston, the 10 and four New York jets coming in."
01:15:15,120;01:15:16,440;"Oh, yeah."
01:15:16,440;01:15:21,160;"Four o'clock game, Sunday, the day after Christmas boxing day."
01:15:21,840;01:15:24,240;"Well, that's pretty mid 2004."
01:15:24,240;01:15:27,880;"You're pretty mid you fucking goober."
01:15:27,880;01:15:32,320;"Yeah, let's make an effort for next week to see if we can get a little younger"
01:15:32,320;01:15:35,320;"demo going here and start using some fucking slang."
01:15:35,320;01:15:35,560;"All right."
01:15:35,560;01:15:36,640;"Some TikTok slang."
01:15:36,640;01:15:38,880;"Yeah, I'm all over it."
01:15:38,880;01:15:39,600;"Yeah."
01:15:39,600;01:15:41,800;"Steve's busting over it."
01:15:41,800;01:15:43,080;"It's spicy."
01:15:43,080;01:15:46,480;"This is going to go well."
01:15:46,480;01:15:47,200;"I can feel it."
01:15:47,200;01:15:48,600;"All right."
01:15:48,600;01:15:54,760;"boy be blessing. I'd be buzzing every day. Goodness. And on that"
01:15:54,760;01:15:59,560;"note, until we see you next week or whenever we record another"
01:15:59,560;01:16:02,000;"episode, we will see you later."

00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,000;"I am not your mother."
00:18,000;00:27,120;"Welcome back to the Page of Staunancy Podcast."
00:27,120;00:31,520;"Here 2003 week 14 closing on the end of the regular season and"
00:31,520;00:35,220;"We haven't seen a loss in a long time boys"
00:35,220;00:39,880;"It's right. It's being kind of nice. How many in roses?"
00:39,880;00:42,720;"this is"
00:42,720;00:48,860;"They come into this game with eight consecutive wins last time we saw a loss was week four in Washington"
00:48,860;00:50,960;"to the"
00:50,960;00:54,240;"One third of the way through right is 23"
00:54,880;00:57,660;"Believe it's 21 or 23. I can't remember"
00:57,660;01:03,120;"So on a third roughly a third we're cruising through. Yeah, but this is"
01:03,120;01:10,440;"Yet another game that our listeners will remember at least one play from"
01:10,440;01:16,960;"And maybe only one play I only remembered the one play, but we'll get to that. Yeah, but we have"
01:16,960;01:21,360;"the Miami Dolphins visiting Gillette Stadium"
01:22,200;01:25,420;"And also Mother Nature visiting Hangella at Stadium"
01:25,420;01:33,380;"Because the commentators in this game could not get over the fact that New England had received 28 inches of snow"
01:33,380;01:41,180;"It was a pretty good dump. Yeah, but this I think is an all-time"
01:41,180;01:48,480;"Crowdshot game. Oh, yeah, that's why it's a people literally just dug themselves it like you couldn't see the seat"
01:48,480;01:54,280;"So they just like dug a seat in the two feet of snow and just sat on that and it was fucking amazing"
01:54,280;01:57,840;"Just like watching the people try to get to their seats and just like"
01:57,840;02:02,600;"Sliding down all the the snowbanks and stuff just trying to like find somewhere to plop themselves"
02:02,600;02:12,460;"We always wondered that about big snowstorms. How do you it's gonna be a logistical nightmare to shovel those with the seats and everything"
02:12,460;02:17,400;"Well, I think what happened is it dumped the snow right before during the day right because they were saying like"
02:17,400;02:19,000;"We didn't even get that much in Boston."
02:19,000;02:21,200;"We got like a foot and then we get there and it's two feet."
02:21,200;02:23,400;"So it's snowed a shit little more south."
02:23,400;02:24,080;"Yeah."
02:24,080;02:26,600;"Imagine route one during all that shit to."
02:26,600;02:30,600;"I feel like I've heard stories of people who went to this game"
02:30,600;02:34,600;"and they said, you know, normally getting home takes two hours."
02:34,600;02:36,480;"This one, it took like four and a half."
02:36,480;02:38,440;"Just because of that."
02:38,440;02:39,040;"A parking lot."
02:39,040;02:41,280;"It didn't snow during the game as much though."
02:41,280;02:43,760;"No, there wasn't there was a lot of snow happening."
02:43,760;02:47,160;"Like it was happening at the beginning of the game, but it tapered off."
02:47,160;02:50,600;"Which honestly, like right after the storm can actually be kind of nice."
02:50,600;02:52,600;"Oh yeah, cause I was so quiet."
02:52,600;02:56,000;"I love the way that the snow just like muffles all the sounds."
02:56,000;02:57,000;"Beautiful."
02:57,000;02:58,680;"Let's see, what was the weather?"
02:58,680;02:59,920;"They showed the weather at the beginning."
02:59,920;03:06,040;"It was 28 degrees, wind chill was 17, winds of 15 to 30 miles an hour."
03:06,040;03:08,400;"Yeah, ends game was long as shit."
03:08,400;03:10,560;"It was two hours on that YouTube."
03:10,560;03:13,600;"Let's give it a, let's give it a Lombardi watchability score."
03:13,600;03:16,800;"Alright, well first of all, I want to know Greg, did you watch the entire game?"
03:16,800;03:18,800;"What would you do highlights?"
03:18,800;03:19,800;"Highlights."
03:19,800;03:20,800;"Alright, yeah."
03:20,800;03:21,800;"I don't believe it."
03:21,800;03:22,800;"I mean, it's..."
03:22,800;03:24,800;"Final score is 12 to nothing."
03:24,800;03:25,800;"Yeah."
03:25,800;03:29,800;"I'll watch the few plays that probably are good to watch."
03:29,800;03:31,800;"But I don't have to see the rest."
03:31,800;03:36,800;"I like a defensive battle."
03:36,800;03:41,800;"Even having said this, I think you could skip..."
03:41,800;03:42,800;"First three course."
03:42,800;03:44,800;"First half."
03:44,800;03:45,920;"You know what I wish I could do?"
03:45,920;03:49,600;"Just skip all the offensive plays and just watch the defense snap to snap to snap."
03:49,600;03:52,640;"Because like when the past is on, it was pretty impressive."
03:52,640;03:53,760;"Yes."
03:53,760;03:59,040;"Yeah, this was I actually wrote down this was the."
03:59,040;04:06,080;"I've never seen a Patriots defense as amped up as in this game."
04:06,080;04:11,520;"Like it's sort of every tackle was like an absolute monster hit."
04:11,800;04:16,680;"And that as soon as the guy, the tackler got up, he like everybody was jumping on, like"
04:16,680;04:20,680;"slapping his helmet and just like everybody was just amped to the nines."
04:20,680;04:21,720;"It was ridiculous."
04:21,720;04:24,560;"It seemed like they're coming off the Colts game there."
04:24,560;04:25,640;"That's true."
04:25,640;04:29,800;"And also this is if they win this game, they clench their"
04:29,800;04:30,800;"AFC East as well."
04:30,800;04:33,720;"So it's a hat and T-shirt game."
04:33,720;04:37,280;"But the defense is so like dominant to them."
04:37,280;04:41,200;"Like this game, the Dallas game, the even like the indie game they held Peyton"
04:41,200;04:45,120;"really good. It's like they're playing out of their minds. It looks similar to the"
04:45,120;04:49,760;"Patriots defense last year, 19 at the first half of the season. First half of the season."
04:49,760;04:54,920;"They couldn't do shit against them. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, this is their second"
04:54,920;05:01,120;"shutout of the year. Is that right? They had a stat in this game. They crossed 50"
05:01,120;05:05,440;"possessions with no TDs at home. Yes. These possessions are given up a touchdown at home."
05:05,440;05:11,040;"Yeah. Well, they showed it. It was 48 when Miami lined up at their own"
05:11,040;05:18,180;"four-yard line right before the infamous play. But let's see, they've had two shut"
05:18,180;05:23,460;"out so far, this one and then the Cowboys, both 12-0, strangely enough. I think"
05:23,460;05:28,740;"there might be another one at the end of the season. Yeah, they held the Giants."
05:28,740;05:33,780;"They held the Giants at six points and they held a brown so three points, which"
05:33,780;05:36,260;"Just feel like ages ago."
05:36,260;05:39,700;"So one, two, three, four, five games"
05:39,700;05:42,300;"have given up a total of nine points."
05:42,300;05:43,380;"But Dan is."
05:43,380;05:45,900;"And these are all against like good teams too."
05:45,900;05:49,540;"They showed a stat about,"
05:49,540;05:52,460;"did I take a screenshot of that one?"
05:52,460;05:54,260;"There's something about like the Patriots"
05:54,260;05:56,940;"versus teams with, oh yeah,"
05:56,940;05:59,540;"Patriots versus teams with winning records this year."
06:00,660;06:05,220;"six and oh, they beat Philadelphia 31 10 beat Tennessee."
06:05,220;06:05,980;"That was a good game."
06:05,980;06:09,140;"The 38 31 beat Miami and over time."
06:09,140;06:13,060;"So actually now there's seven of no, because it beat Miami again, beat Denver,"
06:13,060;06:14,540;"beat Dallas beat indie."
06:14,540;06:18,060;"Well, the Denver games, the intentional safety game to right."
06:18,060;06:18,580;"Yeah."
06:18,580;06:21,100;"The indie game is the fourth down stop."
06:21,100;06:21,860;"Yeah."
06:21,860;06:23,660;"Tennessee game, the one 38 30."
06:23,660;06:26,660;"That was with, uh, wasn't that tie law at the end to seal it?"
06:26,660;06:27,420;"Yeah."
06:27,420;06:30,500;"Where he lived as well in the end zone after after picking it off."
06:30,500;06:33,620;"Was a dolphins game the overtime bomb to Troy Brown? Yep"
06:33,620;06:40,540;"So none of these are the only blowout really was Philadelphia 31 10 coming off of the 31 nothing drubbing week one"
06:40,540;06:46,360;"Yes, yeah, so so but there Brady's been playing his best against these winning teams as well"
06:46,360;06:49,540;"And verse those six teams"
06:49,540;06:56,140;"He's averaging 259 yards per game he's thrown 11 touchdowns only three interceptions"
06:56,620;07:00,880;"Which is pretty good because actually throwing a handful of interceptions this season like double digits"
07:00,880;07:02,880;"But only three against the good teams"
07:02,880;07:09,220;"It's pass ratings 95 and a half. So that's pretty good dolphins on the other hand not so good"
07:09,220;07:11,340;"At least not in the weather"
07:11,340;07:17,980;"there was a whole bunch of thing about Miami teams playing the weather and I think those are my favorite games when Miami comes to New England in"
07:17,980;07:19,980;"December"
07:19,980;07:25,780;"Because they're always just woefully and prepared for some yeah, everybody looked cold except for junior say-ow"
07:26,260;07:30,220;"Yes, he did not let cold it on but you love it and don't this look freezing"
07:30,220;07:34,060;"But in the globe, I think it was the day before the game"
07:34,060;07:37,660;"They had a little chart of all the games"
07:37,660;07:45,200;"Of the dolphins having played in Foxborough 10 times after December 1st"
07:45,200;07:50,580;"And of those 10 games they have won only three of them. So not not great and also"
07:53,140;08:00,220;"Miami since 97 playing games under 50 degrees which apparently is cold for Miami team. They are three and ten"
08:00,220;08:05,420;"Lost five straight and their turnover difference negative 21"
08:05,420;08:12,700;"13 butter fingers in the cold that's a lot. Yeah, they just well, it's probably has something to do with"
08:12,700;08:18,660;"The under inflated footballs in New England. Yeah, you know, yeah, yeah"
08:18,660;08:21,340;"They do save those for the cold games"
08:22,460;08:27,820;"That's true. You want that competitive advantage edge until it really counts. Yep. Just just like me saving my"
08:27,820;08:30,820;"my under-inflated tires this morning"
08:30,820;08:39,100;"For the winter. Yeah, this is appropriate for the the current climate these days. Yeah, it's very true"
08:39,100;08:41,620;"Shut up Texas. Yeah"
08:41,620;08:45,380;"It's getting more snow than us up here in New England right now"
08:45,380;08:50,540;"Yeah, it feels very apropos, isn't it? There's a lot of internet chatter about"
08:51,300;09:00,200;"People being better or worse than other people because of their tolerance for difficult weather which which there's nothing better, you know."
09:00,200;09:01,080;"Oh yeah."
09:01,080;09:04,100;"One of my favorite internet."
09:04,100;09:08,500;"I mean that's why the basic arrogance over tolerance of weather is the best."
09:08,500;09:12,980;"I mean I do that with you guys now because you've both grown soft having moved to the south."
09:14,020;09:19,020;"-I feel like, ""God, it's 30 degrees. Let's baton the hatches."""
09:19,020;09:21,280;"-It's all relative, Andy."
09:21,280;09:22,800;"-T-shirt weather, baby."
09:22,800;09:23,500;"-Mm-hmm."
09:23,500;09:26,600;"-Right, it's all weather, but that's not going to stop me"
09:26,600;09:28,040;"from giving you shit about it, right?"
09:28,040;09:29,500;"-Yeah, but you know--"
09:29,500;09:30,380;"-Only fair."
09:30,380;09:31,440;"-It makes you a bitch."
09:31,440;09:34,700;"-Well, the warm weather's made you a big thing"
09:34,700;09:35,980;"is what you meant to say."
09:35,980;09:37,940;"-Dude."
09:37,940;09:39,940;"-Cold rain, there's nothing worse."
09:39,940;09:42,060;"-No, cold rain is the worst."
09:42,060;09:45,660;"Yeah, but it's got to be like just above free then like 35."
09:45,660;09:50,180;"I feel like the dolphins think that snow is the worst though because they did not"
09:50,180;09:50,860;"like this game."
09:50,860;09:55,100;"They did not actually I wanted to bring up the the drive chart in this game."
09:55,100;09:57,740;"Oh, we didn't actually give it a long watchability."
09:57,740;09:58,900;"Yeah."
09:58,900;10:03,340;"You know, I'd probably give it higher than you would think."
10:03,340;10:04,340;"So you go first."
10:04,340;10:09,180;"I would give it a three and a half."
10:11,140;10:15,380;"You can probably convince me to give it a four just because of the memorable play."
10:15,380;10:20,740;"And the slow and the I was going two and a half."
10:20,740;10:20,940;"Right."
10:20,940;10:24,020;"I was going to see a boss in the bar and a David."
10:24,020;10:25,340;"Well, nothing game."
10:25,340;10:25,780;"Yeah."
10:25,780;10:27,060;"Yeah, it was not super."
10:27,060;10:31,420;"I like I like defensive shutouts like this."
10:31,420;10:32,780;"I know this is my jam."
10:32,780;10:34,580;"So they're off and it's like so trash."
10:34,580;10:37,300;"Yeah, so sad watching Antoine Smith just not."
10:37,300;10:39,500;"That was a game plan, though."
10:39,500;10:42,380;"We're on his ass up the middle until he fucking gets full off."
10:42,380;10:45,020;"-He likes to mow up in ugly games, but that doesn't mean it's not ugly, you know?"
10:45,020;10:45,220;"-Yeah."
10:45,220;10:47,420;"-27 for 60 yards."
10:47,420;10:50,060;"The average 2.2 yards you carry."
10:50,060;10:51,020;"-And he had a couple of more. -Yeah, a couple of more."
10:51,020;10:52,020;"-How did Rick Williams do that?"
10:52,020;10:54,220;"-The key points, but yeah."
10:54,220;10:58,220;"-I think he didn't do much better, but he did do better."
10:58,220;11:03,500;"Miami had 134 total yards of offense in this game."
11:03,500;11:04,140;"-Yeah."
11:04,140;11:06,540;"Like I said, just give me the pages defensive plays."
11:06,540;11:08,940;"I love it because they were dominating."
11:08,940;11:14,600;"That's what I mean. Yeah, so just yeah, just fast forward through the pay as soon as pay to get the ball as fast forward to that shit"
11:14,600;11:18,500;"And then wait till the defense comes on because here are"
11:18,500;11:24,420;"The I'm gonna just get a real quick. Give you the drive chart of the dolphins on the day"
11:24,420;11:33,340;"They give you the the yards that they gained and then the end result. So five yards punt five yards punt six yards punt"
11:33,340;11:35,660;"30 yards punt"
11:35,660;11:40,780;"- three yards punt two yards punt 25 yards punt minus one yards punt and"
11:40,780;11:45,620;"Then we're in the third quarter by the way. So this is one of their third drive third quarter"
11:45,620;11:47,620;"They actually got moving 41 yards"
11:47,620;11:52,260;"And then they fumbled it and then - when you are punt 7 yard punt"
11:52,260;12:01,140;"Zero yards interception return for touchdown nine yards punt zero yards interception - one yard safety to end it. Mm-hmm. That's a good"
12:01,140;12:04,300;"Cherry on the yeah"
12:04,700;12:06,700;"That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:06,700;12:07,540;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:07,540;12:08,380;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:08,380;12:09,220;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:09,220;12:10,220;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:10,220;12:11,220;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:11,220;12:12,060;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:12,060;12:12,900;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:12,900;12:13,740;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:13,740;12:14,580;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:14,580;12:15,420;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:15,420;12:16,260;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:16,260;12:17,100;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:17,100;12:17,940;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:17,940;12:18,780;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:18,780;12:19,620;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:19,620;12:20,460;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:20,460;12:21,300;"- That's what I was like shit sandwich."
12:21,300;12:25,620;"we'd up to that Teddy one because everyone remembers it for that one Teddy interception."
12:25,620;12:27,620;"But this could be an absolute blow."
12:27,620;12:29,660;"Willie McGinnis almost had a diving interception."
12:29,660;12:30,300;"Yeah."
12:30,300;12:31,980;"I think was supposed to be a screenplay."
12:31,980;12:37,020;"Like there was like a little outcro of the tight end, I think, kind of in the flat"
12:37,020;12:38,260;"and he's yeah, some play."
12:38,260;12:39,900;"And that was the fourth miss."
12:39,900;12:42,660;"I put a note fourth near I and T by Willie."
12:42,660;12:43,580;"Yep."
12:43,580;12:46,420;"Feeder three for three and I and T on nearly every drive."
12:46,420;12:49,580;"So this is like the fourth golfins drive and he almost was a pick on all of them."
12:49,580;12:50,540;"Yeah."
12:50,740;12:54,820;"And I think, uh, as I say, Samuel took one between the what number was he?"
12:54,820;12:55,540;"I don't even remember."
12:55,540;12:56,420;"He was too."
12:56,420;12:56,780;"Yeah."
12:56,780;12:57,540;"He took it."
12:57,540;12:59,740;"He took a football between the twos that he couldn't catch."
12:59,740;13:03,740;"There was one that hit a defender in the hands, bounced up in the air and the"
13:03,740;13:05,740;"dolphins guy caught it for like a 34 yard."
13:05,740;13:07,340;"I love that."
13:07,340;13:09,900;"That yeah, that was the 30 yards of their 41 yard."
13:09,900;13:11,060;"That's the only drive they had."
13:11,060;13:11,900;"And it was because of that."
13:11,900;13:12,420;"Yeah."
13:12,420;13:18,700;"And that's one of the like the only times they moved the ball and we had a pick at that"
13:18,700;13:18,900;"point."
13:18,900;13:25,720;"So like we had so many chances in the finally fucking somebody catches one of these and it's their player. Yeah, they're still hanging in there"
13:25,720;13:30,140;"But yeah, this it was basically"
13:30,140;13:33,700;"Nothing until that third quarter"
13:33,700;13:36,500;"Patience put up a field goal. What a mat Turk"
13:36,500;13:42,380;"lot of that Turk also also or like Matt jerk a lot of"
13:42,380;13:44,620;"Brooks Bernard"
13:44,620;13:49,540;"Barnard Barnard Barnard Barnard the barnyard animal the barnyard. Yeah"
13:49,540;13:56,540;"A street free agent up until this week, but they got so sick of Ken Walter like you know what fuck it cut numb"
13:56,540;13:59,580;"We're gonna find a guy after street cuz you can't be doing any worse"
13:59,580;14:06,460;"And he didn't but this guy's first fucking game comes in and only has to punt 10 times in a snowstorm. No"
14:06,460;14:09,540;"The crazy wind"
14:09,660;14:15,740;"Oh, my game ball goes to this guy. He played out of his mind. Not every pot was great, but no"
14:15,740;14:18,560;"But his first putt when he had his first pot"
14:18,560;14:24,780;"I was like a mediocre putt but he got a standing. Oh when he did it because he wasn't Ken Walter"
14:24,780;14:33,020;"Dude, this is his only game ever career career. Yeah. Oh shit. Yeah. So only putt next week"
14:33,020;14:38,900;"I don't know what happens of Brooks because we'll find out. Yeah, it was alright. Yeah. I looked him up on"
14:38,900;14:40,700;"on LinkedIn."
14:40,700;14:42,020;"He was involved in it."
14:42,020;14:43,020;"- LinkedIn?"
14:43,020;14:45,100;"- Yeah, he's a VP of policy."
14:45,100;14:48,220;"He's like a, he's a good underarmored"
14:48,220;14:49,380;"doing sports marketing."
14:49,380;14:51,340;"- And did you connect with him?"
14:51,340;14:53,420;"- Well, once we release this, I'm gonna send it"
14:53,420;14:54,820;"to him on LinkedIn, but like, hey buddy,"
14:54,820;14:55,820;"we talked about it."
14:55,820;14:57,180;"- More appropriate."
14:57,180;14:59,460;"Are you gonna do that from Kelly's account?"
14:59,460;15:01,100;"'Cause I think that's what we do on this podcast."
15:01,100;15:03,820;"- I should actually go to Kelly's."
15:03,820;15:06,140;"Barnard, the Barnard dog."
15:06,140;15:08,380;"(laughing)"
15:08,380;15:09,380;"Yeah."
15:09,380;15:10,380;"Great."
15:10,380;15:11,380;"He's making these up."
15:11,380;15:15,960;"So his first one, he got a standing O in the second punt, bounced the end zone and he"
15:15,960;15:17,800;"immediately got booed."
15:17,800;15:19,800;"And he fucking tough crowd."
15:19,800;15:25,200;"But he also made that Teddy an I and T on some level because he punted and got him out"
15:25,200;15:26,200;"with five yard line."
15:26,200;15:27,200;"Oh, yeah."
15:27,200;15:28,200;"Yeah."
15:28,200;15:29,200;"Yeah."
15:29,200;15:35,400;"But some of the ripples of Ken Walter being gone is that Damon Hewards now holding for"
15:35,400;15:37,480;"field goals."
15:37,480;15:40,140;"- No, that..."
15:40,140;15:42,500;"It didn't look great."
15:42,500;15:45,300;"Adams only, he kicked one field goal,"
15:45,300;15:47,020;"but it went over the goal post."
15:47,020;15:49,060;"- I've never seen something so close, by the way."
15:49,060;15:51,980;"That went directly over the goal post."
15:51,980;15:54,260;"- Yeah, which technically apparently is good"
15:54,260;15:57,660;"as long as the ball stays inside the outside of the goal post."
15:57,660;15:59,060;"- We feel like, oh, good luck telling me."
15:59,060;16:01,900;"- How do you not have goal line technology for that?"
16:01,900;16:04,660;"- I mean, it's 2003."
16:04,660;16:05,980;"- You don't even have wide-stemming like now."
16:05,980;16:07,060;"- They could barely get the yellow..."
16:07,060;16:08,620;"Oh, now, yeah."
16:08,620;16:10,700;"Yeah, now just the point you're fucking lasers up."
16:10,700;16:12,900;"If it pretty seems like all those problems"
16:12,900;16:14,380;"are really easy to solve."
16:14,380;16:17,820;"Yeah, like the, you know, QB sneaks at the one"
16:17,820;16:19,660;"or the close to first down."
16:19,660;16:22,940;"Like they have it in soccer and tennis."
16:22,940;16:24,380;"Yeah, we have to go."
16:24,380;16:25,700;"We have to go over to do it."
16:25,700;16:27,060;"Yeah, where's the var?"
16:27,060;16:29,620;"But I mean, also how long did it take them"
16:29,620;16:32,780;"to put cameras on the pylons that Bellachek wanted?"
16:32,780;16:35,660;"They finally got that this."
16:35,660;16:37,580;"- This smells like a conspiracy."
16:37,580;16:38,860;"- It is, yeah, I agree, Greg."
16:38,860;16:40,980;"- It's because Tom Brady is so good at Cubie sneaks,"
16:40,980;16:41,820;"like, you know what, no,"
16:41,820;16:43,820;"we don't want to give him that advantage."
16:43,820;16:46,300;"If he will know and he will practice."
16:46,300;16:48,380;"And so we don't need that."
16:48,380;16:50,180;"- Either that or it'll cost the owners"
16:50,180;16:52,500;"like an extra 10K a year to do it."
16:52,500;16:55,300;"- No, no, not doing it."
16:55,300;16:56,820;"- That's actually good."
16:56,820;16:58,780;"- If the players want to pay for it, that's fine."
16:58,780;16:59,700;"- Yeah."
16:59,700;17:00,540;"- Yeah."
17:00,540;17:02,260;"We'll bring it up the next collective bargain."
17:02,260;17:03,100;"- Exactly."
17:03,100;17:05,060;"(laughs)"
17:05,060;17:05,980;"Oh, man."
17:05,980;17:07,820;"Yes."
17:07,820;17:10,020;"So if we can, if anybody out here, anybody"
17:10,020;17:11,940;"listening knows Brooks Bernard, the"
17:11,940;17:13,820;"hard yard, we got some on LinkedIn."
17:13,820;17:14,300;"All right."
17:14,300;17:17,300;"But yeah, if anybody can get us a hookup,"
17:17,300;17:19,500;"we'll have a mod and we'll talk to football."
17:19,500;17:21,460;"Because I mean, how cool is it to be like a"
17:21,460;17:24,220;"street free agent come in and like be the"
17:24,220;17:25,060;"punter for this game?"
17:25,060;17:26,620;"And that's like, that's it."
17:26,620;17:27,620;"That's it."
17:27,620;17:29,820;"Like, I would pay money for that."
17:29,820;17:32,900;"Like, I'm not going to say I can outpunt Brooks"
17:32,900;17:34,780;"Barnard, but I could probably outpunt Ken Walter."
17:34,780;17:36,820;"- No. - No."
17:36,820;17:37,740;"- Good punter."
17:37,740;17:39,380;"- No. (laughs)"
17:39,380;17:40,740;"- You're not any type of punter."
17:40,740;17:43,340;"- 10 waltz are punting at 20 yards."
17:43,340;17:46,540;"You've never punted at any shape."
17:46,540;17:47,380;"- A punter, yeah. - Yeah."
17:47,380;17:49,380;"- Well, yeah. - That's a hard nobody."
17:49,380;17:50,220;"(laughs)"
17:50,220;17:51,140;"- How could it be?"
17:51,140;17:53,860;"- Well, we'll ask Brooks when he comes on."
17:53,860;17:54,700;"- Yeah, okay."
17:54,700;17:55,540;"- Yeah, we'll ask."
17:55,540;17:56,380;"- We'll get an expert on."
17:56,380;17:57,300;"We'll settle this."
17:57,300;17:58,380;"- Yeah, exactly."
17:58,380;18:03,100;"- Also on that kind of punt field goal team,"
18:03,100;18:07,020;"something that will come up later. Lonnie Paxson gets hurt in this game."
18:07,020;18:11,220;"Yes, I've been sort of keep my eye on this all year. Mm hmm."
18:11,220;18:15,980;"Because I can't, I still can't find that story about the"
18:15,980;18:19,980;"duty gets put in service here. I found it. You dead? Yep."
18:19,980;18:22,620;"I'm just keeping on the back burner until it comes up. Let's bring"
18:22,620;18:24,820;"that up in the Super Bowl because I remember that's where I came to"
18:24,820;18:27,420;"head. But this is where he gets injured and he's out for the rest of"
18:27,420;18:31,580;"the year. And he gets injured after Brooks Bar and pretty decent"
18:31,580;18:34,940;"punt to their 44. He commits a holding penalty. Look pretty clear."
18:34,940;18:39,140;"In gets injured on the play and then wrote us a punt again from the back of his own end zone."
18:39,140;18:42,340;"And it's a 20 yard swing, you know, Brooks. That should be better."
18:42,340;18:49,180;"I agree. I agree. But this is also, I don't know if you call this the reason that Tom Brady has a punt."
18:49,180;18:53,780;"His first punt. He has multiple. Did he have not ready?"
18:53,780;18:57,260;"Paunted. He did. He punted in the fourth quarter."
18:57,260;19:02,260;"It actually set up the safety because he punted down"
19:02,260;19:06,920;"to the one yard line, down by much maligned Daniel Graham,"
19:06,920;19:09,560;"who I think dropped another three or four passes in this game."
19:09,560;19:10,920;"Yeah, bad hands. Yeah."
19:10,920;19:13,160;"Like on screens, like just hitting them right in the hand"
19:13,160;19:14,160;"and just skipping right out."
19:14,160;19:15,860;"That was Givens. No."
19:15,860;19:19,880;"And now just said it was Graham, but it may have been Givens."
19:19,880;19:21,360;"I think he was a minor senior."
19:21,360;19:22,760;"I mean, he just went. Yeah. Yeah."
19:22,760;19:25,960;"But great, great."
19:25,960;19:29,320;"punt team. I actually a pretty good putt. Yeah, I snapped."
19:29,320;19:30,520;"I did to Greg. Come on."
19:30,520;19:33,760;"We did Greg. Yeah."
19:33,760;19:39,160;"Watch it now. Yeah, send a bunch of people. But speaking of"
19:39,160;19:44,680;"injuries, no Troy Brown in this. He was inactive again. So"
19:44,680;19:49,880;"Kevin Falk was playing the Troy Brown role, I think, of just"
19:49,880;19:52,840;"kind of being that smartest guy in the field sort of thing."
19:53,200;19:58,200;"- No, early, early Dynasty MVP, Kevin Fauci."
19:58,200;20:00,880;"- All right, let's actually dig in this because"
20:00,880;20:02,760;"I get why he's saying this,"
20:02,760;20:04,160;"but I have a counterpoint,"
20:04,160;20:05,560;"not that I don't like Kevin Fauci,"
20:05,560;20:07,640;"or maybe even disagree with your stance."
20:07,640;20:09,400;"- Would you like me to present my argument"
20:09,400;20:10,600;"that you can counter it?"
20:10,600;20:11,400;"- I already know your argument,"
20:11,400;20:12,880;"you've been talking about it for weeks."
20:12,880;20:14,520;"- No, but in this one,"
20:14,520;20:16,480;"he is doing the Troy Brown stuff."
20:16,480;20:18,560;"Like he didn't put up big numbers."
20:18,560;20:20,000;"- He has a fumble too."
20:20,000;20:22,600;"- Because you got knocked the fuck out on a dirty hit."
20:22,600;20:24,080;"- Oh yeah, that's what I was saying."
20:24,080;20:25,160;"- He got not out of it."
20:25,160;20:27,180;"- Which, actually, okay."
20:27,180;20:29,980;"That's a good little segue."
20:29,980;20:33,560;"- Oh. - Member us."
20:33,560;20:34,720;"Oh yeah."
20:34,720;20:36,080;"It's that time in the podcast"
20:36,080;20:38,320;"where I'm gonna start talking about the--"
20:38,320;20:39,160;"- The announcers?"
20:39,160;20:40,440;"- The announcers, yes."
20:40,440;20:41,920;"- They were good."
20:41,920;20:47,240;"- They were okay, except for this."
20:47,240;20:48,880;"- ""Folk is up and off the field."""
20:48,880;20:51,720;"The good news is, he's up and off the bad news is,"
20:51,720;20:54,440;"Kevin Falk thinks he's Marshall Falk is up."
20:54,440;20:56,520;"That's awesome."
20:56,520;20:57,840;"Yeah, it's awesome."
20:57,840;20:58,720;"Yeah, come on in."
20:58,720;20:59,640;"It's 2003."
20:59,640;21:01,800;"Yeah, that's good."
21:01,800;21:02,600;"Conventating."
21:02,600;21:03,160;"Yeah."
21:03,160;21:04,600;"I don't think so."
21:04,600;21:06,240;"I don't think that's why it is."
21:06,240;21:07,280;"Oh, why?"
21:07,280;21:09,040;"Because it's problematic, bro."
21:09,040;21:11,160;"Because he got knocked the fuck out."
21:11,160;21:13,040;"So I think it's funny."
21:13,040;21:14,760;"I don't know."
21:14,760;21:15,480;"That's rough."
21:15,480;21:18,360;"We didn't even know what CTE was."
21:18,360;21:21,600;"Dude, he was he was lying on the field stiff as a bore with his arms."
21:21,600;21:25,620;"like stuck out like this. It was a time it was a bad one. You"
21:25,620;21:30,100;"got his bell wrong. Well, according to the bossing globe,"
21:30,100;21:35,300;"the injury report Patriots running back Kevin Falk wind knocked"
21:35,300;21:39,820;"out did not return. When knocked out of what is fucking"
21:39,820;21:43,180;"crani front frontal lobe."
21:43,180;21:49,220;"But like it was a bad those were the highlights on sports"
21:49,220;21:50,820;"center of those big hits like that though, you know,"
21:50,820;21:55,820;"True, but is a different just the fact that he was like he was laying there with his arms like"
21:55,820;22:01,540;"Stuck it's actively funny. Okay, because their cousins and they have the same last name"
22:01,540;22:06,020;"Yeah, and Marshall Paul's big name at the time too. He's not like thrown back to Marshall folk"
22:06,020;22:15,340;"Don't talk about my Kevin Falk like that. All right, so here's my counter going don't get me wrong. I love Kevin Falk"
22:16,300;22:18,300;"But he never has like big plays"
22:18,300;22:21,860;"He's very dependable in you know"
22:21,860;22:26,700;"Short-term and like less than 15 year plays couple screens that go along"
22:26,700;22:29,500;"But never has any like big play never a soft long runs"
22:29,500;22:35,580;"He never like you know take catches a wheel round tastes the house counter to your counterpoint neither does Julian element"
22:35,580;22:41,280;"No Julian has big plays Julian element is the engine that keeps drives going"
22:41,280;22:45,260;"He doesn't have big plays. He had the biggest play for the Patriots this year"
22:45,260;22:47,520;"- This one."
22:47,520;22:49,720;"- The one against Seattle, remember that one?"
22:49,720;22:50,940;"That crazy catch."
22:50,940;22:54,520;"That was a Patriots longest play from scrimmage all year."
22:54,520;22:55,960;"- Jesus."
22:55,960;22:57,160;"- But I don't think that's a good thing."
22:57,160;22:59,680;"That's like say, Kevin Falcon's your leading rusher"
22:59,680;23:03,280;"on the year, like that's not what you want, you know?"
23:03,280;23:04,440;"- That's a fair point."
23:04,440;23:05,680;"- Yeah."
23:05,680;23:07,240;"- But I think Kevin Falcon,"
23:07,240;23:09,640;"'cause I mean, there's always that one guy."
23:09,640;23:11,560;"First it's Troy Brown, then it's Kevin Falcon,"
23:11,560;23:16,560;"And I'd say you could probably throw James White in that."
23:16,560;23:19,420;"Maybe even a Dion Lewis back in the day."
23:19,420;23:24,180;"But there's always that one guy when you need that conversion"
23:24,180;23:25,320;"or you just need a couple of yards,"
23:25,320;23:27,240;"like the drives have been stalling"
23:27,240;23:29,480;"and you're not getting anywhere."
23:29,480;23:31,400;"The one guy is gonna jumpstart things"
23:31,400;23:32,560;"and always be dependable."
23:32,560;23:33,720;"And he'll get you the first down."
23:33,720;23:35,640;"He's not gonna be flashy about it."
23:35,640;23:38,640;"That's the Dion branch to the world of the rainy mosses."
23:38,640;23:41,240;"But to get that first down or even Wes Walker,"
23:41,240;23:42,240;"Same idea."
23:42,240;23:45,600;"Those guys that just kind of keep things moving,"
23:45,600;23:49,200;"keep drives alive so that Brady can then go take shots at."
23:49,200;23:51,340;"- So WD-40."
23:51,340;23:52,640;"- I love it."
23:52,640;23:54,040;"- I'm not disagreeing, but I'm off at the--"
23:54,040;23:55,880;"- WD-33."
23:55,880;23:56,720;"- No?"
23:56,720;23:57,760;"- WD-33."
23:57,760;24:01,960;"We just made up a sick nickname after a player has retired."
24:01,960;24:02,800;"- Yeah."
24:02,800;24:03,640;"- Damn it, stood."
24:03,640;24:05,400;"Nah, fuck it, we're making T-shirts."
24:05,400;24:07,240;"- We started like 10 years ago, dude."
24:07,240;24:09,440;"- WD-33."
24:09,440;24:10,280;"That's sick."
24:10,280;24:12,040;"That's sick. All right."
24:12,040;24:16,200;"We'll save that for the next player who fits that role."
24:16,200;24:19,080;"Maybe they'll be a gun or all chef ski or someone."
24:19,080;24:21,200;"Yeah."
24:21,200;24:26,480;"But yeah, so a, but Troy, uh, Kevin fog in his game, he,"
24:26,480;24:30,080;"he was returning punts sometimes."
24:30,080;24:31,480;"It was him and Tyrone pool."
24:31,480;24:35,840;"And I think he was like the hands guy and Tyrone pool was like supposed to be"
24:35,840;24:36,640;"the returner guy."
24:37,560;24:41,320;"So one punt that was about to go in the end zone."
24:41,320;24:45,840;"Uh, Kevin fall came over and like pretended to block the gunner."
24:45,840;24:47,640;"So the gunner paid attention to him."
24:47,640;24:49,020;"So the ball could roll into the end zone."
24:49,020;24:50,160;"Great heads up play."
24:50,160;24:52,200;"And then he also recovered."
24:52,200;24:54,880;"You can see answers credit for calling that out."
24:54,880;24:55,280;"Yep."
24:55,280;24:56,840;"And those answers in this that any, come on."
24:56,840;24:58,080;"You gotta be fair."
24:58,080;24:58,840;"Yeah."
24:58,840;25:04,800;"But then they also if I can make that joke that was made in the, wasn't that"
25:04,800;25:05,720;"a Snickers commercial?"
25:07,080;25:09,140;"The guy gets a concussion."
25:09,140;25:10,860;"It's a football player."
25:10,860;25:12,420;"It's like-- - Why you should not have"
25:12,420;25:14,420;"for not, for like, it's on commercials."
25:14,420;25:16,260;"Of course they're gonna make their jokes then Andy."
25:16,260;25:17,980;"Why is that a bad thing?"
25:17,980;25:19,620;"- That's a bad thing now."
25:19,620;25:21,060;"- Okay. - We're canceled"
25:21,060;25:21,900;"for now. - We're canceled"
25:21,900;25:22,740;"for now. - We're canceled"
25:22,740;25:24,000;"for it's a bad thing in this podcast,"
25:24,000;25:25,460;"we're gonna judge him now for it."
25:25,460;25:26,300;"- Yeah."
25:26,300;25:27,140;"He's not famous enough for that."
25:27,140;25:28,940;"- Yeah. - And I did it knowingly."
25:28,940;25:32,500;"- That's the difference."
25:35,580;25:39,900;"Yeah, at the end of this game, D-Trick Ward was returning puns, which is tough."
25:39,900;25:40,900;"D-Trick."
25:40,900;25:42,220;"D-Trick Ward."
25:42,220;25:44,060;"Well, Kevin also really neat."
25:44,060;25:44,580;"Pick up."
25:44,580;25:46,660;"It's neat."
25:46,660;25:49,500;"It's just so neat we could get that guy."
25:49,500;25:50,140;"Yeah."
25:50,140;25:51,980;"Even JJ Stokes."
25:51,980;25:56,260;"I'm forever going to associate D-Trick Ward with the word neat from here on out."
25:56,260;26:00,620;"Because of my exposure is going to be like these three games he's involved in."
26:00,620;26:02,020;"That's one quote."
26:02,020;26:05,340;"I mean, it's all the games he's really involved in too."
26:05,340;26:07,100;"Yeah, I don't think he plays much more."
26:07,100;26:08,940;"It's incredible, man."
26:08,940;26:14,580;"The fact that these people are trying to now dejerk word and JJ Stokes committing a million penalties."
26:14,580;26:17,220;"Yeah, and still make the Super Bowl."
26:17,220;26:22,300;"Yeah, like this, this offense was not great."
26:22,300;26:25,100;"And yeah, Annie and Tom Smith is back there as your lead back."
26:25,100;26:30,660;"Yeah, nothing in the tank who was apparently last week was an actor for the game."
26:30,660;26:33,060;"Well, that's because you're on the turf."
26:33,060;26:38,420;"Right. Yeah. Yeah. But you go from an actor to be in the starter. Like that's typical"
26:38,420;26:43,220;"Patriots shit, isn't it? I'm getting 30 carries. And you look at the offense and be like, Hey,"
26:43,220;26:46,740;"if we just have like a Corey Dillon type back in there, we'd be so good."
26:46,740;26:52,580;"It's true. It's so true. Because like the one thing they're missing is like an awesome"
26:52,580;26:55,140;"one game because there's a bunch of highlights from Clinton Portis."
26:55,140;26:59,460;"Oh, this. Yeah. So the game break for this was going back to the"
27:00,500;27:07,540;"Broncos Chiefs game because chiefs are in first place or game ahead of the Patriots, but they're playing a division game"
27:07,540;27:13,540;"Against the Broncos and it's priest Holmes verse. What's his face Clinton Portis? He was"
27:13,540;27:18,020;"In the Denver game we played earlier this year. Yeah, so they start off the game"
27:18,020;27:21,220;"Trading touchdowns. They both had two touchdowns each"
27:21,220;27:25,940;"Clinton Portis ended up winning this"
27:27,300;27:32,820;"battle of the running backs for going 22 for 22 carries, 218 yards, five touchdowns"
27:32,820;27:38,660;"to beat the chiefs, which put New England in first place in the AFC."
27:38,660;27:42,820;"But touchdowns were so sick too. What did he put? Just open field move on the safety."
27:42,820;27:47,540;"Austin has the sickest one. One, he just like accelerated the goal to the"
27:47,540;27:51,060;"pylon. No one can touch him. And the other one is just flat out speed."
27:51,060;27:54,980;"Yeah, like all his touchdowns were from like 30, 40 yards out."
27:54,980;27:59,860;"It didn't really have a short Wednesday. I don't think it's so sweet. I don't know. Yeah."
27:59,860;28:03,380;"Was it sunny there? Yeah. Yeah."
28:03,380;28:10,020;"You love a game break that has a different like. Yes. Weather. Yeah. You know, like,"
28:10,020;28:14,180;"like a different time of day. Like if you watch it and it's like getting towards like the,"
28:14,180;28:19,460;"like the nighttime games and doing them, then they cut to like a San Diego game or something"
28:19,460;28:24,500;"or San Francisco. It's like, Oh, look, it's noon. Yeah. And it cuts back and like,"
28:24,500;28:26,180;"like everyone's just wearing slop"
28:26,180;28:28,820;"'cause the field in to let suck at this point."
28:28,820;28:30,660;"- Which did you catch this?"
28:30,660;28:32,980;"The field is heated."
28:32,980;28:34,220;"- Yeah, I didn't see that."
28:34,220;28:35,460;"- Yeah, they have a heated field."
28:35,460;28:38,260;"They heated to 55 degrees like you would a pool."
28:38,260;28:39,100;"- Yeah."
28:39,100;28:41,740;"- That's fucking, I want a heated fucking field in my yard."
28:41,740;28:42,660;"- Oh, like clearly it didn't work."
28:42,660;28:44,380;"- That's amazing."
28:44,380;28:45,620;"Can I heat my driveway?"
28:45,620;28:47,940;"- Yes, yes I can."
28:47,940;28:49,100;"- Fuck it, but that's expensive."
28:49,100;28:50,260;"- You heat your floor of your bathroom too,"
28:50,260;28:51,380;"that's pretty common."
28:51,380;28:52,260;"- Yeah, I was gonna do it."
28:52,260;28:54,860;"Kelly's dad did the whole house."
28:54,860;28:55,760;"There you go."
28:55,760;28:57,340;"The whole house has heat of floors."
28:57,340;28:59,220;"Yeah, the whole entire thing."
28:59,220;29:00,380;"It's ridiculous."
29:00,380;29:01,660;"That's a lot."
29:01,660;29:02,740;"Yeah."
29:02,740;29:07,820;"They just ran like this runs like this small tubing in these grooves."
29:07,820;29:09,260;"And it's just the entire floor."
29:09,260;29:11,460;"They were up there in like the middle of December, putting it in."
29:11,460;29:12,180;"Holy shit."
29:12,180;29:13,700;"It's like this brittle tubing."
29:13,700;29:14,060;"Yeah."
29:14,060;29:14,580;"Yeah."
29:14,580;29:15,060;"Yeah."
29:15,060;29:16,420;"It's great to put it."
29:16,420;29:19,780;"He's like, yeah, Laurie was like getting blisters on her hands."
29:19,780;29:20,340;"And he's just like,"
29:22,060;29:23,560;"- Mush, mush, mush."
29:23,560;29:26,060;"- Mush, dicks their fingers in these groups."
29:26,060;29:27,060;"- Oh, boom."
29:27,060;29:28,860;"- It's like, ""God damn, Mr. Moody."""
29:28,860;29:31,780;"(laughing)"
29:31,780;29:32,620;"- Oh boy."
29:32,620;29:37,180;"- Speaking of whipping, the offense got whipped."
29:37,180;29:39,500;"- Yeah."
29:39,500;29:41,660;"So I wrote down--"
29:41,660;29:42,500;"- No."
29:42,500;29:43,900;"- Like that one, Eddie, come on."
29:43,900;29:47,060;"- I wrote down that the only player"
29:47,060;29:49,580;"who was staying warm today was Jay Fiedler"
29:49,580;29:52,600;"because the defense was bringing the heat on him,"
29:52,600;29:53,800;"the entire fucking game."
29:53,800;30:00,200;"But he was also four for 10 for 15 yards in the first half."
30:00,200;30:02,160;"- He just couldn't throw the ball into the wind at all"
30:02,160;30:04,400;"and they knew it and they were breaking on every single slant"
30:04,400;30:06,560;"or any kind of-- - They were, yeah."
30:06,560;30:07,880;"- Nobody was open."
30:07,880;30:10,400;"- Jake Field, they're not known for his arm strength."
30:10,400;30:13,320;"- Yeah, I know. - No, it was bad."
30:13,320;30:15,320;"- Yeah, the whole thing was bad."
30:15,320;30:17,680;"- But last week, they apparently like they came in on a high"
30:17,680;30:20,960;"because last week they the dolphins beat the shit out of the cowboys."
30:20,960;30:22,960;"Yeah. 41."
30:22,960;30:26,400;"They said they had five turnovers, five sacks."
30:26,400;30:28,080;"Like the I think it was a defensive thing."
30:28,080;30:36,240;"So it's I think these AFC teams are all defense heavy game manager offenses."
30:36,240;30:36,480;"Yeah."
30:36,480;30:37,760;"It's back when they were all good too."
30:37,760;30:39,080;"Like these games were big games."
30:39,080;30:39,920;"Yeah."
30:39,920;30:41,440;"Because I mean, the bills, same sort of thing."
30:41,440;30:44,920;"They had that that defense that we saw a week one that absolutely smoked the"
30:44,920;30:45,640;"Patriots."
30:45,640;30:47,320;"The Jets always have good defenses."
30:47,320;30:51,400;"I feel like that all falls apart for all three of them after the season."
30:51,400;30:53,520;"Pretty cool."
30:53,520;30:54,600;"I think the dolphins may have one more."
30:54,600;30:56,080;"We'll start falling off pretty soon for all."
30:56,080;30:56,280;"Yeah."
30:56,280;30:59,600;"Um, let's be a fall off Ricky Williams."
30:59,600;31:03,840;"We've talked about this because of he did his own contract."
31:03,840;31:04,760;"Yeah."
31:04,760;31:07,720;"He, I think he had the most rushing yards."
31:07,720;31:10,960;"He led the league last year with like 17 hundred or something like that."
31:10,960;31:15,200;"He's already over a thousand yards a season, but they're all like he's fallen off."
31:16,480;31:21,320;"Okay, you look fine. They just had three consecutive hundred yards games coming into this"
31:21,320;31:28,080;"And they're getting broken here, but like I think the reason they were saying he had fallen off was because"
31:28,080;31:33,820;"He went from averaging something like I think they may have shown it"
31:33,820;31:40,140;"Let's see if I took a screen just because he likes smoking wheat. They're trying to black bomb. I think"
31:40,140;31:42,880;"conspiracy again, but I think"
31:44,400;31:46,000;"Yeah, I didn't."
31:46,000;31:48,360;"But it was something like he was averaging last season."
31:48,360;31:52,360;"He averaged like 5.7 yards a carry on the season."
31:52,360;31:54,480;"And this year he's averaging like under four,"
31:54,480;31:56,400;"like three and a half."
31:56,400;31:58,320;"So it's taken him a whole lot more carries."
31:58,320;31:59,720;"- It's part Dave wants that fault."
31:59,720;32:01,560;"There's like a third in three"
32:01,560;32:03,920;"and they pass the feeler into the wind."
32:03,920;32:07,160;"And it's like, dude, can't throw it more than three yards."
32:07,160;32:08,520;"Why are you not running them?"
32:08,520;32:10,080;"They even the commentators call them out."
32:10,080;32:13,640;"- Which if you remember at the end of the season, last season,"
32:13,640;32:18,720;"He was backed up and he was winning and he'd already rushed for 170 something yards with"
32:18,720;32:19,720;"Ricky Williams."
32:19,720;32:21,600;"He decided to throw it three times like his own fucking end zone."
32:21,600;32:22,600;"Yes."
32:22,600;32:24,960;"Let the Patriots get to overtime."
32:24,960;32:25,960;"Yeah."
32:25,960;32:30,360;"So not really known for his more known for his mustache than his play calling."
32:30,360;32:31,360;"What call it?"
32:31,360;32:34,360;"Yeah, I would say so."
32:34,360;32:36,800;"So that's not great."
32:36,800;32:39,680;"But you know who was great in this game?"
32:39,680;32:40,680;"Teddy Bruce Key?"
32:40,680;32:49,040;"I was gonna say Rodney Harrison. Oh, yeah. Teddy Bruce key. Teddy Bruce key had a great play. Yeah. I would say Harrison and"
32:49,040;33:02,120;"Rebel where the top two, Rebel apparently had the flu all week hadn't practiced came to this game and absolutely was just like the most disruptive force on that defensive line."
33:02,120;33:07,560;"This is his best game of his career, I would think to this point to this point probably the first time you see him and like that's a"
33:07,560;33:11,560;"able you know. Yeah. And the games you've watched him and he hadn't been nearly as good as you"
33:11,560;33:15,480;"remember. You know, he's going to get there obviously, but this is the first game where he just looks"
33:15,480;33:22,600;"like a real problem for the tackles. Yeah. And Richard Seymour running stunts all day and then"
33:22,600;33:27,080;"just Richard had been doing that all the last two years at this point. Yeah. I just like,"
33:27,080;33:30,840;"because you know, when you think of Richard Seymour, you think of him just being like a big tall,"
33:30,840;33:36,440;"long dude batting down passes, running down quarterbacks. But every time they tried to run"
33:36,440;33:41,000;"him. They try to put two offensive linemen on him and push him and he just didn't move."
33:41,000;33:44,920;"It was a static because you think that would Ted Washington like, okay, yeah, you try to move"
33:44,920;33:49,880;"him that doesn't happen because he's like, you know, weighs as much as the three of us combined."
33:49,880;33:57,800;"Mount Washington. Yeah, Washington Monument. That's right. I don't have Richard Seymour Butts."
34:01,880;34:07,480;"But Seymour was actually also playing full back in this game due to an injury to Dan Klecko."
34:07,480;34:12,600;"And they just decided, you know what, fuck it, full back's not worth paying, so we'll just"
34:12,600;34:18,440;"plug it in Richard Seymour. Didn't look like a full back, I will say. But Rodney Harrison,"
34:18,440;34:24,920;"the commentators said that we're going to give Rodney an honorary neck roll and a number of the"
34:24,920;34:27,720;"50s because he's playing like a fucking linebacker. Yeah."
34:29,080;34:33,000;"Because the best part was his timing on the snap for so however he figured out"
34:33,000;34:37,560;"The snap count and his timing he would just come sprints like you're watching arena football"
34:37,560;34:41,640;"He's just running towards the line. Yeah, yeah that one guy in motion. Yeah, it's true"
34:41,640;34:44,040;"and he timed it perfectly every time"
34:44,040;34:47,880;"And there was I think there's one play where he did that and he timed it"
34:47,880;34:50,280;"But he got picked up by the running back"
34:50,280;34:55,800;"But the running back was running a screen and as soon as the running back didn't block runny harrison"
34:56,040;34:58,440;"the way that he Rodney thought he should."
34:58,440;35:02,040;"Yeah, right. It's like, awesome. Just grab the guy and just follow them."
35:02,040;35:05,000;"Let him catch the ball. Like, didn't knock it down. Let him catch the ball."
35:05,000;35:07,960;"And then just ragdoll him to the ground for like a two yard loss."
35:07,960;35:13,000;"It was amazing, Blake. It was pretty sweet. But Rodney actually,"
35:13,000;35:21,960;"the week before this game actually had some words with Randy McMichael, the Z-etto."
35:24,440;35:29,740;"Apparently, after the last game they played, the pages"
35:29,740;35:34,340;"when they won it over time, Michael called Rodney Harrison"
35:34,340;35:36,080;"dirty."
35:36,080;35:39,920;"And apparently this week, I found an article in the Sun"
35:39,920;35:42,740;"Sentinel said, and they're ongoing and seemingly endless"
35:42,740;35:43,760;"clash of boards."
35:43,760;35:46,040;"New England page with safety, Rodney Harrison,"
35:46,040;35:48,920;"had an idea last week for dolphins tied in random Michael."
35:48,920;35:51,080;"Quote, ""I think he just needs to basically shut up"
35:51,080;35:51,840;"and play football."""
35:51,840;35:56,120;"- What do you think you would have said"
35:56,120;35:58,280;"if he really said what he wanted to?"
35:58,280;35:59,280;"- Yeah."
35:59,280;36:00,680;"- Just fucking asshole."
36:00,680;36:01,560;"- What do you say to his friends?"
36:01,560;36:02,400;"Yeah."
36:02,400;36:03,840;"- What do you say to Michael?"
36:03,840;36:06,680;"'Cause I'm pretty sure they were chatting all game."
36:06,680;36:07,600;"- I didn't really notice it."
36:07,600;36:08,440;"I don't know."
36:08,440;36:09,720;"- I don't blame him."
36:09,720;36:11,800;"I don't blame either of them."
36:11,800;36:12,640;"- No, yeah."
36:12,640;36:15,200;"- If I was playing against Harrison,"
36:15,200;36:18,040;"I'd be fucking telling him he was dirty too."
36:18,040;36:18,880;"- Yeah."
36:18,880;36:19,720;"- You know?"
36:19,720;36:21,040;"'Cause he is."
36:21,040;36:22,040;"Yeah."
36:22,040;36:23,040;"All right."
36:23,040;36:24,040;"So here we go."
36:24,040;36:25,040;"This is where it's our..."
36:25,040;36:27,040;"Well, Harrison and McMichael say they have no dislike for each other."
36:27,040;36:31,280;"Their recent conversations through the media have made that difficult to understand."
36:31,280;36:35,200;"After McMichael caught eight passes in the dolphins 1913, over time, lost the Patriots"
36:35,200;36:36,840;"on October 19th."
36:36,840;36:39,160;"He called Harrison, quote, ""a dirty player."""
36:39,160;36:42,120;"For emphasis, he added, quote, ""He's a garbage player."""
36:42,120;36:43,120;"Ooh."
36:43,120;36:46,840;"McMichael's comments were prompted by Harrison calling him overrated and delivering a forearm"
36:46,840;36:48,880;"to the back of the heads."
36:48,880;36:50,360;"Harrison's response."
36:50,360;36:55,280;"Quote when he makes a catch he gets up and does his little dance. So when we get a chance we're gonna make him pay"
36:55,280;36:57,380;"We're gonna try and rip his head off"
36:57,380;37:00,760;"Yeah, the boys a beefin"
37:00,760;37:04,560;"McMichael said he and Harrison chatted a little during Sunday's game like this game"
37:04,560;37:10,280;"We're talking about but nothing nasty. He said they compliment each other at one point after McMichael dropped a pass"
37:10,280;37:12,680;"Harrison delivered a friendly pat on his backside"
37:12,680;37:18,520;"Quote anytime somebody calls you out. It's sort of disrespecting you Harrison said I told Randy during the game"
37:18,520;37:21,520;"just play football. You're a good player. Just go play football."
37:21,520;37:27,520;"Yeah, I mean, I feel like when people talk shit to each other like that,"
37:27,520;37:30,520;"it's they're both the same type of person."
37:30,520;37:35,520;"So there's that kind of like underlying thing of like, yeah, I'm being a prick,"
37:35,520;37:37,520;"but that's kind of the point. Yeah. Exactly."
37:37,520;37:41,520;"And they're like, I, they can see a little bit of each other and each other to know that like,"
37:41,520;37:45,520;"yeah, this is a real hatred. We probably like each other if we're on the same team."
37:45,520;37:47,520;"Game recognized game. Yeah, we're exactly."
37:47,520;37:50,520;"Exactly. We're playing the game that needs to be played here."
37:50,520;37:54,620;"But I think MacMichael may have also been"
37:54,620;37:59,280;"kind of conciliatory because of the game that he had."
37:59,280;38:01,920;"Because let's see."
38:01,920;38:04,760;"Our name Michael five targets, zero catches, zero yards."
38:04,760;38:08,480;"And on the one drive that the"
38:08,480;38:11,840;"the dolphins actually had, they got to the Patriots 10 yard line."
38:11,840;38:14,200;"And I think it was third down."
38:14,200;38:17,400;"MacMichael missed his assignment, which was Rodney Harrison coming in"
38:17,400;38:23,900;"on the Blitz and Rodney Harrison, strip-sacked J-feet layer, which Paige recovered."
38:23,900;38:25,700;"And that was like their only scoring chance."
38:25,700;38:30,300;"So he's like, Michael was talking about how he's the one that kind of fucked up this game."
38:30,300;38:31,300;"It wasn't quite as fun."
38:31,300;38:32,300;"He's fought it in score."
38:32,300;38:33,300;"Huh?"
38:33,300;38:34,300;"We should call him Randy Mafloury."
38:34,300;38:39,580;"He was like, ""Well, it came right back to the red zone and got fucked up again."""
38:39,580;38:41,820;"There's that Richard Seymour, like 20 yard sack."
38:41,820;38:42,820;"Oh, yeah."
38:42,820;38:46,140;"Well, yeah, they got like into field goal range at one point."
38:46,140;38:49,900;"And then it went, I think I wrote this down."
38:49,900;38:52,420;"Oh, yeah, it was the beginning of the fourth."
38:52,420;38:54,100;"It was the first shot of the fourth."
38:54,100;38:55,500;"They started their own 40,"
38:55,500;38:58,140;"and then on the last play of the third quarter,"
38:58,140;39:01,660;"they hit a deep ball too, I don't even fucking care."
39:01,660;39:03,220;"Which put them at the New England 33"
39:03,220;39:05,020;"to start the fourth quarter."
39:05,020;39:07,100;"And then immediately from that"
39:07,100;39:10,500;"Vrable got a strip sack, which the Dolphins recovered."
39:10,500;39:11,700;"So it's third and 20."
39:11,700;39:13,900;"And then from there, Seymour got another sack."
39:13,900;39:17,780;"And now it's four from 33 from back on their own side of the field."
39:17,780;39:19,180;"It was like their own like 40 something."
39:19,180;39:20,300;"That's so bad."
39:20,300;39:22,460;"Like you strip sack and get the ball back through your offense."
39:22,460;39:24,380;"Your offense doesn't do shit with it."
39:24,380;39:25,140;"Yep."
39:25,140;39:28,340;"Brooks Barnard has a punt with 30 seconds left into the wind."
39:28,340;39:31,340;"If only you guys had even run the ball twice, then we're going to"
39:31,340;39:32,620;"punt it with the wind in his back."
39:32,620;39:35,220;"But nobody's got a punt for the last play in the quarter into the win."
39:35,220;39:35,740;"Yeah."
39:35,740;39:38,420;"They get the ball hit a big pass or right back to where they were."
39:38,420;39:41,020;"And then it's just like not at this point, it's still three nothing"
39:41,020;39:41,980;"because of third quarter."
39:42,380;39:44,620;"And the pages of man just three whole points in this game."
39:44,620;39:48,500;"And yet it still felt like the game was out of reach because"
39:48,500;39:51,500;"this defense was just so dominating."
39:51,500;39:52,380;"And that's what they did."
39:52,380;39:53,100;"Like, you know what? Fuck it."
39:53,100;39:54,300;"Fourth quarter. This is our game."
39:54,300;39:56,580;"So we're going to sack them twice and put them forth and 33."
39:56,580;39:57,500;"The fuck out of our."
39:57,500;39:58,700;"You missed one play in there."
39:58,700;40:00,300;"It was a near interception from tie loss."
40:00,300;40:01,660;"So it went near. Yes."
40:01,660;40:02,740;"That's right. That's right."
40:02,740;40:03,740;"That's right."
40:03,740;40:05,700;"Actual sack for 13 yards."
40:05,700;40:07,540;"Yeah, not great."
40:07,540;40:08,820;"Yeah."
40:08,820;40:11,580;"But then I think that was like immediately after that was the play"
40:11,580;40:14,780;"that fall got knocked out and followed the way."
40:14,780;40:15,780;"They hunted it."
40:15,780;40:16,600;"Remember Tyrone Pool missed because they"
40:16,600;40:18,600;"hunted with the wind, I guess."
40:18,600;40:20,060;"And Tyrone Pool missed the punt,"
40:20,060;40:22,740;"bounced at his feet and Kevin Fallkamvert recovered it."
40:22,740;40:24,780;"And then the next day he gets knocked out."
40:24,780;40:25,280;"Yeah."
40:25,280;40:28,380;"Obviously the dirty head Andy."
40:28,380;40:31,340;"He just delivered it."
40:31,340;40:31,860;"One of the different--"
40:31,860;40:32,380;"One of the different--"
40:32,380;40:32,880;"One of the different--"
40:32,880;40:33,340;"--the one in safeties, I think."
40:33,340;40:33,540;"Yeah."
40:33,540;40:36,140;"It was kind of like he got wrapped up"
40:36,140;40:37,980;"from behind by Junior Seo."
40:37,980;40:39,020;"So his legs."
40:39,020;40:41,380;"And then just got his head taken off"
40:41,380;40:47,620;"like held down. It was clean. That was a shoulder. It was just bad timing because junior lunged,"
40:47,620;40:51,940;"barely got his ankles and like wrapped his both his ankles up at once. And Kevin felt just started"
40:51,940;40:56,180;"falling at that moment right as he got hit. So he was like, it was body was like, yeah, I don't"
40:56,180;41:01,700;"think it was dirty, but it was a brutal hit. It was a big hit. Like you knew as soon as he got hit,"
41:01,700;41:08,420;"like he was he was out before you hit the ground. Brock Marion. Yes, I know. So I just looked through"
41:08,420;41:14,000;"their roster. And I was like, who on this list would I pick to do a dirty hit?"
41:14,000;41:20,200;"I think it may have been a rock in there. I think it was. Headhunting. Typical"
41:20,200;41:27,140;"Brock. Speaking of headhunting though, one of the dolphins players, this is actually gonna be my best,"
41:27,140;41:32,560;"but this is the perfect segue. His helmet exploded. Oh, yeah, I saw that in the middle of the day."
41:32,560;41:33,400;"- Yeah."
41:33,400;41:35,400;"- I've never seen it."
41:35,400;41:37,200;"- Yeah, so I have a couple of pictures"
41:37,200;41:40,640;"that I'll post on the show notes, but like, holy shit."
41:40,640;41:43,000;"Like it's not just a piece chipped off."
41:43,000;41:45,800;"Like, to roughly down the center at the two,"
41:45,800;41:46,640;"like even the sides."
41:46,640;41:47,800;"- Like piece of helmet."
41:47,800;41:49,640;"- Like, you know how they have the stripe"
41:49,640;41:50,840;"along the middle of the helmet?"
41:50,840;41:53,400;"Like it cracked all the way along that was in two pieces."
41:53,400;41:54,720;"- Was it cutting the gold?"
41:54,720;41:56,720;"- Did they talk about it on the broadcast?"
41:56,720;41:57,720;"- No, they didn't."
41:57,720;41:59,880;"All they really said about it was,"
42:00,960;42:03,760;"Hey, you know the guy who broke the most helmets?"
42:03,760;42:04,920;"Mike Singletary."
42:04,920;42:06,600;"- Yes."
42:06,600;42:07,440;"- Okay."
42:07,440;42:08,960;"- Shaquille O'Neal."
42:08,960;42:10,040;"- I mean, that's crazy."
42:10,040;42:10,880;"- LSU."
42:10,880;42:11,720;"- I mean, I'm gonna do a break."
42:11,720;42:12,560;"I've never seen that before."
42:12,560;42:13,560;"- Right."
42:13,560;42:14,400;"- Yeah."
42:14,400;42:16,640;"I mean, well Drew Bledso had his helmet dented."
42:16,640;42:17,720;"That's my great."
42:17,720;42:19,360;"- I don't remember that."
42:19,360;42:21,560;"- And the hit that shared against the Jets."
42:21,560;42:23,000;"- Oh, right, right."
42:23,000;42:26,120;"- His face was apparently was twisted and dented"
42:26,120;42:26,960;"'cause of the hit was--"
42:26,960;42:27,800;"- Oh, Lewis."
42:27,800;42:28,640;"- Yeah."
42:28,640;42:30,560;"- How far we've come, you know?"
42:30,560;42:33,440;"- Yep, making fun of Kevin Falk for concussions,"
42:33,440;42:35,420;"helmet splitting on the field."
42:35,420;42:38,640;"Now you can't even touch him."
42:38,640;42:40,320;"- 12 whole points being scored."
42:40,320;42:41,160;"- Yeah."
42:41,160;42:42,880;"- Back when football was football."
42:42,880;42:44,320;"- Old school, football man."
42:44,320;42:50,840;"- But we haven't actually touched on the iconic play of this."
42:50,840;42:56,880;"Teddy with 1D, Teddy with 1D, Teddy with 1TD."
42:57,880;42:58,720;"- Oh, oh."
42:58,720;43:06,980;"This is off the Barnyard dog punt,"
43:06,980;43:10,040;"puts the ball, dribble the ball out of bounds at the five,"
43:10,040;43:11,580;"not bad."
43:11,580;43:14,660;"And the next play, as the announcers are talking about how"
43:14,660;43:16,820;"this is the perfect time to get Ricky Williams going,"
43:16,820;43:18,860;"just pound it out of the end zone"
43:18,860;43:20,060;"and just give it to your workers,"
43:20,060;43:22,720;"that's why you pay them all this money."
43:22,720;43:24,580;"Jay Fiedler drops back and throws a pick six"
43:24,580;43:25,780;"to Teddy Bruceky."
43:25,780;43:26,780;"- First play."
43:26,780;43:27,620;"Immediately."
43:27,620;43:28,440;"- Of course, play."
43:28,440;43:29,280;"- Yeah."
43:29,280;43:30,120;"- As he's saying this, which--"
43:30,120;43:32,180;"- A gaz or dickulous catch-down."
43:32,180;43:35,160;"- Yeah, I'd forgotten how good of an interception it was,"
43:35,160;43:37,200;"but this was one of the most athletic plays"
43:37,200;43:38,800;"I've seen a linebacker make."
43:38,800;43:40,800;"- Or just like a pure hands play,"
43:40,800;43:43,320;"where it's like, he was like five yards away"
43:43,320;43:44,500;"from this quarterback who was like,"
43:44,500;43:46,320;"trying to zip it into tight coverage."
43:46,320;43:48,760;"And it just, no bobble of mouth, it just zoop."
43:48,760;43:51,080;"- Nope, yeah, just snagged it."
43:51,080;43:53,920;"- But even if like, fully outstretched too."
43:53,920;43:54,760;"- Yeah."
43:54,760;43:56,320;"- It looked like Chatham was there to block that down too."
43:56,320;43:57,440;"Like he threw that in."
43:57,440;43:58,360;"That was a bad."
43:58,360;44:01,080;"It was like the guy covering the receiver was closed."
44:01,080;44:02,280;"Two linebackers right there."
44:02,280;44:03,080;"Yeah."
44:03,080;44:07,400;"I mean, all his throws in this game right now, though, like out of them were good."
44:07,400;44:11,920;"But this, I mean, I don't think this was what play he expected."
44:11,920;44:13,440;"They was going to get intercepted the way it did."
44:13,440;44:17,160;"I just, he just doesn't know the concept of looking anybody off."
44:17,160;44:18,520;"I think that might be true."
44:18,520;44:22,280;"And then they figure it out soon enough."
44:22,280;44:24,480;"And you can watch Teddy in the replay."
44:24,480;44:28,040;"He just hides behind the blocker real quick and like watches he there and then just yeah"
44:28,040;44:29,900;"Just slowly drifts that way and seems a throat gun"
44:29,900;44:33,320;"But like fully outstretched just absolutely snags it"
44:33,320;44:38,200;"The end zone a plus as well. Oh, yeah, drop into his knees and like"
44:38,200;44:45,040;"As he goes to his drags his feet. Yeah, oh, it's beautiful. Yeah iconic poster of this Greg"
44:45,040;44:49,880;"Hey, me. I don't know. I feel like they even poster of like"
44:50,440;44:52,440;"Him just like on his knees. Yeah"
44:52,440;44:57,720;"Air and then like it's like a like all black bat border like platoon, right?"
44:57,720;45:01,080;"Everyone throwing snow and shit in the air. Yeah, there's a"
45:01,080;45:07,960;"Another iconic picture of him throwing snow up like by the the stands"
45:07,960;45:10,840;"And like everybody else's throwing snow too"
45:10,840;45:16,880;"But that even just the throwing the snow to the timing of the song too as if it were like fireworks"
45:16,880;45:19,480;"Was absolutely amazing"
45:19,480;45:20,320;"- Hey. - Hey."
45:20,320;45:22,120;"- Hey. - I'm gonna hit that."
45:22,120;45:23,960;"- Snow on that one. - Okay, hey guy."
45:23,960;45:25,720;"With that fucking, hey."
45:25,720;45:26,620;"- Song? - Oh yeah."
45:26,620;45:27,620;"- Fucking nail. - Oh yeah."
45:27,620;45:30,240;"- That was gonna be my best best because, like,"
45:30,240;45:32,200;"what a fucking song to play."
45:32,200;45:33,400;"- Except that's Gary Glitter."
45:33,400;45:35,240;"So he's been canceled, so he can't play that."
45:35,240;45:37,280;"- Why, what happened to Gary Glitter?"
45:37,280;45:38,120;"- He's a kid. - I know that"
45:38,120;45:39,260;"wasn't Gary Glitter."
45:39,260;45:40,960;"- Who is Gary Glitter? - That Hey song."
45:40,960;45:42,080;"- He's the guy that wrote that song."
45:42,080;45:43,720;"He's the, he's a pop artist."
45:43,720;45:45,880;"I think he's a kitty-diddler."
45:45,880;45:47,760;"Oh, that song anymore, yeah."
45:47,760;45:55,220;"Oh, I did lost profits. Remember those guys? Oh, yeah. Yeah. They were into that. So yeah, the lead singer huge didler"
45:55,220;46:00,340;"Yeah, now I can't listen to them anymore. I mean it really just do it on headphones"
46:00,340;46:02,780;"Don't tell people just do it on headphones"
46:02,780;46:09,260;"Separate the music from the artist. Mm-hmm. No, I was wrong about that photo"
46:09,260;46:12,620;"You have Greg. It is the one you were talking about Andy Pim throw in the snow in the ear in front of the fans"
46:12,620;46:16,340;"Yeah, it's a great one. It signed on eBay 150 bucks"
46:16,340;46:18,500;"- All right."
46:18,500;46:21,220;"- It's Teddy with 1D."
46:21,220;46:23,020;"- Yep."
46:23,020;46:24,740;"- Where did you go to school?"
46:24,740;46:25,580;"- Arizona."
46:25,580;46:26,420;"- Arizona."
46:26,420;46:27,260;"- Nice."
46:27,260;46:29,700;"- 'Cause he's going back to be like a coaching consultant"
46:29,700;46:30,540;"now I think."
46:30,540;46:31,380;"- Yeah, I think so."
46:31,380;46:33,500;"- Did you know because remember Lisa"
46:33,500;46:34,340;"that we had on?"
46:34,340;46:35,180;"- Simpsons?"
46:35,180;46:36,020;"- Yeah."
46:36,020;46:37,860;"(laughs)"
46:37,860;46:38,860;"- Yeah, sure."
46:38,860;46:40,260;"She went to Arizona."
46:40,260;46:41,780;"So she's a big Teddy Bruski fan."
46:41,780;46:43,780;"- Bruski."
46:43,780;46:45,860;"Remember that shirt I got you, Andy?"
46:45,860;46:46,700;"I still have it."
46:46,700;46:47,520;"- Mine, why is it looking one?"
46:47,520;46:48,360;"- Yeah."
46:48,360;46:49,200;"- Yeah."
46:49,200;46:50,660;"- It's a Bruce key, king of linebackers."
46:50,660;46:51,740;"- That's what I was looking at."
46:51,740;46:54,640;"- I remember I was probably like around this time,"
46:54,640;46:55,760;"maybe like 14."
46:55,760;46:57,820;"And that was like the first time I was like,"
46:57,820;47:00,220;"dude, I just got the dopest Christmas present"
47:00,220;47:01,060;"for my brother."
47:01,060;47:03,840;"It's called beer on it."
47:03,840;47:04,680;"- Oh my God."
47:04,680;47:09,000;"- He's gonna fucking love me so much after this."
47:09,000;47:10,000;"That was a great one."
47:10,000;47:12,600;"That was top notch."
47:12,600;47:14,060;"- What happened, Greg?"
47:14,060;47:15,860;"I went, I remember seeing it at the mall"
47:15,860;47:17,420;"in one of those stands and the member"
47:17,420;47:19,820;"they stick with those things in the middle of the aisle."
47:19,820;47:20,820;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
47:20,820;47:22,180;"- And I was like, sure, it's sweet."
47:22,180;47:23,020;"- The carts."
47:23,020;47:24,860;"- I went back later and bought it for you."
47:24,860;47:25,700;"So high."
47:25,700;47:28,980;"- Well, I haven't even been able to unveil"
47:28,980;47:31,180;"my Christmas gift this year, you guys got me,"
47:31,180;47:33,620;"which is probably on that level."
47:33,620;47:36,300;"It's funnier, but maybe not something I'll wear is on."
47:36,300;47:38,220;"- Yeah, how are we not making you wear that"
47:38,220;47:39,100;"for every episode of the time?"
47:39,100;47:40,580;"- Because he hasn't been on yet."
47:40,580;47:41,420;"- That's true."
47:41,420;47:43,740;"- We're teasing it, but it'll happen."
47:43,740;47:48,660;"We'll even pose a picture. We'll have to wear it a bunch. So that's good. I guess unfortunately. Yes"
47:48,660;47:57,160;"Did you know Teddy was accomplished saxophonist I did I don't remember I think we that came up one of them"
47:57,160;47:59,160;"Nouns were sent in name. Yeah"
47:59,160;48:07,220;"Like Lisa said that's correct so I'm not gonna lie I thought that that was the only score in the game. I thought it was 10 nothing"
48:07,220;48:11,700;"Because unlike Greg, I don't watch I don't look at the score before I watch it"
48:12,580;48:16,380;"And I have another here. I was like man, we didn't score again. It would have been even more snow"
48:16,380;48:21,860;"Because like such an organic like cool thing. Yeah, that was really cool"
48:21,860;48:23,580;"And then like I was like yeah, it's cool"
48:23,580;48:30,220;"But like next time we score it'll be even better. Yep, because everybody's ready for it and then they close it out with a safety -"
48:30,220;48:37,900;"Yeah, oh, yeah, it was which like an absolute garbage time safety probably the the only garbage time safety I've ever seen"
48:38,380;48:42,580;"Because Miami's this is after Tom Brady punts it down to the one"
48:42,580;48:47,980;"Miami starts at their own one and is now fourth and eight like well"
48:47,980;48:52,380;"We kind of have to go for it. We're down ten nothing less than two minutes left and"
48:52,380;48:55,860;"And it was a label again wasn't it?"
48:55,860;48:57,360;"Yeah, we've got the pressure"
48:57,360;48:58,420;"Garvus green well"
48:58,420;49:04,000;"We'll be able to basically push him into Jarvis Green who was standing there with his arms wide open and even the play before he"
49:04,000;49:06,000;"Almost had a strip sack. Yes, he did"
49:06,000;49:08,260;"Got his hand on the ball"
49:08,260;49:13,320;"Causing the completion when he was just he was unblockable in this game. It was amazing"
49:13,320;49:19,460;"All right, you know, do you got some worse thing we we touched on most of the good plays? I have I have one question for you that because"
49:19,460;49:23,640;"We've seen a lot of iconic moments"
49:23,640;49:27,060;"In these games"
49:27,060;49:29,620;"But they all seem to be"
49:29,620;49:32,460;"defensive moments and"
49:32,460;49:34,780;"one of the the last remaining"
49:35,980;49:41,780;"Arguments I'm hearing now about Tom Brady not being the best and they're like scraping the bottom of the barrel now"
49:41,780;49:43,780;"Oh, it is"
49:43,780;49:48,500;"Tom Brady is not the greatest because he doesn't have an iconic moment"
49:48,500;49:50,980;"What?"
49:50,980;49:58,220;"Yeah, because Joe Montana the argument was Joe Montana has the catch to Dwight Clark good point. I"
49:58,220;50:05,560;"Don't know what Peyton mean. I don't think it's a good point Aaron Rogers has a couple of like hail Mary's you remember"
50:05,560;50:12,480;"Yeah, like what's the comeback from 20. Yeah, but what's the what's the play? Yeah, there's no like one play that you remember Tom Brady"
50:12,480;50:19,200;"I would say this spike in the snowball, but I'm partial to that game. Oh, it's the the spike in the Rams game where you fucking spikes it"
50:19,200;50:24,280;"And yeah, that's not a play. That's just like a play. It's a player quarter. You didn't even make a play though"
50:24,280;50:25,280;"That's a"
50:25,280;50:32,480;"It's a kid that also showed that Tom Brady is super cool as a cucumber as a second in your player loop in like the biggest moments like that was when"
50:33,000;50:38,760;"And even John Madden's commentation of that made it better. He's like oh what Tom Brady did just gave me gills. Oh, I've got one"
50:38,760;50:41,000;"All right, it just came to me"
50:41,000;50:44,760;"Tom Brady's touchdown pass"
50:44,760;50:50,420;"Against the Saints when they shouldn't have even been in it and you had Zolax"
50:50,420;50:53,440;"No, yeah, where's the beef?"
50:53,440;50:55,360;"Show ponies all that garbage show ponies"
50:55,360;50:58,120;"whatever that was as a pretty old"
50:58,120;51:01,000;"That's pretty iconic. I think yeah"
51:01,800;51:06,220;"a million iconic plays like you can get fucked with that argument. Well, that's the thing"
51:06,220;51:11,740;"that like Tom Brady has so many which one do you choose? Well, no, I think that's the"
51:11,740;51:17,440;"beauty of Tom Brady is that it's not about him being like a player that can do things"
51:17,440;51:22,460;"that other people can't. He's a player that everybody could do what he does, but no one"
51:22,460;51:27,780;"does it every single time and when the pressure is on and just comes through like he's not"
51:27,780;51:33,300;"He's not even that talented, but he still fucking wins every time."
51:33,300;51:38,580;"But his fundamentals are so much better than anybody else's ever."
51:38,580;51:46,580;"His decision making, his footwork is just like pocket presence, his accuracy, his timing,"
51:46,580;51:48,820;"just all of those pieces."
51:48,820;51:53,460;"And the fact that he does it exactly the same regardless of the situation."
51:53,460;51:56,020;"It doesn't matter if he's down 28 to three in the Super Bowl."
51:56,020;51:59,740;"He's still doing the exact same book and thing over and over again."
51:59,740;52:04,220;"The fact that you can do it on such a high level for so long, I think is what makes it"
52:04,220;52:05,620;"a consistency is really."
52:05,620;52:09,460;"And also the fact that he doesn't like put himself in the situations where he needs to"
52:09,460;52:10,460;"be the hero either."
52:10,460;52:12,620;"So you say, no, Jack's a bad coach."
52:12,620;52:13,620;"Are you on team?"
52:13,620;52:18,140;"No, I have a, I have a pro ballot check take here."
52:18,140;52:19,140;"Oh my God."
52:19,140;52:20,140;"Let's see it."
52:20,140;52:21,140;"Yeah."
52:21,140;52:22,140;"Hang on."
52:22,140;52:25,980;"Let me figure this is, uh, we are at what, what time in the meeting are we?"
52:25,980;52:26,820;"like, oh, fuck it."
52:26,820;52:29,740;"- It's six PM 2021."
52:29,740;52:31,260;"Go on, Greg."
52:31,260;52:33,500;"- I mostly like, we'll cut this."
52:33,500;52:36,460;"- Well, all of this, you're carrying a lot of talk now"
52:36,460;52:38,100;"that Brady won the Super Bowl that they're like,"
52:38,100;52:41,920;"""Oh, if the Patriots had just gone out"
52:41,920;52:45,140;"and like got some weapons for Brady,"
52:45,140;52:46,620;"maybe who would have stayed?"""
52:46,620;52:50,300;"They tried, like they went and got Demarius Thomas."
52:50,300;52:53,780;"They got Antonio Brown, you know,"
52:53,780;52:54,940;"- Got Joe getting hurt."
52:54,940;52:58,100;"- They got Josh Gort, they got a ton of people,"
52:58,100;52:59,660;"they just didn't work out."
52:59,660;53:00,500;"- Yeah, the fact that-"
53:00,500;53:01,660;"- That's not Bellachek's fault."
53:01,660;53:04,660;"All the people they got, like every single one"
53:04,660;53:06,380;"of them didn't work out is just like,"
53:06,380;53:09,840;"yeah, I thought they made more of an effort that year"
53:09,840;53:12,180;"than they had like any previous years."
53:12,180;53:13,700;"- Yeah."
53:13,700;53:14,820;"- But I feel like they've been doing it"
53:14,820;53:16,740;"for a couple of years too, you know?"
53:16,740;53:17,580;"- Yeah."
53:17,580;53:19,500;"- Like they had been just kind of like selling out a bit,"
53:19,500;53:20,700;"like they drafted Nikila Harry."
53:20,700;53:21,540;"So first-"
53:21,540;53:22,380;"- Yeah, they drafted Nikila Harry."
53:22,380;53:23,380;"- Why'd receiver day that year too?"
53:23,380;53:24,220;"- Yeah."
53:24,220;53:27,220;"- I can talk to me about them not trying to surround"
53:27,220;53:28,060;"with weapons."
53:28,060;53:28,880;"- Exactly."
53:28,880;53:31,900;"- And the year before they drafted Sony Michelle too, right?"
53:31,900;53:32,740;"- Yeah."
53:32,740;53:35,580;"- So like offensive pieces to frame the build around."
53:35,580;53:38,220;"- So yeah, sometimes it doesn't work out."
53:38,220;53:40,500;"That's just, I saw football works, you know?"
53:40,500;53:44,260;"Antonio Brown is gonna molest his fucking trainer."
53:44,260;53:45,100;"- Yep."
53:45,100;53:45,940;"- Yeah."
53:45,940;53:48,060;"- It's nothing like you could do there."
53:48,060;53:51,100;"Although nothing's changed, but like all that heats off"
53:51,100;53:52,300;"of all of a sudden for some reason."
53:52,300;53:54,060;"Yeah, these time wheels all wounds and."
53:54,060;53:58,780;"We also not going to like give stupid contracts out either."
53:58,780;54:03,060;"Like the Carson ones one that he has one good year gets hurt."
54:03,060;54:03,660;"And then like, you know what?"
54:03,660;54:06,500;"Here's a new contract that pays you shit loads of money."
54:06,500;54:09,340;"That's a good way now on the hook for."
54:09,340;54:09,860;"Yeah."
54:09,860;54:12,580;"30 million, 34 million this year."
54:12,580;54:14,140;"I was not going to be on the team."
54:14,140;54:18,100;"It's the biggest, just trade a form and they have two years and"
54:18,100;54:19,780;"forty five million dollars committed."
54:19,780;54:21,020;"Yeah."
54:21,540;54:23,640;"But they have to pay like 34 million this year."
54:23,640;54:26,180;"It's the biggest dead cap hit ever in the history of the league."
54:26,180;54:27,460;"Oh, the eels are fucked out."
54:27,460;54:28,180;"They're both fine."
54:28,180;54:31,380;"And this is all after building a statue of their backup quarterback,"
54:31,380;54:34,820;"where they also shipped out in front of the stadium."
54:34,820;54:36,860;"Those people have tattoos as that guy."
54:36,860;54:39,420;"Oh, well, I mean, if you win the Super Bowl, I get that."
54:39,420;54:42,580;"But like building statues seems a little premature,"
54:42,580;54:44,140;"especially when you're still on the team."
54:44,140;54:45,580;"Like, are you fucking kidding me?"
54:45,580;54:46,860;"Anybody can do it."
54:46,860;54:49,780;"Nobody does it as consistently as Tom."
54:49,780;54:50,780;"It's true."
54:50,780;54:51,820;"It's true."
54:51,820;54:53,460;"- All right, best of words, let's go."
54:53,460;54:55,100;"- No, wait, wait, wait, wait, before we do it,"
54:55,100;54:56,100;"can we do trivia?"
54:56,100;54:57,100;"Remember we talked about trivia?"
54:57,100;54:58,100;"- Oh, yeah, trivia."
54:58,100;54:58,940;"- Yeah, yeah, okay."
54:58,940;54:59,780;"- Yes."
54:59,780;55:00,900;"- I'm not gonna go overboard here,"
55:00,900;55:02,820;"but I just have, I'm gonna try and pull"
55:02,820;55:04,900;"one trivia question a week."
55:04,900;55:05,740;"- I love it."
55:05,740;55:07,820;"- In the context to the dynasty, okay?"
55:07,820;55:09,100;"- Okay, okay."
55:09,100;55:13,060;"- All right, so since 2001,"
55:13,060;55:13,900;"- Yep."
55:13,900;55:18,580;"- There have been seven players on the Patriots"
55:18,580;55:23,420;"that have caught 100 passes, but are not wide receivers."
55:23,420;55:27,620;"- 100 passes total or an AC?"
55:27,620;55:29,460;"- Yes, Rob Grogkowski."
55:29,460;55:33,620;"- Yep, Rob Grogkowski is number one with 521 receptions."
55:33,620;55:34,620;"- Her name. - 521."
55:34,620;55:36,640;"- Okay, so yeah."
55:36,640;55:39,620;"- Aaron Hernandez."
55:39,620;55:41,220;"- Aaron Hernandez is number five."
55:41,220;55:42,700;"- Oh, shit, he's on there."
55:42,700;55:44,220;"How many are there? - 175."
55:44,220;55:45,540;"- There's seven, yeah. - Okay."
55:45,540;55:48,340;"- James White."
55:48,340;55:50,440;"James White is number three."
55:50,440;55:51,440;"- Kevin Falk?"
55:51,440;55:53,900;"- Kevin Falk is number two."
55:53,900;55:54,940;"Number two, see?"
55:54,940;55:55,940;"That's what I'm saying."
55:55,940;55:57,540;"How many did he have?"
55:57,540;56:00,900;"- He had 431 catches."
56:00,900;56:02,220;"Damn."
56:02,220;56:03,060;"That's a run."
56:03,060;56:04,780;"- That's actually 1999 to 2000."
56:04,780;56:05,620;"- That's fine."
56:05,620;56:07,620;"- Close enough, I'll give it to him."
56:07,620;56:10,500;"So we're missing Vereen."
56:10,500;56:11,600;"- Vereen."
56:11,600;56:12,440;"- Oh, nice."
56:12,440;56:14,600;"- 107, he's number seven."
56:14,600;56:16,860;"- Ben Watson?"
56:16,860;56:17,700;"- Nope."
56:17,700;56:21,620;"Yeah, Ben Watson, 184, he was fourth."
56:21,620;56:23,180;"So that's six, we got one more."
56:23,180;56:25,180;"Yeah, in sixth place."
56:25,180;56:28,280;"- Non-receiver, it's not gonna be the full back."
56:28,280;56:30,820;"- Larry said it."
56:30,820;56:34,460;"- That's what we were running backward."
56:34,460;56:36,180;"- I'll give you his timeframe."
56:36,180;56:37,180;"- Yeah."
56:37,180;56:39,660;"- 2002 through 2006."
56:39,660;56:40,740;"So he's on this roster."
56:40,740;56:43,780;"- Now, Daniel Graham."
56:43,780;56:45,100;"- Really?"
56:45,100;56:47,500;"- Mm-hmm, 120 catches."
56:47,500;56:48,340;"- Wow."
56:48,340;56:50,660;"- He has more than what's in that?"
56:50,660;56:52,180;"- What's in that, 184."
56:52,180;56:56,980;"Dude, Hernandez had 175 in three seasons."
56:56,980;56:57,820;"- That's a bad one."
56:57,820;57:00,980;"- But, he could have been so good."
57:00,980;57:02,420;"That was my takeaway from that list is,"
57:02,420;57:03,740;"God damn it, Hernandez."
57:03,740;57:04,580;"- So much, yeah."
57:04,580;57:05,420;"- It's so funny."
57:05,420;57:08,220;"- Yeah, that offense would have given people"
57:08,220;57:09,700;"problems for fucking me."
57:09,700;57:11,580;"- I guess all of the contracts too,"
57:11,580;57:13,020;"like they had them both locked up."
57:13,020;57:13,940;"- Yeah, and it was,"
57:13,940;57:16,620;"'cause it was one of those like unsolvable offenses"
57:16,620;57:19,460;"because you could run out two tight ends"
57:19,460;57:22,340;"and just run a fucking power run theme."
57:22,340;57:24,660;"And as soon as they ship on more defensive linemen"
57:24,660;57:26,380;"or linebackers, you just fucking spread it out."
57:26,380;57:27,860;"Same fucking guys."
57:27,860;57:28,700;"- Yep. - Uh-huh."
57:28,700;57:31,060;"Brutal."
57:31,060;57:33,620;"What could have been?"
57:33,620;57:35,460;"We're complaining that they only won 60."
57:35,460;57:38,160;"- That might be the overall dynasty worst."
57:38,160;57:42,260;"- Aaron Eddas, I think it's everybody's dynasty worst."
57:42,260;57:43,420;"Yeah."
57:43,420;57:44,740;"What else are you gonna do?"
57:44,740;57:50,260;"That is my worst take of all time is that Hernandez will end up with a better career than Gronk."
57:50,260;57:51,460;"And it's getting worse."
57:51,460;57:52,460;"[laughter]"
57:52,460;57:54,580;"Every year gets worse."
57:54,580;57:55,460;"Still going."
57:55,460;57:56,740;"- You think about scraping the bottom of the barrel."
57:56,740;57:57,820;"You didn't even have to live yet."
57:57,820;57:58,660;"You got a lot."
57:58,660;58:00,580;"[laughter]"
58:00,580;58:01,500;"- Holy shit."
58:01,500;58:03,100;"That's a tough look."
58:03,100;58:03,900;"- Yes."
58:03,900;58:05,900;"- I like that you're still owning up to it, though."
58:05,900;58:06,700;"- Uh-huh."
58:06,700;58:08,380;"- You're the--"
58:08,380;58:09,340;"- You gotta eat your helmet."
58:09,340;58:10,340;"- You gotta eat your helmet."
58:10,340;58:11,940;"- The Max Kellerman of the Brown family."
58:11,940;58:12,740;"I like it."
58:14,180;58:18,100;"All right, so let's do best of words. That's great. Great. Yeah, keep keep those coming. I like that."
58:18,100;58:23,620;"Greg, you can go first and best of words since great trivia question and you didn't watch the game."
58:23,620;58:34,260;"Okay, my best tie law. I made this promise a while ago, but anytime tie law has an interception in a NFL game, he will be named the best of the game."
58:34,260;58:38,460;"He almost had a couple other like diving ones like cut back on it."
58:38,460;58:41,100;"He was hurt too, right? He was playing through injury."
58:41,100;58:43,220;"He pulled a hand me on the on the second almost."
58:44,060;58:58,940;"Yeah. My worst is HP printers. I had about an hour and a half fucking battle royale with my"
58:58,940;59:03,980;"printer before getting on this call. Drag is trying to print his notes for the call."
59:08,460;59:10,940;"Why does this say paper jam when there's no paper jam?"
59:10,940;59:15,660;"So beautiful."
59:15,660;59:17,340;"All right, you go, Andy, I got a couple."
59:17,340;59:18,620;"All right."
59:18,620;59:20,820;"Let's see."
59:20,820;59:23,140;"I'm trying to figure out what my best and worst are here."
59:23,140;59:27,260;"What do we have?"
59:27,260;59:31,700;"Oh, my best was the graphic that they showed."
59:31,700;59:33,580;"Probably halfway through the game."
59:33,580;59:36,860;"The game fact was the title of it."
59:37,300;59:42,300;"It was seats filled with fans 45,000 seats filled with snow 17,000."
59:42,300;59:47,420;"Huh. Wait, so they couldn't get people in the 17,000?"
59:47,420;59:49,540;"I think that's just how many people showed up."
59:49,540;59:52,780;"Yeah, but they'll do a lot of people just like looked outside and said,"
59:52,780;59:54,300;"""It's fucking two feet of snow."" I'm also."
59:54,300;59:56,780;"I still don't understand how they do that."
59:56,780;01:00:00,100;"Think they just do it by manual power, right?"
01:00:00,100;01:00:03,780;"Yeah, you've never seen it on like the highlights where they basically have,"
01:00:03,780;01:00:06,580;"well, nowadays, they figure out where they shoot."
01:00:06,940;01:00:09,660;"Yeah, they put their shoots and everybody's like shovels the snow into the shoots."
01:00:09,660;01:00:11,940;"But yeah, there's no, yeah, but just think about it."
01:00:11,940;01:00:15,860;"Shoveling in like small crevices is a pain in the ass."
01:00:15,860;01:00:16,420;"Yeah."
01:00:16,420;01:00:19,980;"What these are hands?"
01:00:19,980;01:00:20,580;"I don't know."
01:00:20,580;01:00:25,740;"They just show shot to the stands and like any NPC that is gigantic snow"
01:00:25,740;01:00:26,260;"mounted on it."
01:00:26,260;01:00:29,780;"Yeah, that's see, that's what I would expect to see is like, that's what it was."
01:00:29,780;01:00:33,700;"Because there's an opening shot of the whole like YouTube is this dude sitting on"
01:00:33,700;01:00:35,700;"top and pulling his kid up the top."
01:00:35,700;01:00:36,140;"Yeah."
01:00:36,140;01:00:37,820;"I just drag his ass up."
01:00:37,820;01:00:38,920;"That's awesome."
01:00:38,920;01:00:39,460;"Oh, yeah."
01:00:39,460;01:00:42,060;"You're a kid and you're just like, all right, let's go."
01:00:42,060;01:00:43,100;"Hell yeah."
01:00:43,100;01:00:44,500;"That's pulling you on top of the snow bank."
01:00:44,500;01:00:45,740;"You can get a better view because you're higher up."
01:00:45,740;01:00:46,940;"It's a great memory."
01:00:46,940;01:00:47,440;"Right?"
01:00:47,440;01:00:48,220;"Yeah, fucking right."
01:00:48,220;01:00:52,700;"I bet-- remember when Buffalo was doing like get a free ticket"
01:00:52,700;01:00:54,740;"if you comment, help us shovel the stadium?"
01:00:54,740;01:00:57,580;"Oh, yeah, that's right."
01:00:57,580;01:00:59,340;"Yeah, that's a couple years ago."
01:00:59,340;01:01:00,420;"That's a great look."
01:01:00,420;01:01:01,460;"That's a great look."
01:01:01,460;01:01:04,300;"Yeah, I love that."
01:01:04,300;01:01:05,460;"That was sort of my best, too."
01:01:05,460;01:01:06,740;"That was probably my, my number."
01:01:06,740;01:01:09,460;"Cause like the fans here were a plus plus."
01:01:09,460;01:01:10,020;"Oh yes."
01:01:10,020;01:01:10,220;"Yeah."
01:01:10,220;01:01:14,940;"The guys that show the people that showed up in this game were like the hard core."
01:01:14,940;01:01:17,060;"Like they were here for a good time."
01:01:17,060;01:01:21,460;"There was a sign that said today's special is frozen fish."
01:01:21,460;01:01:24,420;"It's like the very end of the game."
01:01:24,420;01:01:27,620;"Oh, that's that's early 2000s humor there."
01:01:27,620;01:01:28,140;"Yeah."
01:01:28,140;01:01:30,020;"What squeeze the cheese?"
01:01:30,020;01:01:30,380;"Yeah."
01:01:30,380;01:01:33,660;"Not if you want the very last like clip of the."
01:01:34,860;01:01:39,500;"Yes, dude with this dolphins construction hat just get in the fucking low to snow"
01:01:39,500;01:01:44,000;"Yeah, somebody hit him with like a massive fuck sold back as I was like"
01:01:44,000;01:01:47,580;"Like the whole snowball just like exploded across him"
01:01:47,580;01:01:54,060;"And he just like he had like one of those like rubber mass on to but you could tell like the whole just the way"
01:01:54,060;01:01:55,940;"He was you're so dejected like yeah"
01:01:55,940;01:02:01,740;"I can't believe I fucking flew out from Florida for this kind of sit in this fucking snow and we fucking lost 12"
01:02:01,740;01:02:03,740;"Nothing and I'm gonna tell them to snowballs"
01:02:04,100;01:02:05,100;"Yeah, did."
01:02:05,100;01:02:06,100;"It was good."
01:02:06,100;01:02:09,580;"It was much fun as the Patriots fans had with that because they won and because they're"
01:02:09,580;01:02:11,820;"serving beer because it was so fucking cold."
01:02:11,820;01:02:13,620;"Just sitting on the snow."
01:02:13,620;01:02:19,060;"That novice guy was having the absolute worst fucking time."
01:02:19,060;01:02:25,340;"But for my worst, I will say this was the 18th game in a row where the Patriots have"
01:02:25,340;01:02:27,500;"failed to score an opening drive touchdown."
01:02:27,500;01:02:30,220;"I feel like you're saying that because we score one next week."
01:02:30,220;01:02:31,220;"But all right."
01:02:31,220;01:02:32,220;"No, I don't know."
01:02:32,220;01:02:33,660;"They showed the stat at the beginning."
01:02:33,660;01:02:36,180;"It's like, oh, the page haven't had an opening drive touch channel."
01:02:36,180;01:02:37,140;"Last 17 games."
01:02:37,140;01:02:39,900;"And then they didn't score with this game either."
01:02:39,900;01:02:43,100;"So it's up to 18 now, which isn't great."
01:02:43,100;01:02:45,220;"But they also never lose if they're winning at halftime."
01:02:45,220;01:02:48,500;"So yes, winning games when ugly."
01:02:48,500;01:02:51,780;"Page is never-- they're never like a fast starting team, I feel."
01:02:51,780;01:02:53,340;"They're second half team most."
01:02:53,340;01:02:55,620;"All right, I will throw one extra on the fans."
01:02:55,620;01:02:57,420;"100 straight sellout."
01:02:57,420;01:03:00,260;"Yes, this was the 100th straight sellout since the Crafts"
01:03:00,260;01:03:01,940;"bought the team."
01:03:01,940;01:03:02,940;"Not too bad."
01:03:02,940;01:03:03,940;"I was my negatives."
01:03:03,940;01:03:07,680;"It was sort of the field goal kicking from a sanitary."
01:03:07,680;01:03:08,680;"It was sketchy."
01:03:08,680;01:03:10,000;"Put that one right on it."
01:03:10,000;01:03:14,300;"The extra extra point after Teddy touched down was it going to through."
01:03:14,300;01:03:16,260;"Almost almost double dink."
01:03:16,260;01:03:19,740;"Like it hit one and came back across and just went behind the other."
01:03:19,740;01:03:25,220;"It was a 54 yarder with the wind in your back at the end of the half headiness to barely"
01:03:25,220;01:03:26,220;"though."
01:03:26,220;01:03:27,940;"It's not messed up by much."
01:03:27,940;01:03:34,680;"Yeah, I'm curious if the the holding situation on these are all pre-packs and getting hurt"
01:03:34,680;01:03:38,260;"Yeah, I know but the the holder was no longer Ken Walter"
01:03:38,260;01:03:43,000;"So they hadn't had a lot of time to get"
01:03:43,000;01:03:46,140;"acquainted if you will let's not throw around"
01:03:46,140;01:03:52,020;"Baseless allegations here Andy, okay, I'm just repeating what the commentator said so you can take it"
01:03:52,020;01:03:54,900;"Don't come after Damon without some part proof"
01:03:56,780;01:03:58,500;"Tom Fayette had a great line."
01:03:58,500;01:04:00,820;"Asante Samuel's missed interception."
01:04:00,820;01:04:02,940;"He's like, I hope he didn't hurt him"
01:04:02,940;01:04:04,740;"because they hit him right in the fucking hand."
01:04:04,740;01:04:05,580;"- That's chest."
01:04:05,580;01:04:06,420;"- It did."
01:04:06,420;01:04:09,420;"- That was pretty good."
01:04:09,420;01:04:13,140;"- But you know, I know you gave it to the tie law,"
01:04:13,140;01:04:15,420;"but I'm gonna give it to Eugene Wilson."
01:04:15,420;01:04:16,260;"- Hey."
01:04:16,260;01:04:17,100;"- Hey."
01:04:17,100;01:04:17,940;"- Eugene."
01:04:17,940;01:04:19,180;"- We'll be getting this game."
01:04:19,180;01:04:20,340;"There was that third in one"
01:04:20,340;01:04:22,100;"of Ricky Williams' Bursu line."
01:04:22,100;01:04:23,940;"It's one on one, him and Eugene."
01:04:23,940;01:04:25,980;"That's what the same move that Portis put on."
01:04:25,980;01:04:26,980;"Yes."
01:04:26,980;01:04:28,900;"Shoot strings them and holds them right."
01:04:28,900;01:04:29,900;"Oh, yeah, he did."
01:04:29,900;01:04:32,060;"He was like last man, last offender."
01:04:32,060;01:04:34,780;"One on one with Ricky Williams and just catches enough of his feet."
01:04:34,780;01:04:38,340;"He had like a big hit where he laid lumber early in the game and they were talking about"
01:04:38,340;01:04:40,100;"how he went to Illinois."
01:04:40,100;01:04:49,260;"And I think that he was at Illinois when the Patriots had the Miracle on Lake Champlain"
01:04:49,260;01:04:50,260;"game."
01:04:50,260;01:04:51,260;"Oh, you might be right."
01:04:51,260;01:04:52,860;"Because I was there stadium."
01:04:52,860;01:04:55,940;"We were played in there last year."
01:04:55,940;01:05:01,380;"Yeah, it was 2002. Yeah, again, so this is rookie year. So it was a senior year. So you probably was at that fucking game. Oh, fuck"
01:05:01,380;01:05:03,860;"He may have been watching the Patriots come back on the"
01:05:03,860;01:05:11,420;"If you're a senior or whatever about to get NFL drafted on the football team you're at the Patriots game there. That's interesting"
01:05:11,420;01:05:13,420;"I bet. Yeah, I wonder if he was"
01:05:13,420;01:05:16,100;"That's funny"
01:05:16,100;01:05:18,300;"Bad what's your worst?"
01:05:18,300;01:05:21,300;"field go kicking start with the worst, you know, it's finished"
01:05:21,300;01:05:24,820;"All right, a couple last things"
01:05:24,820;01:05:30,260;"Um, the poll that they put up for this game, because they seem to do that every game now,"
01:05:30,260;01:05:33,540;"which of the following players should be the AFC starting Pro Bowl quarterback."
01:05:33,540;01:05:36,040;"I'm going to give you a list here."
01:05:36,040;01:05:38,540;"One of these things, not like the others."
01:05:38,540;01:05:43,940;"Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, Steve McNair, Trent Green, John Kittner."
01:05:43,940;01:05:45,980;"Which one is named?"
01:05:45,980;01:05:46,980;"Right?"
01:05:46,980;01:05:49,180;"Could you get John Kittner asked?"
01:05:49,180;01:05:51,220;"What do you mean?"
01:05:51,220;01:05:52,220;"Kittner's a legend."
01:05:52,220;01:05:53,220;"Yeah."
01:05:53,220;01:05:57,340;"This is one of the Ben is first started getting good too. They've been shit for wicked long. I think"
01:05:57,340;01:06:01,420;"Bengals legend John Kittena. Yeah, kitten is awesome"
01:06:01,420;01:06:03,980;"Whole kitten a kaboodle"
01:06:03,980;01:06:10,020;"Trank green. They're the same. That was an obvious obvious to me. Yeah. No trip. This is Trent Green chief's era"
01:06:10,020;01:06:15,500;"This is he's yeah, he's hitting the ball off the priest homes. Yeah, he's still putting up godly numbers because of it"
01:06:15,500;01:06:16,820;"and"
01:06:16,820;01:06:21,940;"Lastly, this doesn't really have to do with the park guys except that it's"
01:06:21,940;01:06:28,940;"It's both of you are involved in it, but Facebook today gave me those like, oh yeah,"
01:06:28,940;01:06:30,580;"on this day thing."
01:06:30,580;01:06:33,580;"And you were both involved for some reason."
01:06:33,580;01:06:37,260;"And I just want to know if you remember what either of these are about because you both"
01:06:37,260;01:06:39,420;"posted on my Facebook."
01:06:39,420;01:06:45,540;"Greg from 13 years ago, February 18th, 2008."
01:06:45,540;01:06:49,660;"Yo, Andy, you're probably going to poop on for this, but I lost my cell phone this weekend."
01:06:49,660;01:06:52,660;"I need your number so I can call you about tomorrow."
01:06:52,660;01:06:54,940;"And don't tell mom or Ellie."
01:06:54,940;01:06:57,900;"- Okay."
01:06:57,900;01:07:02,900;"- And then Steve's, this, I don't know what it is."
01:07:02,900;01:07:05,500;"So maybe you can try to light on it."
01:07:05,500;01:07:08,380;"12 years ago, February 18th, 2009,"
01:07:08,380;01:07:10,540;"so one year after to the day."
01:07:10,540;01:07:13,540;"One of my roommates does, as to the reason why"
01:07:13,540;01:07:15,260;"your guess is as good as mine,"
01:07:15,260;01:07:17,380;"but you know I got a better arm than you and Greg."
01:07:17,380;01:07:19,980;"He might be the soccer princess, but you're his prince."
01:07:19,980;01:07:27,300;"Well, the last part remains true, but I don't remember the harm part."
01:07:27,300;01:07:28,260;"Don't either."
01:07:28,260;01:07:32,860;"Are you guys scrubbed your Facebook yet?"
01:07:32,860;01:07:36,340;"No, no, I mean, what that means."
01:07:36,340;01:07:41,060;"You know, like every time someone gets drafted, they always comb their."
01:07:41,060;01:07:41,900;"Yeah."
01:07:41,900;01:07:44,140;"I keyword it."
01:07:44,140;01:07:44,860;"It gets you in trouble."
01:07:45,300;01:07:47,740;"I know a keyword searched my Facebook though."
01:07:47,740;01:07:48,940;"How bad was it?"
01:07:48,940;01:07:50,620;"Yeah, there's a bunch of weed stuff,"
01:07:50,620;01:07:52,740;"but nothing really problematic."
01:07:52,740;01:07:56,020;"Dude, I would just openly be like,"
01:07:56,020;01:07:58,940;"yo, let's smoke a blunt this weekend, John."
01:07:58,940;01:08:03,220;"It's a public forum. What was I doing?"
01:08:03,220;01:08:07,700;"Yeah, I did that no less than like 15 times."
01:08:07,700;01:08:11,340;"Yeah, what are the crutches you put out there?"
01:08:11,340;01:08:13,300;"The clearly blood was one of them."
01:08:13,300;01:08:14,300;"Yeah."
01:08:14,300;01:08:14,900;"Yeah."
01:08:14,900;01:08:18,380;"What else? Like weed, smokage."
01:08:18,380;01:08:21,380;"Yeah, like anything like any bad or I could think of."
01:08:21,380;01:08:22,780;"You jibber?"
01:08:22,780;01:08:24,220;"No, that's probably."
01:08:24,220;01:08:25,780;"Holy shit."
01:08:25,780;01:08:27,980;"Yeah. Oh boy."
01:08:27,980;01:08:32,740;"All right. Well, what the hell is next week?"
01:08:32,740;01:08:35,620;"Tuesday, Wednesday."
01:08:35,620;01:08:37,340;"Next week."
01:08:37,340;01:08:39,500;"I mean, there will be those days actually correct."
01:08:39,500;01:08:41,140;"Friday."
01:08:41,140;01:08:43,020;"Well, that's tomorrow."
01:08:43,020;01:08:44,180;"Ooh, tomorrow."
01:08:44,180;01:08:45,620;"What are you guys doing this weekend?"
01:08:45,620;01:08:52,100;"The same thing I do every weekend, which is masturbate furiously over the world."
01:08:52,100;01:08:55,100;"Ooh, that was a deep cut."
01:08:55,100;01:08:55,940;"I know."
01:08:55,940;01:08:57,940;"Smoke a blunt, dude."
01:08:57,940;01:09:04,780;"Uh, getting the puppy this weekend."
01:09:04,780;01:09:11,220;"I, I found one where I was messaging John on Facebook and I posted something."
01:09:11,220;01:09:14,140;"I was like, yo, you ever going to come back and like,"
01:09:14,140;01:09:16,340;"I clean up that pizza, you threw my wall"
01:09:16,340;01:09:18,140;"and fix my smoke detector."
01:09:18,140;01:09:20,400;"(laughing)"
01:09:20,400;01:09:24,020;"- Which is the valid question."
01:09:24,020;01:09:25,740;"- And he goes, that wasn't me."
01:09:25,740;01:09:27,980;"(laughing)"
01:09:27,980;01:09:31,220;"- Clearly him."
01:09:31,220;01:09:32,060;"- Definitely."
01:09:32,060;01:09:37,020;"- All right, next week is back to Gillette again,"
01:09:37,020;01:09:38,420;"back home games."
01:09:38,420;01:09:42,900;"So I'm welcoming in the four and nine Jacksonville Jaguars."
01:09:42,900;01:09:43,740;"- Scared."
01:09:43,740;01:09:44,780;"Can we skip this one?"
01:09:44,780;01:09:46,140;"I do not remember."
01:09:46,140;01:09:47,660;"I don't remember this at all either."
01:09:47,660;01:09:48,660;"You can skip it."
01:09:48,660;01:09:51,780;"Okay, that was expecting."
01:09:51,780;01:09:53,100;"What's the next good one?"
01:09:53,100;01:09:55,460;"Super ball bag."
01:09:55,460;01:09:57,720;"I can't wait for these playoffs."
01:09:57,720;01:10:01,020;"Yeah, the next good was probably the last game of the season."
01:10:01,020;01:10:03,860;"Because the Patriots have just won the AFC East."
01:10:03,860;01:10:04,700;"They did."
01:10:04,700;01:10:07,940;"As we speak it into existence right now."
01:10:07,940;01:10:08,780;"Yep."
01:10:08,780;01:10:12,340;"And they are first in the AFC because Kansas City lost."
01:10:12,340;01:10:16,260;"So both teams are now 11 and two,"
01:10:16,260;01:10:18,180;"and the patients have a better"
01:10:18,180;01:10:22,300;"number one conference record or something like that."
01:10:22,300;01:10:25,500;"'Cause one of their losses was to the NFC."
01:10:25,500;01:10:26,820;"- To the Redskins."
01:10:26,820;01:10:28,020;"- To the Redskins of all teams."
01:10:28,020;01:10:29,820;"- So now we're just talking position"
01:10:29,820;01:10:31,940;"in these last couple of games here, right?"
01:10:31,940;01:10:33,580;"- You went out and you're in first,"
01:10:33,580;01:10:35,740;"you have home field advantage all the way through,"
01:10:35,740;01:10:37,980;"but they've clinched the division already."
01:10:39,260;01:10:41,700;"with six games to go."
01:10:41,700;01:10:42,860;"Is that right?"
01:10:42,860;01:10:44,540;"- No, three games. - Oh no, three games."
01:10:44,540;01:10:45,700;"- Three games and then three play."
01:10:45,700;01:10:46,620;"Okay. - Yeah."
01:10:46,620;01:10:48,740;"- So."
01:10:48,740;01:10:50,580;"- All right, I'll see you guys in the playoffs."
01:10:50,580;01:10:53,340;"(laughing)"
01:10:53,340;01:10:55,140;"- Maybe the Super Bowl."
01:10:55,140;01:10:55,980;"- Maybe the Super Bowl."
01:10:55,980;01:10:56,820;"- No. - Are you kidding me?"
01:10:56,820;01:10:59,060;"- I'm not, the Super Bowl's not even the one"
01:10:59,060;01:11:00,780;"I'm most excited for."
01:11:00,780;01:11:01,620;"- Oh boy."
01:11:01,620;01:11:02,460;"- I have an idea but."
01:11:02,460;01:11:05,980;"- Oh yeah, this is like my favorite fucking single game"
01:11:05,980;01:11:08,260;"performance by any player ever."
01:11:08,260;01:11:11,300;"Oh boy, is this your Eugene thing?"
01:11:11,300;01:11:15,060;"He's actually integral in it too, but no."
01:11:15,060;01:11:15,900;"- Okay."
01:11:15,900;01:11:16,740;"- I know what he's talking about."
01:11:16,740;01:11:18,180;"- Yeah, okay."
01:11:18,180;01:11:19,420;"Okay, yes."
01:11:19,420;01:11:21,660;"- Yes, even now."
01:11:21,660;01:11:23,860;"- All right, well until then,"
01:11:23,860;01:11:25,720;"if you have any feedback for us,"
01:11:25,720;01:11:30,380;"if you wanna hear more of Greg's trivia or drug stories"
01:11:30,380;01:11:34,420;"or you want Stephen to actually put the puppy"
01:11:34,420;01:11:37,980;"on the episode next week, you can text us."
01:11:37,980;01:11:38,820;"- I'm not sure what you'd say."
01:11:38,820;01:11:42,540;"- Also, I wanted to shout out mom,"
01:11:42,540;01:11:44,100;"'cause that's where I get my hatred"
01:11:44,100;01:11:45,600;"of all technology from."
01:11:45,600;01:11:47,780;"(laughing)"
01:11:47,780;01:11:49,180;"That's all I was thinking while I was like,"
01:11:49,180;01:11:51,140;"fucking, cussing out this printer."
01:11:51,140;01:11:53,440;"I was like, this is mom."
01:11:53,440;01:11:55,620;"(laughing)"
01:11:55,620;01:12:00,620;"- Well, I mean, when I used to do IT support my,"
01:12:00,620;01:12:01,900;"every time I go for an interview,"
01:12:01,900;01:12:03,340;"they'd be like, oh, so why are you good at this?"
01:12:03,340;01:12:05,460;"I'm like, well, let me tell you about my mother."
01:12:05,460;01:12:06,940;"I'll tell you this story."
01:12:06,940;01:12:11,460;"One day I came home from college and I walked in"
01:12:11,460;01:12:13,860;"and she was yelling at the printer,"
01:12:13,860;01:12:15,260;"not at me, about the printer,"
01:12:15,260;01:12:17,980;"but at the printer, eventually it turned to me."
01:12:17,980;01:12:20,220;"So she was yelling at the printer and said,"
01:12:20,220;01:12:23,180;"""What's going on? What's up with the printer?"""
01:12:23,180;01:12:24,020;"And she turns, ""Look at me."""
01:12:24,020;01:12:27,460;"She says, ""God damn fucking printer, won't print."""
01:12:27,460;01:12:29,460;"I'm like, ""Okay, what's going on?"""
01:12:29,460;01:12:31,140;"She said, ""I don't fucking know, won't fucking print."""
01:12:31,140;01:12:32,860;"So I walk over, look at the printer"
01:12:32,860;01:12:35,260;"and I hit the on button and it turns on"
01:12:35,260;01:12:36,900;"and starts to print."
01:12:36,900;01:12:39,680;"And so to thank me, she turns to me and says,"
01:12:39,680;01:12:42,480;"why the fuck does a printer have an on button?"
01:12:42,480;01:12:43,880;"It storms away."
01:12:43,880;01:12:45,880;"- My favorite was, this was me,"
01:12:45,880;01:12:48,760;"like I walked the door coming home from college."

01:13:03,000;01:13:06,360;"I walk over, I mean, I've done iTunes before"
01:13:06,360;01:13:12,160;"I just double click a song I said it's fine and she goes what'd you do? I was like a double click this like you got a click it twice"
01:13:12,160;01:13:19,000;"I was like mom after like you click the ones. What was your next troubleshooting thing to do?"

01:13:40,600;01:13:42,440;"which I need to learn that."
01:13:42,440;01:13:45,740;"That like, I just get so mad at like the people"

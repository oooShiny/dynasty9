00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:22,080;"I am not your mother."
00:22,080;00:24,640;"Welcome back to the Page of Stancey podcast."
00:24,640;00:27,160;"I am your host, Andy Brown."
00:27,160;00:33,080;"We are going through every game of the Patriots dynasty era."
00:33,080;00:34,200;"We started in 2001."
00:34,200;00:38,720;"We are now week 14 of 2004."
00:38,720;00:41,560;"Patriots hosting the Cincinnati Bengals."
00:41,560;00:45,320;"So with me as always is a reliable brother Steve Brown."
00:45,320;00:46,320;"That's right."
00:46,320;00:49,480;"Mr. reliable Steve, reliable Brown, just like Troy Brown."
00:49,480;00:50,480;"Also very reliable."
00:50,480;00:51,480;"Sure."
00:51,480;00:53,080;"We'll go with that."
00:53,080;00:57,120;"Greg Brown today because he's tired from working."
00:57,120;00:59,080;"No, that's not true."
00:59,080;01:00,080;"We got rid of Greg."
01:00,080;01:01,080;"We upgraded him."
01:01,080;01:06,440;"So yeah, so yeah, well, without further ado, Steve, you have brought a, brought us a guest."
01:06,440;01:07,800;"Do we like to introduce us?"
01:07,800;01:10,840;"I know all of the long suffering NFL franchise fans."
01:10,840;01:19,160;"So my, my, my buddy David Prue, the Bengals fan is joining us for this 2004 week 14, first"
01:19,160;01:20,160;"the Bengals."
01:20,160;01:22,160;"I"
01:22,160;01:33,500;"And thanks for the opportunity to join you guys. I look forward to discussing the Bengals and Carson Palmer's first year as a pool starter. Yeah"
01:33,500;01:39,080;"Long suffering no more as well. That's true. Yeah, you guys are riding high finally"
01:39,080;01:45,560;"We'll say I remember I was in the party for you before the season started you were stoked about the Bengals you were right"
01:45,560;01:49,840;"Yeah, all right. Yeah, so should we start there? Um, I"
01:49,840;01:52,640;"How do you feel about this most recent Super Bowl?"
01:52,640;01:57,680;"- Yeah, no, seriously, it was a,"
01:57,680;02:01,160;"now the next back of the year,"
02:01,160;02:03,560;"you know, we're riding the Abujeri borough,"
02:03,560;02:05,720;"Joe Marchace, what a great pickup."
02:05,720;02:10,400;"You know, the big young man playing quarterback"
02:10,400;02:13,280;"at Sac Way more jobs than we wish."
02:13,280;02:18,280;"Looks like our offensive line has been addressed very well."
02:18,280;02:25,580;"You know, but this, I don't know the experience of being a new English sports fan, because"
02:25,580;02:27,420;"you guys have rings."
02:27,420;02:29,780;"We have disappointment."
02:29,780;02:37,700;"So as happy as we were about making it a Super Bowl, it ended the way since the sports"
02:37,700;02:42,980;"ends as always with a close call and a loss."
02:42,980;02:47,820;"Well, we feel great, but what I do now is still,"
02:47,820;02:51,540;"the national media is still things that was a one year wonder."
02:51,540;02:56,340;"And it puts doubt in the centralized work fans head,"
02:56,340;02:57,140;"what do I hear that?"
02:57,140;03:02,140;"So we're hoping to accomplish our goals, get back there."
03:02,140;03:09,740;"But when you watch ESPN and all these other channels,"
03:11,220;03:14,260;"We're not big on the other top of the MSC still."
03:14,260;03:15,940;"So, you know, it's so question"
03:15,940;03:18,020;"whether or not it's retainable."
03:18,020;03:19,460;"- Wow, that's your problem right there."
03:19,460;03:20,980;"Listen to ESPN."
03:20,980;03:21,820;"- That is, yeah."
03:21,820;03:22,660;"- You should hear Boston Sports Talk,"
03:22,660;03:24,380;"apparently the Patriots are fucking"
03:24,380;03:26,860;"never gonna win a game ever again."
03:26,860;03:27,820;"- Yeah."
03:27,820;03:28,720;"- There was a-- - Sorry to talk"
03:28,720;03:31,700;"about packaging Mac Jones"
03:31,700;03:34,260;"and two first round draft picks for Russell Wilson."
03:34,260;03:35,660;"(laughing)"
03:35,660;03:37,700;"Even though he's already been traded."
03:37,700;03:39,140;"So that's cool."
03:39,140;03:44,300;"There was a note from the commentators or stat in this game that the Bengals hadn't had"
03:44,300;03:45,940;"a winning season since 1990."
03:45,940;03:46,940;"This is the-"
03:46,940;03:51,140;"Yeah, but they had been 8-8 for the past, what, 2 or 3 years or something like that?"
03:51,140;03:52,140;"And they would-"
03:52,140;03:53,140;"They'd have to start a great game."
03:53,140;03:54,140;"Right?"
03:54,140;03:57,300;"And then they go to the playoffs a bunch of years in a row and lose because Carson's good"
03:57,300;04:00,220;"and then just couldn't get over that first round hump."
04:00,220;04:04,900;"Well, they had the Carson injury too, which was like that was their one year where they"
04:04,900;04:07,940;"were kind of similar to this past year."
04:07,940;04:25,940;"of the one, came up on off and with the Steelers went low on Carson bomber. But since that true, since I sport fans are not cost Carson bomber fans because Carson bomber has been very negative."
04:25,940;04:30,140;"towards the Bengals for a very long time,"
04:30,140;04:35,140;"even recently saying that the Bengals will never protect"
04:35,140;04:38,740;"and he needs to find his way out after two great years."
04:38,740;04:43,140;"So Carson Ballmer's a four-letter work here"
04:43,140;04:45,260;"in the greater Cincinnati area."
04:45,260;04:46,580;"- This is why we brought you on."
04:46,580;04:49,460;"I would have assumed that they love Carson Palmer."
04:49,460;04:51,900;"- Not at all, not at all."
04:51,900;04:58,900;"we've also met him and and obviously over the Super Bowl"
04:58,900;05:03,700;"coverage, Carson Palmer was spoke up very heavily against the"
05:03,700;05:09,020;"Mingles for an office and you know he's been out of the league for a couple"
05:09,020;05:12,500;"years now I don't know why he's even around them anymore."
05:12,500;05:16,900;"So what do they think about Corey Dillon?"
05:16,900;05:21,100;"That's a great transition."
05:21,100;05:27,180;"Okay, okay, he also shot his way out of town. Yeah, like worse"
05:27,180;05:39,300;"Right because Corey was an exceptional talent got very little support and got frustrated and"
05:39,300;05:42,660;"you know, you know, the obviously the"
05:42,660;05:48,820;"The number one thing was either a badge and a helmet and a stand he did get his helmet back"
05:50,460;05:56,780;"Which was a big deal for him but at that time that the franchise was in shambles and"
05:56,780;06:03,020;"And it very very much should have been and Carson bomber didn't have what he needed"
06:03,020;06:09,580;"And he forces way out and Marvin Lewis actually endorsed him to Bellachek"
06:09,580;06:12,340;"When they were gonna make the trade"
06:12,340;06:18,180;"But at that time he needed his way out very similar to what's going on with Cincinnati Sports now with the Reds"
06:19,460;06:21,460;"the red zone or just"
06:21,460;06:26,900;"One of the reds proud all presenters just told the fans on opening day"
06:26,900;06:30,980;"Where else are you gonna go if you don't like the product get out of here?"
06:30,980;06:35,100;"And I was tuition motto in"
06:35,100;06:42,580;"2004 and five and six and now the the Bengals PR team and front office"
06:42,580;06:46,660;"Our rock stars in this town. So Corey did what you need to do"
06:46,660;06:50,000;"I'm always afforded that and I'm glad he got his ring"
06:50,000;06:56,460;"So you were rooting for him in 04 what's that the Super Bowl that he plays in you're definitely all about him"
06:56,460;07:00,880;"No, we were we were rooting for we were rooting for core down"
07:00,880;07:04,280;"Well, and that's not the Patriots just Corey got it"
07:04,280;07:07,480;"Not the Patriots. I get that"
07:07,480;07:10,020;"But just going back and watching the video"
07:10,020;07:13,620;"Just saying you know fifth year for"
07:14,540;07:22,180;"Dollar check and all everything they were building up to it's kind of neat to go back and watch that in hindsight"
07:22,180;07:24,580;"And we'll get where they were"
07:24,580;07:30,900;"We're not patriot haters as much as you think we are mr. Brown. We're being the big supporters"
07:30,900;07:36,020;"Yes, so we're doing and we're rooting for Chad Johnson when Chad got there. I'm a"
07:36,020;07:39,900;"Worked out you guys got our"
07:39,900;07:43,300;"Can we call them sloppy seconds on there? Oh, yeah"
07:44,300;07:50,340;"You guys got his lobby for options in court. You are a kid didn't you know, I don't like work head"
07:50,340;07:55,940;"He was sweet a rec break actually played alive also one of our former properties"
07:55,940;07:58,720;"Rex was a very nice young man"
07:58,720;08:02,840;"Yeah, you guys gotta cut a couple sloppy so happy seconds, but"
08:02,840;08:10,080;"We really were he worked his tail off. Yeah, yeah, that's what it seems like when I was doing my deep dive on him"
08:10,080;08:15,880;"He was just the kind of guy who was like the lone bright spot on the Bengals for basically"
08:15,880;08:16,880;"his entire career."
08:16,880;08:23,480;"Yeah, yeah, really Anderson was awesome at that time and should be an all-fame in my"
08:23,480;08:27,280;"opinion as a tackle."
08:27,280;08:33,280;"But Corey was just a, he was a blue collar, grinder, Cincinnati."
08:33,280;08:35,680;"I hate to say the word Pittsburgh."
08:35,680;08:40,360;"you know what is one of the not one of the not one of the northeast uh..."
08:40,360;08:44,160;"you know country type uh... north east america types"
08:44,160;08:46,040;"they get all handed to them"
08:46,040;08:47,880;"cori dell and a grinder"
08:47,880;08:51,760;"and uh... he just work itself so that's why we we supported him"
08:51,760;08:54,480;"when he left even though he went to the enemy"
08:54,480;09:00,320;"see you can tell they've never even been out of the state of kentucky"
09:00,320;09:02,080;"uh... boy"
09:02,080;09:04,680;"yeah all right uh..."
09:04,680;09:09,360;"Let's see, let's talk about this 2004 Bengals team briefly too."
09:09,360;09:13,640;"Because like you said, it's the Carson Palmer's first year as a starter."
09:13,640;09:18,920;"Start off a little rocky and then seemed to turn it around."
09:18,920;09:20,600;"They had one coming into this game."
09:20,600;09:22,800;"They had won their four of their last five."
09:22,800;09:27,800;"The week before they had beat the Ravens."
09:27,800;09:31,680;"Before quarter comeback, Carson Palmer played probably his best game"
09:31,680;09:33,280;"of his career at this point."
09:33,960;09:40,040;"And the week before that was the shoot out with the Browns that we talked about last week when the pages play the Browns"
09:40,040;09:42,360;"That's the"
09:42,360;09:50,920;"Was it was like 48 45 I think it's still the second highest scoring dawn overtime game in the history of the NFL that it was Browns Bengals"
09:50,920;09:53,720;"And the Bengals still won by two scores"
09:53,720;09:56,760;"in a shootout"
09:56,760;09:57,800;"So"
09:57,800;09:59,800;"So they're coming in flying pretty high"
10:01,000;10:06,840;"They're even though they're only six and six, but Carson Palmer does get hurt in this game in the second half"
10:06,840;10:12,760;"Kind of it was almost foreshadowing the the chemo van olafson"
10:12,760;10:17,800;"Hit i thought because it was kind of like low in the side of his knee and I guess he had a"
10:17,800;10:22,760;"A sprain in his knee is what they they said on the the highlights afterwards"
10:22,760;10:27,720;"Um, so I work someone hit tom Brady like that and the NFL made it illegal"
10:28,520;10:32,600;"Right. Well, actually, they made it illegal when car."
10:32,600;10:36,320;"We call that a Tom Brady rule, not the Carson Palmer"
10:36,320;10:38,520;"was a certain time where he went."
10:38,520;10:40,840;"I think it is the Carson Palmer rule that and they did."
10:40,840;10:43,160;"They put it in that off season."
10:43,160;10:46,800;"And then it's just everybody remembers the Tom Brady one"
10:46,800;10:50,240;"because he was coming off his 2007 season."
10:50,240;10:53,800;"Yeah. Very sad. Yeah."
10:53,800;10:57,720;"So yeah, but so this is a kind of a promising upstart."
10:57,720;11:06,160;"Bengals team. But a bright spot would be that they would make their first appearance on Monday"
11:06,160;11:13,720;"night football since 1992, where they would beat the Denver Broncos at home. But there"
11:13,720;11:20,160;"one, I would say Achilles heel for this team up until just very recently was that they were"
11:20,160;11:26,960;"coached by Marvin Lewis. And so I'm curious to get a Bengals fans perspective on Marvin"
11:26,960;11:32,440;"Lewis because he was one of those coaches who, I mean, it's almost like the Andy Dalton"
11:32,440;11:36,880;"line where it's the Marvin Lewis line where he will get you the playoffs, but you will"
11:36,880;11:42,300;"not win a playoff game. And is that good or is that not good? He's like a little bit"
11:42,300;11:43,960;"better Jeff Fisher."
11:43,960;11:44,960;"Yeah."
11:44,960;11:56,940;"Well, you know, in 2005, Marvel was great. You know, we came out of nowhere. We started"
11:56,940;12:04,460;"win games 2005 it was the AFC champions if I believe right that was the year after"
12:04,460;12:10,540;"this year so you could get a model game in championship culture but he changed the culture"
12:10,540;12:17,420;"today we're good enough and we're good enough to make the playoffs we're good enough to win"
12:17,420;12:25,420;"nine or ten games and that was great until it good enough became the standard."
12:25,420;12:32,620;"And so that was a problem but in that 2004 game with the talent that they had"
12:32,620;12:40,940;"with the first year starter tomorrow was a hero and you know not to get into"
12:40,940;12:48,940;"anything much more, you know, we had an African American coach, one of the few, and"
12:48,940;12:55,460;"I think it resonated great with the players at that time to have one of the"
12:55,460;13:02,820;"few and to Jan and Marzemann Zada, who's a very strong personality. I don't know if"
13:02,820;13:09,860;"we could have had a different coach at the time to get to the wrong. The problem"
13:09,860;13:17,700;"was Marvin could never get him over the hump. But if we're going back to the 2004-2005-2006 era,"
13:17,700;13:28,180;"it certainly was better than Dave Schuyla. And a lot of the coaches we had three Marvin"
13:28,180;13:35,140;"loans. And he's had a great tenure. But if you ask me a question of 2004, we were ecstatic."
13:35,780;13:40,660;"Yes, man. Question of 2008, 1716 before we made this list."
13:40,660;13:43,620;"And it's time to make this legend."
13:43,620;13:46,500;"The same would have been said for our current coach"
13:46,500;13:52,900;"after year one and year two. So I really believe, you know, you have to give these guys a little more"
13:52,900;13:56,420;"leash than what they need. It's hard to change culture."
13:56,420;14:02,340;"As Mr. Brown knows and everything we do, Steve, you know, it's hard to change culture."
14:02,900;14:06,580;"Sometimes you gotta be the bad guy. It's not hard for me. I don't have to do any of it."
14:06,580;14:18,420;"That feels about right. That sums up."
14:18,420;14:28,020;"Fair enough. All right. Yeah. He didn't fare very well against bell checking the Patriots."
14:28,900;14:30,900;"The Pats went six and one"
14:30,900;14:33,300;"First Marvin Lewis led Bengals"
14:33,300;14:39,760;"Steve do you remember the loss or do we either of you remember the Patriots loss of the Bengals?"
14:39,760;14:42,260;"Having in 2000"
14:42,260;14:46,160;"It was not"
14:46,160;14:51,500;"No, I remember I only remember because it was in the rain and Brady just couldn't throw a touchdown"
14:51,500;14:57,980;"As well as like slog games in Cincinnati. It was just awful year was it 2013. It was just"
14:57,980;14:59,980;"It was like the last years."
14:59,980;15:01,980;"Yeah, it was. Yeah."
15:01,980;15:02,980;"It was a tough game."
15:02,980;15:05,980;"This game does have a name though."
15:05,980;15:06,980;"Okay."
15:06,980;15:07,980;"It does."
15:07,980;15:08,980;"How certain games have names and you watch."
15:08,980;15:10,980;"Oh, yeah, that's the whatever game."
15:10,980;15:11,980;"Yeah."
15:11,980;15:13,980;"This is the, I don't know what do you call it?"
15:13,980;15:15,980;"What's your name for this game, Andy?"
15:15,980;15:17,980;"The Corey Dillon revenge game."
15:17,980;15:18,980;"No, no."
15:18,980;15:21,980;"Oh, you're thinking that you missed the big play."
15:21,980;15:22,980;"Oh."
15:22,980;15:25,980;"Well, I mean, which big play?"
15:25,980;15:27,300;"play. There's a few."
15:27,300;15:30,420;"- You call it like a butt pass or a seated pass or?"
15:30,420;15:32,060;"- Oh, that, okay. So there is that."
15:32,060;15:35,060;"I mean, there's a lot to get into in this game."
15:35,060;15:36,620;"But before we do that, let's just real quick."
15:36,620;15:38,460;"I want to go over some of the other coaches in this,"
15:38,460;15:42,540;"this team because it's just the fact that they were,"
15:42,540;15:47,260;"ah, fuck it doesn't matter."
15:47,260;15:48,100;"No, my."
15:48,100;15:49,660;"(laughs)"
15:49,660;15:51,500;"- I'll try to, I'll try to,"
15:51,500;15:52,340;"I'll try to, I'll try to,"
15:52,340;15:53,740;"shoe or a new Jackson in there somehow, but,"
15:53,740;15:54,740;"bucket."
15:54,740;15:56,140;"See the lot in the coaching side."
15:56,140;15:58,660;"You Jackson out of a lot of conversations."
15:58,660;16:01,100;"You'll be okay here in Cincinnati."
16:01,100;16:02,100;"It's not where."
16:02,100;16:03,100;"Yeah."
16:03,100;16:06,500;"I mean, he's he's the wide receivers coach and he's coaching Chad Jackson and TJ who's"
16:06,500;16:07,500;"mr."
16:07,500;16:16,260;"And somehow managed to turn that into a head coaching career where he went three and"
16:16,260;16:20,540;"thirty six and one with the Browns."
16:20,540;16:30,620;"some work. He was 500 with the Raiders. For how many games? Two? Yeah, one in one. I think"
16:30,620;16:39,100;"he was even able to write it. All right. I mean, he was not a someone else. We're gonna really"
16:39,100;16:44,300;"want to talk much about him since then, and because he's he's still a little disgruntled since"
16:46,460;16:50,060;"He didn't get the head coaching job here when Marvin decided stuff."
16:50,060;16:50,860;"Wow, that's right."
16:50,860;16:51,180;"Right."
16:51,180;16:51,580;"Right."
16:51,580;16:51,820;"Yeah."
16:51,820;16:53,420;"Now we did."
16:53,420;16:53,660;"Yeah."
16:53,660;17:00,380;"It went 8 and 8 in Oakland before going 1 and 15, 0 and 16 and then 2, 5 and 1 in Cleveland in three years."
17:00,380;17:01,820;"How do you get that third season?"
17:01,820;17:03,420;"I've got my stats there."
17:03,420;17:05,340;"Round game."
17:05,340;17:07,980;"I know why you Jackson."
17:07,980;17:11,500;"But I mean, the stuff I just stuck out from that ball game with me,"
17:12,060;17:19,920;"What would the revenge game one? I don't think Dylan got much revenge. He did he's on a touchdown. It wasn't a touchdown true"
17:19,920;17:22,340;"He was actually down. Yeah"
17:22,340;17:28,760;"Rudy John. It looked like a Rudy Johnson revenge game in the first half. Yeah, he was pretty good"
17:28,760;17:36,580;"Well, I mean pretty much it came down to bulk control that"
17:38,740;17:44,560;"Interception for a touchdown. I think change it and and I love Troy Brown to white player"
17:44,560;17:47,740;"a toy brown and"
17:47,740;17:52,020;"We're scored to touch down on our interception"
17:52,020;17:54,900;"Sante Samuel"
17:54,900;17:57,780;"Rookie by looking at that deep months on"
17:57,780;18:04,980;"Acting how the bing was gonna win against risky Harrison Seymour McGinnis will fork"
18:05,940;18:10,620;"You keep coming coming into the game everyone was worried because the Bengals could throw the ball around the yard"
18:10,620;18:12,980;"We're starting earthwind, warland didn't yeah"
18:12,980;18:25,780;"Yeah, they're secondary so bad. Yeah, it was just a secondary that was the issue and so going up against a"
18:25,780;18:31,020;"Pass heavy team you kind of expected the bang was come out just slinging the ball and they really didn't"
18:31,020;18:47,020;"the one that, and then the one that was a success on the ground. They ran Rudy a lot. And Rudy had a great game, except for that fumble that I don't think was a fumble other, but we can. Bring that non fumble and non touch down to Bing was probably win that game."
18:47,020;18:50,740;"I know, I just, because there was a third down, they would have gone for it on fourth"
18:50,740;18:52,460;"and Corey Dolan to punch that through."
18:52,460;18:59,060;"But I think that was one of the first times that Brady Snake really turned into a Brady"
18:59,060;19:00,060;"Snake."
19:00,060;19:01,060;"You think so?"
19:01,060;19:06,460;"He's snuck it on board down and got about three yards and that changed the game too."
19:06,460;19:09,100;"Well, that's, I mean, that's just what he's been doing."
19:09,100;19:10,580;"That's what he's been doing."
19:10,580;19:15,620;"Like since, since week one, like of his career, that's kind of what he's been doing."
19:15,620;19:16,460;"- That is."
19:16,460;19:19,980;"- I don't know how it took so many teams so long to stop it."
19:19,980;19:22,740;"I'm a little surprised that the play"
19:22,740;19:26,460;"that I keep seeing pop up is the Patriots go"
19:26,460;19:30,020;"five wide real quick and Brady's in the shotgun"
19:30,020;19:32,300;"to start out with sends everybody out wide"
19:32,300;19:34,820;"so that you don't have much of defenders in the box"
19:34,820;19:37,980;"and then just steps up underneath the center"
19:37,980;19:41,820;"and goose is in and gets the two, three,"
19:41,820;19:43,660;"however many yards he needs that way."
19:43,660;19:44,500;"And it's just so simple."
19:44,500;19:46,060;"- He's the only one who needs one."
19:46,060;19:47,700;"I mean, he gets three when he needs one."
19:47,700;19:49,580;"He doesn't get one and a half."
19:49,580;19:51,220;"He always gets three."
19:51,220;19:52,740;"- Yeah, and he does it every time."
19:52,740;19:55,900;"I think he has like a 98% success rate or something."
19:55,900;19:57,260;"He's been doing it for 20 years."
19:57,260;19:58,860;"It's unbelievable."
19:58,860;20:00,900;"- One of the best short yardage backs"
20:00,900;20:01,980;"in the history of the NFL."
20:01,980;20:04,060;"- Well, that's how he got to a thousand yards doing it, right?"
20:04,060;20:05,420;"Like two yards."
20:05,420;20:06,260;"- He did."
20:06,260;20:09,900;"I think his longest carry is like 22 yards."
20:09,900;20:11,420;"- I think he've already seen it too."
20:11,420;20:12,260;"- Yeah."
20:12,260;20:13,460;"- He was like, ""Oh, two."""
20:13,460;20:16,700;"Yeah, it was not, it was not a reason."
20:16,700;20:19,380;"Um, they have baby gazelle out there."
20:19,380;20:20,540;"They're all arms and legs."
20:20,540;20:21,500;"Oh my God."
20:21,500;20:21,660;"Yeah."
20:21,660;20:21,940;"It does."
20:21,940;20:23,220;"It looks like a baby giraffe."
20:23,220;20:25,660;"Just been born, learn how to use its arms and legs."
20:25,660;20:28,380;"Uh, super patch fans."
20:28,380;20:32,940;"Why is this called the delivery bench game?"
20:32,940;20:38,900;"And if Dylan was a non factor is because he really only plays one year."
20:38,900;20:40,100;"Right."
20:40,300;20:43,420;"Because Corey Dillon is not really a factor outside of this one season."
20:43,420;20:45,460;"I mean, this is, yeah, this is big."
20:45,460;20:49,420;"I think he next season does OK, but yeah, the wheels kind of fall off of me."
20:49,420;20:49,900;"It's hurt."
20:49,900;20:52,780;"It's replaced by Lawrence Moroni, I believe, all people."
20:52,780;20:55,700;"And I say this is not known for the Corey Dillon revenge game."
20:55,700;20:59,700;"This game is known for that play where Tom Brady lands on his ass after like"
20:59,700;21:02,500;"stumbling over his own feet, dropping back and throws."
21:02,500;21:04,300;"That's in my notes."
21:04,300;21:06,100;"And I love that."
21:06,100;21:06,580;"Yeah."
21:06,580;21:10,260;"I want to sum that up in a name, but like, I don't know, but past name."
21:10,260;21:17,940;"game game game I don't know yeah yeah I don't know why it's a game game because"
21:17,940;21:29,140;"I've got in my notes great passes from his ass yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah"
21:29,140;21:35,640;"simply ass past game but I still don't think he had the I think we were so"
21:35,640;21:42,840;"figured out who he was and I think between the quarterback snake, the ass past and"
21:42,840;21:48,840;"just the way he handled himself. I mean you got Christian Fourier, a sport of touch. I mean"
21:48,840;21:55,640;"you got Troy Brown's for you know getting an interception. I mean it's just always been the"
21:55,640;22:02,920;"no name you know other than the names are on the defense on that team and that's awesome and I"
22:02,920;22:07,920;"I wish in Cincinnati we had that kind of a lot."
22:07,920;22:11,080;"- And no receivers over like five foot 10."
22:11,080;22:13,200;"- Yeah, always the title, guys."
22:13,200;22:17,080;"- Yeah, but I mean, yeah, to your point,"
22:17,080;22:20,240;"I think the reason this is the Dylan revenge game"
22:20,240;22:24,320;"is 'cause that's how it was posed pregame, you know?"
22:24,320;22:28,080;"And like all the highlights were about how Corey Dylan"
22:28,080;22:31,720;"was still hated by the Bengals and like even in the announcers"
22:31,720;22:32,560;"when he scored his first touch,"
22:32,560;22:34,520;"and he's like, oh, it's nice to see everybody still being"
22:34,520;22:36,680;"professional and that there's no extra pushing and shoving"
22:36,680;22:38,560;"after he scored sort of shit."
22:38,560;22:42,720;"So I think they were expecting it to be this like super kind"
22:42,720;22:46,840;"of like scrappy, touch and go sort of thing."
22:46,840;22:49,120;"And it just wasn't."
22:49,120;22:51,760;"- Well, that's a testament to his work ethic here"
22:51,760;22:52,840;"in Cincinnati."
22:52,840;22:54,800;"The people that were in the trenches with them,"
22:54,800;22:58,200;"the grinded with them were happy for him."
22:58,200;22:59,040;"- Yeah."
22:59,040;23:02,000;"- And at that time, most of them probably wish"
23:02,000;23:08,720;"they weren't out of Cincinnati. And so they didn't hold that against him. They were happy"
23:08,720;23:15,360;"for him because he actually found his way. It was dysfunctional and all means here at"
23:15,360;23:21,320;"that time and has been up until the last couple of years. So yeah, I mean, I get it. And the"
23:21,320;23:29,040;"last image of him in Cincinnati was thrown his pads in the stands. So whatever, how"
23:29,040;23:35,240;"You know, whatever, how else are you going to do the, you know, the story going into it as broadcast or"
23:35,240;23:42,000;"other than he's going back up against him. But now I think that everybody was classy and he's still in"
23:42,000;23:42,960;"school on that touchdown."
23:42,960;23:46,160;"Okay. And let's not pretend like Corey do doesn't have a good game."
23:46,160;23:48,560;"22 carries 88 yards a touchdown."
23:48,560;23:49,240;"It's four."
23:49,240;23:56,880;"And they said in the broadcast he's the only player ever and that this may even still stand to get 75 plus"
23:56,880;23:58,600;"rushing yards in every game he's played."
23:59,600;24:01,280;"The room is really jobs and stats."
24:01,280;24:05,680;"Kind of similar. Very similar."
24:05,680;24:12,480;"Dylan had one less yard, but a better average in a tuddy."
24:12,480;24:16,160;"Right. And get in the game and played pretty well."
24:16,160;24:17,600;"The end, you did. Yeah."
24:17,600;24:21,440;"Getting ahead of nine for 13, one, 26 a touchdown and a pick."
24:21,440;24:23,840;"Yeah. But I mean, Detroit Brown."
24:23,840;24:27,640;"It's tough to say you've had a good day as a quarterback,"
24:27,640;24:32,760;"when the one interception you threw was to a converted wide receiver in the end."
24:32,760;24:38,360;"In the end, it has a bad place to go picked. And you know, I mean, Drew Bledsoke can attest."
24:38,360;24:45,960;"But add the my favorite fact from this game is after this game, Troy Brown has now three"
24:45,960;24:51,720;"interceptions on the season, which is tied for the team lead. In these options, Troy Brown is"
24:51,720;24:56,680;"leading the team leading this defense of all defenses. The 2004 doing the game."
24:56,680;25:01,920;"Was it was amazing that was right when I'm a he played everywhere"
25:01,920;25:06,640;"And he wound up didn't his career end at the Preble with a"
25:06,640;25:11,500;"Catch in the sand and he heard himself. No, I was with I was there running back. Yeah"
25:11,500;25:13,120;"Robert"
25:13,120;25:19,000;"I'm not sure. Yeah, I'm he played everything he did everything. I enjoy that hurt himself in the Preble"
25:19,000;25:21,400;"No, Robert. It's what's like what he does five"
25:21,400;25:24,280;"No, Robert. I was like early"
25:26,080;25:29,080;"I think it was like, my affection 2000."
25:29,080;25:31,920;"'Cause he was supposed to be replacing"
25:31,920;25:34,280;"for Curtis Martin, I believe."
25:34,280;25:35,120;"- Oh yeah."
25:35,120;25:39,120;"- And like he had a great rookie season in the Pro Bowl."
25:39,120;25:40,960;"He tore it and like, he was just never the same."
25:40,960;25:42,120;"- Played in sand football."
25:42,120;25:43,880;"It was like, exploded his knee and never played again."
25:43,880;25:45,240;"No, he did play again."
25:45,240;25:46,600;"- He did, he played for the-"
25:46,600;25:47,600;"- On his podcast, yeah."
25:47,600;25:49,160;"- Yeah, he played for Miami."
25:49,160;25:52,920;"And did nothing, 'cause he just wasn't the same guy."
25:54,680;26:00,520;"list off the Bengals turnovers in this game. Okay. First drive, Rudy Johnson"
26:00,520;26:09,360;"fumble on the 12. Even though. Yeah. That's pretty sure even the game log."
26:09,360;26:13,880;"Then pick six right after the Patriots score touchdown, they come out and"
26:13,880;26:17,800;"immediately throw a pick six. Yeah. So two touchdowns and 12 seconds."
26:17,800;26:22,220;"Yeah. And then John Kitna throwing that interception to Troy Brown in"
26:22,520;26:24,160;"turn around zone and zone. Yeah."
26:24,160;26:26,480;"And he took it out of the three."
26:26,480;26:27,960;"Would you should have stayed down?"
26:27,960;26:29,680;"He should have. But I mean, you know,"
26:29,680;26:33,520;"when you're a wide receiver and a punt"
26:33,520;26:35,360;"returner, like all that just looks like"
26:35,360;26:37,520;"green fields. You can't help yourself."
26:37,520;26:38,960;"But they're on the New England 10"
26:38,960;26:40,720;"yard line. So there's three turnovers"
26:40,720;26:43,840;"inside the 15. Yeah."
26:43,840;26:46,080;"In the red zone or in the Patriots."
26:46,080;26:48,600;"Yeah."
26:48,600;26:50,840;"Cory down was traded for the Medillo"
26:50,840;26:54,000;"Williams I think is what that pick wind up being"
26:54,000;27:00,660;"He was traded for a pick it turned into Madee Williams and Madee was a fan favorite here"
27:00,660;27:02,920;"But yes, yes"
27:02,920;27:08,400;"Grading falls and complete pass from his ass is the biggest thing I have circled in my nose"
27:08,400;27:13,520;"It should be the the buck bumble and the ass pass"
27:13,520;27:20,420;"There's a game should go down on history. I got a difference. Thank you if they replayed that on"
27:20,420;27:25,420;"and he has been now, most people probably forgot about that aspis."
27:25,420;27:26,700;"- Oh, definitely."
27:26,700;27:27,540;"- Yeah."
27:27,540;27:28,380;"- Yeah."
27:28,380;27:29,220;"- I think-"
27:29,220;27:30,060;"- But you see it as a major saying, you go,"
27:30,060;27:30,900;"""Oh shit, I remember that."""
27:30,900;27:31,740;"But you don't really thought about it."
27:31,740;27:32,580;"- No, yeah, yeah."
27:32,580;27:33,420;"- That's the difference between us and the Jets."
27:33,420;27:34,620;"The Jets have the butt fumble."
27:34,620;27:36,020;"We have the ass pass, you know?"
27:36,020;27:38,100;"This is two totally different franchises going"
27:38,100;27:39,500;"in totally different directions."
27:39,500;27:42,420;"- We also won that game and I don't think the Jets won"
27:42,420;27:43,900;"the butt funnel game."
27:43,900;27:45,940;"- Oh, they very much did not."
27:45,940;27:47,420;"(laughing)"
27:47,420;27:49,620;"- They got like 40, they got four touchdowns scored"
27:49,620;27:55,140;"like a minute and a half, right? It was it was three touchdowns in under a minute. Yeah."
27:55,140;27:59,140;"Mark Sanchez looks great on TV though. He does. He's a very pretty man."
27:59,140;28:07,140;"Guys, any other questions for me before I have bogged down your stuff too much,"
28:07,140;28:10,340;"I could do this for days and days. I love this stuff. I know you can."
28:10,340;28:13,940;"I mean, we started a podcast to do this, so we could also do this for days and days."
28:16,020;28:22,740;"What's Brady gonna do? Is this why I swear on? What do you guys think?"
28:22,740;28:27,300;"You know what? It's nice not to have to worry about that anymore."
28:27,300;28:31,460;"Yeah, it's basically really nice. You know, you don't have to. It's not really my problem."
28:31,460;28:35,380;"He's a maggones. He's reached his Brett Farr."
28:35,380;28:41,140;"Yeah. You're secretly stalking him, Steve Brown. I know you are."
28:41,140;28:43,140;"Oh, don't you know"
28:43,140;28:48,040;"Dms you're keeping an eye on him. I know you are of course I keep an eye on him"
28:48,040;28:51,840;"He's like it's like an ex girlfriend. You know you sometimes check their social medias or whatever"
28:51,840;28:57,820;"Just yeah, just to see if they're happier or less happy without you. Hopefully everything's working out for them"
28:57,820;28:59,420;"Wish them all the best"
28:59,420;29:01,420;"And if it's not the best that's fine, too"
29:01,420;29:05,980;"It's fine"
29:09,620;29:11,900;"- Troy Brown is the pages player that you married."
29:11,900;29:12,980;"You know, you love Troy Brown."
29:12,980;29:14,180;"He's everything you ever wanted."
29:14,180;29:16,420;"- I love Troy Brown as well."
29:16,420;29:18,380;"- We're the number one Troy Brown fans."
29:18,380;29:20,540;"We're working our hardest to get him on his podcast."
29:20,540;29:21,700;"- Yeah, yeah."
29:21,700;29:23,860;"- And we'll stop it, or I might stop."
29:23,860;29:24,700;"(laughs)"
29:24,700;29:26,660;"- My life's mission will be accomplished."
29:26,660;29:28,980;"- Yeah, I mean, what more is there after that, right?"
29:28,980;29:29,820;"- Yeah, I agree."
29:29,820;29:32,340;"- Being able to talk to Troy Brown about his time"
29:32,340;29:33,260;"on the Patriots."
29:33,260;29:34,380;"- How much we love him?"
29:34,380;29:36,340;"That'll be weird for him."
29:36,340;29:37,620;"- Oh, it definitely will be."
29:37,620;29:39,180;"- Yeah."
29:39,180;29:39,780;"All right, let's see."
29:39,780;29:43,420;"Do I have any more bangles stuff?"
29:43,420;29:44,460;"I don't think so."
29:44,460;29:47,260;"I mean, this is just-- it's one of those forgotten games"
29:47,260;29:49,860;"where there's a lot of cool stuff that happens,"
29:49,860;29:53,900;"but there's nothing particularly memorable"
29:53,900;29:55,340;"about the game itself."
29:55,340;29:57,380;"Like, it wasn't--"
29:57,380;29:57,780;"It wasn't--"
29:57,780;29:59,100;"You didn't watch abilities for Andy."
29:59,100;30:00,460;"It wasn't really back and forth."
30:00,460;30:01,460;"I mean, watch abilities score."
30:01,460;30:05,620;"So we do it out of six Lombardes."
30:05,620;30:06,980;"I would say four."
30:06,980;30:09,300;"There's a good amount of scoring, this great plays."
30:09,300;30:11,020;"It's definitely rewatchable."
30:11,020;30:15,600;"And it's one of those maybe like,"
30:15,600;30:17,800;"not quite on the forgotten gems level,"
30:17,800;30:21,020;"but it's close to that, I would say."
30:21,020;30:22,540;"- I give it a four and a half."
30:22,540;30:23,780;"- Okay."
30:23,780;30:25,860;"- A four and AOC Championship ring, if you--"
30:25,860;30:27,980;"- I could be, I could be."
30:27,980;30:30,500;"- Because there's a lot of great big name players in this,"
30:30,500;30:31,740;"and they all ball out."
30:31,740;30:33,340;"Teach you who's from Zada has awesome--"
30:33,340;30:35,060;"- Yeah, like 12 catchers or something, yeah?"
30:35,060;30:35,980;"- Yeah, Earth wouldn't bore it."
30:35,980;30:40,980;"Yeah, it's 11 the last I kept track of TJ was a mom."
30:40,980;30:43,940;"I would say on the bingleside,"
30:43,940;30:46,900;"I know this is a Patriots podcast,"
30:46,900;30:48,260;"but on the bingleside,"
30:48,260;30:51,020;"it was definitely a little bit of a turning point."
30:51,020;30:53,780;"Like we can play with these guys."
30:53,780;30:54,620;"- Yeah, yeah."
30:54,620;30:59,620;"- And the next year, they won the AFC North"
30:59,620;31:04,020;"and that started there."
31:05,900;31:10,900;"You know, a couple of year running to playoffs with Marvin, they never want to play off game."
31:10,900;31:13,900;"But I think it was a measuring stick game for them."
31:13,900;31:22,400;"You can see there was a little chipping list, but overall, I mean, the Patriots dynasty had already started,"
31:22,400;31:25,900;"but nobody knew what it was going to actually be."
31:25,900;31:29,400;"But they have tried to tell with them, and they kept it close."
31:29,400;31:35,400;"And so, you know, from a bigger fan perspective, it was like, okay, we're close."
31:35,400;31:37,960;"You know, we don't fumble."
31:37,960;31:40,800;"We, you know, we don't know that interception."
31:40,800;31:44,540;"And maybe win that game and we're seven and six"
31:44,540;31:46,740;"instead of six and seven."
31:46,740;31:49,720;"And from then on, it went great."
31:49,720;31:54,320;"And, you know, and Bellagic was in his fifth year, I think,"
31:54,320;31:56,080;"as a coach."
31:56,080;31:59,920;"And what, you know, now we've got him."
31:59,920;32:01,620;"- Still same guy."
32:01,620;32:02,720;"- Yeah."
32:02,720;32:04,420;"- Yeah, I'm wrecking people too at that point."
32:04,420;32:12,420;"His halftime interview was great and it looked like Bojack today. He had the same answers he would today."
32:12,420;32:16,820;"So he talks a lot more back in the day. He talks about he's a little recent."
32:16,820;32:25,620;"You guys are very fortunate to have what you have there and I feel sorry for you in the AFC going forward"
32:25,620;32:31,460;"because with this new offensive line and all the skill players we have it's going to be,"
32:32,100;32:34,660;"You'll be on my podcast here in about three years."
32:34,660;32:35,660;"All right."
32:35,660;32:38,500;"We will hold you to that."
32:38,500;32:38,900;"Sure."
32:38,900;32:40,460;"We'll put on your podcast."
32:40,460;32:42,660;"Someone who says, ""Teach me out of do a podcast."""
32:42,660;32:45,060;"Steve."
32:45,060;32:50,460;"Well, when is the when is the Joe Barrow versus Mac Jones match up?"
32:50,460;32:51,460;"That'll be good."
32:51,460;32:52,460;"Isn't this year coming up?"
32:52,460;32:55,140;"I think so."
32:55,140;32:56,980;"I don't know."
32:56,980;32:58,540;"I'm on Google and there right now."
32:58,540;32:59,620;"We are stat check, bro."
32:59,620;33:06,460;"fact check. Yes, let's let's. We turn to schedule there. They do"
33:06,460;33:08,100;"play the Bengals at Foxboro."
33:08,100;33:13,740;"Hey, what week? It has been determined. Oh, right. Hasn't"
33:13,740;33:18,100;"been really set. Correct. So they know, we'll see. We're about"
33:18,100;33:21,620;"to find out. Maybe the Patriots are like, wow, we can really"
33:21,620;33:23,500;"hang with these guys. They went to the Super Bowl last year."
33:26,260;33:28,260;"Measuring"
33:28,260;33:32,900;"Check for the bank here coming up"
33:32,900;33:41,060;"I'm gonna let you know unless you need me for anything else Steve you got anything out for me. Thanks for coming on David"
33:41,060;33:47,220;"Secrets"
33:47,220;33:54,420;"Nothing good in that that closet"
33:54,420;34:02,580;"Yeah, I really like having you. Thanks a lot, David. Anytime. Thanks, guys. All right."
34:02,580;34:07,820;"Take it easy. Take it easy, guys. I mean, it's got some cocho vibes. Yeah, I told you"
34:07,820;34:13,780;"cocho. Yeah. Kentucky cocho. He's the best. Yeah. I'm a little disappointed Greg's not"
34:13,780;34:22,300;"here because I had a genius bill Belichick thing for him to scoff at. Yes. So a couple"
34:22,300;34:27,660;"of them actually. Oh, multiple. Right. Yeah. So maybe we'll save this for Greg. We'll"
34:27,660;34:32,420;"cut this clip and play it for him. But at the beginning of the game, they're talking"
34:32,420;34:37,340;"about how, you know, the Patriots are what 11 and one coming into this game. So, you know,"
34:37,340;34:43,180;"they need some motivation to play 500 Bengals team. But I guess these two teams have played"
34:43,180;34:51,580;"in the preseason and the Bengals were up 31 nothing at halftime over the Patriots. So"
34:51,580;34:54,860;"Bellachek spent the entire week playing the lowlights because you saying that"
34:54,860;35:00,860;"We got whoops and they're like, oh, it's just preseas like yeah, all our starters were in though"
35:00,860;35:06,660;"So he was playing all of the bullshit stuff that happened in the preseason just to get him hype for this and"
35:06,660;35:09,340;"the other thing was that"
35:09,340;35:13,420;"One of the Bengals defensive backs Tory James apparently"
35:13,420;35:17,020;"super long dude big long arms, so"
35:17,020;35:19,860;"Bellachek had the"
35:20,500;35:24,340;"defensive backs carrying racquetball rackets to knock down footballs."
35:24,340;35:25,780;"That's a classic."
35:25,780;35:31,780;"Right? It's so bad. It's like the 2001 Super Bowl where he had all the wide receivers line up"
35:31,780;35:38,820;"for yards off sides to simulate the speed of the Rams offense. Just thinking outside the box."
35:38,820;35:41,220;"Steve, you know what that is? It's genius."
35:41,220;35:42,500;"Oh, yeah."
35:42,500;35:43,540;"Fucking genius."
35:43,540;35:46,340;"Nobody else does that."
35:46,340;35:47,780;"No one else has thought he is pretty good."
35:47,780;35:50,020;"No one knows that they even knows the thing about that."
35:50,020;35:52,020;"I think he's on our team."
35:52,020;35:53,020;"Oh my god, yeah."
35:53,020;35:55,020;"Oh, yeah, he's the best."
35:55,020;35:57,020;"He's a Troy Brown."
35:57,020;36:00,020;"This is another peak Troy Brown game."
36:00,020;36:06,020;"Troy Brown is the premium Troy Brown we're in right now."
36:06,020;36:07,020;"Yeah."
36:07,020;36:19,020;"Even the fact that he was, he actually got a defensive holding call that was declined because he's covering TJ Hushman's on the third downs out of the slot."
36:19,020;36:21,820;"also draws OPI on Hushkonzada."
36:21,820;36:23,020;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. Yeah."
36:23,020;36:23,620;"One of its area."
36:23,620;36:24,620;"Yeah."
36:24,620;36:27,020;"That's like, it's amazing."
36:27,020;36:29,300;"Yeah. Yeah. This is this is peak Troy Brown."
36:29,300;36:35,060;"This in 2001, like 2001 peak, like offensive Troy Brown, you know, like"
36:35,060;36:35,900;"Oh, one oh two."
36:35,900;36:38,460;"And this is peak just like"
36:38,460;36:40,820;"Patriot Troy Brown, right?"
36:40,820;36:45,340;"You're your prototypical player, prototypical New England,"
36:45,340;36:47,340;"Just football player, you know."
36:47,340;36:48,340;"Yeah."
36:48,340;36:49,340;"Yeah."
36:49,340;36:55,260;"I'm wondering if actually if it was this season that he lined up as the emergency quarterback"
36:55,260;36:56,260;"in the preseason."
36:56,260;36:57,260;"Probably."
36:57,260;36:59,260;"Let's see."
36:59,260;37:00,260;"Talk amongst yourself, Stephen."
37:00,260;37:03,540;"I'm going through whatever else I got on my notes here."
37:03,540;37:04,540;"I was not."
37:04,540;37:05,540;"It was 2006."
37:05,540;37:06,540;"So he hasn't even done that yet."
37:06,540;37:07,540;"Line up a quarterback."
37:07,540;37:09,940;"He's been this back now."
37:09,940;37:12,300;"He's on the goal in like 17 at that point."
37:12,300;37:13,300;"2006."
37:13,300;37:17,160;"He's still he's still around 2007 when yeah, we talked about if him"
37:17,160;37:22,680;"and my shows on Randy Moss cross and they did. Yeah. So here's a good"
37:22,680;37:27,640;"step that I wanted to bring up about Corey Dillon because they showed"
37:27,640;37:33,760;"how he's doing this year compared to his career high numbers. Like just"
37:33,760;37:39,800;"across the board. So his career high rushes per game were just over 21."
37:40,320;37:42,840;"This season he's averaging 23 carries a game."
37:42,840;37:51,600;"His career high for rushing yards per game in a season was previously just over 89."
37:51,600;37:54,640;"This year it's over 100, 111 yards."
37:54,640;37:59,200;"His yards per rush is still 4.8, which matches his career high."
37:59,200;38:04,800;"And he in this game gets his 10th touchdown of the season, which matches yet another career high."
38:04,800;38:10,280;"So this is he's setting career highs in literally every statistic this season."
38:10,280;38:16,520;"It's tough that he doesn't bawl out more years than just this one, you know?"
38:16,520;38:17,520;"He does."
38:17,520;38:21,920;"Yeah, I mean, he, he's set only your, I even remember Cory Dylan."
38:21,920;38:24,240;"Well, that's because you were like 12."
38:24,240;38:26,240;"He's been around."
38:26,240;38:30,600;"No, no, but like also, but I think back about the pages, dynasty, it's like, yeah, Cory"
38:30,600;38:34,560;"Dylan, oh four, and no one's like, Cory Dylan, oh five, oh six, oh seven, it could have been."
38:34,560;38:35,800;"Oh, you're talking about on the page."
38:35,800;38:36,800;"Okay."
38:36,800;38:37,800;"I see what you're saying."
38:37,800;38:38,800;"Yeah."
38:38,800;38:39,800;"Yeah."
38:39,800;38:41,120;"with injuries and stuff."
38:41,120;38:42,680;"It's like sort of the end of his career."
38:42,680;38:44,360;"Like this is his last good season, I feel like."
38:44,360;38:44,840;"Yeah."
38:44,840;38:45,720;"You pretty much."
38:45,720;38:46,400;"Yeah."
38:46,400;38:48,360;"I think it goes somewhere else eventually."
38:48,360;38:49,480;"Nope."
38:49,480;38:51,280;"No, it retires as a patriot."
38:51,280;38:53,080;"There you go."
38:53,080;38:53,720;"Yeah."
38:53,720;38:54,840;"Put him in the hall."
38:54,840;38:56,200;"Put him in the hall."
38:56,200;38:56,720;"I would agree."
38:56,720;38:59,400;"Is he actually the Hall of Famer NFL?"
38:59,400;39:06,240;"Um, it doesn't say anything anywhere of him being a Hall of Famer"
39:06,240;39:07,160;"in his Wikipedia."
39:07,160;39:08,960;"So I'm going to say no, which is a shame."
39:09,520;39:19,280;"Because he, I mean, he set the rookie record for rushing yards in a game, which again,"
39:19,280;39:25,200;"has since been broken 39 times for 246 yards and four touchdowns over the Tennessee Oilers,"
39:25,200;39:33,520;"which broke Jim Brown's rookie single season game record that had stood at that point for 40 years."
39:34,320;39:38,680;"I think it's still been it's been broken since by somebody weird."
39:38,680;39:40,000;"Where is it?"
39:40,000;39:41,560;"Um, oh, Mike Anderson."
39:41,560;39:43,000;"Oh, yeah."
39:43,000;39:43,440;"Yeah."
39:43,440;39:50,960;"As since broken that he also held the single game, like singles game rushing"
39:50,960;39:56,480;"record overall, um, which again has since been broken, but he ran for"
39:57,360;40:03,160;"Uh, 278 yards against the Broncos, which broke Walter"
40:03,160;40:07,720;"Payton's 275, which again, had stood for like 40 years."
40:07,720;40:09,800;"Cause you know, Walter Payton was way back then."
40:09,800;40:10,240;"Yeah."
40:10,240;40:11,680;"He said it in 77."
40:11,680;40:17,480;"Um, and then all 16 games in 2006."
40:17,480;40:20,560;"Yeah, but I think he's hurt when he's doing it."
40:20,560;40:23,640;"Oh, actually no, uh, 2006 he was sharing."
40:24,440;40:27,920;"Um, the, the backfield with Lawrence Moroni."
40:27,920;40:29,840;"He was sick as 13 touchdowns."
40:29,840;40:30,940;"That says career high."
40:30,940;40:31,860;"That's not bad."
40:31,860;40:34,460;"So I think you may have been the short, short yardage back."
40:34,460;40:34,820;"Perhaps."
40:34,820;40:37,360;"I mean, his touchdowns for the Patriots go 12, 12, 13."
40:37,360;40:38,240;"Yeah."
40:38,240;40:38,580;"Yeah."
40:38,580;40:44,860;"The yards go from 1600 to 733 to 812, but his carries 200 ish."
40:44,860;40:46,540;"I mean, boy, he's going to touch that."
40:46,540;40:47,420;"You didn't know five."
40:47,420;40:47,980;"That's what I'm saying."
40:47,980;40:50,820;"Like I feel like this is the only year he's good, but looking at the stats,"
40:50,820;40:54,260;"he's definitely only plays 12 games and 05, but six."
40:54,260;40:55,920;"He plays all the whole year."
40:55,920;41:00,640;"Carries at a 4.1 average and score 13 touchdowns in 800 yards."
41:00,640;41:04,020;"Today, that's like a game in Harris, balling out."
41:04,020;41:05,760;"You know, yeah."
41:05,760;41:09,360;"But that's not the 4.8 yards it carries getting in 2004."
41:09,360;41:09,560;"Right."
41:09,560;41:14,280;"So I guess he didn't play long enough really to get in the home, but still."
41:14,280;41:20,040;"And what you think he's eight years into his career, played every single game,"
41:20,040;41:24,200;"except for a couple of this last year in Cincinnati and he gets over 75"
41:24,200;41:25,360;"yards every single one of them."
41:25,360;41:27,200;"He's a true work horse back."
41:27,200;41:27,360;"Yeah."
41:27,360;41:28,920;"He's like, yeah, he's one of those cool."
41:28,920;41:30,120;"Why don't you?"
41:30,120;41:33,080;"I don't think he got 75 yards in every single game he's ever played."
41:33,080;41:35,840;"I think I think it was with the Patriots."
41:35,840;41:37,600;"No, I think they said in his career."
41:37,600;41:44,640;"No, because I saw something where he there was some drama about him, like"
41:44,640;41:51,000;"coming off the field and like not going back on because he had like 12"
41:51,000;41:54,920;"carries for nine yards in one game because his offensive line was so bad."
41:54,920;41:57,040;"I refuse to believe that's big news."
41:57,040;41:58,220;"Okay."
41:58,220;42:01,600;"I mean, it's probably"
42:01,600;42:04,280;"probably easy."
42:04,280;42:06,900;"Looked up, but kind of this stat has been beat Andy."
42:06,900;42:07,960;"What's that?"
42:07,960;42:13,240;"Um, Patriots extend their records at 18 straight games scoring first."
42:13,240;42:13,880;"I saw that."
42:13,880;42:14,120;"Yeah."
42:14,120;42:20,200;"And also, um, uh, they also have not allowed an opening drive touch on in the last"
42:20,200;42:24,280;"28 games, which is fucking bananas."
42:24,280;42:26,320;"That is because they're about to score a touchdown."
42:26,320;42:27,880;"They're driving on this thing and then"
42:27,880;42:28,880;"fumbles."
42:28,880;42:30,680;"I'm just going to say that statement and that wasn't a fumble."
42:30,680;42:32,480;"They figured out every time."
42:32,480;42:33,840;"Yeah."
42:33,840;42:35,880;"Unbelievable. Yeah."
42:35,880;42:38,800;"That's got to be a record, right?"
42:38,800;42:43,160;"I would have to imagine scoring first is an 18 straight."
42:43,160;42:47,440;"I mean, it's a season plus scoring first."
42:47,640;42:49,280;"consecutive"
42:49,280;42:51,280;"Games NFL record"
42:51,280;42:54,320;"Let's see top NFL streaks"
42:54,320;42:58,880;"Fuck it's got you get the hell out of here. Oh geez"
42:58,880;43:02,160;"brutal"
43:02,160;43:04,160;"Second most super bowl appearances"
43:04,160;43:10,440;"Games one. Yeah losses again losses scoring"
43:10,440;43:15,640;"Boy"
43:15,640;43:21,780;"All right, I don't care. We'll find out when it ends what it actually ends up and then we can figure it out then I'll"
43:21,780;43:24,600;"What that okay, what else you got on this game?"
43:24,600;43:27,600;"Let's see"
43:27,600;43:32,480;"Just talk about the announcers. I know you have big feelings on those no I blocked him out"
43:32,480;43:37,180;"Really stuff. What about the time when the dude saw a piece of trash on the field? I thought I was a flak"
43:37,180;43:42,260;"I feel when I saw that I thought who he's gonna be real triggered by that"
43:44,040;43:49,400;"Because it was on the Asante Samuel pick six. Yeah. Yeah, and like oh wait does a flag down and"
43:49,400;43:55,480;"And they even like flipped a little like yellow flag thing in the in the presentation"
43:55,480;44:00,680;"Like there's a flag on the field and obviously somebody whispered in his ear. That's not a flag that's trash"
44:00,680;44:07,960;"They're like oh, oh wait. No, it's it's a McDonald's box. But look it's got yellow on the side of it. Yep"
44:07,960;44:13,560;"No, he didn't like it. Okay"
44:13,560;44:18,480;"What about them saying, bell check numbers, pounds of square peg into a round hole?"
44:18,480;44:22,080;"He does it all the time."
44:22,080;44:24,920;"You just hate your Andy."
44:24,920;44:26,280;"Yes."
44:26,280;44:29,360;"It was that fumble was like, they waited to call that too."
44:29,360;44:30,880;"Oh my god."
44:30,880;44:31,040;"Yeah."
44:31,040;44:33,960;"It was like the play was over and like, uh, you know what?"
44:33,960;44:34,840;"Let's call that a fumble."
44:34,840;44:35,880;"Yeah."
44:35,880;44:36,320;"Yeah."
44:36,320;44:37,800;"It took them a while to figure out what was going on."
44:37,800;44:40,440;"But, you know, I mean, it's par for the court."
44:40,440;44:41,760;"Cause this is a deer dog, wasn't it?"
44:42,560;44:44,320;"Yeah, definitely sound like the door."
44:44,320;44:49,600;"So we all know how I feel about a deer dwarf as if he's watching a different game."
44:49,600;44:53,400;"So water off a duck's back."
44:53,400;44:54,840;"See, I'm a father."
44:54,840;44:56,160;"Now I can't carry that anger."
44:56,160;44:59,600;"You're trying to do this, but I know deep down that."
44:59,600;45:01,360;"No, I'm a father now."
45:01,360;45:02,400;"Yeah."
45:02,400;45:06,960;"We can now you're all stressed out and now you're to watch this guy or listen to"
45:06,960;45:07,960;"a deer dwarf."
45:07,960;45:09,920;"No, it's very naughty."
45:09,920;45:10,760;"It's fine."
45:10,760;45:15,840;"Uh, oh, they did talk about, uh, Charlie Weiss though, because apparently he has officially"
45:15,840;45:18,920;"officially, unofficially that they kept kind of going back and forth because, you know,"
45:18,920;45:19,920;"it's Dan Dudor."
45:19,920;45:20,920;"He's on top."
45:20,920;45:23,600;"And now it's that he's going to be the head coach of Notre Dame."
45:23,600;45:26,800;"I don't need to have been announced, but it was like Adam Schefter at this point had"
45:26,800;45:27,800;"tweeted it."
45:27,800;45:29,240;"That's what it felt like."
45:29,240;45:30,240;"Yeah."
45:30,240;45:32,080;"That version of whatever that is a no for."
45:32,080;45:33,800;"Yeah, exactly."
45:33,800;45:36,960;"So it was like unofficially official, basically."
45:36,960;45:37,960;"Yeah."
45:37,960;45:43,240;"And the other thing kind of swirling around this game that didn't have anything to do it was paint manning chasing Marina"
45:43,240;45:45,740;"Touchdown record fucking worse and sufferable"
45:45,740;45:52,500;"Yeah, it's a sufferable and I remember hating time - yeah now I'm seeing these again bring back all that PTSD about"
45:52,500;45:57,120;"I don't give a shit right and also like all his touchdowns were within the five-yard line"
45:57,120;46:04,000;"So he's just like he's throwing on every single like drives just so we can get the the record because there was actually a stat"
46:04,000;46:06,440;"Recently that I saw"
46:06,640;46:09,340;"I wonder if I saved it, but it was basically,"
46:09,340;46:13,600;"you know, Tom Brady has thrown all these touchdowns,"
46:13,600;46:17,580;"but they went and somebody went back and found"
46:17,580;46:20,660;"how many short yardage touchdowns"
46:20,660;46:24,980;"all the offenses of the top quarterbacks had."
46:24,980;46:31,100;"And Tom Brady had like twice as many"
46:31,100;46:35,660;"who was whoever was in second, Peyton or Aaron Ryder"
46:35,660;46:36,500;"or something like that."
46:36,500;46:39,860;"but they had like twice as many,"
46:39,860;46:42,540;"like rushing touchdowns within five yards"
46:42,540;46:43,860;"than any other quarterback."
46:43,860;46:48,820;"So Brady was never the one to go or, you know,"
46:48,820;46:50,900;"Belichick or whoever was calling the offense,"
46:50,900;46:51,740;"was never one to be like,"
46:51,740;46:53,940;"""Oh, we're just gonna sling it from the five"
46:53,940;46:56,180;"just to get Brady some touchdowns stats."""
46:56,180;46:58,820;"- Whatever, he did it without that."
46:58,820;47:01,580;"- So he did it without padding, you know?"
47:01,580;47:03,460;"Yeah, whatever won the game."
47:03,460;47:05,060;"- Some other idiot on the internet went"
47:05,060;47:07,780;"and kind of give of every single Tom Brady touchdown pass"
47:07,780;47:09,320;"and put it on a website."
47:09,320;47:10,420;"- Tom Brady touchdowns.com."
47:10,420;47:11,820;"- Fucking loser."
47:11,820;47:13,260;"- Tom Brady TDs are kind of."
47:13,260;47:17,020;"And in fact, there is new,"
47:17,020;47:21,020;"the new graph on there, Steve."
47:21,020;47:21,860;"I don't know if you've been recently."
47:21,860;47:22,860;"- How do you get a new graph?"
47:22,860;47:23,700;"- Yeah."
47:23,700;47:25,220;"- I'm a viral with this one too, bro."
47:25,220;47:26,840;"- It's a scatter plot."
47:26,840;47:31,340;"- What did Greg say today in the group chat?"
47:31,340;47:32,980;"- I don't know."
47:32,980;47:34,780;"- You don't even read it, anyhow."
47:34,780;47:36,780;"I usually just tune you guys out."
47:36,780;47:41,220;"No, this isn't the family one those pics would do numbeys on the gram. Oh"
47:41,220;47:47,100;"Yeah, well this this this is probably too nerdy to do numbeys"
47:47,100;47:57,540;"Because it's have another website Tom Brady TDs calm. Yeah, that's just all it such as because I could I couldn't track all his"
47:57,540;48:03,620;"Buccaneers touchdowns on Pat's dynasty dot com. Oh, yeah, of course not of course not so right now it only has"
48:03,620;48:10,500;"has his Patriots touchdowns, but I have tracked the game time, like time remaining in the"
48:10,500;48:20,380;"quarter for each touchdown and created a scatter plot. Touchdowns, the X axis is game time"
48:20,380;48:26,540;"and the Y axis is the distance of the touchdown pass. So it just kind of shows you where all"
48:26,540;48:33,580;"the grouping is there's a whole mess of touchdowns within a minute of the second quarter ending."
48:33,580;48:41,340;"Like a stack of them. And then again, kind of towards the end of the game as well."
48:41,340;48:48,060;"And at the end of every quarter, kind of seems. And for some reason, with 12 minutes left in the"
48:48,060;48:52,460;"second quarter, there's a massive stack as well. How does Tom Brady have two touchdowns with"
48:52,460;48:55,260;"negative seven area. It's just what thrown behind the line."
48:55,260;48:58,660;"Screenplays. Yeah. The areas I based on."
48:58,660;49:02,700;"Screenplays are like negative sevens, though. I mean, I get the fours, five,"
49:02,700;49:05,620;"the three, as 14, three yards behind those are screens."
49:05,620;49:10,340;"No, some of them. Well, here's the thing. You can click on any single one"
49:10,340;49:12,860;"that's there and it will show you the video of the play."
49:12,860;49:15,740;"Not your site's broken, bro. Click on it now."
49:15,740;49:16,980;"So let me click."
49:16,980;49:20,540;"I just did it. I'm looking at it."
49:22,180;49:23,660;"Maybe just renders wrong."
49:23,660;49:26,220;"So it's a Brady Antoine Smith, where he rolled out"
49:26,220;49:29,700;"to the right, others against the Saints in 2001."
49:29,700;49:31,500;"Again, we rolled to the right and then threw it back"
49:31,500;49:32,000;"to the left."
49:32,000;49:35,460;"Antoine Smith, he was seven yards behind the line of scrimmage."
49:35,460;49:37,780;"And similar to the James White one too."
49:37,780;49:39,100;"It's kind of-- he's out of a shotgun,"
49:39,100;49:42,140;"and he has to drift back, and then throws out"
49:42,140;49:45,300;"a swing pass behind the line of scrimmage."
49:45,300;49:46,660;"James White behind the line of scrimmage."
49:46,660;49:48,300;"Oh, so I was clicking the graph."
49:48,300;49:51,140;"I didn't click on the right, the bars."
49:51,140;49:55,020;"Well, how is clicking on the graph going to do it, Steve?"
49:55,020;49:57,380;"Because they'll bring it up in the IDLC."
49:57,380;50:01,820;"I know reading cover ranges hard,"
50:01,820;50:03,620;"but all the touchdowns at the top,"
50:03,620;50:06,820;"you can click on all the dots and that will play the video."
50:06,820;50:11,300;"It's crazy as long as touch sounds only 55 area yards."
50:11,300;50:13,740;"I mean, that's kind of a lot."
50:13,740;50:15,220;"I don't know."
50:15,220;50:17,100;"They should not really anymore."
50:17,100;50:18,740;"I mean, I don't know."
50:18,740;50:19,980;"You'd have to look up."
50:19,980;50:23,660;"And this is just like from the line of scrimmage, how far did the ball go?"
50:23,660;50:27,060;"If you only count yards, game down passes that went for TDS."
50:27,060;50:28,720;"He has more yards and rex growth."
50:28,720;50:29,740;"Correct."
50:29,740;50:32,060;"That's not that's not very impressive."
50:32,060;50:34,260;"Exgrowments fucking sucks."
50:34,260;50:34,540;"Correct."
50:34,540;50:34,780;"Girls."
50:34,780;50:35,780;"I went to a Super Bowl."
50:35,780;50:36,660;"I know he did."
50:36,660;50:40,180;"And he's like universally panned as like the worst Super Bowl quarterback of all time."
50:40,180;50:41,140;"Oh, that's not true."
50:41,140;50:43,620;"Who's the worst?"
50:43,620;50:46,460;"The the Ravens guy, Kyle now."
50:46,460;50:47,860;"Who is the Kyle bowler?"
50:47,860;50:49,580;"Uh, was that?"
50:49,580;50:56,020;"Yeah, it was the experts was right there with him."
50:56,020;50:57,020;"Kerry Collins."
50:57,020;50:58,020;"Yeah."
50:58,020;50:59,020;"Oh yeah."
50:59,020;51:01,820;"I mean, he's, but he was still a starting quarterback that went super and Tom Brady is"
51:01,820;51:05,620;"from more passing yards just on touchdowns alone than he has."
51:05,620;51:12,460;"Tom Brady has from more touchdown playoff touchdowns than Joey Harrington or Jay Fiedler."
51:12,460;51:15,100;"And they're ever through."
51:15,100;51:16,660;"Again, we're like super impressive."
51:16,660;51:17,820;"Those guys suck."
51:17,820;51:21,020;"Well, yeah, I mean that's kind of how this works Steve"
51:21,020;51:25,920;"It's not like he's gonna throw more playoff touchdowns and paint Manning as ever throw touchdowns, is it?"
51:25,920;51:31,400;"You're right. There's a lot of touchdowns in the last second of the second quarter. Yep"
51:31,400;51:37,140;"There is one bucks TD on here. What are you talking? There was one. Yeah, so it's his two playoffs"
51:37,140;51:43,220;"This is a riveting. I'm sure for people listening well as you go on the website is it is actually very interesting"
51:43,220;51:45,520;"And I can't believe you found time to make this fucking website"
51:45,980;51:48,720;"Don't you have a newborn? This is this is pre newborn"
51:48,720;51:54,020;"And and the graph at the top is all just data entry when I'm waiting for"
51:54,020;52:01,700;"Stuff to compile at work. So I can do that in chunks your goddamn loser Andy. Yeah, well, you know what?"
52:01,700;52:06,260;"You're here with me Steve. So what does that say about you? You are the company you keep?"
52:06,260;52:10,900;"Well, you know the whole pick your buggers pick your friends, but not your family thing"
52:10,900;52:17,660;"I mean you moved away from us and yet you're still here Thursday nights on our zoom call"
52:17,660;52:19,980;"without fail"
52:19,980;52:23,780;"Yeah, not missing any of them. It was terrible when you know when Dave was on but now it's just"
52:23,780;52:26,980;"tough I"
52:26,980;52:32,340;"Agree can we talk more about Troy Brown though cuz I like that part all right talk to me about Troy Brown"
52:32,340;52:34,380;"He seals the game with a first down"
52:34,380;52:37,260;"Reception yeah after getting the interception"
52:38,140;52:41,080;"Yeah, and that was what one of his two catches on the game"
52:41,080;52:45,840;"There wasn't a wasn't right after the interception. Oh, yeah early fourth quarter"
52:45,840;52:48,340;"His last drive"
52:48,340;52:50,800;"Two minutes left. They have no time outs"
52:50,800;52:55,940;"Where do you go I can tango some for around for 20 yards right?"
52:55,940;53:01,540;"Neil Neil game over one of his two receptions on the game was the biggest catch of the game"
53:01,540;53:07,180;"That's why he's out there the two-minute drill after playing defense the whole goddamn game"
53:07,180;53:08,180;"Right."
53:08,180;53:09,180;"So you got there."
53:09,180;53:10,180;"Get out there Troy."
53:10,180;53:12,180;"We need you to catch us a goddamn first down."
53:12,180;53:13,780;"Yeah, you got to seal this."
53:13,780;53:15,180;"Yeah."
53:15,180;53:17,180;"But I think the, yeah."
53:17,180;53:20,180;"And you know who's covered him and he had the tackle."
53:20,180;53:21,180;"I didn't realize this."
53:21,180;53:22,180;"What was it?"
53:22,180;53:23,180;"Medea Williams."
53:23,180;53:24,180;"Oh shit."
53:24,180;53:26,180;"The Corey, yeah."
53:26,180;53:28,180;"The Corey Dillon traffic."
53:28,180;53:29,180;"Corey Dillon."
53:29,180;53:30,180;"Yeah."
53:30,180;53:31,180;"That's hysterical."
53:31,180;53:36,180;"So yeah, I'd say, um, this is a relatively watchable game."
53:36,180;53:40,700;"If you can find it. I don't think this one's on YouTube, so you have to go digging for it."
53:40,700;53:50,260;"But yeah, I think if you can only watch a bit of it watch the second quarter because that's when all the action happens really"
53:50,260;53:54,140;"With this is an eminently watchful game because yeah"
53:54,140;53:58,220;"Not a little bit of him, but the Bengals kept keeping it close and they're thirsty in the ball"
53:58,220;54:03,980;"They're actually running it. So generally a lot of these games recently the Patriots defense has just been absolutely"
54:04,940;54:07,820;"- Yeah, and the games get out of hand quick,"
54:07,820;54:10,700;"where this game, you think it could have,"
54:10,700;54:12,100;"you know, peaches kind of go up a little bit,"
54:12,100;54:13,380;"but then mangles come back."
54:13,380;54:15,940;"It's nothing a little back and forth since"
54:15,940;54:17,900;"you got a bunch of big names."
54:17,900;54:20,580;"- Yeah, a bunch of big names, like early big names too."
54:20,580;54:24,540;"- And obviously it's a sick, free-brown game."
54:24,540;54:27,820;"- Right, yeah, which is worth watching, generally."
54:27,820;54:29,860;"- He's out there outperforming Earthwood and Moreland,"
54:29,860;54:32,780;"who's just getting absolutely eaten up by TJ Ushmanzada."
54:32,780;54:34,780;"- Yeah, I mean, I think everybody was TJ."
54:34,780;54:35,780;"He's mizzou."
54:35,780;54:36,580;"I have a note."
54:36,580;54:38,420;"Earth wind is overmatched by everybody."
54:38,420;54:44,340;"I mean, not as well, but no, because wasn't he, uh,"
54:44,340;54:45,860;"like undrafted or something?"
54:45,860;54:48,900;"Yeah, he was, he was back up on his team in college or something."
54:48,900;54:51,460;"And that was not what we've decided last week, because we could before."
54:51,460;54:57,740;"He's not, uh, not, not something you would expect to be a starting NFL player."
54:57,740;54:59,780;"But, you know, this is where the pages are this season."
54:59,780;55:06,740;"And yet this 2004 defense is considered like one of the best defenses that the pages have"
55:06,740;55:13,180;"ever had, even with this struggle in the defensive back."
55:13,180;55:14,740;"So yeah, I'll take."
55:14,740;55:18,100;"I mean, you don't really think about that because we were talking about this is the best defense"
55:18,100;55:23,380;"they've ever had and might be even with just absolutely nobody in them."
55:23,380;55:24,540;"I mean, you got Rodney."
55:24,540;55:25,540;"That's probably crucial."
55:25,540;55:28,180;"If you got hurt in this year, they'd probably be a lot worse."
55:28,180;55:29,180;"That's true."
55:29,180;55:31,100;"Samuel has been around for a while."
55:31,100;55:31,940;"Samuel's nice."
55:31,940;55:32,780;"I'm rookie this year."
55:32,780;55:35,660;"No, so he's like, he's actually been on the field."
55:35,660;55:36,980;"He's more than me."
55:36,980;55:41,540;"But yeah, I think, yeah, this is kind of the reason we go back"
55:41,540;55:43,980;"and watch these games because we just forget that."
55:43,980;55:45,740;"Like, oh, yeah, 2014, that was really good."
55:45,740;55:49,540;"But it's like, how the fuck did this defense play so well"
55:49,540;55:54,900;"with literally a makeshift MacGyver defensive backfield?"
55:54,900;55:57,300;"I'm Troy Brown and Earthwood and Moreland."
55:57,300;56:00,660;"Yeah, and Dexter Reed, being significant time."
56:00,660;56:01,860;"Significant time."
56:01,860;56:04,500;"He was like a core special."
56:04,500;56:09,100;"Terry, Drew, Terry, he's getting in there."
56:09,100;56:10,500;"And it's just, oh my God."
56:10,500;56:11,460;"Yeah."
56:11,460;56:12,660;"Yeah, it's ridiculous."
56:12,660;56:19,700;"So yeah, but I also, um, I think we got to shout out the kind of the fuck you, Tom Brady."
56:19,700;56:24,420;"This was kind of peak that era too, where, um, you know, Patriots score a touchdown."
56:24,420;56:26,860;"And then bangles come right back and score their touchdown."
56:26,860;56:32,540;"So it's tie game and that answered the drive to answer that."
56:32,540;56:38,060;"Um, where Brady, like immediately scored touchdown was, uh,"
56:38,060;56:43,180;"Brady complete for nine yards to somebody named Jed Weaver, who is, uh,"
56:43,180;56:44,260;"with a neck roll."
56:44,260;56:44,780;"Yeah."
56:44,780;56:45,940;"A tight end with a neck roll."
56:45,940;56:46,700;"Uh,"
56:46,700;56:48,100;"beautiful."
56:48,100;56:51,900;"He was there a third string tight end because Daniel Graham was out."
56:51,900;56:56,580;"Um, so nine yards to him, 13 yards to Kevin Falk on the,"
56:56,580;57:04,580;"play that you never see them running more where he fakes the screen to the left and then spins around backwards and then throws the screen to the right."
57:04,580;57:09,580;"Yeah, which you just I used to love that play, but they never run anymore."
57:09,580;57:13,580;"And then a deep bomb 48 yards to patent."
57:13,580;57:19,580;"And it's just like one of those, you know, fuck you response drives."
57:19,580;57:23,580;"And then the next play is literally Carson Palmer pick six."
57:23,580;57:27,580;"This game went from tied at seven to the pants up by two touchdowns."
57:27,580;57:30,580;"Yeah, 10 or five tied at seven at eight twenty seven. It was."
57:30,580;57:31,580;"Yeah."
57:31,580;57:32,580;"Yeah."
57:32,580;57:37,580;"Like the page is real quick drive three plays to drive the lens of the field."
57:37,580;57:40,580;"And then pick six."
57:40,580;57:44,580;"And it's just like Jesus Christ that that change in the."
57:44,580;57:48,580;"The vengals going along drive and get it down to another touchdown, right?"
57:48,580;57:51,540;"Yeah. So, I just think of two and a half minutes left. Right."
57:51,540;57:57,460;"They just come back and score 25 seconds left. Yeah, exactly. It was just that this is what I'm"
57:57,460;58:04,260;"talking about. It was just that like, fuck you response, Patriots. This is that situation from"
58:04,260;58:08,020;"blah, they always really did that. Yeah, but they were, but it's not like they were driving up and"
58:08,020;58:13,060;"down the field the entire game. It's just kind of every time the bangle score, the Patriots be like,"
58:13,060;58:16,100;"all right, well, fuck it. And how we got to do it? Like, if they, you know, they go three and"
58:16,100;58:19,620;"out every once in a while, but like, as soon as they knew to score, like fuck, we're gonna"
58:19,620;58:22,260;"go score and they just did it. March straight down the field."
58:22,260;58:26,420;"I even know what about you about TJ Duckett coming in or is that just a highlight that I saw?"
58:26,420;58:29,460;"That was a highlight. That was the Falcons highlight."
58:29,460;58:33,700;"Give me the ducats. TJ Duckett also,"
58:33,700;58:41,300;"something awesome. I don't remember his first name. He was the kick returner. And I only know him"
58:41,300;58:46,300;"because I would play Madden with my college roommates."
58:46,300;58:50,300;"And I was a Falcons and I told my roommate"
58:50,300;58:53,340;"not to kick it to Rossum 'cause his name rhymes was awesome."
58:53,340;58:55,820;"And then for the first and only time ever,"
58:55,820;58:57,700;"I returned the kickoff for a touchdown"
58:57,700;59:02,340;"and was just screaming the fact that his name rhymes"
59:02,340;59:03,820;"was awesome the entire play."
59:03,820;59:09,860;"And I did not let my roommate live that down."
59:09,860;59:12,540;"This is when you were doing that and started going to class, right?"
59:12,540;59:15,540;"Uh, no, this is after that."
59:15,540;59:17,340;"Oh, this is not Penn State."
59:17,340;59:18,020;"Right."
59:18,020;59:18,260;"Yeah."
59:18,260;59:18,260;"Yeah."
59:18,260;59:19,300;"This is afterwards."
59:19,300;59:22,060;"This is after I went to go to this is, yeah, you're, you're"
59:22,060;59:24,260;"recording on the, on the page."
59:24,260;59:24,580;"Yeah."
59:24,580;59:28,140;"So I'm a, I'm a 21 year old freshman at UNH at this point, I believe."
59:28,140;59:28,820;"Got it."
59:28,820;59:32,620;"I think we're bringing that up Steve."
59:32,620;59:33,620;"Yeah."
59:33,620;59:36,100;"Well, as you get from bring me on this podcast, Andy,"
59:36,580;59:40,580;"Well, you're dirty laundry aired out for the tens of listeners we have to hear."
59:40,580;59:41,580;"That's right."
59:41,580;59:44,280;"Hey, we have like 20s of listeners."
59:44,280;59:45,580;"What episode are we on?"
59:45,580;59:46,680;"Are we getting close to 100?"
59:46,680;59:47,880;"Yeah."
59:47,880;59:49,480;"What are we on?"
59:49,480;59:51,180;"You know, 80 something."
59:51,180;59:54,480;"We better get Troy Brown on for number 100."
59:54,480;59:56,180;"Or what?"
59:56,180;59:57,180;"You're going to leave?"
59:57,180;59:58,380;"You got something better to do?"
59:58,380;01:00:01,980;"What if number 100 would be the Chargers game?"
01:00:01,980;01:00:05,880;"Oh, I mean, Chargers games in like"
01:00:05,880;01:00:07,240;"2005, right?"
01:00:07,240;01:00:09,360;"No, I think it's not this year, isn't it?"
01:00:09,360;01:00:14,080;"No, no, it charges the games like way in the past."
01:00:14,080;01:00:15,240;"I thought it was this year."
01:00:15,240;01:00:17,960;"We have released 82 total episodes."
01:00:17,960;01:00:20,040;"So we're on 83."
01:00:20,040;01:00:21,960;"This will be 83."
01:00:21,960;01:00:22,800;"Yes, when it goes life."
01:00:22,800;01:00:25,600;"And at this rate, they won't be."
01:00:25,600;01:00:29,560;"You found this right there will not be an 84."
01:00:29,560;01:00:31,480;"What else you got in this game, Steve?"
01:00:31,480;01:00:32,400;"Anything?"
01:00:32,400;01:00:35,520;"There's a note about Marvin and Harrison getting a $22 million signing"
01:00:35,520;01:00:37,580;"bonus and how massive that was."
01:00:37,580;01:00:43,320;"I'm going to compare this into all the guys that recently"
01:00:43,320;01:00:45,260;"get 75 million guaranteed."
01:00:45,260;01:00:45,800;"Right."
01:00:45,800;01:00:46,080;"Yeah."
01:00:46,080;01:00:47,440;"Unbelievable."
01:00:47,440;01:00:49,200;"Unbelievable."
01:00:49,200;01:00:49,520;"Yeah."
01:00:49,520;01:00:52,320;"The numbers these days are just outrageous."
01:00:52,320;01:00:54,200;"And that's it in inflation."
01:00:54,200;01:00:54,760;"Tell you what?"
01:00:54,760;01:00:57,760;"No, no, well, it's NFL inflation, I guess."
01:00:57,760;01:00:58,580;"Yeah."
01:00:58,580;01:01:02,120;"But the student does some worst."
01:01:02,120;01:01:03,240;"All right."
01:01:04,360;01:01:05,560;"You want me to go first?"
01:01:05,560;01:01:07,080;"Sure."
01:01:07,080;01:01:09,160;"My best is Troy Brown."
01:01:09,160;01:01:11,920;"Everything about everything."
01:01:11,920;01:01:13,480;"Steve, he made a tackle."
01:01:13,480;01:01:16,360;"He got credit for a tackle in the game."
01:01:16,360;01:01:17,480;"Did you know that?"
01:01:17,480;01:01:18,680;"He's already had tackles though."
01:01:18,680;01:01:21,280;"Yeah, but I mean, he did everything."
01:01:21,280;01:01:24,800;"Like he was he was catching game ceiling passes."
01:01:24,800;01:01:26,760;"He's making tackles."
01:01:26,760;01:01:27,760;"He's blocking."
01:01:27,760;01:01:30,800;"Getting interceptions in the end zone."
01:01:30,800;01:01:32,120;"Trying to return them."
01:01:34,000;01:01:35,480;"two catches two first downs."
01:01:35,480;01:01:37,200;"He had a past defender as well."
01:01:37,200;01:01:40,400;"Oh, yeah, two tackles, both solo."
01:01:40,400;01:01:42,720;"He doesn't need help."
01:01:42,720;01:01:45,760;"Troy Brown, defensive player of the game."
01:01:45,760;01:01:48,360;"No, OK."
01:01:48,360;01:01:53,840;"And I think my worst is just having to look at Marvin Lewis"
01:01:53,840;01:01:55,800;"again, because he's just--"
01:01:55,800;01:01:57,280;"he makes me sad for Bengals fans."
01:01:57,280;01:02:02,400;"Because I mean, David, you know, he's like, oh, yeah,"
01:02:02,400;01:02:07,640;"We still kind of like them, but you could just like hear the sadness and his voice when he talked about"
01:02:07,640;01:02:10,080;"Marvin Lewis"
01:02:10,080;01:02:13,300;"And I think also probably the the ownership as well"
01:02:13,300;01:02:17,480;"I think had something to do with how bad they were because the ownership's I think known to be"
01:02:17,480;01:02:19,640;"pretty cheap"
01:02:19,640;01:02:25,640;"Just generally so yeah. Oh, and that's that's all of them until like I came about the Browns"
01:02:25,640;01:02:32,120;"Yeah, they really got to the Pittsburgh Pirates here like that that guy. Yeah super stingy. Yeah"
01:02:32,120;01:02:34,880;"They just don't give a shit."
01:02:34,880;01:02:40,600;"So it just makes you sad when other teams aren't run as well as the Patriots are and"
01:02:40,600;01:02:45,280;"also makes me thankful that we have Robert Kraft, who was actually a fan before he bought"
01:02:45,280;01:02:46,280;"the team."
01:02:46,280;01:02:47,280;"Yeah."
01:02:47,280;01:02:50,120;"So he like gives a shit, you know, instead of it just being like a money making operation."
01:02:50,120;01:02:52,920;"So yeah, what about you?"
01:02:52,920;01:02:55,280;"Uh, I don't know."
01:02:55,280;01:03:01,320;"I have worse except the whole Charlie Weiss leaving because, you know, I think that actually"
01:03:01,320;01:03:06,440;"affects the team pretty significantly him and Romeo Cornell leaving right around this time."
01:03:06,440;01:03:09,000;"That's fair. It takes him a while to get back from that."
01:03:09,000;01:03:15,560;"So it's like that's like the first sign I guess of the beginning of the last years."
01:03:15,560;01:03:23,000;"This is what I'm going to call it. I'm going to watch the Patriots defensive backs play defense"
01:03:23,000;01:03:27,800;"on Ocho and Hoosh. Ocho to Moocho. I have one here."
01:03:27,800;01:03:32,160;"And they both went to Oregon State, which I didn't know."
01:03:32,160;01:03:33,680;"That was pretty cool. Yeah."
01:03:33,680;01:03:35,760;"And they both graduated the same year."
01:03:35,760;01:03:38,360;"They were both drafted by the Bengals in 2001."
01:03:38,360;01:03:41,720;"Yeah, but that's going to be fun."
01:03:41,720;01:03:45,440;"But yeah, Johnson was drafted like in the first or second round."
01:03:45,440;01:03:46,280;"Yeah, he's a first."
01:03:46,280;01:03:49,680;"TJ was drafted in like the sixth or seventh round."
01:03:49,680;01:03:51,840;"Yeah. But that's pretty cool."
01:03:51,840;01:03:53,480;"And they're both like studs."
01:03:53,480;01:03:57,280;"The process, even Neil and see double a champion."
01:03:57,280;01:04:00,360;"I didn't know that undefeated wrestler and see"
01:04:00,360;01:04:00,880;"the way champion."
01:04:00,880;01:04:01,680;"Yeah, I'm defeated."
01:04:01,680;01:04:05,000;"It was like 83 and zero or 80 something and zero."
01:04:05,000;01:04:09,560;"Someone the bell checker Skarnekia said he is the most"
01:04:09,560;01:04:12,240;"like improved player they've ever coached."
01:04:12,240;01:04:13,880;"Well, yeah, because he didn't play football."
01:04:13,880;01:04:15,960;"Exactly."
01:04:15,960;01:04:20,960;"Another another is that another example of Bellaciec genius?"
01:04:20,960;01:04:21,960;"What did you say?"
01:04:21,960;01:04:24,800;"- Yeah, well, I mean, there he finds guys that like,"
01:04:24,800;01:04:26,400;"no one even thinks to look at."
01:04:26,400;01:04:28,960;"- Hey, Sebastian Volmer from the-"
01:04:28,960;01:04:29,800;"- Yeah, Mayor."
01:04:29,800;01:04:31,120;"- Mayor, yeah."
01:04:31,120;01:04:32,460;"- Mayor, yeah."
01:04:32,460;01:04:33,300;"- It's gonna be Johnson."
01:04:33,300;01:04:35,280;"- That, that, that Marilyn the cross guy."
01:04:35,280;01:04:38,960;"You know he's got a huge heart on for that dude."
01:04:38,960;01:04:40,840;"- Oh, you mean Hogan?"
01:04:40,840;01:04:41,680;"Chris, are you?"
01:04:41,680;01:04:45,120;"- No, no, there's a guy, he is like the all time"
01:04:45,120;01:04:46,880;"leading score for Mayor Cross."
01:04:46,880;01:04:47,720;"- Oh, that's right, yeah."
01:04:47,720;01:04:49,960;"- And I played for some D3 school quarterback"
01:04:49,960;01:04:52,400;"and led them to the D3 Championship and won it."
01:04:52,400;01:04:53,520;"- Nice."
01:04:53,520;01:04:54,360;"- Yeah."
01:04:54,360;01:04:55,280;"- All right."
01:04:55,280;01:04:58,760;"- And no one knows if he's gonna be in the NFL, but."
01:04:58,760;01:04:59,600;"- Oh, we know."
01:04:59,600;01:05:00,600;"- I have a little checker in all of the,"
01:05:00,600;01:05:02,840;"the weird ones, aren't you kidding me?"
01:05:02,840;01:05:05,760;"- He'll be invited to camp at the very least, right?"
01:05:05,760;01:05:09,080;"- And this best is gonna throw you off a little bit."
01:05:09,080;01:05:13,880;"But it was the Bengals' fake field goal touchdown."
01:05:13,880;01:05:15,560;"- We didn't talk about that."
01:05:15,560;01:05:17,320;"- Yeah, I can't really go and talk about this whole,"
01:05:17,320;01:05:19,080;"I've been sitting on this thing."
01:05:19,080;01:05:20,440;"That was a sweet play."
01:05:20,440;01:05:21,720;"- I'm surprised David didn't bring it up."
01:05:21,720;01:05:24,380;"That was like probably the Bengals highlight of the game."
01:05:24,380;01:05:29,000;"- And it was right after Palmer gets hurt, right?"
01:05:29,000;01:05:29,880;"- Yeah."
01:05:29,880;01:05:32,080;"- And like, has he even come out yet?"
01:05:32,080;01:05:35,000;"And like, yeah, it's literally the play"
01:05:35,000;01:05:37,640;"that he gets hurt, Carson Palmer's last play."
01:05:37,640;01:05:38,480;"- Yeah."
01:05:38,480;01:05:39,480;"- It's on the third and five."
01:05:39,480;01:05:40,320;"- Right."
01:05:40,320;01:05:42,520;"- I'm the 11 and they're in this sweet,"
01:05:42,520;01:05:44,160;"I don't know if I put the highlight up on the website"
01:05:44,160;01:05:45,640;"because it's actually worth watching."
01:05:45,640;01:05:46,480;"- Well, I'm not gonna do that,"
01:05:46,480;01:05:49,040;"but okay, I'll find a YouTube video, link it."
01:05:49,040;01:05:54,380;"We don't put other teams highlights on this on the it's on the prime time it is yeah"
01:05:54,380;01:05:59,940;"And this is a cool play. It was just well designed. Yeah, it's kind of like a"
01:05:59,940;01:06:02,760;"Running back off tackle"
01:06:02,760;01:06:07,360;"That's kind of a good call for Marvellous everyone's like what the fuck the quarterback just got blown up right?"
01:06:07,360;01:06:11,840;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm like you know the perfect timing for that no one's thinking about the fake field go at that point"
01:06:11,840;01:06:14,400;"So I'm actually a pretty good coach and Collins for it"
01:06:14,400;01:06:17,280;"So we did have one that's good"
01:06:18,480;01:06:20,480;"Like he thinks it's okay. I mean"
01:06:20,480;01:06:22,760;"For the Bengals in it"
01:06:22,760;01:06:26,920;"2004 hadn't had a winning season since 1990. They'll take me to York already, you know, yeah"
01:06:26,920;01:06:31,560;"You're gonna be a big step up for them. Yeah, that was a touchdown run by"
01:06:31,560;01:06:34,640;"Bengals"
01:06:34,640;01:06:37,880;"Legend Kyle Larson their pun. Yeah. Yeah"
01:06:37,880;01:06:41,280;"This was his rookie season 2004"
01:06:41,280;01:06:45,800;"Life would never get better"
01:06:46,040;01:06:51,240;"Yeah, even pee-pee early week week 14. I mean, you know it happens"
01:06:51,240;01:06:57,280;"Yeah, that that was his only ever rush touchdown. There's only ever yeah, he's only ever"
01:06:57,280;01:06:59,440;"non-punt"
01:06:59,440;01:07:04,920;"Oh, yeah a couple kickoffs three kickoffs in his career. It would be the worst if one of those was the one where"
01:07:04,920;01:07:13,340;"What's his name is the big chest stomped him in the chest. Oh god, yeah, I think that that must have been passes"
01:07:13,340;01:07:15,340;"Yeah, that's the time."
01:07:15,340;01:07:17,340;"It only played until 2008."
01:07:17,340;01:07:19,340;"That would be tough."
01:07:19,340;01:07:23,340;"Although in 2008, his final season, he did crack the century market puns."
01:07:23,340;01:07:29,340;"This is most every, he kicked 100 puns, which feels like a lot."
01:07:29,340;01:07:30,340;"Yeah."
01:07:30,340;01:07:32,340;"Like a lot, a lot."
01:07:32,340;01:07:34,340;"The Bengals have four and 11 of them won that year."
01:07:34,340;01:07:35,340;"So yeah, that makes sense."
01:07:35,340;01:07:36,340;"Yeah."
01:07:36,340;01:07:38,340;"When you're shitty, you put in a lot."
01:07:38,340;01:07:39,340;"Yeah."
01:07:39,340;01:07:40,340;"Yeah."
01:07:40,340;01:07:42,660;"So all right you got anything else Steve"
01:07:42,660;01:07:45,820;"good anything else"
01:07:45,820;01:07:47,620;"you good"
01:07:47,620;01:07:50,160;"Gucci all right as the kids say"
01:07:50,160;01:07:55,820;"Did they suppose this is the gram get the numbies as Greg says yeah?"
01:07:55,820;01:08:00,540;"I don't think anybody says that Greg says he said it in the group chat and the family and everyone ignored him"
01:08:00,540;01:08:05,700;"Well, right because that's what you do when somebody says something stupid like that you ignore them. Yeah"
01:08:05,700;01:08:09,620;"All right, well, I mean I think since he's here"
01:08:09,620;01:08:15,920;"We should turn in next week to see how much of a blubbering little bitch"
01:08:15,920;01:08:19,520;"kuragi on the page where it's dynasty park."
01:08:19,520;01:08:22,720;"We should be here next week, but okay."
01:08:22,720;01:08:24,720;"We'll let him lead us out."
01:08:24,720;01:08:27,520;"Well, I mean, you'll have to tune in next week."
01:08:27,520;01:08:28,320;"What is next week, Steve?"
01:08:28,320;01:08:29,220;"I don't know."
01:08:29,220;01:08:30,020;"So I'm asking you."
01:08:30,020;01:08:38,220;"Well, next week, this is a game that I vaguely remember."
01:08:38,220;01:08:44,140;"It's one of the losses that I care the least about, I will say."
01:08:44,140;01:08:45,140;"But it's also..."
01:08:45,140;01:08:46,140;"I know it's a loss."
01:08:46,140;01:08:47,980;"Yep, you do."
01:08:47,980;01:08:50,460;"So go into it knowing that."
01:08:50,460;01:09:00,220;"But it's also a game that the winning team has named it themselves."
01:09:00,220;01:09:02,980;"So we'll just..."
01:09:02,980;01:09:05,540;"We'll tickle your teaser with that, Steve, okay?"
01:09:05,540;01:09:06,540;"Okay, fine."
01:09:06,540;01:09:08,180;"I'll find out when I watch it."
01:09:08,180;01:09:13,780;"Okay. If I watch it, you'll watch it. You always watch it. I don't always watch it. Always"
01:09:13,780;01:09:20,860;"watch it. Alright, well, that's it. Thank you for joining us. Thank you, David, for coming"
01:09:20,860;01:09:28,220;"on and giving us a bangles perspective on the old school. Early 2000s, years. It was"
01:09:28,220;01:09:32,980;"always nice to hear the suffering of other fans. Yeah, I feel better about my life for"
01:09:32,980;01:09:37,780;"sure. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, the we were, uh, we made the right decision following the,"
01:09:37,780;01:09:43,380;"the new one. I think that was born in New Hampshire. Yeah. Awful, awful team. Yeah. So"
01:09:43,380;01:09:52,660;"yeah, so next week the Patriots will travel to Miami. Pro player stadium. From Monday night game"
01:09:52,660;01:10:01,780;"against the two and 11 Miami Dolphins. And we will see what happens next week"

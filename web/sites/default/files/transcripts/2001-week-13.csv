00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,880;"I am not your mother."
00:19,880;00:24,320;"Welcome back to the Page of Sanity podcast."
00:24,320;00:26,880;"You've made it to week 13."
00:26,880;00:29,680;"Well we have, I'm not sure anybody's listening anymore."
00:29,680;00:33,380;"But we have a special guest with us today."
00:33,380;00:37,720;"But before we get to him, we have Mike and Greg on the show tonight."
00:37,720;00:40,680;"No, Steve, how are you boys doing?"
00:40,680;00:42,680;"I'm doing fantastic."
00:42,680;00:43,680;"I'm really darn well."
00:43,680;00:46,480;"I should have let one at a time."
00:46,480;00:47,480;"I knew better."
00:47,480;00:48,480;"Yeah."
00:48,480;00:49,480;"All right."
00:49,480;00:50,480;"Sure."
00:50,480;00:51,480;"Great."
00:51,480;00:59,560;"But also with us, we have Connor Ireland, who to me sounds like a name of"
00:59,560;01:03,540;"Conor McGregor in an off-licensed MMA game, but I assure you he is not"
01:03,540;01:06,240;"Connor how's it going bud"
01:06,240;01:13,720;"Going well, I think my name kind of sounds like someone who grew up as an Irish kid who was cheered for the Patriots for their entire life"
01:13,720;01:16,200;"back during the"
01:16,200;01:18,200;"Ben Coats"
01:18,200;01:20,880;"Drew blood so"
01:20,880;01:23,680;"Where those other guys there's other guys"
01:23,680;01:29,540;"I should huge fan huge fan"
01:29,540;01:34,540;"and I answer Greg back in those days."
01:34,540;01:36,620;"- I don't know if Greg remembers this"
01:36,620;01:38,780;"'cause he's just a wee one,"
01:38,780;01:42,540;"but the Boston Globe used to do a poster"
01:42,540;01:46,380;"of a specific player every Sunday."
01:46,380;01:48,180;"- Oh, that's right."
01:48,180;01:53,180;"- And no one had been more Ben Coates posters on their walls"
01:53,180;01:56,260;"than I did."
01:56,260;02:01,260;"So Greg, talk with me when you can remember 1996"
02:01,260;02:02,580;"'cause I know I can."
02:02,580;02:03,580;"(laughs)"
02:03,580;02:05,700;"- He used to hang him up in market basket."
02:05,700;02:08,020;"- That's when you know--"
02:08,020;02:09,020;"- That's right."
02:09,020;02:10,020;"- Yeah."
02:10,020;02:10,860;"- Yeah."
02:10,860;02:11,860;"- Coming up in market basket."
02:11,860;02:13,540;"- Yeah, I can't believe it was that."
02:13,540;02:16,700;"- Every Sunday, there is a little poster"
02:16,700;02:19,260;"in the back of the Sunday Globe."
02:19,260;02:20,100;"- Yeah."
02:20,100;02:22,620;"- And a specific player, and I used to cut them out"
02:22,620;02:24,180;"and paint them on my wall."
02:24,180;02:25,220;"So."
02:25,220;02:27,340;"Yeah, I think I had those up in my walls too."
02:27,340;02:28,700;"I remember those."
02:28,700;02:30,860;"Connor, have you ever seen my scrapbook?"
02:30,860;02:31,220;"Bro?"
02:31,220;02:38,580;"I'm the kid who had the, uh, the, the, the Patriot shrine in his bedroom for"
02:38,580;02:39,660;"a series."
02:39,660;02:41,820;"I scrapbooked this whole season."
02:41,820;02:42,820;"Yeah."
02:42,820;02:47,300;"Let me guess, Greg, your Patriot shrine started in like what?"
02:47,300;02:49,180;"2003, 2004."
02:49,180;02:52,740;"Dude, it was pre-brady."
02:52,740;02:53,540;"Yeah."
02:54,260;02:57,060;"I, I scrapped Brady's first start."
02:57,060;02:58,140;"He did."
02:58,140;03:00,740;"So don't come at me."
03:00,740;03:01,060;"All right."
03:01,060;03:04,740;"So 2000, 2001 got it."
03:04,740;03:05,540;"Yeah."
03:05,540;03:06,020;"Yeah."
03:06,020;03:07,340;"All right."
03:07,340;03:10,540;"So now that the dick measuring contest is over, how about we get to this football"
03:10,540;03:11,020;"game, my boys?"
03:11,020;03:13,180;"I didn't even join the dick measuring contest."
03:13,180;03:13,580;"All right."
03:13,580;03:16,820;"You would you, would you like to chime in about how big your page is dick is?"
03:16,820;03:18,580;"Yeah, this time for that later."
03:18,580;03:21,300;"All right."
03:21,820;03:30,140;"So yeah, this is like we said earlier week 13 of the 2001 season the Cleveland Browns coming to visit"
03:30,140;03:35,580;"Foxboro Stadium with the gratuitous shots of CMGI fields in the backgrounds"
03:35,580;03:46,060;"Browns were actually good for the Browns this year, I guess coming into the game they were six and five"
03:47,260;03:51,340;"which was more wins than they had in the previous two seasons combined where they went"
03:51,340;03:57,260;"two wins and then three wins. Unfortunately, they would finish the season seven and nine"
03:57,260;04:00,380;"missed the playoffs. Now, typical brown shit."
04:00,380;04:04,300;"Well, that's the..."
04:04,300;04:04,860;"Well, that's the catch."
04:04,860;04:05,340;"That's the catch."
04:05,340;04:11,740;"That's the catch. It's a great, you know, what did he win a Heisman? He was like the great white"
04:11,740;04:19,020;"hope for the ground. Well, they were talking about him as what the Heisman winner or something"
04:19,020;04:26,460;"in this game. But yeah, this was still this was pre crouch. This was Tim couch. That's what"
04:26,460;04:34,940;"I meant. Tim couch. Yeah, sorry. Yeah. He he I felt so bad for Tim couch in this game."
04:36,060;04:39,060;"Well, we'll get to that in a bit, but he struggled."
04:39,060;04:41,420;"He was sacked 51 times this season."
04:41,420;04:50,060;"I think, yeah, we touched on most sacked players in the in League history."
04:50,060;04:53,940;"And I'm pretty sure this was on that list in like the top 10 or 20, whatever it was."
04:53,940;04:54,620;"I don't know."
04:54,620;04:56,580;"There's some 70s on that list."
04:56,580;04:56,860;"Yeah."
04:56,860;04:59,460;"It was what's his face was topping that list far and away."
04:59,460;05:00,620;"Car."
05:00,620;05:01,140;"Yeah."
05:01,140;05:01,980;"Yeah."
05:01,980;05:02,460;"Yeah."
05:02,460;05:03,060;"Yeah."
05:03,060;05:05,420;"It's like an expansion team thing."
05:05,420;05:05,700;"Yeah."
05:05,700;05:06,700;"Yeah."
05:06,700;05:07,700;"That's true."
05:07,700;05:08,700;"Yeah."
05:08,700;05:11,700;"Um, so head coach was Bush Davis."
05:11,700;05:14,700;"Remember that which is a fucking fantastic name."
05:14,700;05:16,700;"Uh, never, never beat the Patriots."
05:16,700;05:19,700;"Uh, the past went to an O against them."
05:19,700;05:21,700;"Some other notable coaches on the team though."
05:21,700;05:27,140;"They're actually like some who's who of, uh, future head coaching failures."
05:27,140;05:28,140;"I thought."
05:28,140;05:29,140;"Yeah."
05:29,140;05:30,140;"Yeah."
05:30,140;05:31,140;"Yeah."
05:31,140;05:32,140;"Yeah."
05:32,140;05:34,140;"Bruce Arians is probably the most successful of them all."
05:34,140;05:35,140;"Wow."
05:35,140;05:35,980;"- Yep."
05:35,980;05:38,700;"He was a head coach of the Cardinals for five years"
05:38,700;05:41,260;"and is now currently the head coach of the Buccaneers."
05:41,260;05:44,700;"Him of James Winston fame."
05:44,700;05:46,140;"- I like him. - He's in 30."
05:46,140;05:47,660;"- I think he's a good coach."
05:47,660;05:50,100;"- Yeah, but wasn't he the guy that talked about"
05:50,100;05:52,100;"like he used to drink paint as a kid?"
05:52,100;05:53,780;"Did I make that up?"
05:53,780;05:55,140;"- I'll stat check."
05:55,140;05:56,860;"(laughs)"
05:56,860;05:59,580;"- I feel like there was some quote about him"
05:59,580;06:03,180;"and some somewhere about him like either eating paint chips"
06:03,180;06:04,860;"or like drinking paint as a kid."
06:04,860;06:06,140;"Yeah."
06:06,140;06:13,140;"Who's Ariane said on serious today that he had to get his stomach pumped twice when he was younger from drinking paint."
06:13,140;06:17,340;"So not once, but twice."
06:17,340;06:19,180;"Well, they said that in 2017."
06:19,180;06:20,220;"Yeah."
06:20,220;06:21,300;"Yeah, I thought so."
06:21,300;06:26,780;"Secondary coach on the team with Todd Bowles, the old Jets head coach, remember him?"
06:26,780;06:27,980;"Yep."
06:27,980;06:31,060;"We liked playing against him."
06:31,060;06:34,780;"The pages were eight and one against Todd Bowles, coach, Jets teams."
06:34,780;06:36,220;"What happened on that loss?"
06:36,220;06:38,660;"Um, I don't know."
06:38,660;06:41,860;"I've taught my head, but my guess it was probably like a week 17"
06:41,860;06:43,860;"throw your backup scene game."
06:43,860;06:44,620;"Yeah."
06:44,620;06:45,900;"You're right."
06:45,900;06:46,940;"Yeah."
06:46,940;06:50,620;"Well, actually, no, wasn't that, uh, I feel like Todd Bowles."
06:50,620;06:53,780;"Oh, who was that Jets quarterback?"
06:53,780;06:58,700;"After, um, after Sanchez."
06:58,700;07:02,540;"I think it was like the Virginia or Virginia Tech guy."
07:02,540;07:04,180;"Oh, yeah."
07:04,180;07:06,180;"Oh, what's his name?"
07:06,180;07:07,180;"Greg."
07:07,180;07:08,180;"Greg."
07:08,180;07:09,180;"Check."
07:09,180;07:10,180;"Check."
07:10,180;07:17,180;"Well, it's a Quincy card, but it's not Quincy card."
07:17,180;07:18,180;"You know, Smith."
07:18,180;07:19,180;"Gino Smith."
07:19,180;07:20,180;"Thank you."
07:20,180;07:21,180;"Yeah."
07:21,180;07:22,180;"Yeah."
07:22,180;07:23,180;"Yeah."
07:23,180;07:24,180;"Yeah."
07:24,180;07:25,180;"Yeah."
07:25,180;07:26,180;"Yeah."
07:26,180;07:27,180;"Yeah."
07:27,180;07:28,180;"Yeah."
07:28,180;07:29,180;"Yeah."
07:29,180;07:30,180;"Oh, it's enough."
07:30,180;07:37,060;"Yeah, so I think that was during those days and those one game where Gino Smith just went"
07:37,060;07:39,460;"off randomly and beat the Patriots."
07:39,460;07:41,820;"So that was probably that one win."
07:41,820;07:42,820;"I remember."
07:42,820;07:43,820;"Yeah, right."
07:43,820;07:49,060;"Yeah, I think I'm assuming that was Todd Bowles because I mean they've had a lot of dark moments,"
07:49,060;07:52,980;"but Todd Bowles is one of the darker ones."
07:52,980;07:57,140;"And then the secondary coach was our old friend Chuck Bagano."
07:57,140;07:58,140;"Wow."
07:58,140;08:00,940;"Wow, it's a blank color in history."
08:00,940;08:07,420;"Right. Yeah, it was because he is the swinging gate fake punt."
08:07,420;08:08,820;"Chuck Pagano, right?"
08:08,820;08:09,820;"Oh, yeah."
08:09,820;08:10,820;"Okay."
08:10,820;08:13,260;"The greatest play in special teams history."
08:13,260;08:16,180;"Oh, so hang on."
08:16,180;08:21,380;"Was taught, no, okay, no, man, I was hoping that Todd Bowles was the coach of the butthumbel"
08:21,380;08:24,260;"game, but that's, that's what the case was."
08:24,260;08:25,460;"Can you hear me?"
08:25,460;08:26,460;"Can you hear me?"
08:26,460;08:27,940;"I can hear you now, yeah."
08:27,940;08:33,620;"Okay, yeah, I just I just hopped on to my zoom meeting."
08:33,620;08:36,540;"My, my AirPods are connected to the zoom meeting."
08:36,540;08:37,660;"So we're locked and loaded."
08:37,660;08:39,460;"Continue on the show."
08:39,460;08:45,420;"We'll leave that in."
08:45,420;08:45,820;"Fuck it."
08:45,820;08:48,180;"That's what I'm saying."
08:48,180;08:56,780;"So I took a quick look at the, um, the roster of this team,"
08:56,780;09:00,540;"tried to put together a list of people that even like you may have heard of."
09:00,540;09:08,140;"And the only two people that I'd heard of were Tim couch and Phil Dawson, the kicker."
09:08,140;09:10,860;"The other names I didn't recognize."
09:10,860;09:15,460;"You don't remember, you don't remember Gerard Warren, the defensive lineman that"
09:15,460;09:17,740;"played for like 27 years."
09:17,740;09:21,140;"You don't remember Earl Little, the safety."
09:21,140;09:22,540;"No."
09:24,140;09:26,740;"Then it's Northcut ring about when I."
09:26,740;09:27,840;"For sure."
09:27,840;09:30,380;"And Kevin Johnson is bell right."
09:30,380;09:34,260;"Kevin Johnson, I had no idea, but he was great."
09:34,260;09:37,340;"By the way, I just want to point this out."
09:37,340;09:40,420;"I have the Zoom app because I use it for work."
09:40,420;09:44,740;"Every time Greg talk, it says Kelly Brown when he speaks."
09:44,740;09:46,540;"So I just I just want that on."
09:46,540;09:49,660;"I want that on record."
09:49,660;09:50,660;"Greg."
09:50,660;09:51,100;"I'm sure a lot."
09:51,100;09:52,740;"I Greg."
09:52,740;09:54,940;"You know what? I'm a I'm a modern man."
09:54,940;09:55,980;"And I'm."
09:55,980;10:01,140;"He actually took her first name and she took his last name."
10:01,140;10:02,220;"So they're both Kelly Brown."
10:02,220;10:04,420;"Now, holy shit, that is one."
10:04,420;10:09,460;"It's fucking me up every time Greg talks with those."
10:09,460;10:14,100;"Kelly Brown is speaking and, you know, it, it makes sense."
10:14,100;10:20,580;"I did recognize Corey Fuller, I think."
10:21,020;10:23,520;"But I don't know if that's a good game in this game."
10:23,520;10:27,580;"Or you're thinking of the core, the wide receiver Corey"
10:27,580;10:31,100;"filler that was actually on the Browns a couple of years ago."
10:31,100;10:33,740;"See that could be a two."
10:33,740;10:36,460;"It's a different Corey Fuller."
10:36,460;10:41,660;"Yeah. Apparently, Jamar Miller was like a pro bowl for"
10:41,660;10:43,940;"C'mon Pro was the linebacker."
10:43,940;10:47,420;"And he looked apart, but we still never heard of him."
10:47,420;10:48,540;"Don't remember him."
10:49,540;10:56,820;"And what it's just through of just failures in terms of Brown's defense."
10:56,820;11:04,140;"This is what bothers me as a guy named Wally Rayner that had 13 tackles that game."
11:04,140;11:09,100;"I'm upset that I have never heard of a guy named Wally Rayner."
11:09,100;11:13,620;"No, none of these guys, because yeah, I'm putting it all the league."
11:13,620;11:16,420;"They're they're leading running back with James Jackson."
11:16,460;11:20,460;"one never heard of him, two he finished with 554 rushing yards."
11:20,460;11:23,420;"Yeah, never heard of him either. Leading Russia on this team."
11:23,420;11:27,660;"For part of the reason, right, is because of the whole relocation, right?"
11:27,660;11:31,740;"Yes. So yeah, because that had just happened recently."
11:31,740;11:39,020;"Yeah, so the new Browns, the new Browns resume play in 1999. So they're two years back into their,"
11:39,020;11:43,020;"you know, brand new franchise, essentially."
11:43,980;11:48,980;"I can't believe Bill gave up on a franchise like this."
11:48,980;11:52,980;"It's really blowing my mind."
11:52,980;11:54,980;"They gave up on him."
11:54,980;11:56,380;"Yeah, they did give up on him."
11:56,380;11:58,180;"He wanted to stick around."
11:58,180;12:00,180;"Yeah."
12:00,180;12:03,180;"Did you hear how it went down?"
12:03,180;12:04,180;"I think so."
12:04,180;12:06,180;"I've heard a few different versions."
12:06,180;12:07,580;"I don't know what you've heard."
12:07,580;12:09,980;"So Belichick makes the playoffs, right?"
12:09,980;12:10,980;"That one year."
12:10,980;12:12,780;"11 and five."
12:12,780;12:16,020;"The next year, they're like, it's week five."
12:16,020;12:19,380;"And that's when Art Mode dealt, he decides he's going to"
12:19,380;12:21,340;"announce that they're moving the team."
12:21,340;12:22,940;"The middle of the season."
12:22,940;12:23,940;"Right."
12:23,940;12:24,620;"Right."
12:24,620;12:25,780;"It was moved."
12:25,780;12:29,300;"So the whole team quits on the season, of course."
12:29,300;12:32,780;"They win five games that year and Bella checks gone."
12:32,780;12:35,340;"But then that also plays into the jet situation because people"
12:35,340;12:38,300;"should on Bella check for bailing on the jets position."
12:38,300;12:42,220;"But if people remember back then, there was also an ownership"
12:42,220;12:46,020;"change or it was at least rocky because they didn't know they were going to sell the team."
12:46,020;12:49,700;"And so I'm pretty sure Belichick didn't want to be a head coach for the second time and"
12:49,700;12:52,540;"then have the team move or some janky crap happen."
12:52,540;12:55,300;"So it looked pretty bad."
12:55,300;13:01,220;"But if we look back at history, I think it's an understandable move."
13:01,220;13:02,220;"Yeah."
13:02,220;13:10,060;"And I think you can also point out the fact that the last coach to take the Browns to"
13:10,060;13:14,080;"a playoff victory is still to this day. Bill Belichick."
13:14,080;13:16,740;"Drew beating our new"
13:16,740;13:18,280;"Patriots actually in that playoff game."
13:18,280;13:22,780;"Imagine this podcast, like for the Browns."
13:22,780;13:26,080;"I love you every day."
13:26,080;13:29,660;"We should start that."
13:29,660;13:31,040;"Greg, just me and you."
13:31,040;13:32,080;"Browns on Browns."
13:32,080;13:32,680;"Yeah."
13:32,680;13:34,320;"I like that name."
13:34,320;13:38,220;"Just go back and just shit on the"
13:38,220;13:44,820;"Brown starting in 2001. Hey, you got the name of the podcast. It's called shit brown."
13:44,820;13:47,420;"There you go. Boom."
13:47,420;13:52,500;"Beautiful. Is that is that not insane though?"
13:52,500;13:55,900;"Like you imagine being a Brown fan."
13:55,900;13:58,340;"You're like you you want to start a podcast."
13:58,340;14:02,100;"This one I was like, oh my God, there's so much longevity to this."
14:02,100;14:06,340;"You start with Tom Brady's first game and you have 19 years."
14:06,780;14:09,660;"It's like we're gonna have a podcast forever."
14:09,660;14:13,460;"You do the Brown and you're like, well, we're done."
14:13,460;14:14,460;"All right."
14:14,460;14:16,300;"Yeah, when do you even start with that?"
14:16,300;14:18,500;"Thanks."
14:18,500;14:19,460;"Thanks for coming back."
14:19,460;14:23,340;"You guys want to cover some of those 1960 Jim Brown games?"
14:23,340;14:25,540;"Let's go play like play."
14:25,540;14:26,380;"Yeah."
14:26,380;14:28,340;"I mean, I feel like those games will be"
14:28,340;14:31,220;"will be tough to cover because I don't think they had TV back then."
14:31,220;14:33,380;"So finding video of that."
14:33,380;14:35,180;"Probably doesn't exist."
14:35,180;14:42,580;"You can't look this up, but imagine Jim Brown breaking a tackle of a 180 pound"
14:42,580;14:44,980;"linebacker that you've never heard of."
14:44,980;14:47,260;"Do you have the visual?"
14:47,260;14:50,740;"You have the part time mechanic while also playing football."
14:50,740;14:52,580;"Yeah."
14:52,580;14:57,580;"Auto green plus four for six to the air."
14:57,580;14:58,860;"Twenty six."
14:58,860;15:01,260;"This is sounding better and better by the second."
15:01,260;15:02,460;"Nine nothing."
15:02,460;15:04,460;"[laughter]"
15:04,460;15:07,460;"Oh, Brown's on Brown's, I'm telling you."
15:07,460;15:10,460;"Wait for that spin-off, I can feel it."
15:10,460;15:12,460;"We want something."
15:12,460;15:15,460;"That's how we expand our audience, Andy."
15:15,460;15:16,460;"Absolutely, yeah."
15:16,460;15:19,460;"But Brown's fans and Patriots fans there,"
15:19,460;15:23,460;"two audiences ripe for the picking, I'm sure."
15:23,460;15:26,460;"Not that I think there's many Brown's fans left, probably, but..."
15:26,460;15:30,460;"I don't know, they do need a boost for those that are left."
15:30,460;15:36,260;"So maybe maybe we'll bring our massive star power to the Browns as well. I can't wait by the way"
15:36,260;15:42,140;"Go ahead. This is just a side note. I got"
15:42,140;15:50,500;"Text confirmation Tully Bantikane is ready to join the podcast starting in 2003. So we have some ground"
15:50,500;15:59,760;"He did tell me that I would be allowed to ask him on air how big Tom Brady's dick is so can we get"
16:00,260;16:01,960;"2003 as soon as possible."
16:01,960;16:05,360;"I have some things to ask me about this."
16:05,360;16:06,360;"All right."
16:06,360;16:07,760;"I like this guy."
16:07,760;16:09,360;"He's bringing some things to the table here."
16:09,360;16:11,260;"I've got some questions asked."
16:11,260;16:13,760;"Tell me about Kelly Brown, actually."
16:13,760;16:14,660;"Yeah."
16:14,660;16:15,560;"So yeah."
16:15,560;16:17,960;"So yeah, we definitely have him on the podcast."
16:17,960;16:19,260;"I'm from the rumors."
16:19,260;16:20,460;"Exactly."
16:20,460;16:20,760;"Yeah."
16:20,760;16:23,560;"If he knows what, uh, uh, what was it called?"
16:23,560;16:24,460;"The credit card is?"
16:24,460;16:25,260;"Yeah, the credit card."
16:25,260;16:26,260;"So I, yeah."
16:26,260;16:26,660;"Okay."
16:26,660;16:29,060;"So we'll tease that for."
16:29,660;16:31,220;"fucking two seasons from now."
16:31,220;16:37,500;"Well, Christian Fourier said that Tom Brady's nickname was driftwood, Tommy."
16:37,500;16:42,740;"And I want to know what exactly he means by driftwood."
16:42,740;16:45,100;"Like, what are we talking here?"
16:45,100;16:47,620;"Yeah, that's kind of ambiguous."
16:47,620;16:50,580;"You think that's going to come out like when Brady retires?"
16:50,580;16:52,700;"Is it because it's soft and smooth?"
16:52,700;16:53,700;"I don't."
16:53,700;16:54,860;"I don't think so."
16:54,860;17:01,660;"Now breaking news Tom Brady's dick is the size of a log that has been out at sea for three years."
17:01,660;17:05,340;"He does have what they call that that big dick energy."
17:05,340;17:06,300;"Is that what it is?"
17:06,300;17:07,100;"That's true. Yeah."
17:07,100;17:08,860;"Yeah, he's got that big dick energy."
17:08,860;17:09,980;"Seems that way."
17:09,980;17:10,860;"Tommy Longcock."
17:10,860;17:16,380;"Greg dresses him for Halloween."
17:16,380;17:18,460;"That's probably anatomically correct."
17:23,100;17:24,120;"Got it. All right."
17:24,120;17:25,920;"Speaking of speaking of big dicks."
17:25,920;17:29,600;"Let's talk about let's talk about a boy, Tim couch."
17:29,600;17:35,400;"I feel like we should probably start with him because for some reason I remember"
17:35,400;17:36,640;"seeing highlights of this."
17:36,640;17:40,680;"I think it's like when I was putting together the website and all the highlights"
17:40,680;17:45,880;"are basically Tim couch getting just absolutely the shit kicked in."
17:45,880;17:48,280;"It's yeah."
17:48,280;17:52,920;"The fact that he survived his football game kind of surprised me."
17:52,920;18:00,080;"Yeah, Tim couch running for his life. He went 20 for 29, a 24 39 in this game."
18:00,080;18:07,200;"Yeah. His first pass attempt like to set the tone of this game, second play from scrimmage."
18:07,200;18:13,240;"He drops back and I think it was Teddy Bruce. He just puts his face mask right in his chest as"
18:13,240;18:17,520;"he's throwing the ball and turns into a duck and he gets picked off like literally second play of"
18:17,520;18:22,880;"the game. I think it was a joke. Jones with that one. Yeah, exactly. And it went downhill from"
18:22,880;18:27,880;"there. It was not great. And then he actually had one drive that was good. And he got it"
18:27,880;18:31,320;"all the way down, like in the first quarter, got all the way down and then threw a touchdown"
18:31,320;18:35,280;"on third down, but they even that got overturned. It was just not his day."
18:35,280;18:40,280;"Well, I don't know if it was necessarily his fault though, because there were parts"
18:40,280;18:43,760;"of the game, man. He was looking like Steve Young running around and flinging it. The"
18:43,760;18:47,920;"problem is, is that he was getting smashed on the replay. So it's hard to tell if it"
18:47,920;18:51,760;"was like his fault or I mean, the line didn't help for sure. But I don't know if that guy"
18:51,760;18:53,520;"I ever got like a fair shake in this game."
18:53,520;18:58,000;"- I don't think that's shaking is career."
18:58,000;18:59,400;"- No, exactly."
18:59,400;19:01,920;"- I mean, he's drafted by an expansion team"
19:01,920;19:03,120;"first overall, right?"
19:03,120;19:06,200;"And then he only had five years in the NFL."
19:06,200;19:07,960;"For only-- - Oh, wow, holy crap."
19:07,960;19:10,920;"- Games in five seasons, all with the Browns."
19:10,920;19:12,800;"So he never even got that like, you know,"
19:12,800;19:15,480;"every, you know, first pick overall"
19:15,480;19:18,640;"that boss always gets that second, third, fourth team."
19:18,640;19:20,320;"He never had him for him."
19:20,320;19:21,640;"That's crazy. I never knew that."
19:21,640;19:22,840;"Yeah, it's true."
19:22,840;19:24,440;"Yeah."
19:24,440;19:25,760;"Nice."
19:25,760;19:33,360;"Also, he was responsible for one, two, three, four turnovers in that game."
19:33,360;19:36,640;"Three picks and a fourth fumble by my boy, Tabaki."
19:36,640;19:38,680;"What a name, by the way."
19:38,680;19:41,720;"I don't know if he was responsible for that, though."
19:41,720;19:44,160;"Maybe he recovered the fumble."
19:44,160;19:44,720;"I'm sorry."
19:44,720;19:45,160;"How you."
19:45,160;19:46,680;"Oh, you're talking about Tabaki, Joe."
19:46,680;19:48,480;"I thought you're talking about Tim couch."
19:48,480;19:59,880;"I mean, he was involved in four turnovers in that game."
19:59,880;20:00,880;"Three picks."
20:00,880;20:05,480;"And then he completed the pass."
20:05,480;20:06,480;"That was that humbled."
20:06,480;20:07,480;"Yeah."
20:07,480;20:08,480;"That's what it was."
20:08,480;20:11,480;"Kabaki had a pick and a four swumble in that game."
20:11,480;20:12,480;"Yeah."
20:12,480;20:18,240;"I mean, the first number was because North crit literally got knocked the fuck out as"
20:18,240;20:19,880;"he was like, Africa, the ball."
20:19,880;20:22,040;"You should have self cut."
20:22,040;20:28,160;"That's so bad."
20:28,160;20:28,720;"I love it."
20:28,720;20:29,400;"Yeah."
20:29,400;20:30,320;"You should have."
20:30,320;20:32,320;"You should have cut anywhere but north."
20:32,320;20:33,160;"You're absolutely correct."
20:33,160;20:36,200;"Uh, I love her second there."
20:36,200;20:37,360;"I thought you said self cut."
20:37,360;20:38,920;"And I thought that was what I thought."
20:38,920;20:41,920;"I was like, Oh man, you early."
20:41,920;20:45,680;"Uh, no, but the guy's trying to make plays."
20:45,680;20:47,920;"So of course, every once in a while, it's going to sail on them"
20:47,920;20:51,640;"or whatever, but I mean, he was pretty much the only playmaker on the field."
20:51,640;20:52,640;"They had nobody."
20:52,640;20:53,640;"Yeah, there was nothing."
20:53,640;20:58,040;"Because I mean, even one of those interceptions, he hit the guy straight in the hands, he just"
20:58,040;21:02,000;"bobbled it and it was picked off by which defensive line was."
21:02,000;21:04,440;"And it's the pleasant, I think, ended up with the interception."
21:04,440;21:05,440;"It was, yeah."
21:05,440;21:07,400;"It was Anthony Pleasant."
21:07,400;21:08,400;"Yeah."
21:08,400;21:09,400;"Yeah."
21:09,400;21:15,600;"For probably his only ever interception of his career, I have to guess."
21:15,600;21:17,600;"I'll point"
21:17,600;21:19,720;"Stat check"
21:19,720;21:25,520;"Alexa there's there's so many there's so many names on this path defense that just"
21:25,520;21:32,600;"God I fucking I love those early teams in terms like Anthony Pleasant"
21:32,600;21:38,760;"Work will get to Roman fight for later. Maybe the mola under maybe the most underrated"
21:38,760;21:41,200;"Patriots defensive player like the early"
21:41,200;21:43,480;"2000s"
21:43,480;21:49,020;"God there's some great this fucking great man Patrick pass who is what our fullback"
21:49,020;21:56,920;"Have three tackles in that game God. He must have just been doing work on either kickoff or pun. Yeah special teams"
21:56,920;22:02,480;"Yeah"
22:02,480;22:08,480;"So close in a clear intersections - all right Wow your sex"
22:08,480;22:11,320;"Not bad"
22:11,760;22:17,840;"Yeah, for I mean they say he's a defensive end, but they didn't feel like a defensive end. Yeah"
22:17,840;22:27,120;"Does this still happen where you have like your three main linebackers and they're all they all have like"
22:27,120;22:35,080;"10 plus tackles in a game does this still happen in the NFL or on the Patriots because I'm looking at Roman Fyfer"
22:35,080;22:37,640;"Mikey braids and"
22:37,760;22:45,180;"Teddy ice cold and they all had 10 plus tackles in this game and it's like does that even happen in that film anymore?"
22:45,180;22:52,920;"When you have a really have three linebackers on a field anymore with how spread open things are like you'll have to and then you'll"
22:52,920;22:54,560;"have like a"
22:54,560;23:00,720;"An extra safety come down to the box or something like that, you know like a Patrick Chung sort of with an extra DB on there"
23:00,720;23:06,840;"Yeah, Roman Pfeiffer was definitely one of those like hybrid outside linebackers like an Elvis doomer"
23:06,840;23:09,480;"like do Merville or you know like"
23:09,480;23:12,520;"not a not a traditional"
23:12,520;23:18,280;"Lineback especially in today's day and age but I'm looking at it right now and it's like"
23:18,280;23:22,520;"Fyfer Bruski and Braebel 11"
23:22,520;23:25,640;"Sort of that that's right of"
23:25,640;23:28,520;"free hybrid. Yeah"
23:28,520;23:34,640;"Yeah, I did catch the when you were talking about under-rated"
23:35,520;23:37,680;"players on his defense they"
23:37,680;23:44,200;"The commentators at one point like oh, I think one of the most underrated players on this defense is Teddy Bruski"
23:44,200;23:49,640;"And I thought to me of all the people you can pick on this defense. I don't know if he's the one I"
23:49,640;23:55,120;"Would have pulled up, but maybe he wasn't yeah, but they were referencing that he was like a he was a backup"
23:55,120;23:59,400;"Before there were injuries. So I think he he was underrated"
24:01,040;24:07,040;"It was 2001 Andy. He probably wasn't underrated underused linebacker on the team."
24:07,040;24:09,040;"He probably didn't come into his own."
24:09,040;24:22,040;"You didn't start seeing like Teddy Bruski throwing up the snowballs during the snow game like into like the 2003 2004 era."
24:22,040;24:26,040;"Teddy Bruski wasn't like an everyday starter until then."
24:26,040;24:31,280;"Yeah, and I believe like a problem on the depth chart until I got yeah"
24:31,280;24:35,280;"But I thought until I'm just looking it up right this second"
24:35,280;24:41,880;"Stat tracking shit now these days and 99 2000 both years he had 108 tackles"
24:41,880;24:50,780;"So these big track went yeah, I know that but I mean that's what I thought too"
24:50,780;24:54,480;"Especially the way that we're talking about him about always this this young up and cumber"
24:54,480;24:57,000;"But I mean, he'd been on the team since '96, apparently."
24:57,000;25:02,400;"Didn't start many games until '99."
25:02,400;25:07,600;"We started, you started 14 games and then 16 games year, year after or the year"
25:07,600;25:08,200;"before this one."
25:08,200;25:09,160;"Oh, that's weird."
25:09,160;25:09,960;"Yeah."
25:09,960;25:10,680;"You're right."
25:10,680;25:13,760;"They were kind of almost like they never discovered them."
25:13,760;25:17,360;"I mean, to be fair, the Patriots were obscure anyway."
25:17,360;25:21,800;"So maybe it was just that they were getting a little bit better and they noticed him."
25:21,800;25:23,000;"That's what I'm thinking."
25:23,000;25:23,280;"Yeah."
25:24,360;25:26,040;"I mean, I will say Teddy Bruski man."
25:26,040;25:29,120;"I don't know if there's been another line back or that just flies around."
25:29,120;25:35,760;"Tackle or no tackle usually not tackling, but he's just flying off screen to somewhere."
25:35,760;25:38,160;"And I've never seen anybody else quite do it like him."
25:38,160;25:45,400;"Yeah, I think that's one of my favorite things to to remember from from these teams is"
25:45,400;25:51,320;"that that picture of Teddy Bruski just running at like on a blitz and just running at the guy."
25:51,440;25:54,680;"usually the running back that steps up to block and he just"
25:54,680;25:57,200;"literally just tries to jump over him every time. Yeah, it's"
25:57,200;26:00,080;"clipped in the legs, but still just like his body hurdles into"
26:00,080;26:03,520;"the into the quarterback and then just knocks him over like"
26:03,520;26:04,840;"feet first or some bullshit."
26:04,840;26:08,800;"All right, you guys have two seconds to respond. What"
26:08,800;26:12,560;"position? Where did Teddy Bruce can go to college and what"
26:12,560;26:13,640;"position did he play?"
26:13,640;26:19,560;"Arizona. Yes, he did. He was a tight end though, isn't he?"
26:20,000;26:22,960;"He was a safety Arizona. I'm pretty sure."
26:22,960;26:27,080;"Don't quote me on that, but it's on it's on Eric's on record."
26:27,080;26:30,000;"I'm pretty sure he was a safety at Arizona."
26:30,000;26:34,800;"With the point being, though, he's massively undersized."
26:34,800;26:39,520;"He's always just been a fucking bowling ball of hate."
26:39,520;26:41,080;"Apparently. Yeah."
26:41,080;26:43,760;"Yeah. Six one two forty seven,"
26:43,760;26:49,080;"which not huge for, I mean, for, well, I mean, nowadays,"
26:49,080;26:52,280;"linebacker to think of kind of gotten smaller in general because they have to be quicker."
26:52,280;26:58,600;"But in this 2001 day and age where everybody was just bigger in general, it seems like."
26:58,600;27:02,680;"I mean, you look at the tight ends of these games and they all look like they're the same"
27:02,680;27:04,040;"size of Rob Grockenkowski."
27:04,040;27:07,240;"They're just basically an extra lineman with hands."
27:07,240;27:10,280;"Yeah. Everybody looks lower too."
27:10,280;27:16,280;"Oh yeah. Yeah. Like just a little bit. Yeah. The game wasn't about speed, it was about size."
27:16,280;27:30,840;"Because didn't, um, didn't build Parcells have some comment about, uh, he, he built big teams because, uh, as the season goes on, fast teams get slower, but big teams never get any smaller or something like that."
27:30,840;27:33,480;"Yeah, but they also probably get slower."
27:33,480;27:36,600;"So this is true, but they started slow."
27:36,600;27:37,280;"So it doesn't matter."
27:37,280;27:39,400;"So that closes, right?"
27:39,400;27:41,200;"The size, the size never changes."
27:41,200;27:42,360;"I guess that's true."
27:42,720;27:48,160;"The best part of sales quote is about being able to pick the groceries when he went to the Cowboys."
27:48,160;27:49,680;"Oh, yeah."
27:49,680;27:52,320;"He's like, ""I want to pick the groceries."""
27:52,320;27:54,960;"And I couldn't, it's like, amen."
27:54,960;27:57,040;"And that's one thing about Bill."
27:57,040;27:58,560;"That's why he's never leaving the past."
27:58,560;28:03,600;"Bill gets to pick the groceries and fucking Robert Craft signs the checks."
28:03,600;28:10,480;"Bill, Bill, is fucking like obscure team where people were like, ""How is this going to work?"""
28:10,480;28:14,320;"And it's the same way that this is going to really blow you guys with mine."
28:14,320;28:20,640;"The same way that Herb Brooks built the 1980 US Olympic team that built the Russia."
28:20,640;28:22,640;"So like, how is this going to work?"
28:22,640;28:26,080;"And you just got to, you just got to fuck with the vision."
28:26,080;28:28,640;"You got to fuck with the vision and that."
28:28,640;28:31,520;"Well, you said you need to have a system."
28:31,520;28:31,680;"Yeah."
28:31,680;28:32,080;"Yeah."
28:32,080;28:36,800;"That's, I mean, I think that's a surprisingly apt analogy from something like."
28:37,440;28:41,840;"And what that quote was about, you know, he,"
28:41,840;28:45,440;"Parcels was upset because he was forced to draft Terry Glenn."
28:45,440;28:45,840;"Yes."
28:45,840;28:52,880;"And speaking of Terry Glenn, he experienced this season."
28:52,880;28:53,760;"Nicely done."
28:53,760;28:55,680;"That's the hell of a segue."
28:55,680;28:58,800;"He actually finally played in this game."
28:58,800;29:02,880;"The Boston Globe had shit on articles."
29:02,880;29:06,560;"Do we like the whole thing was, will he actually play or not?"
29:06,560;29:12,160;"because they settled their differences or some bullshit and he was kind of healthy."
29:12,160;29:17,840;"But did you actually see they showed the clip of, we talked about it last week, the week before,"
29:17,840;29:25,040;"about the interview that he gave where he basically said, ""Yeah, I'm hurt because I'm not getting paid,"
29:25,040;29:31,680;"and I'm not getting paid, so I'm going to be hurt."" Right, he said, ""I did want to be part of the"
29:31,680;29:36,680;"the Patriots. Yeah. D. I. D. did. That's not clear."
29:36,680;29:43,260;"That was the best. His outfit on that was phenomenal."
29:43,260;29:51,920;"Dude, he has style. He had he had the cornrows, which I'm assuming we're a thing back in 2001."
29:51,920;29:56,960;"I'm just going to guess because he was stylish man. So I've ever heard of Alan"
29:56,960;30:01,960;"- Yeah, I'd say that cornrows were a thing back in 2001."
30:01,960;30:05,760;"Yes."
30:05,760;30:09,860;"- I don't follow Alan Iverson's hairstyle career"
30:09,860;30:10,700;"in terms of time."
30:10,700;30:12,680;"- Well, he had one, he only had one."
30:12,680;30:14,520;"- That's all he ever had?"
30:14,520;30:15,960;"That doesn't mean much."
30:15,960;30:18,800;"(laughing)"
30:18,800;30:22,320;"- Yeah, so he had the cornrows and then he had those like,"
30:22,320;30:24,600;"I don't even know how you describe those sunglasses."
30:24,600;30:30,180;"almost like clear reflective sunglasses that were like wrap arounds."
30:30,180;30:34,200;"I don't even know if there were sunglasses."
30:34,200;30:36,000;"Let's honor the dead."
30:36,000;30:41,040;"Uh, Terry Glenn and his son have passed on to the afterlife."
30:41,040;30:47,000;"Let's, uh, not be too disrespectful, but my God, I'm talking about how"
30:47,000;30:49,920;"you have touched on this in the past, but you are correct."
30:49,920;30:51,960;"What a waste of talent."
30:51,960;30:53,560;"I'll just dive in right now."
30:53,560;30:56,840;"Terry Glenn, what a fucking waste of talent."
30:56,840;30:58,920;"He could have been so good."
30:58,920;30:59,840;"I mean, he was good."
30:59,840;31:01,480;"I was when he was on the field."
31:01,480;31:01,880;"Yeah."
31:01,880;31:03,800;"He just couldn't stay on the field."
31:03,800;31:05,280;"96 to 98."
31:05,280;31:09,920;"He was probably like a top 10 wide receiver."
31:09,920;31:12,640;"Dude, he caught 90 balls as a rookie."
31:12,640;31:13,360;"Yeah."
31:13,360;31:14,960;"1,100 yards."
31:14,960;31:17,920;"What year was that, Kelly?"
31:17,920;31:18,920;"96."
31:18,920;31:20,080;"96."
31:20,080;31:20,520;"Yeah."
31:20,520;31:21,760;"That's a simple year, right?"
31:21,760;31:26,640;"the first one. It was. Yeah. Yeah. So he gave Drew blood so a weapon. They went to Super Bowl."
31:26,640;31:41,240;"Yeah. His play his playing style matched up with Drew's perfectly because Drew was so in love with his arm. And he just did like the whole he just did the whole like fuck it. Terry's down there somewhere. And Terry was like, you know, the perfect."
31:41,960;31:44,680;"Terry would just be going long and Drew would just hit him."
31:44,680;31:48,080;"But so similar to like, uh,"
31:48,080;31:52,080;"the Tom Tom Brady and Randy Moss."
31:52,080;31:53,400;"Yeah."
31:53,400;31:58,560;"Or you've seen the Eli, you seem like the Eli Manning theme where his eyes are"
31:58,560;32:00,920;"closed and he's throwing the ball and he's like, fuck it."
32:00,920;32:03,040;"Uh, Oh,"
32:03,040;32:03,800;"Oh, yeah."
32:03,800;32:05,320;"Yeah."
32:05,320;32:07,240;"Manning hands down there somewhere."
32:07,240;32:07,640;"Yeah."
32:07,640;32:10,160;"Exactly."
32:11,040;32:12,920;"Joe Flacco, jump ball Joe."
32:12,920;32:16,480;"Yeah, say exactly the same idea."
32:16,480;32:20,040;"Joe Flacco's best play was the throw it deep."
32:20,040;32:21,920;"Get the defensive pass interference."
32:21,920;32:23,240;"That was by far his best."
32:23,240;32:23,760;"Constantly."
32:23,760;32:25,240;"Oh, absolutely."
32:25,240;32:28,560;"Or let bold and like body someone."
32:28,560;32:30,120;"Right. Yeah."
32:30,120;32:33,520;"OK, so week 13 2000."
32:33,520;32:36,640;"What do you think was the game changing play in this game?"
32:36,640;32:40,680;"I think everyone probably thinks it's the same one, but I have one"
32:40,680;32:43,280;"of the mind. I just want to hear what other people think."
32:43,280;32:47,320;"Well, I'm a Troy Brown stand, so I'm going to go with his"
32:47,320;32:48,280;"button return touchdown."
32:48,280;32:53,320;"And that's the that's the only answer. One thing."
32:53,320;32:58,720;"Well, I was going to jump in with it's not a play, but the the"
32:58,720;33:02,400;"two minute drill before the half was a drill as well."
33:02,400;33:07,120;"So one play. So I'll give you that. But I loved watching it."
33:07,120;33:09,720;"And I think it set the tone for the second half."
33:09,840;33:14,040;"Yeah, if NFL films do it a turning point, I think it could be either of those situations."
33:14,040;33:14,760;"I agree."
33:14,760;33:15,280;"I agree."
33:15,280;33:21,200;"You know, one thing that sticks out to me, like, that's just a glaring difference"
33:21,200;33:27,720;"between the early 2000s and like today's football lawyer, Malloy, maybe our best"
33:27,720;33:29,320;"overall defensive player."
33:29,320;33:36,320;"He had the game changing block that freed Troy Brown up for that punt return."
33:37,440;33:44,940;"He started to start offensive players stay in on part returns anymore. I feel like that's just like not a thing that happens anymore"
33:44,940;33:49,000;"And I just saw the Patriots, but it's always been like that for them"
33:49,000;33:55,880;"Bell check had been I remember seeing something on one of those like"
33:55,880;34:01,000;"documentaries that have been doing about Bell check this soft season and"
34:01,000;34:05,220;"They were talking about how he did the same thing in"
34:06,320;34:10,400;"on the in Cleveland on the Browns and had like all his top guys on there and"
34:10,400;34:15,600;"It won them like a whole bunch of games like literally on a punt Richard like a walk-off punt return for a touchdown"
34:15,600;34:17,600;"That won them the game"
34:17,600;34:20,360;"So he like that was part of his philosophy from day one"
34:20,360;34:24,380;"There was some staff from this year about how they were like paying"
34:24,380;34:31,680;"Special teams players more than wide receivers. Yes like guys that only play special teams like Matthew Slater"
34:33,400;34:36,040;"But I think that's kind of like the evolution of"
34:36,040;34:42,200;"Having the star is on there to like literally just drafting guys who are starters on special teams now"
34:42,200;34:48,920;"I think that was my point. I feel like you just don't see it"
34:48,920;34:54,920;"You know, they have entire personnel changes when the plant when they know teams planting"
34:54,920;35:00,040;"And like I was just reading up on it. It's like Richard Seymour"
35:01,640;35:03,640;"lawyer"
35:03,640;35:06,440;"And I think"
35:06,440;35:10,360;"Raibel we're all out on punt return and you know what could have been a major"
35:10,360;35:19,880;"Driver behind that. Do you remember when grok broke his forearm on a fucking extra point? I was just gonna bring it out. Yeah"
35:19,880;35:24,280;"I"
35:24,280;35:25,960;"Garbage time"
35:25,960;35:31,380;"And he's been what I bet he probably still wears that fucking robot thing on his arm"
35:31,380;35:40,120;"I don't want to say that it was the major driver behind it, but like I feel like early 2000s"
35:40,120;35:46,040;"Just a whole different animal you had your best players out on your punt return"
35:46,040;35:50,520;"Return"
35:50,520;35:54,280;"To add to your point that wasn't at nasty Laura Malo block"
35:54,280;35:59,400;"But then Richard Seymour like you mentioned was out there. He blasted the kicker on"
35:59,400;36:02,520;"That was gonna be my best"
36:02,520;36:06,840;"Watching six foot seven three hundred fifty pound Richard Seymour"
36:06,840;36:12,680;"It was basically just just walk right into the punter and the guy just falls over like he's been hit by a truck"
36:12,680;36:16,760;"He's the way like I didn't do that"
36:16,760;36:21,560;"He's actually got his hands up as he's doing it and the guy still falls over"
36:23,640;36:26,360;"Well, I was going to put into perspective that. Go ahead."
36:26,360;36:28,440;"No, you go ahead, Mike."
36:28,440;36:32,760;"I was just going to say to put into perspective, like game-wise and correct me if I'm wrong,"
36:32,760;36:39,720;"because I slipped up last week. So whatever. But at this point, it was like 10, 10 in the second"
36:39,720;36:45,800;"quarter. I think it was like four minutes left. And the Troy Brown punt return touchdown for 85"
36:45,800;36:51,560;"yards made it 17, 10. So it was definitely a turning point in the game for those that"
36:51,560;36:55,320;"are curious where we're at at this point but uh uh uh go on time."
36:55,320;37:02,200;"No I'll even add on top of that I think that we got the ball back at half and we scored right at"
37:02,200;37:10,840;"half that punt return actually turned into a uh a sizable two score lead and by sizable two"
37:10,840;37:16,360;"scored lead that makes no fucking sense because it's a two score lead but it's pretty good."
37:16,360;37:18,960;"- Yeah, you're right, you're right."
37:18,960;37:20,320;"- We got the ball back at half."
37:20,320;37:23,400;"I'm pretty sure we scored after half."
37:23,400;37:25,440;"- It was right before half."
37:25,440;37:26,840;"- Right."
37:26,840;37:28,160;"- Oh, that's right, sorry."
37:28,160;37:29,000;"Did they get the ball?"
37:29,000;37:30,240;"- Yeah, in that two minute."
37:30,240;37:32,480;"So, yeah, so after the pun return,"
37:32,480;37:34,560;"the Browns like drove straight down the field"
37:34,560;37:36,200;"in like three plays."
37:36,200;37:41,200;"And then, but then Tim couch threw a pick to Terrell Buckley"
37:41,200;37:44,240;"and then the Pats, they had the ball"
37:44,240;37:49,520;"their own like 20 or 30. And with like, I'm just over a minute left, but they actually"
37:49,520;37:53,520;"drove down the field instead of, and the common, the commentators actually made some"
37:53,520;37:57,600;"comments about how it was a whole different philosophy because Patriots in the past would"
37:57,600;38:01,240;"have just like taken a knee and gone to halftime. The Patriots actually drove down the field."
38:01,240;38:04,680;"Now I'm been a Terry kick the field goal with like a couple seconds left. So now they're"
38:04,680;38:08,920;"up 10 points going into into the half or 20 to 10."
38:08,920;38:12,920;"It's actually a lot of the Super Bowl too."
38:12,920;38:13,920;"That's what I was thinking."
38:13,920;38:15,920;"It's definitely foreshadowing that Greg."
38:15,920;38:17,920;"It's a minute 17."
38:17,920;38:19,920;"They have it on their own 30."
38:19,920;38:20,920;"Yup."
38:20,920;38:23,920;"And the situational football baby."
38:23,920;38:25,920;"Please don't anywhere."
38:25,920;38:26,920;"And then."
38:26,920;38:28,920;"They have a big pass."
38:28,920;38:30,920;"Troy Brown sets it up."
38:30,920;38:32,920;"And then they kick a few."
38:32,920;38:34,920;"It's almost like the seat."
38:34,920;38:36,920;"It's true."
38:36,920;38:40,680;"And can I dive into that cliche even more?"
38:40,680;38:42,040;"Yeah."
38:42,040;38:47,280;"I'm going to tear you with the best player on that team."
38:47,280;38:49,680;"Obviously you're going to fucking drive down the field."
38:49,680;38:53,280;"No matter how much time is left because you want to put the ball in your best"
38:53,280;38:56,080;"players and the best player in your team's hands."
38:56,080;38:57,760;"And that's not me saying that."
38:57,760;38:59,960;"That's, that's what Bill Belichick."
38:59,960;39:02,280;"Dude, that's what Bill Belichick was saying."
39:02,280;39:03,920;"He was saying Adam."
39:03,920;39:08,920;"He was saying Adam's territory was the best player on that team."
39:08,920;39:11,920;"I swear to God, that is a direct quote."
39:11,920;39:13,920;"And this isn't from that year."
39:13,920;39:18,920;"I'm talking about years later, Bill Belichick, thinking back to that team."
39:18,920;39:20,920;"He says that direct quote."
39:20,920;39:23,920;"As he's been a Terry was the best player on that team."
39:23,920;39:27,920;"So, which is interesting because he even missed two kicks in this game."
39:27,920;39:28,920;"Yeah."
39:28,920;39:30,920;"Hey, what does that say?"
39:30,920;39:32,920;"It's true."
39:32,920;39:40,560;"And he hasn't been nearly as consistent throughout this season so far as I remember"
39:40,560;39:44,200;"because when you think of Adam Vinotero, you think of him just never ever missing kicks"
39:44,200;39:45,480;"and always making the big ones."
39:45,480;39:53,800;"But this season especially, I thought he hasn't been who I remember him to be."
39:53,800;40:01,400;"I'm pretty sure from this week 14, I don't know if this is not an absolute stat, but"
40:01,400;40:05,240;"It's close from week 14 on, I don't know if Adam,"
40:05,240;40:07,400;"Ben and Terry missed the field goal the rest of the year."
40:07,400;40:09,240;"It might maybe one."
40:09,240;40:10,160;"And this is the year."
40:10,160;40:11,520;"- That sounds familiar, yeah."
40:11,520;40:13,640;"- And this is the year that we went on"
40:13,640;40:14,760;"the one on first Super Bowl."
40:14,760;40:19,360;"I swear to God, maybe it was not as cool as week 14,"
40:19,360;40:22,440;"but I swear to God, he started a week"
40:22,440;40:25,000;"and he didn't miss a field goal the rest of the season."
40:25,000;40:27,080;"And he was the best player on the team."
40:27,080;40:29,040;"- Well, Connor, I'm interested in your take"
40:29,040;40:32,400;"as we talked about this in previous episode before."
40:32,400;40:36,620;"But so you're saying that he got pretty automatic"
40:36,620;40:39,000;"as the season went on, but obviously he was struggling"
40:39,000;40:40,360;"in the early part of the season."
40:40,360;40:41,640;"Same thing with Tom Brady."
40:41,640;40:42,800;"He had his bumps and bruises."
40:42,800;40:43,880;"There were some perfect games."
40:43,880;40:48,080;"And then so far, we've seen some kind of ducks thrown in"
40:48,080;40:48,840;"all that."
40:48,840;40:51,680;"And Bill's philosophy at that time"
40:51,680;40:54,120;"was ride those guys, right?"
40:54,120;40:55,200;"He had faith in them."
40:55,200;40:57,440;"And I think nowadays he would have a little bit of a shorter"
40:57,440;40:59,420;"leash for the same scenario with"
40:59,420;41:01,580;"a gaskowski or like some other guys."
41:01,580;41:04,880;"So what are your thoughts on his like departure of philosophy?"
41:04,880;41:07,820;"Or is it the same philosophy and I'm just reading it?"
41:07,820;41:10,700;"- I think you're right in the middle"
41:10,700;41:13,260;"'cause I don't think the commentary,"
41:13,260;41:15,860;"I think from I think week 14 in 2001,"
41:15,860;41:20,660;"maybe the rest of his career never had"
41:20,660;41:23,420;"as bad of a stretch as Gostaski has."
41:23,420;41:26,300;"I don't know, you remember those games Mike, Andy,"
41:26,300;41:31,060;"Greg, when have you like a kick like a 35 yard field goal?"
41:31,060;41:35,500;"Have you ever during the Venetary era where you ever like, Oh, my God, I'm"
41:35,500;41:35,900;"worried."
41:35,900;41:39,300;"Gastasi has missed the best."
41:39,300;41:42,900;"He has missed those over and over again."
41:42,900;41:48,500;"He's so like, now, then it's Harry had a run where you knew no matter what it"
41:48,500;41:49,420;"was automatic."
41:49,420;41:52,100;"40 to 45 yards."
41:52,100;41:52,780;"It was automatic."
41:52,860;41:59,100;"He hit most of the 50 plus yarders, but 40, 45 yards, you could just like,"
41:59,100;42:01,020;"like, I'm going to go get some more chips and dip."
42:01,020;42:04,860;"Like you knew he was hitting it because Soske, you're like, are we going to lose this game?"
42:04,860;42:09,740;"Because he can't a 40 yard field goal in a dome."
42:09,740;42:11,740;"Like it can be a dome."
42:11,740;42:15,100;"I'm telling you."
42:15,100;42:17,020;"I mean, it's the eye ball test."
42:17,020;42:20,380;"You know what, Mike, Mike, you're also right though, because I bet Bill"
42:20,380;42:22,660;"check philosophy is the exact same."
42:22,660;42:26,180;"But I don't think he ever got to the point within a Terry where he needs to"
42:26,180;42:29,700;"start bringing in these fucking journeyman kickers."
42:29,700;42:31,020;"Like, right."
42:31,020;42:32,820;"You do even for fucking Bill Bellage."
42:32,820;42:33,420;"I have him."
42:33,420;42:37,380;"57 year old Morton Anderson in for a trial because"
42:37,380;42:39,780;"then a Terry was fucking unreliable."
42:39,780;42:40,420;"No."
42:40,420;42:42,700;"That's true."
42:42,700;42:42,980;"Yeah."
42:42,980;42:48,860;"They haven't had kickers in because Goskowski's unreliable because he was a"
42:48,860;42:49,140;"hurt."
42:49,900;42:52,540;"Yeah, but what was he like?"
42:52,540;42:54,060;"I don't know man."
42:54,060;42:56,220;"Was he hurt for three seasons?"
42:56,220;42:58,740;"Yeah, but it's all my territory."
42:58,740;43:00,420;"The military missed an extra point."
43:00,420;43:05,020;"Has been had a career after like week 14, 2001, granted."
43:05,020;43:05,860;"It was from what?"
43:05,860;43:07,420;"20 yards, 25 yards?"
43:07,420;43:10,100;"Yeah, it's not terrible at all."
43:10,100;43:13,900;"He actually has missed some, yes."
43:13,900;43:15,260;"During this one."
43:15,260;43:19,380;"During his during his dominant run with the past?"
43:19,380;43:21,580;"Yes. Which one?"
43:21,580;43:28,220;"Let's see. One, two, he missed three in one, two, three, five years."
43:28,220;43:28,900;"All right."
43:28,900;43:31,340;"Connor from the two-yard line, the short case."
43:31,340;43:36,220;"Guess what his yoga percentage was in 2001?"
43:36,220;43:39,420;"Me and Greg are looking at the same thing."
43:39,420;43:40,180;"No, no, no."
43:40,180;43:43,260;"Ask me what his yoga percentage was in 2004."
43:43,260;43:45,980;"Just answer the question."
43:47,100;43:48,420;"in 2001?"
43:48,420;43:52,180;"Well, the year we're talking about yes, 2001."
43:52,180;43:56,820;"80% car. You kick 80% that year."
43:56,820;43:58,500;"That's not great."
43:58,500;44:00,860;"You're you're a small brain syndrome."
44:00,860;44:03,380;"You only remember the kicks that were big, which"
44:03,380;44:04,980;"happening how many field goals?"
44:04,980;44:06,180;"How many pressure?"
44:06,180;44:08,100;"How many attempts?"
44:08,100;44:09,620;"Eski socks."
44:09,620;44:10,740;"Yeah."
44:10,740;44:13,740;"30 attempts, 30 field goals."
44:13,740;44:14,820;"And you made 24 of them."
44:14,820;44:16,580;"So name a kicker that's kicked."
44:16,580;44:21,580;"attempted over 40 field goals and has had a better percentage."
44:21,580;44:24,420;"No, I want, I want Ben is Harry's best year."
44:24,420;44:28,780;"Not 2001, when he had a rocky start to the year,"
44:28,780;44:30,980;"Andy Mike both brought it up."
44:30,980;44:35,980;"He went on a run after week 14 and was the most reliable"
44:35,980;44:38,500;"person on the team."
44:38,500;44:42,340;"- Okay, you wanna hear the 48 yards in fucking three feet"
44:42,340;44:43,180;"of snow?"
44:43,180;44:45,180;"(laughing)"
44:45,180;44:47,620;"So, what he said is not clutch."
44:47,620;44:52,620;"83.8% Gustoste 87.4%."
44:52,620;44:54,600;"Yeah."
44:54,600;44:57,020;"Interesting is more accurate, technically."
44:57,020;44:59,780;"More accurate kicker without a doubt."
44:59,780;45:02,340;"Yeah, but to Connor's point though,"
45:02,340;45:05,180;"it's the eyeball test because if you remember,"
45:05,180;45:07,340;"and I hate to bring this up and we'll talk about it later,"
45:07,340;45:09,180;"but perfect season, right?"
45:09,180;45:13,260;"Super Bowl, right before half, right before half,"
45:13,260;45:15,780;"Gus Askey was given an opportunity,"
45:15,780;45:17,380;"or there was an opportunity to kick,"
45:17,380;45:19,820;"Belichick decided to go for some bullshit fourth"
45:19,820;45:22,540;"and 20 or whatever it was instead of going for the kick."
45:22,540;45:24,340;"And it was-- - I'm gonna follow up."
45:24,340;45:25,940;"- Yeah, no, I know, I'm sorry."
45:25,940;45:27,940;"But it's the proof-your-point, Connor."
45:27,940;45:30,020;"Vinitary passed the eyeball test."
45:30,020;45:31,500;"- Well, he was more clutch, right?"
45:31,500;45:33,420;"We're gonna agree on that."
45:33,420;45:34,260;"- I like yelling."
45:34,260;45:35,900;"- All of the numbers."
45:35,900;45:36,740;"- That was fun."
45:36,740;45:40,180;"- Andy, all of the numbers for every statistic"
45:40,180;45:41,500;"are inflated now."
45:41,500;45:44,580;"It is the score point lead."
45:44,580;45:46,880;"Dude, we are talking about 2001."
45:46,880;45:49,240;"Tom Brady has the most--"
45:49,240;45:50,920;"Tom Brady has the most--"
45:50,920;45:53,320;"It's like, dude, Tom Brady in this game--"
45:53,320;45:57,380;"For offense is sure, but how has kicking changed?"
45:57,380;45:58,580;"Shawn, you're an idiot."
45:58,580;46:00,740;"If anything, they're lower, because they move back"
46:00,740;46:01,660;"the extra points."
46:01,660;46:02,020;"Kicking--"
46:02,020;46:03,020;"Exactly."
46:03,020;46:07,820;"It hasn't changed outside of the extra point rule ever."
46:07,820;46:09,300;"And you know who has the--"
46:09,300;46:12,580;"record for most consecutive extra points kicked in a row."
46:12,580;46:16,660;"Yeah, I was counting like 570 something."
46:16,660;46:23,700;"Yeah. So what was his rookie year 2007? Not a bad time."
46:23,700;46:28,180;"2006. 2006. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We're not talking about"
46:28,180;46:30,500;"totals here. We're talking about percentages, right? Yeah."
46:30,500;46:35,860;"I got accuracy. So you're telling me of the Tom Brady, Randy Moss,"
46:35,860;46:43,160;"well what left Walker days didn't put the kicker in a better position position to hit field goals then the Tom Brady"
46:43,160;46:45,000;"fucking"
46:45,000;46:47,000;"17 for"
46:47,000;46:47,880;"26"
46:47,880;46:49,880;"No touchdowns"
46:49,880;46:56,080;"200 and 20 yards and a couple of like game-winning drives where Adam Venetari hit the field goal"
46:56,080;46:58,840;"dude"
47:02,320;47:03,160;"- That's a good point."
47:03,160;47:05,560;"You guys are not in this game alone."
47:05,560;47:08,560;"He's right, I can't disagree."
47:08,560;47:11,080;"In this game alone, to be fair,"
47:11,080;47:13,000;"the majority of his kicks that were attempt"
47:13,000;47:14,700;"were around 50 yards."
47:14,700;47:18,600;"- Yeah, but that's, dude, there's no--"
47:18,600;47:21,800;"- Tom Brady, Tom Brady,"
47:21,800;47:24,480;"threw 50 touchdowns in 2007."
47:24,480;47:27,040;"I don't know how many touchdowns total,"
47:27,040;47:29,760;"you gotta add in fucking rushing touchdowns,"
47:29,760;47:31,280;"defensive touchdowns,"
47:31,280;47:32,800;"special to use touchdowns."
47:32,800;47:39,200;"Dude, Tom Brady was in the fucking red zone all game long."
47:39,200;47:41,960;"Gostowski had the easiest job in the game."
47:41,960;47:42,800;"I'm telling you,"
47:42,800;47:50,040;"Venetary with early pre ACL injury, Tom Brady was kicking 40 plus"
47:50,040;47:51,680;"field goals all day long."
47:51,680;47:56,200;"Gostowski was in like the 30 35 range with the occasional 40 in"
47:56,200;47:57,720;"like the ever."
47:59,040;48:01,040;"You know"
48:01,040;48:06,120;"Right I don't need data"
48:06,120;48:10,160;"I've been watching the past since 1996"
48:10,160;48:16,280;"You were a fucking you were a fucking twinkle in your dad's eye in 1996"
48:16,280;48:18,600;"I've been watching the Patriots since 19"
48:18,600;48:20,600;"You're the same age"
48:24,240;48:38,240;"I'm a year older, but I'm a year older, but I know like his cognitive ability like he probably didn't start to really get the enjoyment of the Patriots until the year after that, which is why I always have to."
48:38,240;48:40,240;"Hello, welcome to the NAB."
48:40,240;48:46,240;"I'm more I'm interested in the twinkle in your dad's eye if you'd like to talk about that for a little bit."
48:48,240;48:51,120;"Or, or perhaps we go back to the Browns here."
48:51,120;48:55,320;"Because I know people are fascinated by our kicker talk."
48:55,320;48:57,840;"I'm going to figure out the numbers on that."
48:57,840;48:58,920;"All right."
48:58,920;49:01,520;"Before back next week, unless I'm wrong, then I won't."
49:01,520;49:08,240;"I mean, game wise, I will say this is a weird one because it felt like both teams"
49:08,240;49:09,680;"were kind of just mucking around."
49:09,680;49:13,280;"You know, Brady had his mistakes."
49:13,280;49:17,240;"Nothing was really like solid, especially in the first half."
49:17,800;49:25,000;"But they they somehow made it work anyway, but it throughout the game no matter how you know one side sucked or another"
49:25,000;49:30,320;"It was pretty close to the end which was surprising to me because it was so sloppy"
49:30,320;49:34,240;"Yeah, and they were talking about how the"
49:34,240;49:41,280;"The the Browns were like plus eight on the season in terms of turnovers like turnover ratio"
49:42,280;49:44,280;"I'm like, how are you going to leave?"
49:44,280;49:47,780;"People forget, dude, Earl Little was a stud."
49:47,780;49:50,840;"Earl Little was a study with a safety for the Browns."
49:50,840;49:55,800;"Gerard Warren in his brown days was a menace on defense."
49:55,800;49:57,760;"Like they're."
49:57,760;50:01,320;"I mean, they had a good deep."
50:01,320;50:02,520;"They had a good defense."
50:02,520;50:03,280;"There's some names."
50:03,280;50:05,800;"Dude, it's crazy."
50:05,800;50:11,760;"I think they showed which makes that number even crazier is that in the previous"
50:11,760;50:15,880;"two games before this, the Browns had lost eight fumbles in those two games."
50:15,880;50:20,600;"Holy shit. Yeah. So that's a minus eight and they're already and they're still a plus eight on top of that."
50:20,600;50:26,440;"Dude, it's crazy though. They set up to this point up to this week that 25 interceptions and 31 overall takeaways."
50:26,440;50:32,960;"That sounds like a shit tongue. Yeah. That's like one of those defenses that you expect to see at the top of the league that people talk about."
50:32,960;50:40,800;"But because their offense was so bad and they'd still won six games and you know, the commentators again kept coming back."
50:40,800;50:44,920;"was like, this is how the Browns win games is their defense keeps them in it."
50:44,920;50:49,520;"And they were talking about the Cleveland Browns, men don't break defense, which"
50:49,520;50:50,680;"I thought was hilarious."
50:50,680;50:56,440;"But and then hopefully the somebody will make a play at some point, which, I mean,"
50:56,440;51:00,920;"the Browns, the defense did they scored the only touchdown."
51:00,920;51:03,200;"Yeah, they, they, the Browns defense school."
51:03,200;51:03,920;"It was in a pack."
51:03,920;51:06,960;"Was it a pick six or a fumble?"
51:06,960;51:10,080;"You know, I think it was a pick six that was, uh, yeah, it was Brady's"
51:10,080;51:14,720;"Brady's first pass was a, it was a pick six. It was a lob. Yeah."
51:14,720;51:20,280;"It wasn't great. No, you know, what Cory. And I agree with you, Andy."
51:20,280;51:24,800;"And then I think about some of those past defenses and I was a big"
51:24,800;51:30,440;"Ben don't break. I was always like, when people were like, the past"
51:30,440;51:35,000;"defense is so bad. They're 30 seconds in the league. And I was like a big"
51:35,000;51:37,040;"Ben don't break defense guys."
51:37,040;51:38,420;"like yards versus points."
51:38,420;51:39,340;"I was the same."
51:39,340;51:39,860;"Yeah."
51:39,860;51:42,140;"The pastor putting up 50 points a game."
51:42,140;51:53,340;"Obviously these offenses are going to accumulate some yards and maybe score a point out to a point or two because they're they now have to throw 50 times a game to even try and keep up."
51:53,340;51:56,060;"And I was like, I was right or die on the bend."
51:56,060;51:56,980;"Don't break the offense."
51:56,980;51:57,700;"So watch it."
51:57,700;51:58,380;"Oh, yeah."
51:58,380;52:04,940;"I think most most of us were just funny just to listen to these guys talking about that from the Cleveland Brown standpoint."
52:04,940;52:06,020;"It was brutal."
52:06,020;52:08,260;"to watch though. Yeah."
52:08,260;52:13,060;"Recently, like I remember the first year, it didn't feel like that was when they got"
52:13,060;52:16,900;"a week and you're like, all right, now they're playing aggressive."
52:16,900;52:22,420;"Yeah. It was like so refreshing to like watch a defense like make place."
52:22,420;52:25,860;"Yeah, kind of like this, this defense has been doing all year."
52:25,860;52:32,260;"Yeah. This is because of one defense. Yeah. But just the level of violence that I thought this"
52:32,260;52:40,860;"defense brought. It's kind of shocked me compared to because we're used to these like all of these Steve"
52:40,860;52:46,660;"Browns up before to where every play you look like that's that's probably a penalty this nowadays like"
52:46,660;52:52,300;"ever every is it though because I was looking at that man there like one of the best hits I've ever"
52:52,300;52:58,580;"seen was on Tim couch delivered by Bruce G like knocked his head off and that was legal man 100% and"
52:59,140;53:04,160;"a lot of these hits, man. It was like, you know, shoulder pads. They were just, I don't"
53:04,160;53:06,120;"know if they were big or more aggressive."
53:06,120;53:08,000;"Hey, no idea."
53:08,000;53:13,000;"It's, I think a lot of it is the defense of the pencils receiver stuff now. That was not"
53:13,000;53:18,600;"a thing back then. And that's true. And I, I was a lot of that in this game."
53:18,600;53:25,080;"I completely agree with Mike Nello though. I think back then, because it was way more"
53:25,080;53:31,720;"violent, you had to play smarter and you had like, there was more, I don't know how to explain it,"
53:31,720;53:37,960;"there was more shoulder to shoulder tackles back then when it was more like the violence was actually"
53:37,960;53:42,840;"more. I don't know, I feel like these people, the defenders especially are so afraid to play"
53:42,840;53:47,960;"defense because everything is a penalty now. They don't know what to do. So really, they're just trying"
53:47,960;53:52,280;"to like knock the guys head off and just hope they stop them dead in the speed because they don't"
53:52,280;53:58,680;"know what's legal and what's not anymore. That's defense has been been getting screwed probably since"
53:58,680;54:04,280;"the 07 Brady Moss when they were like, all right, it's all about offense, fuck the defense."
54:04,280;54:07,480;"It's obviously a 04 when the"
54:07,480;54:12,280;"Hey, man, it's yeah, the calls got the rules changed. Yeah, that was a big end of defense."
54:12,280;54:19,640;"So that's so that's when it was 04. Yeah. Okay. I said, I said 07 because I thought we did it"
54:19,640;54:21,240;"better than they did, which we did."
54:21,240;54:24,160;"But well, I think that was Bella"
54:24,160;54:26,840;"Chex way of being like, hey, fuck you, you want to change the rules?"
54:26,840;54:29,280;"OK, I'll exploit that one instead."
54:29,280;54:30,280;"And that's exactly what he did."
54:30,280;54:31,600;"I agreed. All right."
54:31,600;54:32,520;"Anybody else get any"
54:32,520;54:35,480;"not on this game?"
54:35,480;54:37,120;"Greg, you will bring up the score."
54:37,120;54:38,520;"Oh, yeah."
54:38,520;54:40,840;"I haven't mentioned the final score in any of these games."
54:40,840;54:41,640;"I don't think yet."
54:41,640;54:43,200;"Twenty seven, sixteen."
54:43,200;54:46,000;"There it is."
54:46,000;54:46,960;"All right."
54:46,960;54:47,800;"Good job, stack guy."
54:49,040;54:52,040;"Um, I will say though, man, like, like I said, like the, the"
54:52,040;54:57,000;"paths were, were comfortable for a while, but Brady was just off now to, to his"
54:57,000;54:59,000;"credit, to his credit."
54:59,000;55:03,260;"I mean, he had the composure to like, just keep going and he didn't fall apart."
55:03,260;55:07,520;"You know, but, um, there was no manning face on Brady's face."
55:07,520;55:09,240;"And this doesn't get rattled."
55:09,240;55:12,920;"Like you'll throw a pick and you'll come back and they're, they're, they're"
55:12,920;55:16,320;"pointing it out that that, um, like who's the offense coordinator?"
55:16,320;55:19,440;"Charlie Weiss would come out in the next three plays."
55:19,440;55:21,800;"We'd be just like, I'd chuck it, but not even just like short passes."
55:21,800;55:23,880;"Like, all right, I want you to chuck it down field 20."
55:23,880;55:29,520;"And it's like, they just seem to have full confidence in him actually doing what he"
55:29,520;55:30,160;"needed to do."
55:30,160;55:32,880;"Did, but it was crazy because it was 20 to 10."
55:32,880;55:37,520;"And this is one of the worst interceptions I've ever seen Brady throw."
55:37,520;55:41,200;"And you might have been giving, you might have been getting like"
55:41,200;55:43,240;"Bolezzo tips a little bit too much during game."
55:44,480;55:52,640;"Brady basically launches a ball as he's falling forward and both of his legs are almost off the ground being like grabbed by like some defender."
55:52,640;55:54,520;"So he throws this nasty pick."
55:54,520;56:00,040;"They end up that leads eventually to a Browns field going. It's 20 to 13 just like that."
56:00,040;56:00,760;"Yeah."
56:00,760;56:04,560;"By the way, Mike, that exact play."
56:04,560;56:07,440;"It was third and long."
56:07,440;56:11,800;"And did you see Tom Brady's quote in the paper the day after?"
56:11,800;56:13,840;"It's something you never hear."
56:14,040;56:19,440;"You'd never hear him. Well, luckily, and be uploads all the newspapers."
56:19,440;56:21,080;"Like I"
56:21,080;56:22,680;"guess he does. Like a"
56:22,680;56:28,000;"god, yeah, you can say you are you are a psycho path, dude."
56:28,000;56:33,200;"What you don't know is actually print these off and I have them up on my"
56:33,200;56:35,720;"wall in my bedroom with the with all the pins connecting it."
56:35,720;56:38,360;"I believe this."
56:39,280;56:44,320;"And it looks like it looks like the wall of like the war room and then the CIA."
56:44,320;56:46,960;"There's like all these strings with fucking taps."
56:46,960;56:47,760;"Yeah, exactly."
56:47,760;56:49,520;"One other good thing."
56:49,520;56:50,880;"That's it."
56:50,880;56:55,280;"But Tom Brady in the paper goes, sometimes I need to stay in there and take more hits."
56:55,280;57:00,480;"And this is like, he's talking about it's third and long."
57:00,480;57:05,600;"He's like, it's better basically to get hit and take a sack than do what I did on that play,"
57:05,600;57:08,880;"which is that was the horrible interception you're talking about."
57:08,880;57:17,480;"So could you imagine post ACL care Tom Brady when he changed his whole mindset on like"
57:17,480;57:22,160;"health and what what's important obviously it's a liability."
57:22,160;57:25,320;"Well, it's it's a liability."
57:25,320;57:28,920;"I have obviously it's all about liability."
57:28,920;57:33,480;"But he's like, I need to say I need to stay in there and take more hits."
57:33,480;57:40,800;"That's just not something you would ever hear post 2007 Tom Brady ever say and just kind"
57:40,800;57:46,120;"of speaks to how different his mindset was and honestly how different the game was."
57:46,120;57:52,520;"The game has changed so much like the quarterbacks don't get hit the way Tom Brady got hit back"
57:52,520;57:54,680;"then and he's fucking tough as nails."
57:54,680;58:00,400;"He's one of the toughest ever and I'm done talking to the last little podcast but I"
58:00,400;58:01,840;"(laughing)"
58:01,840;58:04,240;"- No, that makes sense."
58:04,240;58:05,280;"I mean, it is funny."
58:05,280;58:08,160;"I like, I'm a brand Jones and Gus Johnson guy."
58:08,160;58:11,160;"I mean, we talk about these amounts pretty frequently."
58:11,160;58:14,160;"And, you know, I don't think there's a football,"
58:14,160;58:15,600;"or not football this week, guys."
58:15,600;58:16,840;"I think I got most of it."
58:16,840;58:17,680;"But,"
58:17,680;58:20,280;"but,"
58:20,280;58:22,320;"Jones goes,"
58:22,320;58:24,080;"what do you say?"
58:24,080;58:26,360;"Oh, he said a player's name wrong."
58:26,360;58:27,200;"And then he was like,"
58:27,200;58:29,760;"""Ah, I'm so sorry, it's actually this."""
58:29,760;58:31,920;"Um, and he goes, I'm, I'm, I'm"
58:31,920;58:33,840;"hard getting back to my playing days."
58:33,840;58:36,720;"And then Gus Johnson is like, ha,"
58:36,720;58:39,160;"six concussions, I understand."
58:39,160;58:42,120;"And then Red Jones is like, what was your name again?"
58:42,120;58:42,920;"And then Gus Johnson."
58:42,920;58:45,800;"So like they're openly laughing about"
58:45,800;58:46,640;"concussions back then."
58:46,640;58:49,560;"About the fact that he was six concussions."
58:49,560;58:50,160;"Right."
58:50,160;58:51,640;"Definitely a different time."
58:51,640;58:55,040;"She, she, I don't think, I don't think even"
58:55,040;58:59,400;"think that afternoon was even a thing."
58:59,400;59:00,400;"No, not."
59:00,400;59:01,400;"Yeah."
59:01,400;59:02,400;"Yeah."
59:02,400;59:03,400;"Yeah."
59:03,400;59:06,320;"I mean, we've talked about the talked about True Blood."
59:06,320;59:11,340;"So and how like when he got hit against the Jets the first time and they're talking"
59:11,340;59:16,520;"to the team trainer who was literally standing right there when he saw it happen."
59:16,520;59:19,080;"And he's like, Oh, I checked him out for concussion, but he seemed fine."
59:19,080;59:20,240;"So we put him back in the game."
59:20,240;59:23,680;"And then like the day after all the players were like, yeah, he didn't actually know what"
59:23,680;59:24,880;"play he was calling."
59:24,880;59:27,280;"So we told him we should go to here."
59:27,280;59:29,880;"So we like the players actually said back off the field"
59:29,880;59:31,640;"'cause he was so bad."
59:31,640;59:33,920;"Okay, I'm glad you were involved in it back then."
59:33,920;59:34,760;"Yeah."
59:34,760;59:38,040;"- Also, by the way, the announcer"
59:38,040;59:40,320;"started talking about how the night before"
59:40,320;59:44,200;"they had dinner in craft and craft paid for everything."
59:44,200;59:46,000;"And I was just wondering what else he paid for."
59:46,000;59:46,840;"Oh!"
59:46,840;59:48,360;"(laughing)"
59:48,360;59:49,200;"No?"
59:49,200;59:50,800;"- Oh, see that's all right."
59:50,800;59:51,700;"- I thought you were gonna go with that."
59:51,700;59:53,740;"I thought we were gonna go with,"
59:53,740;59:56,320;"it's a slight take on your football, not football."
59:56,320;59:59,400;"It's a Hall of Famer, not Hall of Famer."
59:59,400;01:00:00,760;"- Ooh."
01:00:00,760;01:00:02,840;"- Yes, Brent Jones."
01:00:02,840;01:00:05,400;"Did you guess this? - I know, I did, yes sir."
01:00:05,400;01:00:07,280;"- He was, they were congratulating him"
01:00:07,280;01:00:08,920;"'cause he was inducted into the Hall of Fame"
01:00:08,920;01:00:11,840;"and I thought you gotta be fucking kidding me, not another one."
01:00:11,840;01:00:15,400;"But it was actually the Division II Hall of Fame"
01:00:15,400;01:00:20,480;"and they showed a clip of his speech"
01:00:20,480;01:00:23,160;"and it sounded a little CTE."
01:00:23,160;01:00:24,520;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:00:24,520;01:00:30,360;"his big joke was the fact that obviously the division two guys are smarter because you know what"
01:00:30,360;01:00:34,920;"we've got the playoffs and that was his bring down house moment."
01:00:34,920;01:00:44,840;"Do you think people didn't know that Drew Bludso was concussed is because he was basically just a"
01:00:44,840;01:00:53,400;"traffic arm a traffic cone with arms even when he was I he was literally a big fan of Drew Bludso."
01:00:53,400;01:00:55,400;"No one loves a guy."
01:00:55,400;01:00:58,400;"Hey, boys."
01:00:58,400;01:01:01,400;"I'm 33 years old."
01:01:01,400;01:01:06,400;"The peak of my fandom might have been during the Jew bloods of days."
01:01:06,400;01:01:13,400;"I'm just saying he was a traffic cone with a right arm from his rookie year."
01:01:13,400;01:01:16,400;"That guy could not get out of the way."
01:01:16,400;01:01:25,160;"I mean, he probably had the worst like pocket aware, but he was one of those guys."
01:01:25,160;01:01:26,720;"His arm was so good."
01:01:26,720;01:01:28,920;"He thought he could make any throw on the field."
01:01:28,920;01:01:35,400;"I swear to God, he was so, I mean, I was going to say a worst screen pass."
01:01:35,400;01:01:38,000;"He's going to be rifling that in regards."
01:01:38,000;01:01:40,760;"Yeah, he's like, what is a screen pass?"
01:01:40,760;01:01:42,120;"Like you know what I do."
01:01:42,120;01:01:45,480;"I fucking throw rockets all over the field."
01:01:45,480;01:01:50,120;"It's like, what's this nice touch pass you're talking about?"
01:01:50,120;01:01:51,120;"No, fuck that."
01:01:51,120;01:01:52,320;"Gun it in there."
01:01:52,320;01:01:53,320;"Amazing."
01:01:53,320;01:01:54,320;"Greg?"
01:01:54,320;01:01:55,320;"All right."
01:01:55,320;01:01:58,320;"It's Greg Brown, can I?"
01:01:58,320;01:01:59,320;"No, I'm here."
01:01:59,320;01:02:00,320;"He's here."
01:02:00,320;01:02:01,320;"It's probably statu--"
01:02:01,320;01:02:03,320;"You're just listening to this--"
01:02:03,320;01:02:10,320;"What is your role on this podcast if you won't speak for 15 minutes, Greg?"
01:02:10,320;01:02:16,640;"Here, well, when you run your mouth for 15, it's kind of hard to get a word in."
01:02:16,640;01:02:24,040;"I took a lot of notes."
01:02:24,040;01:02:26,520;"Well, Greg, you're doing a fine job with the stats."
01:02:26,520;01:02:28,680;"I really like what you're bringing in here."
01:02:28,680;01:02:31,160;"And also, Greg, your brother is against you."
01:02:31,160;01:02:36,280;"I told them when you guys were talking about Tom Brady's looks and Greg cut in and said,"
01:02:36,280;01:02:37,280;"""Would you bang him?"""
01:02:37,280;01:02:41,560;"laugh out loud funny and the fact that Andy didn't cut that up and put that on"
01:02:41,560;01:02:49,360;"social media lets me know that he doesn't want you your career to take off so it's"
01:02:49,360;01:02:54,760;"not on me Greg you need to talk to Andy I'm here for a love of the game you know"
01:02:54,760;01:03:02,880;"I'm not here right the city the likes the shares all right speaking of banging"
01:03:02,880;01:03:04,680;"and all that other stuff."
01:03:04,680;01:03:07,960;"Let's try out a football, not football,"
01:03:07,960;01:03:10,520;"quickly on Conner and see what he thinks."
01:03:10,520;01:03:12,640;"So these things have popped up week to week"
01:03:12,640;01:03:14,320;"because I just don't understand football"
01:03:14,320;01:03:15,760;"and Andy is smarter than I am,"
01:03:15,760;01:03:18,080;"and Greg is smarter than I am, and Steve perhaps."
01:03:18,080;01:03:21,680;"So I like to rely on them to give me a little knowledge."
01:03:21,680;01:03:24,360;"So, Brent Jones did say, and I quote,"
01:03:24,360;01:03:29,360;"""San Diego has two hands on it and just couldn't hold on."""
01:03:29,360;01:03:32,680;"San Diego had two hands on it and just couldn't hold on."
01:03:32,680;01:03:39,000;"What does that mean is that football or not football? I don't know. Yeah, two hands on it and just couldn't hold on"
01:03:39,000;01:03:46,440;"Yeah, I've read Joe's are saying that"
01:03:46,440;01:03:52,120;"When my sister is this are you just like a day in sports and around the same time as week 13"
01:03:52,120;01:03:55,720;"This is during the game"
01:03:55,720;01:04:01,320;"Two hands on it and I'm kind of hazy on what that it is and you just couldn't hold on"
01:04:01,640;01:04:08,800;"So I think it might be is he had two hands on the marijuana that he was arrested for"
01:04:08,800;01:04:12,000;"When was that in the paper there was a"
01:04:12,000;01:04:19,320;"Okay, are you guys fucking it?"
01:04:19,320;01:04:23,840;"We're not talking about the Browns O linemen Greg"
01:04:23,840;01:04:28,000;"All right, Andy cuz what you're saying is the Browns O linemen"
01:04:28,480;01:04:33,200;"Greg Robinson just got arrested with like a hundred seventy pounds of weed and now you're talking"
01:04:33,200;01:04:41,840;"There's no"
01:04:41,840;01:04:55,000;"I would I would actually clarify if Kona would shut the fuck up wait OJ Simpson is a different player guys"
01:04:56,160;01:05:01,720;"So in the in the Boston Globe there was this tiny little little blurb"
01:05:01,720;01:05:04,820;"They caught my eye said warrant out for Santiago"
01:05:04,820;01:05:09,860;"A warrant was issued in Pittsburgh for the arrest of Cleveland Browns tied in OJ Santiago"
01:05:09,860;01:05:16,300;"Marijuana possession the Cleveland Clean Deal reported yesterday according to the paper the war is connected to November 20th"
01:05:16,300;01:05:22,160;"The arrest of defensive tackle Gerard Warren who faces a charge of carrying unlicensed firearm in his car during a search"
01:05:22,160;01:05:25,760;"Police found marijuana, which they now believe belongs Santiago"
01:05:25,760;01:05:33,560;"So the fact that sense yagl was actually a lot to play in this game surprised me, but so my guess is"
01:05:33,560;01:05:38,820;"Talking about the fact that he was trying to hide his his marijuana"
01:05:38,820;01:05:43,840;"And so trying to get both hands on it, but obviously couldn't which is why he wore it out for his arrest"
01:05:43,840;01:05:54,340;"Brent Jones was trying to be clever and like that old fucking corny dad like corny joke away. Yes and"
01:05:55,160;01:05:58,900;"Jerod Warren you've seen his hair and I'm not stereotyping"
01:05:58,900;01:06:05,440;"Obviously he's smoke sweet. He looked like he looks like Afro man. You ever heard his song? Oh"
01:06:05,440;01:06:12,460;"All right, Andy edit this out all right"
01:06:12,460;01:06:19,700;"Because I'm not staring at everybody looks like Afro man"
01:06:20,920;01:06:29,320;"Well, you know, it's not even but it's not even they actually they actually look alike Greg that wasn't just a broad"
01:06:29,320;01:06:32,920;"Please"
01:06:32,920;01:06:37,920;"Look up a picture"
01:06:37,920;01:06:44,120;"And I'll say while he's looking"
01:06:45,920;01:06:52,960;"said it looks like Vince Wilfork when he checked what you that is wow he looks"
01:06:52,960;01:06:57,680;"exactly like Vince Wilfork when he has his head shape that's right yes he does I"
01:06:57,680;01:07:03,920;"am glad I'm obviously looking at pictures now look up after a man"
01:07:03,920;01:07:11,800;"it was not happening I just want to say yes Rachel's also said and I know this"
01:07:11,800;01:07:15,080;"This is early 2000s and I don't know why he went this way."
01:07:15,080;01:07:20,120;"It was during a kick return, but he was like, oh, this is gay at the five."
01:07:20,120;01:07:21,920;"And then he's taken down at the 33 yard line."
01:07:21,920;01:07:25,440;"I don't know why he was saying that, but I don't know."
01:07:25,440;01:07:27,800;"Oh, that one I do know."
01:07:27,800;01:07:28,800;"What is it?"
01:07:28,800;01:07:32,360;"Because a kick returner and you can't make this up."
01:07:32,360;01:07:33,240;"His name was Ben Gay."
01:07:33,240;01:07:38,000;"I don't know if he was named after the, um, wasn't that like the"
01:07:38,000;01:07:38,840;"IZ hot stuff?"
01:07:38,840;01:07:39,840;"You know,"
01:07:39,840;01:07:40,840;"Oh,"
01:07:41,400;01:07:42,240;"Are you serious?"
01:07:42,240;01:07:43,720;"So that was football."
01:07:43,720;01:07:44,800;"Yeah."
01:07:44,800;01:07:47,360;"Uh, my point is to all brandyans."
01:07:47,360;01:07:47,960;"Yeah."
01:07:47,960;01:07:51,240;"But, uh, you know, the, the, the topical pain relief product, Ben"
01:07:51,240;01:07:56,320;"Gay, which I remember because, uh, in soccer, in high school,"
01:07:56,320;01:07:58,760;"everybody used to rub it in other people's underwear and shit."
01:07:58,760;01:08:00,920;"So they're what the fuck are you?"
01:08:00,920;01:08:03,600;"That's all I know."
01:08:03,600;01:08:04,440;"Never happened to me."
01:08:04,440;01:08:06,120;"I guess people thought I was to do it."
01:08:06,120;01:08:07,200;"Do it to anybody?"
01:08:07,200;01:08:09,520;"No, I, I couldn't afford Ben Gay."
01:08:09,520;01:08:11,740;"Did you ever watch somebody do it to anybody?"
01:08:11,740;01:08:13,720;"I'm going to go home later and go to yourself."
01:08:13,720;01:08:16,800;"Answer the question."
01:08:16,800;01:08:20,800;"I played the fifth."
01:08:20,800;01:08:25,200;"You know, his name is literally Ben Gay running back."
01:08:25,200;01:08:26,080;"Wow."
01:08:26,080;01:08:26,560;"All right."
01:08:26,560;01:08:28,160;"Well, then I take it back, Brent Jones."
01:08:28,160;01:08:30,960;"You want to hear a funny story about people with the last name, gay?"
01:08:30,960;01:08:36,720;"Is just going, Greg, you and H, we're like, I'd be cutting this out too."
01:08:37,320;01:08:42,720;"went to a game on the soccer team and like, they wouldn't get many fans, but one game."
01:08:42,720;01:08:44,120;"I don't know where it was."
01:08:44,120;01:08:47,360;"They must have got a hold of like the rosters as they were walking in."
01:08:47,360;01:08:48,720;"Oh boy."
01:08:48,720;01:08:53,640;"15 kids as a kid on my team, they packed gay and they just showed up and they were like,"
01:08:53,640;01:08:55,440;"where is gay?"
01:08:55,440;01:08:59,800;"Well, 170 pounds a day."
01:08:59,800;01:09:04,240;"I don't like this is I don't condone any of this."
01:09:04,240;01:09:05,680;"Oh, it's so funny."
01:09:05,680;01:09:06,440;"This is just."
01:09:06,440;01:09:07,700;"And so this was your TV."
01:09:07,700;01:09:08,700;"- I'm appalled by this."
01:09:08,700;01:09:10,280;"- Yes, it did."
01:09:10,280;01:09:11,160;"- How did he think?"
01:09:11,160;01:09:12,760;"How did he feel about all this?"
01:09:12,760;01:09:15,600;"- Dude, he didn't acknowledge it at all."
01:09:15,600;01:09:17,480;"- I mean, at that point, like,"
01:09:17,480;01:09:18,640;"when you get to college, right?"
01:09:18,640;01:09:20,480;"I'm sure you've heard all of that."
01:09:20,480;01:09:21,600;"- Oh yeah, oh yeah."
01:09:21,600;01:09:23,240;"He thought it was fun."
01:09:23,240;01:09:24,400;"- Yeah, of course, yeah."
01:09:24,400;01:09:30,880;"- That's not, no, that's not good."
01:09:30,880;01:09:32,240;"Kegreg, that's..."
01:09:32,240;01:09:35,760;"- Well, it's not gonna be a game."
01:09:35,760;01:09:38,600;"I'm definitely not as I'm sorry."
01:09:38,600;01:09:39,680;"You have to listen to this connor."
01:09:39,680;01:09:40,680;"This is a shame."
01:09:40,680;01:09:46,600;"Well, no, it's not as creative as the stuff Gregy would say during his"
01:09:46,600;01:09:51,240;"I guess fandom, if you will."
01:09:51,240;01:09:52,000;"Yeah."
01:09:52,000;01:09:54,640;"I thought we went to a little spinners game."
01:09:54,640;01:10:01,040;"Honestly, brothers and dad and it was so the the heckling was so bad that"
01:10:01,040;01:10:03,440;"dad left us and and just drove home."
01:10:03,440;01:10:04,440;"We had to find our own way home."
01:10:05,560;01:10:06,760;"What did you say Greg?"
01:10:06,760;01:10:08,680;"And I'm I'm bracing myself."
01:10:08,680;01:10:11,840;"Well, he tried to he tried to fight the the mascot at one point."
01:10:11,840;01:10:13,480;"I think that was dad's tipping point."
01:10:13,480;01:10:15,120;"He was heckling the mascot."
01:10:15,120;01:10:17,400;"Oh, it's not that once I started drinking."
01:10:17,400;01:10:18,840;"I got that."
01:10:18,840;01:10:21,960;"How old for you Greg?"
01:10:21,960;01:10:27,080;"Greg loves to start the fight and he's not one to finish the fight."
01:10:27,080;01:10:28,080;"I've noticed that about."
01:10:28,080;01:10:31,920;"Oh, shots fired there, Greg."
01:10:31,920;01:10:33,920;"No, that's a brown thing right there."
01:10:33,920;01:10:43,000;"CC any buffalo trip we've been on he's got the biggest mouth in the entire group. He's got a anatomically"
01:10:43,000;01:10:50,560;"correct size blow up of Tom Brady's dick strapped around his legs and he's walking around Buffalo"
01:10:50,560;01:10:53,120;"telling people"
01:10:53,120;01:10:55,680;"Tom Brady"
01:10:55,680;01:11:01,960;"Tom Brady this is an anatomically correct size of Tom Brady"
01:11:01,960;01:11:04,560;"(laughing)"
01:11:04,560;01:11:07,520;"Walkin' around Buffalo, and then people get pissed"
01:11:07,520;01:11:09,880;"and guess who steps to the back of the line"
01:11:09,880;01:11:12,280;"doesn't want to be a part of any"
01:11:12,280;01:11:14,600;"of the physical altercation."
01:11:14,600;01:11:16,280;"It's Greg Graff."
01:11:16,280;01:11:17,880;"- Why is there physical altercation over there?"
01:11:17,880;01:11:19,440;"That's just good clean fun right there."
01:11:19,440;01:11:21,600;"- Yeah, we're just having fun, dude."
01:11:21,600;01:11:23,920;"- He's just playing off of his nickname, apparently."
01:11:23,920;01:11:25,040;"- Yeah."
01:11:25,040;01:11:27,800;"- I've had some, I had some beers thrown at me."
01:11:27,800;01:11:29,800;"Like when I was a father at the camp."
01:11:31,200;01:11:37,340;"What was a Tom Brady's nickname again something driftwood driftwood Tommy. Yeah, there you go"
01:11:37,340;01:11:41,540;"There's proof right there my point being Greg is"
01:11:41,540;01:11:46,400;"Yeah, I mean Andy, you know, he's an all-time shit talker"
01:11:46,400;01:11:49,780;"Oh my god. Yeah, it's in the blood"
01:11:49,780;01:11:53,240;"Then the blood Greg I think the Brown family thing"
01:11:53,240;01:11:58,660;"I think you know Greg's definitely got over Steve besides everything"
01:12:00,600;01:12:01,600;"Jesus."
01:12:01,600;01:12:03,600;"Uh, delivery."
01:12:03,600;01:12:07,600;"Greg has a good delivery of his shit talk."
01:12:07,600;01:12:10,600;"Steve, uh, he's witty."
01:12:10,600;01:12:14,000;"Steve, Steve's a bit too aggressive on his, his delivery."
01:12:14,000;01:12:15,000;"I, I think."
01:12:15,000;01:12:21,600;"And I, I also must admit to the, to the, whatever listener out there, um, that Greg"
01:12:21,600;01:12:24,600;"does resemble a little tiny."
01:12:24,600;01:12:26,600;"Don't don't do it."
01:12:26,600;01:12:36,840;"I'll do it. Tom Brady. I know. I know. I know. I know. Never mind. Cut that out."
01:12:36,840;01:12:43,000;"He resembles. He resembles who? Drifwood Tommy. I don't know in that department."
01:12:43,000;01:12:51,240;"But he's going like Greg Brown. He's almost there. We're not talking about like facial"
01:12:51,240;01:12:55,740;"structure, right? Because I mean Tom Brady is infinitely, no,"
01:12:55,740;01:12:59,660;"Greg Brown looks nothing like Tom Brady. No, I retract my"
01:12:59,660;01:13:03,480;"statement and I apologize. I said that I look like Tom Brady"
01:13:03,480;01:13:06,860;"except I'm more athletic and I have a better looking and a"
01:13:06,860;01:13:12,300;"wife. I like that. I can listen to this because that was"
01:13:12,300;01:13:18,800;"pretty good. I just I just choked that. Oh my oh my"
01:13:18,800;01:13:20,240;"Greg."
01:13:20,240;01:13:26,480;"And the better and the better looking wife."
01:13:26,480;01:13:28,880;"Oh, my God."
01:13:28,880;01:13:30,720;"You're out of your fucking butt."
01:13:30,720;01:13:35,840;"Shout out Kelly Brown right there."
01:13:35,840;01:13:38,080;"I mean, yeah, yeah."
01:13:38,080;01:13:38,840;"Yeah."
01:13:38,840;01:13:41,240;"More patient life."
01:13:41,240;01:13:42,240;"That's for sure."
01:13:42,240;01:13:45,560;"I forgot we were on a podcast when Greg said that I"
01:13:46,520;01:13:48,520;"That was a good one."
01:13:48,520;01:13:51,520;"My water bottle and I literally choked on it."
01:13:51,520;01:13:54,520;"It's all fair game."
01:13:54,520;01:13:56,520;"Jesus."
01:13:56,520;01:14:01,520;"Shall we talk about the last big play of the fourth quarter to wrap this up?"
01:14:01,520;01:14:02,520;"Yeah."
01:14:02,520;01:14:08,520;"I think that's what everyone wants to hear is the last big play of the fourth quarter game from 2001."
01:14:08,520;01:14:09,520;"Well, actually, how about we do this?"
01:14:09,520;01:14:10,520;"All right."
01:14:10,520;01:14:14,520;"How about we do best and worse and Mike, you can start with your play."
01:14:14,520;01:14:19,320;"I'm going to have the big play, which is my best and then like a little best."
01:14:19,320;01:14:24,680;"So the the whole I wrote Holy Crap best right."
01:14:24,680;01:14:27,800;"It was with eight minutes left."
01:14:27,800;01:14:30,760;"So it was third down the Patriots."
01:14:30,760;01:14:33,560;"There was a penalty for holding."
01:14:33,560;01:14:39,720;"And at this point they were in their in field goal range and instead of pushing them back"
01:14:39,720;01:14:42,040;"and making them do it again, the Browns declined the penalty."
01:14:42,040;01:14:42,840;"So it's fourth down."
01:14:42,840;01:14:47,640;"They get into a field goal formation."
01:14:47,640;01:14:51,880;"It's a 52 yard attempt and they hike the ball."
01:14:51,880;01:14:53,040;"They catch everybody off guard."
01:14:53,040;01:14:54,600;"Vinitary pooch is it."
01:14:54,600;01:14:56,240;"- Yeah, they snapped directly to Vinitary,"
01:14:56,240;01:14:58,560;"which I thought was an impressive snap."
01:14:58,560;01:14:59,520;"- Yep, I agree."
01:14:59,520;01:15:00,560;"I didn't even know what was going on."
01:15:00,560;01:15:01,960;"I had to play it back like three times."
01:15:01,960;01:15:03,280;"I was like, what just happened?"
01:15:03,280;01:15:06,680;"But yeah, and then it was down by Jermaine Wiggins"
01:15:06,680;01:15:09,280;"with like a crazy athletic play at the one."
01:15:09,280;01:15:13,080;"I feel like that pretty much sealed the deal,"
01:15:13,080;01:15:14,480;"but you guys could."
01:15:14,480;01:15:17,460;"- Yeah, and I think watching Germain Wiggins"
01:15:17,460;01:15:21,400;"hustle 40 yards downfield to tap the ball"
01:15:21,400;01:15:22,600;"from going into the end zone,"
01:15:22,600;01:15:24,500;"like as he's kind of diving for it,"
01:15:24,500;01:15:30,200;"made me realize how unathletic Germain Wiggins was."
01:15:30,200;01:15:33,640;"Or I would love to see him and Vince Wilfork"
01:15:33,640;01:15:35,120;"play one-on-one basketball,"
01:15:35,120;01:15:37,720;"'cause I think Wilfork would fucking toast him."
01:15:37,720;01:15:39,720;"Oh, it wouldn't even move forward."
01:15:39,720;01:15:45,480;"Like I love Wiggy and he's a character"
01:15:45,480;01:15:47,180;"and he's, you know, he makes some big plays"
01:15:47,180;01:15:49,800;"and the snowball and such, but,"
01:15:49,800;01:15:54,200;"and this is a phenomenal play, but not so much."
01:15:54,200;01:15:56,200;"Up and actually, that he used,"
01:15:56,200;01:15:58,760;"like when we were talking before about how big these guys are"
01:15:58,760;01:16:01,880;"and the tight ends were just like actual linemen"
01:16:01,880;01:16:04,120;"who can catch this, basically,"
01:16:04,120;01:16:06,200;"I was thinking of Jermaine Wiggins when I said that."
01:16:07,640;01:16:11,920;"Well, I'll also say, since we were talking about kickers and punters in the past,"
01:16:11,920;01:16:18,200;"so Ken Walter this season, I guess he was averaging almost 40 yards a punt."
01:16:18,200;01:16:19,600;"Not the greatest."
01:16:19,600;01:16:22,720;"So they put it into Vinotary's hands."
01:16:22,720;01:16:25,400;"That's pretty bad."
01:16:25,400;01:16:27,000;"And it was the perfect punt."
01:16:27,000;01:16:28,320;"It was awesome."
01:16:28,320;01:16:31,240;"All right, so that was my best, I guess you could say."
01:16:31,240;01:16:36,600;"And then my other best of the game was a run up the middle by Mark Edwards,"
01:16:36,600;01:16:41,440;"which is not a big deal. But then, oh, sorry, man. But I'll let you take that one."
01:16:41,440;01:16:44,200;"All right. So I'll leave that alone. I'll tackle"
01:16:44,200;01:16:50,360;"our worst. So worst moment of the game. And I hate to shit on these kids. And it's probably"
01:16:50,360;01:16:55,380;"their parents fault. They're patriots fans with face paint. And it looked like the French"
01:16:55,380;01:17:02,000;"flag. So I got a negative for that a for effort, but negative execution. Sorry."
01:17:02,000;01:17:05,360;"Yeah, stuff. Yeah, that's bad parenting with that. Yeah, shit parents."
01:17:05,360;01:17:06,620;"Yeah, not great."
01:17:06,620;01:17:08,120;"Yeah, it's good."
01:17:08,120;01:17:09,500;"He's a nice touchdown."
01:17:09,500;01:17:12,700;"It's probably Brown's fans."
01:17:12,700;01:17:14,660;"French accent."
01:17:14,660;01:17:16,540;"Yeah, this dead on."
01:17:16,540;01:17:17,060;"You nailed it."
01:17:17,060;01:17:17,700;"Or chop."
01:17:17,700;01:17:18,540;"Oh, wow."
01:17:18,540;01:17:19,400;"All right."
01:17:19,400;01:17:22,100;"So I'll go next because Mike tried to see on my thunder."
01:17:22,100;01:17:27,180;"Um, my best was Tom Brady's physicality."
01:17:27,180;01:17:29,940;"And so Mike was starting to allude to it, but there was, yeah,"
01:17:29,940;01:17:35,300;"it was a mark, Mark Edwards full back dive right by the end zone."
01:17:35,300;01:17:37,380;"And, you know, there was a bunch of push and shoving"
01:17:37,380;01:17:40,120;"and somebody like one of the big defensive linemen"
01:17:40,120;01:17:42,380;"charged like pushing him and like bending in half."
01:17:42,380;01:17:44,540;"And so Tom Brady came out of nowhere"
01:17:44,540;01:17:46,780;"and just shoved this massive defensive lineman"
01:17:46,780;01:17:49,260;"who then turned around and realized it's Tom Brady"
01:17:49,260;01:17:51,260;"and started stomping towards him."
01:17:51,260;01:17:54,420;"And I haven't seen Brady move that quickly away"
01:17:54,420;01:17:57,260;"from somebody like even when he has the football."
01:17:57,260;01:18:02,660;"So, but there was that, but it was also the fact"
01:18:02,660;01:18:04,900;"they ran that reverse again that they've been running"
01:18:04,900;01:18:11,580;"with David Patton and Tom Brady was again the lead blocker and he threw a legitimate lead"
01:18:11,580;01:18:14,700;"block on this game. Did you guys catch this one?"
01:18:14,700;01:18:20,380;"Yeah, it might have been like a legal kind of, but it was it was a cup block that was legal."
01:18:20,380;01:18:25,140;"You go with the guy's legs, but I mean, he caught him and it was like, it wasn't even like a"
01:18:25,140;01:18:29,140;"defensive bag. It was like a linebacker. Yeah, it was. It took the guy clean out of the play."
01:18:29,140;01:18:34,820;"And even I think it was Brent Jones was commenting about how it's going to suck to watch that"
01:18:34,820;01:18:38,780;"tape because you never want to get blocked by a quarterback. So Tom Brady. And then I"
01:18:38,780;01:18:44,700;"think you can tack on what Connie was saying about his comments after the game about how"
01:18:44,700;01:18:49,380;"he should take more hits in the pocket. So just psycho psycho Tom Brady is my best in"
01:18:49,380;01:18:50,380;"this game."
01:18:50,380;01:18:51,380;"Mm hmm."
01:18:51,380;01:19:00,460;"See my worst. Well, this game, I don't really have a real worst, but the this game had"
01:19:00,460;01:19:04,020;"some commercials in it. I don't know if you guys skipped them or not."
01:19:04,020;01:19:05,700;"But oh, I want to know."
01:19:05,700;01:19:09,260;"My we did two favorites. Yeah."
01:19:09,260;01:19:15,060;"I had two favorites. One was a commercial for the Palm Pilot."
01:19:15,060;01:19:18,940;"Oh, you remember the Palm Pilot?"
01:19:18,940;01:19:23,380;"So that was fantastic. It was just like top of the line technology."
01:19:23,380;01:19:24,820;"And they were like 300 bucks."
01:19:24,820;01:19:28,700;"And I remember our mom having one of all because I think dad used to work for"
01:19:28,940;01:19:33,740;"palm. So he got some palm pilots for free. And mom used to love her palm pilot."
01:19:33,740;01:19:43,020;"Like the height palm pilots. Yeah, and that flame burnt fast and strong and real quick."
01:19:43,020;01:19:48,940;"It was just like a scheduled calendar. Yeah, it was a digital calendar that didn't connect"
01:19:48,940;01:19:56,860;"with the internet. Yeah. And then the other commercial that I enjoyed was the one for Pepsi Twist."
01:19:56,860;01:20:00,420;"I remember drinking Pepsi twists back then and think I was hot shit."
01:20:00,420;01:20:01,460;"Yeah."
01:20:01,460;01:20:02,940;"I agree."
01:20:02,940;01:20:04,420;"We're gonna surge though."
01:20:04,420;01:20:06,300;"Surge was the best."
01:20:06,300;01:20:08,220;"Yeah, that's what it was called."
01:20:08,220;01:20:09,260;"Yeah."
01:20:09,260;01:20:14,140;"But yeah, because surge they actually came to our school and as school out there,"
01:20:14,140;01:20:16,620;"just giving it away to all of us for free, which I don't do."
01:20:16,620;01:20:17,740;"Probably do anymore."
01:20:17,740;01:20:18,100;"Yeah."
01:20:18,100;01:20:19,340;"What is up with that, dude?"
01:20:19,340;01:20:20,900;"And we got pretty hooked."
01:20:20,900;01:20:21,780;"Yeah, of course."
01:20:21,780;01:20:23,140;"That's the best day."
01:20:23,140;01:20:24,660;"Get him hooked."
01:20:24,660;01:20:25,180;"Yeah."
01:20:25,380;01:20:33,180;"Same thing. Same thing. Pretty weird, man. When I was going to school, like college, I would get like these pick up games."
01:20:33,180;01:20:40,260;"I don't know if you were there for one of these Andy, but there'd be people driving around with like pedaling like Red Bull and giving that shit away for free."
01:20:40,260;01:20:41,260;"Oh, really?"
01:20:41,260;01:20:42,740;"Yeah, I'm like, what is this?"
01:20:42,740;01:20:51,980;"They look like a representative that called just give it free to anybody that could do the sound suspect of someone who could do a deep dive on this."
01:20:54,380;01:20:55,220;"- That's good."
01:20:55,220;01:20:59,580;"All right, Greg, give us your best and worst."
01:20:59,580;01:21:04,580;"- All right, my guess was you've seen that at Browns,"
01:21:04,580;01:21:08,220;"like Jersey where they keep adding on all the quarterbacks."
01:21:08,220;01:21:09,140;"- Yes, yes."
01:21:09,140;01:21:12,140;"- You visiting the whole thing and looking at all the names."
01:21:12,140;01:21:12,980;"- Yes."
01:21:12,980;01:21:14,380;"- It's the best."
01:21:14,380;01:21:16,140;"- Give us a quick rundown."
01:21:16,140;01:21:19,260;"- Okay, we got Couts, Kelly Holcomb's,"
01:21:19,260;01:21:22,860;"I see a friend Dilford Charlie from all"
01:21:22,860;01:21:28,140;"Dolph Anderson, Brady Quinn, Cole McCoy, Brandon Whedon,"
01:21:28,140;01:21:33,780;"Fad Lewis, and Dr. RG3."
01:21:33,780;01:21:37,260;"There's some great names on there."
01:21:37,260;01:21:39,420;"And my worst was going to be that I actually"
01:21:39,420;01:21:44,180;"had a story book in Jersey, which I have no fucking clue"
01:21:44,180;01:21:46,460;"why I had that, but I did."
01:21:46,460;01:21:48,460;"Which is kind of embarrassing."
01:21:48,460;01:21:50,380;"You had a Kelly Holcomb jersey?"
01:21:50,380;01:21:52,460;"- Kelly Holcomb jersey."
01:21:52,460;01:21:53,300;"- I feel like I'm--"
01:21:53,300;01:21:55,700;"- Was it one of those like bargain bin ones"
01:21:55,700;01:21:57,500;"that like Andy's been talking about?"
01:21:57,500;01:21:58,740;"Does that make sense?"
01:21:58,740;01:22:01,340;"- Why would I get a fun Kelly Holcomb baby?"
01:22:01,340;01:22:02,420;"- Yeah, that's insane."
01:22:02,420;01:22:07,420;"- And as the podcast went on, my real worst is Connor's take"
01:22:07,420;01:22:09,540;"on kicking the fingers."
01:22:09,540;01:22:11,940;"(laughing)"
01:22:11,940;01:22:14,420;"I just moved back a little bit."
01:22:14,420;01:22:16,680;"if you look at career."
01:22:16,680;01:22:21,560;"Is there like instruction going on?"
01:22:21,560;01:22:25,620;"Yeah, my worst is Carter doing one of the fuck he's doing in the"
01:22:25,620;01:22:26,300;"bathroom right now."
01:22:26,300;01:22:31,400;"I had my fridge door had been open for too long and it was"
01:22:31,400;01:22:34,460;"alerting me that get out of the fridge."
01:22:34,460;01:22:35,420;"Bad ass."
01:22:35,420;01:22:37,260;"It's making fucking hot pockets over there."
01:22:37,260;01:22:43,700;"I'm making a chicken burrito with salt and birdie."
01:22:43,700;01:22:46,700;"It's green hot sauce."
01:22:46,700;01:22:48,700;"Thank you."
01:22:48,700;01:22:50,700;"Anyways,"
01:22:50,700;01:22:52,700;"I'm glad you're able to show that with it."
01:22:52,700;01:22:56,700;"I'm congratulating Greg for all your staff."
01:22:56,700;01:23:01,700;"I know you were too young to comprehend the games that were"
01:23:01,700;01:23:03,700;"going on in 2001."
01:23:03,700;01:23:08,700;"But Adam Vinotary was automatic and you never had to worry about him."
01:23:08,700;01:23:10,700;"I haven't been able to trust."
01:23:10,700;01:23:18,500;"trust. The numbers don't lie, your brain is not fully"
01:23:18,500;01:23:22,460;"developed. You're like a fucking infant. You just see the"
01:23:22,460;01:23:25,700;"only thing that won. He's gonna get the rest of them."
01:23:25,700;01:23:30,020;"Okay, do you remember?"
01:23:30,020;01:23:33,860;"No, I remember it. Yes, you damn right. It might be do you"
01:23:33,860;01:23:38,340;"remember the games? I never worried about Adam Venetari from"
01:23:38,340;01:23:41,060;"2001 until whenever he left"
01:23:41,060;01:23:48,420;"We see I bet these I bet these old parts remember that too. You could always count on Adam"
01:23:48,420;01:23:49,660;"Ben that Terry"
01:23:49,660;01:23:53,220;"Ben Terry Stephen Gostowski has been missing bunnies"
01:23:53,220;01:23:56,100;"Maybe not even a"
01:23:56,100;01:24:02,580;"Great his percentage is great because we score so often and we're in fucking scoring position all the time"
01:24:05,300;01:24:10,440;"I said better at 50 plus dude. Let's be honest. All right. Let's put this to rest. Let's be honest. Stephen"
01:24:10,440;01:24:20,580;"Gus Kosky was a great until that year in the playoffs against the Broncos where he missed that kick and he's never been the same since. All right, so"
01:24:20,580;01:24:21,560;"prime,"
01:24:21,560;01:24:22,120;"Ben, Terry,"
01:24:22,120;01:24:23,020;"I'm just out."
01:24:23,020;01:24:24,820;"He, who do you got that?"
01:24:24,820;01:24:27,540;"Or is it that you that you got to go?"
01:24:27,540;01:24:30,620;"Have you thought of him the same since?"
01:24:30,620;01:24:33,420;"No, he was not right after that game, man."
01:24:34,100;01:24:37,500;"I mean look at the stats look at the fucking stats"
01:24:37,500;01:24:42,380;"What do you want in their prime answer the"
01:24:42,380;01:24:45,580;"military Gisaski prime. What do you want?"
01:24:45,580;01:24:48,220;"either"
01:24:48,220;01:24:50,220;"Okay, you fucking metal"
01:24:50,220;01:24:55,860;"It doesn't matter. Oh my god"
01:24:55,860;01:25:00,380;"Would get sassy hit the 48 would get sassy hit the 48 yarder"
01:25:01,100;01:25:04,820;"In the snow, you know he wouldn't give me a fucking break dude"
01:25:04,820;01:25:09,380;"Name one big name one big kick"
01:25:09,380;01:25:12,940;"He kicked a 53 yard to be the Giants"
01:25:12,940;01:25:16,340;"Regular"
01:25:16,340;01:25:19,300;"Week 17"
01:25:19,300;01:25:20,620;"Exactly no"
01:25:20,620;01:25:25,640;"Come on. Yeah, you do know he knows and I remember that game exactly so that's"
01:25:27,180;01:25:33,920;"We had that all the fogles I kicked in the last one Randy one Randy Randy had that long touchdown"
01:25:33,920;01:25:37,820;"Everyone remembers week 17 and how it didn't happen matter"
01:25:37,820;01:25:43,860;"No, no not that game. Well, I remember the other game that you might be eluding to with obj"
01:25:43,860;01:25:49,940;"Regular season man"
01:25:49,940;01:25:53,300;"53-yard game winner"
01:25:54,780;01:25:59,900;"talking about who's the better clicker. I believe it's the one that Bellichek"
01:25:59,900;01:26:06,220;"recently said what's it what's this face from the Ravens I believe."
01:26:06,220;01:26:15,460;"Connor, what's your best and worst man?"
01:26:15,460;01:26:22,220;"So it's limited but I have two best and it hasn't been talked about but talk about"
01:26:22,220;01:26:26,780;"missed a reliable and fun. All right. You guys, I'm talking about them in the past. What do you"
01:26:26,780;01:26:36,780;"have? Two CDs of games, very pedestrian, like maybe 70, 80 yards rushing. But he had a fucking"
01:26:36,780;01:26:44,780;"nose for the end zone. I think he had two Russian CDs in this game. My second 76 yards. Yeah. My"
01:26:44,780;01:26:54,320;"second best yeah very ample on Smith game my second best like I already mentioned"
01:26:54,320;01:26:59,780;"was that fucking massive lawyer Maloy blocked the three Troy Brown on the"
01:26:59,780;01:27:06,540;"front return and so it just you don't see your your best offenders out on"
01:27:06,540;01:27:12,660;"punt returns like you did in like the early 2000s and stuff that kind of"
01:27:12,660;01:27:14,660;"without to be Tom Brady just being a"
01:27:14,660;01:27:18,380;"completely different person than that like"
01:27:18,380;01:27:23,540;"2001 obviously first year but like those areas is just"
01:27:23,540;01:27:31,260;"Completely different and my worst might have been to Tom Brady plays. I think this was probably his worst game. Good thing starter"
01:27:31,260;01:27:33,380;"Oh, no"
01:27:33,380;01:27:39,540;"Yeah, there's one worse. I thought goes game was an absolute nightmare. It's actually kind of typical this year"
01:27:39,540;01:27:42,620;"Yeah, yeah, this is yeah"
01:27:42,620;01:27:48,740;"So would you say no the two picks and I think he lost the fumble"
01:27:48,740;01:27:56,180;"He had games where he didn't score touchdowns, but he drove him down the field and Antoine Smith or"
01:27:56,180;01:28:00,020;"like a draw to Kevin Faulk or some shit happened, but"
01:28:00,020;01:28:02,980;"What do you I think he was?"
01:28:02,980;01:28:07,580;"Responsible for three turner was in this game. So it was one of his worst games. Maybe not as worse"
01:28:07,580;01:28:12,020;"But I think it might be a second words. I was at this point. We had one where it was a four-pick game"
01:28:12,020;01:28:14,020;"Maybe a couple of fun bowls. Yeah"
01:28:14,020;01:28:22,540;"I will I will say this guys because we didn't bring it up, but I thought it was very cool stat. Sorry Greg"
01:28:22,540;01:28:29,420;"Jumping in your territory here, but I know they were talking about most consecutive games in a row"
01:28:29,420;01:28:37,020;"with 70% completion percentage or oh, yeah, and they put up a you know a graphic and"
01:28:37,020;01:28:40,580;"And Joe Montana had eight games in a row."
01:28:40,580;01:28:42,900;"Sammy Baugh had four, Steve Young had four,"
01:28:42,900;01:28:46,540;"Troy Aikman had four, and Brady coming into this game"
01:28:46,540;01:28:48,420;"had four in a row as well."
01:28:48,420;01:28:49,260;"- Yeah."
01:28:49,260;01:28:50,180;"- Okay, well, boy."
01:28:50,180;01:28:52,540;"- So that was pretty cool."
01:28:52,540;01:28:57,500;"- 2001 Tom Brady sure was prolific, huh?"
01:28:57,500;01:28:58,820;"- But yeah, right?"
01:28:58,820;01:28:59,660;"And then--"
01:28:59,660;01:29:01,660;"- For the time, I guess so."
01:29:01,660;01:29:04,500;"- I also say we didn't bring up Aaron Shea,"
01:29:04,500;01:29:07,220;"I mean, he got hurt in the game anyway, but"
01:29:07,220;01:29:09,580;"Aaron Shea"
01:29:09,580;01:29:14,100;"Was Brady's teammate at Michigan that they became very good friends"
01:29:14,100;01:29:18,620;"And I don't know if you guys know this but this always stuck in my mind"
01:29:18,620;01:29:23,860;"he always saw greatness in Tom Brady because he was a hard worker and he was humble and"
01:29:23,860;01:29:27,060;"He knows he's humble because he wants to ask Brady"
01:29:27,060;01:29:33,900;"What would you do if you became famous and you had millions of dollars and Brady said I would buy a new pair of socks"
01:29:34,260;01:29:36,660;"Every day because I like how they feel."
01:29:36,660;01:29:40,960;"That's all."
01:29:40,960;01:29:47,260;"So when we have Tom Brady on this podcast, we're going to ask him the first question I'm going to ask him is do you buy any pair of socks every day?"
01:29:47,260;01:29:48,560;"That is."
01:29:48,560;01:29:50,460;"Yeah, I think that's a pretty good question."
01:29:50,460;01:29:51,660;"Oh, move, isn't it?"
01:29:51,660;01:29:53,560;"That's definitely a ball of movies."
01:29:53,560;01:29:53,960;"I know."
01:29:53,960;01:29:56,060;"He's like, that's real to wash your own socks."
01:29:56,060;01:29:56,760;"Dude, exactly."
01:29:56,760;01:29:58,260;"He's like, oh, it's real fucking humble."
01:29:58,260;01:29:59,060;"That's all he wants."
01:29:59,060;01:30:00,760;"Dude, that's pretty big ask."
01:30:02,160;01:30:06,960;"And then I mean, it's definitely loses its novelty after what, like 60 times."
01:30:06,960;01:30:08,400;"Like a week."
01:30:08,400;01:30:10,560;"For maybe two weeks."
01:30:10,560;01:30:13,000;"Yeah, it's it's special because they're new."
01:30:13,000;01:30:17,040;"You know, so that's a poor take from Tom."
01:30:17,040;01:30:17,600;"Yeah."
01:30:17,600;01:30:20,600;"And they still like the first couple of times you're aware of him."
01:30:20,600;01:30:22,560;"They still feel new, you know?"
01:30:22,560;01:30:23,600;"Yeah."
01:30:23,600;01:30:26,480;"And a pre-hair, pre-hairplug, Tom,"
01:30:26,480;01:30:31,760;"he, uh, I think he just had a different mindset."
01:30:31,760;01:30:34,980;"See, I'm glad he brought that up."
01:30:34,980;01:30:37,420;"I mean, we could definitely, that'll be a nice teaser"
01:30:37,420;01:30:41,660;"for future episodes because I've brought up"
01:30:41,660;01:30:45,060;"and we've debated when everybody sold their soul."
01:30:45,060;01:30:48,260;"So is it hair plugs or was it a deal with the devil?"
01:30:48,260;01:30:49,260;"- What do you think of it?"
01:30:49,260;01:30:50,500;"- What?"
01:30:50,500;01:30:52,500;"- Oh, for sure, dude, come on."
01:30:52,500;01:30:57,500;"- It was like 2004 or five he got hair plugs."
01:30:57,500;01:31:00,620;"Yeah, and they started to go in."
01:31:00,620;01:31:01,860;"I would do it too."
01:31:01,860;01:31:03,300;"And I might have already."
01:31:03,300;01:31:04,140;"Thank you very much."
01:31:04,140;01:31:07,740;"- Long hair, Tom Brady,"
01:31:07,740;01:31:09,220;"were some of my favorite years."
01:31:09,220;01:31:11,620;"And you know, he was only wearing the long hair"
01:31:11,620;01:31:13,860;"because he was just so happy"
01:31:13,860;01:31:17,740;"to just even be able to grow long hair after the hair plugs."
01:31:17,740;01:31:21,220;"- All right, now he's dying his hair."
01:31:21,220;01:31:22,820;"Look, it's fine."
01:31:22,820;01:31:23,660;"All right?"
01:31:23,660;01:31:24,660;"He's a beautiful man."
01:31:24,660;01:31:26,140;"- Can do what he wants."
01:31:26,140;01:31:27,540;"He's earned it."
01:31:27,540;01:31:28,380;"- All right, so we don't--"
01:31:28,380;01:31:29,860;"- You can get up or what?"
01:31:29,860;01:31:35,860;"Yes, I think that's that's plenty. I can't believe I'm following it. What is happening?"
01:31:35,860;01:31:40,860;"I just can't believe we've talked as much about a random Browns game that I didn't even remember happened."
01:31:40,860;01:31:42,860;"None of you remember happened if we're going on us."
01:31:42,860;01:31:47,860;"I do remember this game actually, but that's a lie. I do. You son of a bitch."
01:31:47,860;01:31:57,860;"But Connor, if you're ever back again, I mean, this noise that you're making is fucking amateur hour, but you've been good otherwise."
01:31:57,860;01:32:03,580;"I hear you have a deep dive on I believe Roman Fyfer so that could be a"
01:32:03,580;01:32:10,640;"danger for another time. Yes I agree. Yeah we're not gonna get into that tonight."
01:32:10,640;01:32:17,100;"No. We're two hours at this point. I'm gonna have to cut half and then"
01:32:17,100;01:32:21,140;"shoot out anyway. That's what you said and then you said you released a two-hour"
01:32:21,140;01:32:25,060;"episode. I haven't been paying attention but yeah I hear there's a two-hour one"
01:32:25,060;01:32:26,060;"out there."
01:32:26,060;01:32:27,060;"- I don't know."
01:32:27,060;01:32:31,700;"- I came up as a 2016 on my end, bro."
01:32:31,700;01:32:33,740;"- Yeah, and let me come back."
01:32:33,740;01:32:34,980;"I won't talk as much."
01:32:34,980;01:32:35,980;"That's my promise."
01:32:35,980;01:32:36,980;"I didn't know what to do."
01:32:36,980;01:32:40,260;"It was like, I had so much to say."
01:32:40,260;01:32:42,980;"I promise you I will have nothing to say next week."
01:32:42,980;01:32:45,700;"I literally used all my cakes."
01:32:45,700;01:32:50,140;"I used all my, like, I'm done."
01:32:50,140;01:32:51,740;"- That was all your knowledge."
01:32:51,740;01:32:52,740;"That was it."
01:32:52,740;01:32:53,740;"Got it."
01:32:53,740;01:32:59,980;"All right, well until then next week, the Patriots travel to Ralph Wilson Stadium of"
01:32:59,980;01:33:04,220;"Greg Brown, Dick fame, and go up against Buffalo Bills."
01:33:04,220;01:33:06,220;"So we'll see how that turns out."
01:33:06,220;01:33:11,100;"So hopefully if you've lasted this long, you'll join us next week and we will talk to you then."
01:33:11,100;01:33:12,100;"See you later everybody."
01:33:12,100;01:33:13,100;"Bye bye."
01:33:13,100;01:33:13,100;"Bye."
01:33:13,100;01:33:13,100;"Bye."
01:33:13,100;01:33:13,940;"Bye."
01:33:13,940;01:33:17,100;"look over here."

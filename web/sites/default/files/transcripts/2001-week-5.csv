00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,920;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,920;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:20,680;"I am not your mother."
00:20,680;00:28,760;"Alright, let's kick this off."
00:28,760;00:32,200;"Welcome to the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
00:32,200;00:34,280;"This is episode five, I think, right?"
00:34,280;00:36,600;"It was we're week five, two thousand one season."
00:36,600;00:38,080;"- I mean, the beginning was a little murky."
00:38,080;00:42,400;"I mean, we may or may not have recorded a few test runs,"
00:42,400;00:44,680;"so I don't know, you're the boss."
00:44,680;00:48,240;"- Yeah, no, I'm completely lost as well,"
00:48,240;00:50,080;"and who knows how this is gonna actually end up,"
00:50,080;00:53,440;"but yeah, we'll call it for now, tentatively."
00:53,440;00:56,160;"We'll pencil in as episode five."
00:56,160;00:57,000;"- Love it."
00:57,000;01:01,140;"And obviously with me again today is Mr. Mellow."
01:01,140;01:03,140;"Mike, how are you doing?"
01:03,140;01:04,580;"I'm doing pretty well."
01:04,580;01:05,180;"How are you doing?"
01:05,180;01:05,620;"Good."
01:05,620;01:07,300;"Oh, I'm living the dream as always."
01:07,300;01:11,700;"I'm sitting here in my bedroom, talking to you about 2001"
01:11,700;01:13,020;"Patreon season."
01:13,020;01:15,660;"As you do fully go this time."
01:15,660;01:16,900;"For the most part, yes."
01:16,900;01:17,780;"That's beautiful."
01:17,780;01:19,180;"I even got socks on today."
01:19,180;01:22,420;"It's cold here because it's officially winter in New England."
01:22,420;01:26,180;"And it is 27 degrees at the moment."
01:26,180;01:28,600;"I was gonna say I think it's probably like 58"
01:28,600;01:32,260;"So your prize bundled up as I am automatic"
01:32,260;01:35,460;"You know, I've got a nice button up"
01:35,460;01:43,380;"You got the heat on I don't actually know well you have the the the wildfires that are probably keeping you warm"
01:43,380;01:47,260;"They are love okay. Just kidding just kidding"
01:47,260;01:50,020;"Damn it. You're already getting in trouble"
01:51,340;01:54,920;"But yeah, I know things are fantastic, man. I was thinking about it and I don't say it enough"
01:54,920;01:59,900;"But it is a pleasure to be here with you. Yeah, I look forward to doing these every week"
01:59,900;02:03,300;"But yeah, it is just the two of us again"
02:03,300;02:06,740;"The brothers are off gallivanting as always"
02:06,740;02:09,780;"So I prefer frolicking. Oh"
02:09,780;02:13,340;"You can prefer whatever you'd like. Thank you. Hey great"
02:13,340;02:20,140;"He still never responded to my birthday wish from last week. So no, oh well next time he's all after giving him a bunch of shit for that"
02:20,340;02:22,340;"Yeah, I'm not annoyed"
02:22,340;02:27,500;"All right, so speaking of annoying coming into town"
02:27,500;02:34,260;"This week week 5th of 2001 season where the at the time San Diego Chargers, which they no longer are"
02:34,260;02:39,860;"Rest in peace. They could be the London Chargers at some point. That's true. Yeah, I mean, right?"
02:39,860;02:42,580;"Yeah"
02:42,580;02:45,580;"Who do you think like the quick sidebar?"
02:45,580;02:49,300;"Yeah top top three possibilities are to move to London"
02:49,740;02:56,140;"Well franchises I've given this no thought whatsoever. So yeah, I mean either I just came up with this"
02:56,140;03:04,020;"So don't take anything I say as anything other than what I'm saying, but it's gospel. It's it's on recording"
03:04,020;03:10,540;"So it's gospel now. We're gonna hold it. Well, I think I was thinking about this a lot recently not about the London thing"
03:10,540;03:15,260;"But just in general, okay, we have multiple teams in California fine. Whatever true"
03:15,260;03:21,760;"We have multiple teams in New York. We have multiple teams in Florida. That all makes sense Texas. Why why Ohio?"
03:21,760;03:24,820;"Huh"
03:24,820;03:32,260;"No, I'm saying it's not kind of the birthplace for isn't the Hall of Fame in Ohio - yeah, but do you need two two teams in that area?"
03:32,260;03:37,540;"I mean, do you need one team in that area? Well, that's what I'm saying. So ship them both. I mean"
03:41,660;03:45,320;"Like it so so you're gonna you're gonna move the Browns again"
03:45,320;03:51,500;"You're gonna move the Bengals. Yes, which one goes to which one goes to England and which one goes to well"
03:51,500;03:55,520;"Let's say Portugal. That's that's where your family's from. Yeah, I was"
03:55,520;04:00,940;"Think that's problematic, but yeah, all right"
04:00,940;04:06,620;"Yeah that too and freedom such oh, yeah"
04:09,220;04:17,620;"Yeah, no, I think I feel like the I feel like London deserves the Browns, you know, they yeah"
04:17,620;04:22,020;"They could use a little bit of drama, but nothing too happy nothing too"
04:22,020;04:29,720;"Exciting, you know, yeah, I mean this is a country where it rains 80% of the time so they do enjoy themselves some misery"
04:29,720;04:35,500;"Yeah, this is also a country that invented the game of soccer and hasn't won the World Cup"
04:36,300;04:41,700;"1966. So I think the Browns would be a fitting franchise for them, but the Bengals aren't"
04:41,700;04:43,500;"much better. I mean, they've never won as well."
04:43,500;04:51,580;"Well, I was even sick. If we ship them to Portugal, let's say, as you said, my people"
04:51,580;05:01,620;"from the same other. I don't know. Whatever I'm trying to say is the Bengals would be perfect"
05:01,620;05:03,940;"for the Portuguese because guess what?"
05:03,940;05:05,940;"The Portuguese don't watch football."
05:05,940;05:07,940;"They don't give a damn and it would be perfect"
05:07,940;05:09,140;"for the Bengals."
05:09,140;05:10,180;"- Yeah, it would, yeah."
05:10,180;05:11,820;"'Cause it's pretty much that as well."
05:11,820;05:13,860;"Yeah, not much would change."
05:13,860;05:16,940;"- Yeah, so I mean, wait, are you on board?"
05:16,940;05:18,220;"You have any thoughts on this?"
05:18,220;05:20,340;"- Yeah, well, I mean, my initial thought was"
05:20,340;05:24,740;"forced Dan Snyder to sell the Redskins"
05:24,740;05:28,100;"and then just change them to the Washington Redcoats."
05:28,100;05:29,180;"- Right, okay."
05:29,180;05:30,660;"- It still works out."
05:30,660;05:31,500;"I like that."
05:31,500;05:32,340;"And then just ship them over."
05:32,340;05:33,860;"It's problem solved."
05:33,860;05:36,580;"And you probably have to change the logo slightly."
05:36,580;05:40,420;"But I think you could just make the guy on the helmet paler."
05:40,420;05:43,060;"And it would probably still work."
05:43,060;05:43,980;"All right."
05:43,980;05:45,940;"So yeah, give him a little top hat or something."
05:45,940;05:47,820;"I don't know."
05:47,820;05:49,660;"These are not bad ideas."
05:49,660;05:52,940;"If somebody could get on this and tweet"
05:52,940;05:55,460;"whoever needs to be tweeted, it would be great."
05:55,460;05:58,500;"Yeah, if somebody can get in contact with Roger Goodell,"
05:58,500;06:05,780;"our our DMS are always open. He can hit us up and we'll we'll sell him these ideas for small money."
06:05,780;06:08,980;"Yeah, I don't know if you know, but he's currently"
06:08,980;06:15,940;"meeting with Antonio Brown, I believe. Oh, that was today. Yes. Yeah. Can't wait to see what comes"
06:15,940;06:23,300;"out of that. Yeah. So for all you listening to this in the future, and this is old news,"
06:23,860;06:26,180;"And I still haven't heard what happens on your brown."
06:26,180;06:27,340;"Please let me know."
06:27,340;06:29,660;"Yeah, please tweet @MikeMella."
06:29,660;06:32,300;"Even half Twitter."
06:32,300;06:32,820;"I don't know."
06:32,820;06:33,620;"No, I got a sign on it."
06:33,620;06:39,900;"Although my guess is your Twitter handle will be leave me low."
06:39,900;06:40,900;"Me alone."
06:40,900;06:41,380;"What was it?"
06:41,380;06:42,420;"What was your that was?"
06:42,420;06:44,020;"Yeah, I was going through stuff."
06:44,020;06:48,580;"But it was me low in the middle, but it was leave me alone."
06:48,580;06:49,300;"Right."
06:49,300;06:50,740;"Which I thought was super clever."
06:50,740;06:50,980;"Yeah."
06:50,980;06:52,620;"No, I'm a big fan of work playing."
06:52,620;06:58,540;"I was I was I was impressed with that one, you know, but those are darker times and we're here for that football"
06:58,540;07:00,860;"Yeah life could be better"
07:00,860;07:08,160;"Sunny, you know warm least for imagination right at least inside this conversation. It's beautiful. It is"
07:08,160;07:11,500;"You know I see you beautiful. Well, what else is beautiful?"
07:11,500;07:19,220;"The New England patreon. Yes. Well, let's yeah, let's talk about these charges speaking of warm. All right fine"
07:19,220;07:21,540;"so this was"
07:21,540;07:26,540;"I thought an interesting group of players in general."
07:26,540;07:28,700;"The head coach was Mike Riley,"
07:28,700;07:31,940;"who I had never heard of, still never heard of."
07:31,940;07:35,340;"I mean, it's not a name that I remember,"
07:35,340;07:36,940;"I don't know about you."
07:36,940;07:39,780;"- I don't, it not really, doesn't ring well."
07:39,780;07:41,780;"- No, not even a little bit."
07:41,780;07:43,900;"I saw a picture of him, like I looked him up"
07:43,900;07:46,140;"and everything, that not a fucking clue."
07:46,140;07:48,020;"I think he may have coached at Nebraska"
07:48,020;07:49,460;"'cause he's wearing Nebraska stuff,"
07:49,460;07:54,160;"even on his like football, like NFL profile, but good for him."
07:54,160;07:58,720;"Apparently only coaching NFL for three years, all with the"
07:58,720;08:02,440;"chargers from 99 to 2001."
08:02,440;08:07,220;"Eight and eight the first year, one in 15 the second year, and then"
08:07,220;08:09,760;"five and 11, and he was never invited back."
08:09,760;08:14,680;"At least he had a couple of NFL chargers haven't done much better"
08:14,680;08:18,160;"since I mean, they had a couple of good runs, but yeah, they have."
08:18,160;08:20,040;"But every time they have a good run, they fire their coach."
08:20,040;08:23,120;"So I mean, those guys, the Marty shot in high-meer word,"
08:23,120;08:25,240;"didn't they go like 14 and two when he still got fired?"
08:25,240;08:26,400;"- Yeah, they did. - Whatever the hell it was."
08:26,400;08:27,920;"- Yeah, it was the same, yeah."
08:27,920;08:30,640;"- So I mean, I'm sure we'll get to that at some point"
08:30,640;08:32,840;"in this podcast down the road,"
08:32,840;08:36,960;"because I think the Patriots had something to do with that."
08:36,960;08:38,160;"- I think so as well."
08:38,160;08:43,160;"- Yeah, but this charges team led by the well-renowned"
08:43,840;08:53,020;"Mike Riley actually started the season 3 and 0 before losing their game before this one"
08:53,020;08:55,260;"to the Browns, I think it was."
08:55,260;09:02,380;"So the 3 and 1 coming into this game and actually started the season 5 and 2 and ended it 5"
09:02,380;09:03,380;"and 11."
09:03,380;09:10,040;"So I'll talk to you what happened because I'm not a Chargers fan, thank God."
09:10,040;09:12,400;"But that's just the wheels falling the fuck on it."
09:12,400;09:19,280;"It's very Buffalo Bills as it felt, which made sense because there are some ties here"
09:19,280;09:21,280;"to the Buffalo Bills."
09:21,280;09:27,120;"I think the biggest tie would be they're starting quarterback Doug Flutie."
09:27,120;09:28,120;"Doug Doug"
09:28,120;09:29,120;"Flutie."
09:29,120;09:30,120;"Yeah."
09:30,120;09:36,200;"If you didn't know before watching this game, the announcers would beat it over the fucking"
09:36,200;09:44,520;"head for you that he is from Massachusetts. No played at BC. Get the fuck out of here."
09:44,520;09:51,960;"Right. Did you know that? Did you know that after the game? I did. Yeah. Oh, it was nauseating."
09:51,960;10:00,640;"It was it was the 2001 version of did you know this tight end played basketball on college"
10:00,640;10:05,520;"sort of thing, you know? Did you know Patrick Mahomes used to play shortstop? Well, it's"
10:05,520;10:09,520;"It's funny that you bring him up because I was actually thinking, correct me if I'm wrong,"
10:09,520;10:12,520;"is fluting the original Patrick Mahomes."
10:12,520;10:18,520;"Ooh, I think so."
10:18,520;10:19,520;"Okay."
10:19,520;10:20,520;"Because he's..."
10:20,520;10:22,520;"Because he has a farm."
10:22,520;10:24,520;"I mean, Hail Mary, all that."
10:24,520;10:29,480;"They have, I mean, they have had mobile quarterbacks before him because he was a raanal cunning"
10:29,480;10:32,480;"him and Warren Moon and that lot and Steve Young."
10:32,480;10:33,220;"Yeah."
10:33,220;10:37,000;"Um, so maybe Steve Young may have been the first Patrick Mahomes."
10:37,000;10:40,600;"Are you saying that cause, uh, flutey short?"
10:40,600;10:42,640;"I'm saying that cause they're all short."
10:42,640;10:42,880;"Yeah."
10:42,880;10:44,240;"They're all short and mobile."
10:44,240;10:45,680;"Is Stevie M."
10:45,680;10:46,040;"Short?"
10:46,040;10:47,840;"He's not that big."
10:47,840;10:51,280;"I don't, I mean, he, I, he's not a Doug flutey short."
10:51,280;10:52,400;"Doug flute is five nine."
10:52,400;10:52,960;"Yeah."
10:52,960;10:54,400;"And that's what I'm getting at."
10:54,400;10:56,880;"That's why he can be Patrick Mahomes way to go, man."
10:56,880;10:59,280;"How tall is Patrick Mahomes?"
10:59,280;11:01,280;"I have no idea."
11:01,280;11:03,280;"Steve Young is 6'2""."
11:03,280;11:04,280;"See?"
11:04,280;11:06,280;"It's taller than I am."
11:06,280;11:08,280;"So, yeah, he's my height, which..."
11:08,280;11:09,280;"Wow!"
11:09,280;11:11,280;"Okay, I just said taller than I am."
11:11,280;11:14,280;"You have to trump me by stating your height wonderful."
11:14,280;11:15,280;"Sorry."
11:15,280;11:16,280;"Well, I mean, you're not exactly..."
11:16,280;11:18,280;"I mean, what, you, 6'?"
11:18,280;11:19,280;"Yeah."
11:19,280;11:20,280;"Well, I think I'm like a quarter-minute job."
11:20,280;11:21,280;"Whatever."
11:21,280;11:22,280;"We'll call him 6'."
11:22,280;11:24,280;"I don't mind rounding up."
11:24,280;11:28,280;"I'm like 6'1"" and 7'8"", so 6'2"" and you're 6'5""."
11:28,280;11:31,760;"All right, Patrick. What do you think how tall you think Patrick Mahomes is comparatively?"
11:31,760;11:35,320;"Oh, he seems tall and linky, so I gotta think he's like I"
11:35,320;11:39,600;"Want to say well, I think he's probably like six feet"
11:39,600;11:43,120;"He's six three. Yeah, right"
11:43,120;11:46,880;"See that guy was built for this. I guess so"
11:46,880;11:54,040;"What about and Tom Brady's actually six four so he's actually about Tom Brady size, which I always felt like he was much shorter"
11:54,040;11:57,080;"Interesting"
11:57,080;12:02,020;"Yeah, but yeah, flute. I don't know. I mean I say that because he had a rocket arm"
12:02,020;12:08,500;"He was you know, he was pretty good at scrambling running. Yeah, I mean I guess he didn't do the cross body stuff"
12:08,500;12:10,800;"I don't really know who does that other than maybe far"
12:10,800;12:13,200;"Yeah, that's right"
12:13,200;12:18,880;"But you know, I'm saying it right here Doug flute the original Patrick Mahomes. Yeah, no"
12:18,880;12:20,880;"I think there's a lot of structure"
12:20,880;12:26,000;"Right. Yeah, and I think he was a bit before his time for this. Oh, I agree, but he did"
12:26,000;12:33,320;"you did have a good year this year even though they went 5 and 11 because the whole controversy"
12:33,320;12:39,160;"like that's why I was bringing up the bills was that the bills had Doug Flutie and whoever"
12:39,160;12:41,560;"they went with Todd Collins maybe."
12:41,560;12:45,800;"Where are the bills? Was there any about Rob Johnson?"
12:45,800;12:51,280;"That's who it was. Yeah, I knew it was one of those. I don't even know. I don't even"
12:51,280;13:00,400;"the column anymore, just the plethora of fucking awful bills quarterbacks."
13:00,400;13:09,040;"Rob Johnson, so they had both of those in the prior year, like switching back and forth"
13:09,040;13:11,000;"between them."
13:11,000;13:15,480;"And let's see, I have it here."
13:15,480;13:21,860;"Johnson started 11 games, went four and seven. Doug Flute started five games and went four"
13:21,860;13:22,860;"and one."
13:22,860;13:29,660;"Well, and it's funny because Tom Donahue I think was the Bill's GM at that time. And"
13:29,660;13:34,860;"he's that they decided to get his first salary cap reasons that can keep both of them or"
13:34,860;13:40,940;"whatever. So they picked Rob Johnson because he is more talented. That is a quote. Yeah."
13:40,940;13:43,380;"No, it's 100% correct."
13:43,380;13:46,940;"And yeah, because they basically, I think Rob Johnson struggled."
13:46,940;13:48,940;"So they ended up putting fluting at the end of the year."
13:48,940;13:52,780;"And he won as many games as Rob Johnson did in half as many starts."
13:52,780;13:53,500;"Right."
13:53,500;13:55,940;"Because that's kind of what Flutey did."
13:55,940;13:59,460;"It was never particularly pretty, but he always found a way to do it."
13:59,460;14:02,940;"And had that like fourth quarter magic that the commentator in this game"
14:02,940;14:03,860;"were gushing all over him."
14:03,860;14:09,860;"But they, yeah, because there was even a thing in the Boston Globe talking about how"
14:09,860;14:14,860;"basically the bills had made the wrong choice."
14:14,860;14:20,100;"Stake with Rob Johnson because he went in 2001,"
14:20,100;14:25,100;"'cause the charges who were one and 15 the year before"
14:25,100;14:31,980;"got flutey and started off the season five and two."
14:31,980;14:35,740;"And Rob Johnson, on the other hand,"
14:35,740;14:37,660;"started the season one and seven"
14:37,660;14:40,580;"before he was bench for Alex van Pelt of all people."
14:40,580;14:41,420;"- Oh, nice."
14:41,420;14:42,300;"Yeah, I've heard of him."
14:42,300;14:44,100;"- He's fantastic."
14:44,100;14:46,340;"- Yeah, and he finished season two and six,"
14:46,340;14:48,700;"so he was one game better than Rob Johnson,"
14:48,700;14:49,540;"who they paid a bunch of money for."
14:49,540;14:52,300;"- Why? Because he is more talented."
14:52,300;14:53,580;"- Apparently, just barely."
14:53,580;14:56,000;"(laughs)"
14:56,000;14:57,820;"- It's a disaster."
14:57,820;14:58,940;"- Yeah, so Flute had like--"
14:58,940;15:01,500;"- I was getting the age thing though."
15:01,500;15:03,940;"- I mean, yeah, I think Flute was getting up in age"
15:03,940;15:05,540;"at that point."
15:05,540;15:10,020;"Rob Johnson was 28 in 2001."
15:10,020;15:13,220;"And let's see how old Flootie was."
15:13,220;15:16,060;"He was probably significantly older."
15:16,060;15:18,140;"He was 39."
15:18,140;15:19,460;"- Yeah, I mean, so--"
15:19,460;15:20,780;"- Which is 100."
15:20,780;15:23,460;"- The GM kind of just basically said,"
15:23,460;15:25,900;"it's an age thing, we're trying to groom Rob Johnson,"
15:25,900;15:28,700;"but instead he went with the talent."
15:28,700;15:32,860;"- Yeah, that came to backers to bite him a little bit."
15:34,300;15:36,540;"But yeah, so Flute had a decent year."
15:36,540;15:41,220;"He threw for almost 3,500 yards, 15 touchdowns,"
15:41,220;15:43,460;"but he also threw 18 picks."
15:43,460;15:45,220;"So kind of up and down,"
15:45,220;15:47,940;"which I think we saw a little bit of in this game."
15:47,940;15:49,260;"He was actually pretty good in this game,"
15:49,260;15:52,220;"but not as effective in the red zone."
15:52,220;15:54,020;"He also finished with--"
15:54,020;15:57,700;"- He's 12-in-one all time before this game"
15:57,700;15:59,180;"at Foxborough."
15:59,180;16:00,020;"- That's true, yeah."
16:00,020;16:03,380;"But most of those games were well-playing for BC."
16:04,220;16:05,940;"Hey, well, it counts."
16:05,940;16:08,560;"But he had already done a stint with the Patriots"
16:08,560;16:11,860;"before this, which was interesting."
16:11,860;16:15,060;"'Cause I remember when he came back when he was like"
16:15,060;16:16,420;"in his 40s."
16:16,420;16:17,780;"Oh, yeah, yeah."
16:17,780;16:21,700;"And he had the drop kick for the extra point."
16:21,700;16:22,540;"Exactly."
16:22,540;16:24,500;"But I didn't realize he kind of,"
16:24,500;16:30,220;"yeah, he started it in Chicago back in the 80s,"
16:30,220;16:31,860;"came to New England for a couple of years,"
16:31,860;16:34,180;"didn't really play much."
16:34,180;16:37,300;"i started a few games actually in eighty eight he actually started nine games on"
16:37,300;16:39,500;"six and three"
16:39,500;16:42,660;"but they didn't stick with them many went to buffalo and then san diego and"
16:42,660;16:45,220;"then back to me for that one year"
16:45,220;16:48,820;"well and i'm i mean bellet check out a lot of respect from the uh... i mean"
16:48,820;16:50,100;"uh..."
16:50,100;16:52,780;"at the end of the game he saw them out there in my heart"
16:52,780;16:53,660;"uh..."
16:53,660;16:57,500;"again those before he sold his soul which we established with circa two thousand"
16:57,500;16:58,660;"four right"
16:58,660;16:59,940;"right right"
16:59,940;17:04,100;"Well, did you catch when, and just jumping ahead a little bit, but when Brady"
17:04,100;17:08,940;"through his last touchdown, right at the end, he, they, they showed a shot of"
17:08,940;17:09,740;"him celebrating."
17:09,740;17:10,380;"Yeah."
17:10,380;17:12,900;"And his face, like no smile, nothing."
17:12,900;17:15,700;"He just threw his hands up in the touchdown celebration."
17:15,700;17:16,340;"Yeah."
17:16,340;17:16,740;"That was it."
17:16,740;17:18,020;"That he was done."
17:18,020;17:18,820;"Yeah."
17:18,820;17:22,060;"Oh, it's good."
17:22,060;17:23,020;"Yeah."
17:23,020;17:27,500;"But the one other thing that they didn't actually mention at all in this game,"
17:28,420;17:34,260;"But I found out during research on the Chargers was the backup to Doug Flutey"
17:34,260;17:37,340;"and was sitting on the bench was a rookie Drew Brees."
17:37,340;17:38,860;"That's right."
17:38,860;17:40,820;"Yeah, who didn't see the game at all."
17:40,820;17:47,620;"And would I think he I think from what I remember Drew Brees actually kind of"
17:47,620;17:49,260;"struggled a bit at San Diego."
17:49,260;17:50,380;"Yeah."
17:50,380;17:52,740;"And then he got hurt and then he did."
17:52,740;17:53,420;"Yeah."
17:53,420;17:55,860;"And then they moved on and we all know what happened."
17:56,980;18:03,540;"I will say though, one of my notes about Doug Flute was I haven't seen anybody put as much"
18:03,540;18:05,800;"effort into throwing a football."
18:05,800;18:08,940;"It's in Strewbreeze as Doug Flute."
18:08,940;18:12,740;"He puts a 120% effort in throwing that football."
18:12,740;18:16,540;"Looks like he's going to tear his top half of his body off his bottom half."
18:16,540;18:18,380;"Yeah, he does zip him in there though."
18:18,380;18:19,380;"Oh, he does."
18:19,380;18:21,580;"But even like any sort of it doesn't matter what it is."
18:21,580;18:23,940;"He's just slinging it."
18:23,940;18:25,900;"It's amazing."
18:25,900;18:30,900;"So what you're saying is he's not the original Patrick Mahomes."
18:30,900;18:37,900;"He's the top of the family tree."
18:37,900;18:40,900;"You know, almost like a coaching tree, but with quarterbacks,"
18:40,900;18:43,900;"he's the top and coming off of him at one side is Patrick Mahomes"
18:43,900;18:45,900;"and the other side is rubris."
18:45,900;18:47,900;"Wow. So it all starts with flute. I love it."
18:47,900;18:48,900;"It does. Yeah."
18:48,900;18:52,900;"That is the beginning of both of those gas trees."
18:52,900;18:54,900;"Doug flew to the cave that way."
18:54,900;19:00,100;"That he threw a Hail Mary pass at Boston College."
19:00,100;19:05,700;"That sounds familiar."
19:05,700;19:10,980;"Yeah, to be like a like undefeated Miami team or something like that, right?"
19:10,980;19:11,780;"That's right."
19:11,780;19:13,300;"The number one ranked team at the time."
19:13,300;19:14,580;"Yeah, I don't know who it was."
19:14,580;19:18,740;"But yeah, I just remember the celebration videos."
19:18,740;19:19,780;"Oh, yeah, absolutely."
19:19,780;19:21,460;"Where is wearing the cutoff shirt?"
19:21,460;19:22,660;"Yeah, hell yeah, the cutoff."
19:22,660;19:23,300;"Yeah."
19:23,300;19:23,620;"Yeah."
19:23,620;19:25,820;"Yeah. Oh, God."
19:25,820;19:32,420;"Speaking of rookies on this Chargers team, they're running back."
19:32,420;19:35,140;"You may have heard of them, Ladani and Tomlinson."
19:35,140;19:37,620;"This was his record season."
19:37,620;19:40,220;"Hello, rookie season. Yeah. Yeah."
19:40,220;19:43,620;"You ran for 1200 yards in 10 touchdowns this year."
19:43,620;19:47,500;"And at this point of the season was actually the leading rusher going into this game."
19:47,500;19:51,460;"Well, I was insane too, because they were pointing out that at this point,"
19:51,500;19:56,420;"week five, he had seven touchdowns. And the previous year, the Tigers had seven Russian"
19:56,420;19:59,820;"touchdowns total. Yeah, he already had a week five."
19:59,820;20:04,020;"Yeah, it was a pretty big upgrade. Although now that we talk about it, the week five,"
20:04,020;20:06,500;"you had seven touchdowns, he finished the year with 10 touchdowns."
20:06,500;20:12,740;"Yeah, so I, I, I, my guess is that either teams figured him out or they just figured"
20:12,740;20:16,060;"that offense out because I mean, they stopped winning games. So my guess is they got behind"
20:16,060;20:18,700;"and had to just start chucking the ball and go away from actually running it."
20:19,260;20:26,300;"Because even this game, they tried to stick with the run, but LT finished 24 carries 74 yards."
20:26,300;20:28,740;"So it's not crazy."
20:28,740;20:34,460;"He had a touchdown, but as long as Ron was 14, it's not like he was blowing things up in this game."
20:34,460;20:37,140;"I mean, he looked good and he had some pretty strong runs."
20:37,140;20:47,060;"But the page actually kept him surprisingly bottled up for how much the commentators were talking him up."
20:47,300;20:49,600;"I thought it was gonna be a bigger deal."
20:49,600;20:56,420;"He also made me think of you because I'm correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't he one of your favorite players of all time?"
20:56,420;20:58,600;"No, no, he was exactly."
20:58,600;20:59,100;"I'm upset."
20:59,100;20:59,800;"Correct."
20:59,800;21:00,300;"I'm not one."
21:00,300;21:01,200;"Exactly."
21:01,200;21:03,900;"I I've hated him ever since he came out."
21:03,900;21:06,600;"He's got a Jersey, didn't you?"
21:06,600;21:09,300;"No, I'm sure."
21:09,300;21:10,100;"Yeah."
21:10,100;21:11,600;"You want to admit it to the public?"
21:11,600;21:14,000;"I don't I don't buy non-patri."
21:14,000;21:18,620;"Actually, well, I do buy non-pager jerseys, but they're of usually failures"
21:18,620;21:25,720;"My favorite is Maurice Clorat, Jersey. Oh, that's a sore subject. Hey"
21:25,720;21:29,280;"It was a cheap jersey. I'll tell you that I got it for like 15 bucks"
21:29,280;21:37,100;"And like whatever that marshals is in Lawrence. Oh, yeah, yeah, it sells like yeah all the the jerseys with like"
21:37,100;21:41,840;"I've got a couple of ones. I think I have ones like Tim couch. I've got one that"
21:42,880;21:50,180;"Are they like legit though, are they like slavery wonky? No, I well these ones are actually pretty legit. I have one that's um, I"
21:50,180;21:54,840;"Can't remember who was some bills receiver, but the the name was put on upside down. Oh"
21:54,840;21:59,360;"Yeah, I have a date with the numbers were off center. Yeah"
21:59,360;22:05,160;"Yeah, so we probably shopped at the same place then. Yeah, yeah, and I had who was the"
22:05,160;22:11,160;"The Raiders quarterback Aaron Brooks was it. Oh Aaron Brooks. Yeah. Yeah, so I got one of those"
22:11,800;22:16,920;"So I was given those away as Christmas gifts back in college. I actually have them anymore, but they're out there"
22:16,920;22:23,120;"Well, all right if you don't want to admit to being the you get not you just the top five"
22:23,120;22:25,640;"biggest fans of"
22:25,640;22:33,160;"Think I think you may be confusing me with one of my brothers. So we'll have to ask them"
22:33,160;22:36,120;"I don't know we're going on the record"
22:38,520;22:48,240;"the biggest. Yeah. A lot of dating Stan, if you will. Yeah. Oh boy. No, he sucks. Um,"
22:48,240;22:53,960;"he's had a huge, really good. You just, well, yeah, he wasn't such a blowhard. Actually,"
22:53,960;22:59,840;"he wasn't even below or hard anything. He was, uh, he's a kind of a pansy and you're"
22:59,840;23:04,600;"wanting to lie. But anyways, he has a martial flop. They hate the Patriots and the patch"
23:04,600;23:08,040;"I'm sick. Oh, they do and Mark Bernal of all people."
23:08,040;23:11,160;"Mark Bernal. Yeah. He was crying over the flake gate."
23:11,160;23:12,160;"I'm not sure that."
23:12,160;23:12,360;"Yeah."
23:12,360;23:14,440;"Get over your family crying on television."
23:14,440;23:15,760;"Come on."
23:15,760;23:17,720;"Some people. Jerry, right?"
23:17,720;23:19,880;"He was mad because he lost the as he championed it against them."
23:19,880;23:21,440;"Yep. Yep."
23:21,440;23:22,920;"Jerry Rice. Yeah."
23:22,920;23:27,160;"Mr. Sticklem loved the guy, but he admits to cheating himself,"
23:27,160;23:30,400;"which I would say deflated or not intentional or not."
23:30,400;23:32,480;"Who gives a crap about one PS tie?"
23:32,680;23:37,600;"But if you had glue in your hands, that probably has a contribution to certain parts of the game."
23:37,600;23:39,000;"You would think, wouldn't you?"
23:39,000;23:39,520;"Yeah."
23:39,520;23:40,200;"Yeah."
23:40,200;23:42,760;"But hey, who am I?"
23:42,760;23:43,520;"Yeah."
23:43,520;23:44,760;"Let's just let's be right on here."
23:44,760;23:50,880;"We have that guarantee he'd come on right now to defend his honor."
23:50,880;23:51,680;"Yeah."
23:51,680;23:52,720;"So let's do that."
23:52,720;23:53,520;"Because all right."
23:53,520;23:54,920;"All right."
23:54,920;23:57,920;"I'll have I'll have our people talk to his people, see what we can set up."
23:57,920;23:59,600;"Make it happen, man, because I'm curious."
24:02,160;24:03,000;"All right."
24:03,000;24:05,240;"Speaking of wide receivers though,"
24:05,240;24:10,240;"had you heard of any of these charges wide receivers?"
24:10,240;24:12,760;"'Cause here's the list that I have."
24:12,760;24:14,800;"I have Curtis Conway who was their leading team."
24:14,800;24:15,800;"- I remember him."
24:15,800;24:16,960;"- I didn't."
24:16,960;24:20,640;"Jeff Graham who, if you had told me the name Jeff Graham,"
24:20,640;24:23,120;"I would have thought he was like a standup comedian."
24:23,120;24:25,280;"- He is, he's fucking hilarious."
24:25,280;24:26,760;"(laughing)"
24:26,760;24:29,480;"His standup special came out two months ago."
24:29,480;24:30,920;"I highly recommend you watch it."
24:30,920;24:32,200;"I think it's a house like I'm not sure."
24:32,200;24:33,280;"- Okay, all right."
24:33,280;24:35,960;"I'll keep an eye out for that when I'm browsing Netflix."
24:35,960;24:36,960;"- Yeah, he's really good."
24:36,960;24:40,240;"- And then the only name I actually did recognize"
24:40,240;24:41,880;"was Tim Dwight."
24:41,880;24:44,400;"- Tim Dwight was good solid for the Turner."
24:44,400;24:46,760;"- He eventually played for the Patriots."
24:46,760;24:48,480;"- When was that?"
24:48,480;24:50,280;"I vaguely remember that."
24:50,280;24:51,280;"- I don't remember."
24:51,280;24:54,720;"It was like end of his career and he didn't last very long."
24:54,720;24:56,840;"I think he was just there to do punt returns."
24:56,840;25:01,840;"in uh, he was supposed to spell either Welker or Edelman at part returns and he didn't"
25:01,840;25:02,840;"catch."
25:02,840;25:03,840;"Gotcha."
25:03,840;25:04,840;"Gotcha."
25:04,840;25:07,840;"But uh, he was good in this game."
25:07,840;25:12,840;"He, the Patriots couldn't stop a, a wide receiver slant or they just didn't want to."
25:12,840;25:15,840;"And they, they apparently forgot how to tackle on special teams."
25:15,840;25:22,840;"Oh yeah, kick offs were an adventure to say that for both sides, I feel like."
25:22,840;25:26,320;"Yeah, look, I mean, I've been a champion of Lee Johnson."
25:26,320;25:29,320;"Oh, we'll get to Lee Johnson."
25:29,320;25:30,760;"Just you wait."
25:30,760;25:33,880;"Oh, I got a big old section on Lee Johnson to talk about."
25:33,880;25:38,120;"OK, I'll loft my championing this guy."
25:38,120;25:40,080;"And that's the problem with yourself out there."
25:40,080;25:41,480;"Yeah, you shouldn't have done it."
25:41,480;25:45,360;"But the defense actually has some even bigger names."
25:45,360;25:47,560;"I thought some names."
25:47,560;25:50,280;"It's Pat's fans will also recognize"
25:50,280;25:53,780;"because both Rodney Harrison and Junior Seo, who made the Pro Bowl this year,"
25:53,780;25:56,940;"ended up playing the Patriots."
25:56,940;25:59,700;"Like 2019?"
25:59,700;26:02,100;"No, 2001, this year that we're talking about."
26:02,100;26:03,000;"Oh, okay."
26:03,000;26:04,420;"The reason for this podcast, Mr."
26:04,420;26:04,660;"Melon."
26:04,660;26:05,820;"I thought you were saying, okay."
26:05,820;26:09,700;"Yeah, I don't like he's making any Pro Bowls this year."
26:09,700;26:10,620;"Right."
26:10,620;26:11,860;"I thought you were being insensitive."
26:11,860;26:12,980;"No."
26:12,980;26:14,020;"Oh, okay."
26:14,020;26:15,720;"Junior Seo, Rest in Peace, bud."
26:15,720;26:16,380;"Yeah."
26:16,380;26:16,940;"Exactly."
26:16,940;26:17,380;"It was awesome."
26:17,860;26:20,440;"Yeah, he was a heart and soul of the team."
26:20,440;26:25,440;"And yeah, so that between it was those two and also Marcel is"
26:25,440;26:27,220;"wily on the defensive line."
26:27,220;26:32,120;"And I guess Ryan McNeil, the cornerback went to the Pro Bowl this year as well."
26:32,120;26:34,680;"Those four were all defense."
26:34,680;26:34,920;"Yeah."
26:34,920;26:38,760;"So set in the stage there."
26:38,760;26:44,960;"I think talking about how good this defense was, we should actually start"
26:44,960;26:56,460;"talking about the page's offense because, and especially Tom Brady, because this to me was the first game that Brady actually was the reason the"
26:56,460;26:58,740;"pages of one, like in his career."
26:58,740;27:01,700;"Well, wait a, wait a, you know, bring that up."
27:01,700;27:04,100;"So we've even talked about it."
27:04,100;27:05,420;"Give it a little suspense, man."
27:05,420;27:09,060;"Now, you know, no one remembers the outcome of these games."
27:09,060;27:12,960;"Like we, we've given this game in 20 years of suspense."
27:13,340;27:15,740;"No, no, we got a all right."
27:15,740;27:16,140;"Fine."
27:16,140;27:17,340;"They won guys."
27:17,340;27:19,460;"They won this game."
27:19,460;27:24,820;"No, I actually, I think this is me being serious here."
27:24,820;27:27,860;"I think that this game outside of any championship"
27:27,860;27:31,380;"or playoff games, it's probably--"
27:31,380;27:33,020;"and it's one that you don't even think about,"
27:33,020;27:36,620;"but it's probably like one of the top 20 regular season"
27:36,620;27:38,100;"games of the Dynasty."
27:38,100;27:40,420;"And it's definitely worth a rewatch"
27:40,420;27:42,780;"if anyone has access to it."
27:42,780;27:49,140;"Yeah, I 100% because I was I was watching the game today and I got like, I think it was eight"
27:49,140;27:50,180;"minutes left in the fourth quarter."
27:50,180;27:51,860;"I knew what the outcome was."
27:51,860;27:52,460;"Yeah."
27:52,460;27:53,580;"I'm still sitting there."
27:53,580;27:57,300;"I had a moment of doubt of like, wait, they, they do win this game, right?"
27:57,300;28:00,980;"Like how I'm not quite sure how it's going to happen because they're down 10"
28:00,980;28:05,500;"points with eight minutes left and going against this ridiculous defense."
28:05,500;28:06,460;"Right."
28:06,460;28:10,780;"And I really, like not knowing the results going in."
28:10,780;28:15,580;"man. Because I didn't. And I was like, well, this is pretty cool. I feel like I'm"
28:15,580;28:17,900;"reliving like everything all over again."
28:17,900;28:22,300;"See that, because that's how you've been watching is, but I knew, because yeah,"
28:22,300;28:26,860;"I've been for my website, I've like been in this, like all these stats and"
28:26,860;28:31,260;"everything and the results and all that for a while now. So I, yeah, I've kind of"
28:31,260;28:37,180;"like, I know, like from numbers wise and win loss wise, like how the season went"
28:37,180;28:41,180;"on. But I don't actually remember watching this game. Like I don't remember."
28:41,180;28:46,980;"And like, I remember Brady throwing his first touchdown. Like that that plays is"
28:46,980;28:50,700;"in my mind. And then the game winner did he throw to Wiggins."
28:50,700;28:53,620;"Well, you know what's sad about this? I think I didn't miss a"
28:53,620;28:58,420;"page with the game for, I think it's like 2007, to be honest."
28:58,420;29:03,660;"Yeah, me too. So it was probably like, you know, I don't know, 15, 20 years, you"
29:03,660;29:06,100;"you know, 15 years of like straight football."
29:06,100;29:08,140;"I didn't want to miss a game."
29:08,140;29:09,340;"It was very important to me."
29:09,340;29:11,020;"And I, you know, love watching the Patriots."
29:11,020;29:11,860;"It's a good time."
29:11,860;29:14,820;"But looking back, I'm like, I don't remember a damn thing"
29:14,820;29:16,220;"about anything that I wanted."
29:16,220;29:18,260;"I made sure to watch every one of them."
29:18,260;29:20,060;"So maybe they all believed in together,"
29:20,060;29:22,860;"but I feel like looking back, I'm like, man,"
29:22,860;29:26,580;"I shouldn't have tried to catch every single one."
29:26,580;29:32,900;"- But no, I just feel like because it's also been 20 years."
29:32,900;29:33,740;"I know, I know."
29:33,740;29:36,580;"And at the moment, you're experiencing it, you know,"
29:36,580;29:37,420;"as it happened."
29:37,420;29:38,780;"So it's one thing, but I'm like,"
29:38,780;29:40,300;"I do not remember most of this."
29:40,300;29:42,100;"So it's great to watch it again."
29:42,100;29:42,940;"- It really is, yeah."
29:42,940;29:44,140;"I was thinking the exact same thing."
29:44,140;29:46,940;"It's like this for like how,"
29:46,940;29:50,180;"like the, all the feelings that I remember this season,"
29:50,180;29:51,460;"like the bits and pieces that I remember,"
29:51,460;29:54,860;"I thought I remembered more than I actually did."
29:54,860;29:57,300;"Because all of these games that I watched"
29:57,300;29:59,140;"with the exception of the just one where,"
29:59,140;30:00,620;"where blood so went down,"
30:02,100;30:04,740;"I remembered almost nothing of any of these games."
30:04,740;30:08,000;"And so it is almost like part of it is watching it"
30:08,000;30:11,240;"for the first time, but you know how it's gonna end up,"
30:11,240;30:12,440;"which is kind of cool."
30:12,440;30:16,800;"And there's also that added thing of like getting to see"
30:16,800;30:21,680;"Tom Brady as a young fool taking his first steps"
30:21,680;30:24,400;"for being born, knowing what that's gonna turn into."
30:24,400;30:27,160;"And just hearing all the commentators talking about like,"
30:27,160;30:29,720;"""Oh, this young kid might be something one day."""
30:29,720;30:30,560;"- Right, right."
30:30,560;30:33,920;"- Oh, it's fascinating, 'cause the game itself"
30:33,920;30:38,100;"was awesome to watch, but the game before,"
30:38,100;30:41,520;"he sort of got crapped on by Miami."
30:41,520;30:44,680;"So everyone was just writing them off,"
30:44,680;30:46,840;"like we talked about, and they're like,"
30:46,840;30:49,280;"oh, what controversy, whatever."
30:49,280;30:52,880;"And after this game, it sort of like reinvigorated everything."
30:52,880;30:54,000;"- I think it did, yeah."
30:54,000;30:56,720;"- Yeah, yeah, no, I think this was the beginning"
30:56,720;31:00,260;"of the actual quarterback controversy"
31:00,260;31:01,900;"for the Patriots in this year."
31:01,900;31:02,800;"- Yeah, I agree."
31:02,800;31:05,800;"- Yeah, but yeah, 'cause like you said,"
31:05,800;31:09,840;"like the Patriots, it felt like they had been written off"
31:09,840;31:12,520;"'cause they were one and three at this point."
31:12,520;31:13,600;"And when I was putting together,"
31:13,600;31:15,800;"I liked the Boston Globes, like sports pages"
31:15,800;31:18,320;"for the day of and then the day after,"
31:18,320;31:19,600;"like pre-imposed game."
31:19,600;31:23,160;"The front page of the sports section,"
31:23,160;31:25,000;"the day of the game didn't have anything"
31:25,000;31:26,280;"about the Patriots on it."
31:26,280;31:27,240;"Oh yeah, that's right."
31:27,240;31:28,720;"Just wasn't there."
31:28,720;31:32,160;"And it wasn't like the Red Sox,"
31:32,160;31:33,960;"I think the Red Sox have been eliminated for the playoffs."
31:33,960;31:34,960;"So just talking about like,"
31:34,960;31:38,000;"it was all just baseball playoffs basically,"
31:38,000;31:39,080;"and some hockey stuff,"
31:39,080;31:42,200;"but there was no mention of the Patriots."
31:42,200;31:43,800;"- I mean, that's pretty interesting though."
31:43,800;31:45,600;"It's been what, almost 20 years"
31:45,600;31:47,400;"since they were an afterthought."
31:47,400;31:50,040;"- Yeah, yeah, 'cause it wouldn't happen again."
31:50,040;31:52,920;"'Cause this is when they kind of started winning"
31:52,920;31:57,920;"and it didn't really stop for the next night."
31:57,920;32:00,720;"- Well, the other incredible thing about this is like,"
32:00,720;32:04,520;"and I don't know if I mentioned this last week,"
32:04,520;32:09,520;"but watching this team kind of grow from the 2000 season"
32:09,520;32:12,560;"until now and then eventually what they became,"
32:12,560;32:15,960;"it's almost as if like you were watching like the bangles,"
32:15,960;32:16,800;"right?"
32:16,800;32:20,000;"So the bangles, you know, they, they crap themselves"
32:20,000;32:22,400;"every year and then one year there's this kid,"
32:22,400;32:26,200;"You know, like the min-shoe guy or all these people."
32:26,200;32:29,640;"And they take the tea by storm and they never let it up, right?"
32:29,640;32:32,080;"So, you know, they don't lose their job."
32:32,080;32:34,560;"They were and it just continues from that point on."
32:34,560;32:37,840;"So imagine the Bengals just becoming a powerhouse"
32:37,840;32:40,160;"for the next 20 years tomorrow."
32:40,160;32:41,680;"That's what happened basically."
32:41,680;32:46,680;"- Yeah, when they're $100 million starting,"
32:46,680;32:48,480;"like franchise starting quarterback goes down"
32:48,480;32:49,320;"and they're like, you know what fuck,"
32:49,320;32:51,080;"we're gonna start this random dude"
32:51,080;32:52,400;"Nobody's ever heard of."
32:52,400;32:54,360;"Yeah, like a gardener Minshew."
32:54,360;32:57,160;"Yeah, if you just taken them and just won the rest of the games"
32:57,160;33:00,240;"and won the Super Bowl and then stuck around for the next 20"
33:00,240;33:05,360;"years, that's really hard to imagine."
33:05,360;33:07,440;"Even if you want to put like Patrick Holmes in that list,"
33:07,440;33:11,240;"it's like, yeah, they got rid of a solid quarterback"
33:11,240;33:12,240;"in Alex Smith."
33:12,240;33:13,800;"And now all of a sudden, this kid that nobody really knew"
33:13,800;33:16,480;"about even though he was drafting the first round,"
33:16,480;33:17,400;"taking the world by storm."
33:17,400;33:19,040;"But even he's struggling."
33:19,040;33:22,940;"And he didn't want to Super Bowls for us."
33:22,940;33:24,140;"You're like, what the fuck?"
33:24,140;33:25,640;"Right, right."
33:25,640;33:26,640;"MDP."
33:26,640;33:27,440;"Yeah."
33:27,440;33:31,440;"But the one thing I noticed about the Patriots offensive"
33:31,440;33:35,840;"game plan this was that it seemed like they were going to be"
33:35,840;33:40,040;"trusting Tom Brady in the game, even against this defense."
33:40,040;33:40,740;"Right."
33:40,740;33:42,240;"I mean, that's interesting."
33:42,240;33:46,140;"You think of a had that going in because the run game was"
33:46,140;33:47,840;"not working from the beginning."
33:47,840;33:48,840;"That's true."
33:48,840;33:54,740;"But I mean, like they started the second drive, like inside their own 10 yard line."
33:54,740;34:01,200;"The first play was, yeah, five wide zero running back, like empty backfield and letting Tom"
34:01,200;34:02,840;"Bray throughout of his own end zone."
34:02,840;34:03,840;"Like."
34:03,840;34:04,840;"Yeah, you're right."
34:04,840;34:09,080;"I mean, I also like, so he threw over 50 passes in this game, which is insane."
34:09,080;34:10,080;"He did."
34:10,080;34:11,520;"This is actually, I was looking it up."
34:11,520;34:16,400;"It's the kind of 11th most passages I've ever thrown."
34:16,400;34:17,400;"That's crazy."
34:17,400;34:18,400;"Yeah."
34:18,400;34:21,440;"I was also wondering, because I mean, that defense was like brutal."
34:21,440;34:26,940;"I mean, it was, you know, they're fast, they're big, and they blitz a lot, especially with"
34:26,940;34:29,780;"Rodney and Jr."
34:29,780;34:36,280;"So, do you think that part of it was, especially when the run game just crapped itself, do"
34:36,280;34:39,840;"you think that Bella Chek was like, ""You know what?"
34:39,840;34:42,600;"We're going to give this kid experience and whatever happens happens."""
34:42,600;34:47,480;"Or do you think it was more of a, ""We're going to win this by doing it this way?"""
34:47,480;34:50,640;"I mean, I think I don't know."
34:50,640;34:52,720;"It felt like they were like,"
34:52,720;34:56,160;"yeah, no, this kid can do what we ask of him."
34:56,160;34:57,720;"And I don't think they were asking a ton"
34:57,720;35:00,280;"'cause there was a whole lot of like bubble screens"
35:00,280;35:03,320;"and basically it seemed like they told them,"
35:03,320;35:05,600;"you know, if one of your wide receivers,"
35:05,600;35:08,240;"if the defensive back plane against him"
35:08,240;35:10,220;"is often for 10 yards, just like catch a ball"
35:10,220;35:13,520;"and chuck it at him and let him get that eight, nine yards,"
35:13,520;35:15,000;"you know, before the guy can catch them."
35:15,000;35:16,800;"'Cause they did that a bunch of times."
35:16,800;35:20,760;"So what you're saying is that the top ready game plan hasn't changed for 20 years."
35:20,760;35:24,280;"Well, I mean, he was still throwing down the ball."
35:24,280;35:27,200;"He could throw a beautiful outrope."
35:27,200;35:31,760;"He could, but his deep ball, man, like I wrote that that was like one of the weaker,"
35:31,760;35:36,200;"you know, the weaker spots in his game was his,"
35:36,200;35:42,040;"I know he's never been like a perfect deep ball guy anyway, but in this game,"
35:42,040;35:44,080;"I, it looked like it needed to be worked on."
35:44,080;35:46,280;"Like, yeah, he was precisely accurate."
35:46,280;35:48,640;"his decision making was great."
35:48,640;35:51,120;"But like yeah, his deep balls were a little off."
35:51,120;35:53,920;"- I thought he had a couple that were like right"
35:53,920;35:56,280;"in the money, but they were dropped."
35:56,280;35:58,560;"Like number one, specifically from Patton down the sideline."
35:58,560;36:03,560;"But yeah, it was surprising to see him overthrowing deep balls."
36:03,560;36:04,840;"- Yeah, I don't know."
36:04,840;36:07,920;"I mean, obviously you need timing down with those guys."
36:07,920;36:08,760;"- Yeah."
36:08,760;36:10,120;"- You know, you need to know what works."
36:10,120;36:11,680;"- But like, you don't ever really see him"
36:11,680;36:13,120;"overthrow anybody anymore."
36:13,120;36:13,960;"Like that's not the-"
36:13,960;36:14,800;"- 'Cause he can't."
36:14,800;36:16,160;"(laughing)"
36:16,160;36:19,240;"Just kidding, guys."
36:19,240;36:23,440;"But yeah, so this game he did throw his first ever touchdown"
36:23,440;36:30,080;"pass to the vaunted Terry Glenn, who had a--"
36:30,080;36:33,120;"what I felt was a very Terry Glenn game."
36:33,120;36:35,240;"Yeah, I mean, I agree."
36:35,240;36:41,320;"And before we even get into that, do you find it odd"
36:41,320;36:43,360;"compared to maybe now even--"
36:43,360;36:45,080;"do you find it odd that Bella checked"
36:45,080;36:49,320;"after suspending from a year, then he got reduced to four games and then he was forced to come back."
36:49,320;36:56,440;"He didn't have to play him. So, did you find that it was odd that once the suspicion got reduced,"
36:56,440;37:00,760;"that he was disactive in the first game that he was back?"
37:00,760;37:06,520;"No. For a couple reasons. One, the main reason is because"
37:06,520;37:13,160;"Belichick always says, ""I'm doing what's best for the team."" And what's best for the team is to"
37:13,160;37:17,260;"have that talent on the field. And especially because it was"
37:17,260;37:21,080;"this defense. Because they I'm guessing they knew they were"
37:21,080;37:25,080;"going to have to throw it. And so to give Brady that option"
37:25,080;37:28,820;"because I don't remember how many catches he had in the first"
37:28,820;37:29,840;"half to England, but"
37:29,840;37:32,880;"think it was like nine. Yeah, and he went for like 97 yards"
37:32,880;37:33,520;"in a touchdown."
37:33,520;37:35,820;"Or maybe it was like six actually, but yeah, it was up"
37:35,820;37:39,280;"there. It's not like the yeah, but he was kind of the the main"
37:39,280;37:42,840;"option for Brady throwing balls kind of at the sideline that"
37:42,840;37:44,600;"Terry Glenn would make these diving."
37:44,600;37:55,640;"Total amazing, which, I mean, if social media was like prominent, um, around that time, that would be, he might be like the next Odell Beckham."
37:55,640;37:56,560;"Based on. Oh, yeah."
37:56,560;37:57,760;"He's catches alone."
37:57,760;37:59,600;"Yeah, he was, he was making a ton of them."
37:59,600;38:07,120;"I mean, he, I think he had one catch in the second half, but so very, very, very, very, very, very, like, disappeared immediately when the game actually started."
38:07,120;38:12,320;"How about, dude, he, he had that, I think three back to back sideline grabs and they were all like one of them."
38:12,400;38:17,360;"he went dead leg. He basically had the ball as he was flying out of bounds. His legs drop."
38:17,360;38:23,120;"And I don't know how this is humanly possible, but they drop. He did another one that was very"
38:23,120;38:28,720;"similar than the third time. He definitely caught a sideline catch and they called it incomplete."
38:28,720;38:33,600;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. Anyway, whatever. But that was a beautiful catch as well. So,"
38:33,600;38:38,320;"it was incredible to watch. But yeah, he felt he disappeared in the second half or whatever."
38:38,320;38:46,920;"Yeah. Yeah. It's just typical Terry Glenn. Like, I mean, we're talking before we is"
38:46,920;38:53,040;"entire career with the Patriots. He never had multiple touchdowns in a game. Right."
38:53,040;39:00,640;"Which is mind blowing for how good of a player he was. Well, did I see the Randy Moss number"
39:00,640;39:04,440;"I believe you made that claim."
39:04,440;39:05,440;"Yeah."
39:05,440;39:08,600;"So I mean, I believe it was quickly debunked."
39:08,600;39:11,920;"But yeah, if you want to stick with that, you're more the logon."
39:11,920;39:16,520;"OK, I'm just saying that, you know, great players don't necessarily have that."
39:16,520;39:18,040;"Yeah."
39:18,040;39:21,680;"But no, I was correlating this to things like, like,"
39:21,680;39:26,480;"one of West Walker was like, you know, making a couple of foot jokes with."
39:26,480;39:27,480;"Yeah."
39:27,480;39:28,840;"What's his face?"
39:28,840;39:34,040;"Right. Yeah. So, though attack, even though wasn't the greatest thing for the team,"
39:34,040;39:38,840;"he'd bench them for the first quarter of that game and they lost. So true. Yeah."
39:38,840;39:43,320;"I'm like, why? Where's the double standard? Unless he just didn't like West, which I know"
39:43,320;39:51,080;"that that is sort of rumored anyway, but yeah. Yeah. I don't know. I mean, I wonder if we would"
39:51,080;39:55,880;"know more if this, like you said, this was happening today and the age of social media and"
39:57,080;40:04,380;"And if it would be more along the lines of seeing what Antonio Brown has been putting out there, it would have been similar to that."
40:04,380;40:10,620;"Yeah, I don't know. But less was like such a quiet dude anyway, except for that one moment."
40:10,620;40:14,180;"Yeah. I thought fairly severely. I mean, was that a playoff game?"
40:14,180;40:19,480;"Mm. I think it was. Was that the playoff game? I don't remember. Yeah."
40:19,480;40:22,140;"I'm pretty sure it was a playoff game. It was a game for the quarter."
40:22,140;40:25,100;"It may have been. Yeah. That was just a bad game all around."
40:25,540;40:33,060;"So I don't know. Now here's a, you know, maybe it's an out there question. I don't know. You can tell me, but"
40:33,060;40:39,300;"do you think that we could get Belichick on here at some point and have him discuss that?"
40:39,300;40:42,900;"After he retires, yes."
40:42,900;40:44,260;"Oh, you think so?"
40:44,260;40:48,180;"I think that would, yeah, because by the time we've actually caught up to"
40:48,180;40:54,100;"modern day patriots in 19 years or however long it'll take us to do that,"
40:54,500;40:58,900;"He'll will hopefully have eventually retired at that point if he's still alive and then we will"
40:58,900;41:02,260;"have him on because we will be the preeminent uh Patriots podcast."
41:02,260;41:04,900;"Dude in like 20 years I'm going to hold you to this."
41:04,900;41:06,340;"Okay all right."
41:06,340;41:07,140;"If I remember."
41:07,140;41:11,540;"If either of us is still alive in 20 years let's be honest."
41:11,540;41:12,660;"It's a long time."
41:12,660;41:19,220;"Yeah um all right so going back to Brady though one of the note I had on here was um"
41:20,100;41:24,020;"a couple, but the one that I want to talk about next is I"
41:24,020;41:27,940;"noticed that there was a whole lot of hard counts from Tom Brady."
41:27,940;41:32,740;"And I think that was in direct correlation to what the charges defense was doing."
41:32,740;41:41,620;"Because it felt like every single play, at least Junior Seo, if not both middle linebackers,"
41:41,620;41:45,460;"would run up and pretend to try time the snap count."
41:46,420;41:51,540;"And both of them kind of like jumped on either side of the center there."
41:51,540;42:02,500;"And I think even on the first drive, they had, I hadn't written down somewhere, but they, the"
42:02,500;42:07,220;"first, I think it was the first drive they had two off-size penalties trying to time that."
42:07,220;42:07,940;"Yeah."
42:07,940;42:10,900;"That jump and at least one of them was on junior sale."
42:10,900;42:15,060;"And then again, like towards the end of the game, even Rodney Harrison got into it was like trying"
42:15,060;42:17,100;"trying to time that would like jump over."
42:17,100;42:18,580;"And actually on occasion,"
42:18,580;42:21,500;"I actually managed to get back on size"
42:21,500;42:26,500;"before the ball was actually snapped, but it was very like."
42:26,500;42:27,980;"- That was sort of a knock on them"
42:27,980;42:29,580;"at that time in their careers as well though,"
42:29,580;42:31,820;"because I think they were very sharp and aggressive,"
42:31,820;42:34,380;"but then at the same time, they were also very emotional."
42:34,380;42:35,220;"- Yeah."
42:35,220;42:38,620;"- And so, if one or two things goes awry"
42:38,620;42:40,900;"or you hurt your team,"
42:40,900;42:42,420;"I mean, they might be overcompensating"
42:42,420;42:44,900;"and that sort of creates a whole different issue"
42:44,900;42:45,900;"with the defense."
42:45,900;42:48,440;"- Oh, absolutely."
42:48,440;42:53,920;"So yeah, I mean, I think they had,"
42:53,920;42:55,800;"I know the Chargers end this game"
42:55,800;42:59,520;"with like twice as many penalties as the Patriots had."
42:59,520;43:01,480;"The vast majority of those were on the defense"
43:01,480;43:04,160;"for things like jumping off sides"
43:04,160;43:08,200;"or just getting a bit too, like I said, emotional."
43:08,200;43:09,040;"- Right."
43:09,040;43:11,040;"Well, and I also thought it was interesting"
43:11,040;43:13,720;"in what Brady was doing."
43:13,720;43:16,980;"And I think it was foreshadowing the rest of his career."
43:16,980;43:18,560;"But I mean, this kid's a young kid,"
43:18,560;43:21,920;"he's third game in and the defense was aggressive."
43:21,920;43:24,220;"And he was willing to, you could already see him"
43:24,220;43:27,460;"throwing footballs at like people's feet on screens."
43:27,460;43:28,380;"- Yes."
43:28,380;43:30,940;"- So he was willing to give up that play,"
43:30,940;43:34,140;"which he never lost, but that's pretty unique"
43:34,140;43:34,980;"for a young kid."
43:34,980;43:36,980;"And I don't necessarily remember thinking"
43:36,980;43:38,180;"about that back then."
43:38,180;43:39,180;"- Right."
43:39,180;43:40,780;"- But yeah, looking back, I mean,"
43:40,780;43:43,340;"he was pretty good at avoiding that kind of stuff"
43:43,340;43:46,740;"and being aware of what was happening with the defense."
43:46,740;43:50,260;"- Yeah, it was like the antithesis of Drew Bledsoe."
43:50,260;43:51,460;"- Yeah, it really was, man."
43:51,460;43:52,300;"I mean, it was a tough--"
43:52,300;43:54,460;"- Yeah, trying to like, yeah, try to chuck that ball,"
43:54,460;43:56,980;"like no look pass over the over his shoulders."
43:56,980;44:00,060;"He's getting sacked, which is usually picked off"
44:00,060;44:02,020;"for a turn for a touchdown."
44:02,020;44:05,140;"- Yeah, no, so, and I also like, you know,"
44:05,140;44:07,660;"Bell check was already throwing out different types"
44:07,660;44:12,020;"of defense and whatnot on the other side of it."
44:12,020;44:17,900;"So there were, you can see little bits of both of them kind of coming together,"
44:17,900;44:19,400;"which was, I thought pretty cool."
44:19,400;44:20,320;"Yeah."
44:20,320;44:21,040;"Yeah."
44:21,040;44:22,120;"So let's talk about the pages, Stephen."
44:22,120;44:22,880;"That's a good segue."
44:22,880;44:23,120;"Yeah."
44:23,120;44:26,200;"Because I thought they bawled out in this game."
44:26,200;44:33,440;"This was the prototypical, Ben don't break defensive like showcase."
44:33,440;44:38,400;"Cause the charges were, I think the best team in the red zone, I think they showed"
44:38,400;44:39,320;"a stat early on."
44:39,720;44:41,160;"- Yep. - Or like, I don't know,"
44:41,160;44:42,400;"top three or whatever it was,"
44:42,400;44:44,760;"like in scoring red zone touchdowns,"
44:44,760;44:46,240;"which on assuming most of those were"
44:46,240;45:09,120;"Lydanian, Tal"
45:09,120;45:12,860;"The first and that was in the first quarter. Yeah, so it was three three at that point"
45:12,860;45:16,840;"But I think that was a major turning point just to kind of prove what they could do"
45:16,840;45:21,600;"Exactly and then they did it again at the end of the half - yep"
45:21,600;45:26,240;"And I think that actually ended in a miss field goal"
45:26,240;45:30,440;"Right yeah, yeah"
45:30,440;45:32,240;"well, no the the"
45:32,240;45:39,100;"Wasn't that wasn't the end of the half a miss by finitary actually that's right. Yeah, okay"
45:39,100;45:44,260;"Okay, yeah, so it was, yeah, it was actually to begin the second quarter."
45:44,260;45:45,020;"Right, right."
45:45,020;45:45,540;"Yeah."
45:45,540;45:46,040;"Yeah."
45:46,040;45:46,500;"No, you're right."
45:46,500;45:51,740;"Yeah, because then the charges drove all the way down and then kind of went three and"
45:51,740;45:58,620;"out in the like inside the 10-yard line, like first in goal, missed the field goal."
45:58,620;46:04,180;"And then the Patriots actually like from there marched all the way down the field and Brady"
46:04,180;46:05,740;"scored his first touchdown."
46:05,740;46:09,060;"Well, and to piggyback off of that, I know what we're talking to you, fans."
46:09,060;46:12,620;"but it was funny because Tom Brady throws his first touchdown."
46:12,620;46:13,460;"- Yeah."
46:13,460;46:15,300;"- Unitary misses the extra point."
46:15,300;46:16,300;"- Yes."
46:16,300;46:18,820;"- And then they're running the two minute drill."
46:18,820;46:21,460;"The pads are in the second quarter."
46:21,460;46:23,620;"Terry Gwen, another beautiful sideline catch."
46:23,620;46:24,460;"- Yes."
46:24,460;46:28,380;"- Brady driving it like pretty, pretty well executed,"
46:28,380;46:29,820;"two minute drill, and then"
46:29,820;46:31,220;"Unitary misses the field wall."
46:31,220;46:32,060;"- Yes."
46:32,060;46:35,220;"- So that could be an up to just crush a team right there."
46:35,220;46:37,940;"- Yeah, and just, you don't ever remember"
46:37,940;46:44,940;"of the"
46:44,940;46:45,780;"six or six and"
46:45,780;46:47,020;"all of the actual points"
46:47,020;46:50,780;"yet but he would always have one of these games every once in a while remember he had"
46:50,780;46:52,720;"one of these against the Texans where"
46:52,720;46:56,980;"the commentaries kept saying oh he's never missed a kick in doors and is over many years"
46:56,980;46:58,620;"of playing any missing"
46:58,620;47:01,980;"foreign that game before he kicked the game winner over time"
47:01,980;47:04,300;"against the team they should have blown the doors off"
47:04,300;47:08,220;"right? Yeah. So I mean, it was, I mean, they have a lot of"
47:08,220;47:10,300;"different things working against them, but we could go back to"
47:10,300;47:11,900;"the defense and tackle those later."
47:11,900;47:15,380;"Yeah. Well, I mean, no, I mean, that's fine. We can keep talking"
47:15,380;47:17,580;"about Tom Brady. I'll talk about Tom Brady for days, because"
47:17,580;47:20,660;"that two minute offense, I think should be called out as well."
47:20,660;47:26,740;"Because it was a whole I think two minute Tom Brady was still"
47:26,740;47:31,380;"there. But the offense itself, it was like a slow mo version of"
47:31,380;47:32,380;"of what they do now."
47:32,380;47:35,420;"And he was still trying to do trickery,"
47:35,420;47:37,060;"but he wasn't good at it."
47:37,060;47:39,780;"'Cause you can see him like the fake spike play."
47:39,780;47:40,620;"- Yeah."
47:40,620;47:44,100;"- Well, you can see he's calling routes to the receivers,"
47:44,100;47:44,940;"but then he's doing like,"
47:44,940;47:46,140;"oh, I'm gonna spike, I'm gonna spike it."
47:46,140;47:47,860;"And like nobody fall for that,"
47:47,860;47:49,300;"except for the commentators like,"
47:49,300;47:51,460;"oh, I can't believe we threw them all there."
47:51,460;47:52,780;"Look like a fake spike."
47:52,780;47:54,060;"- Right, right."
47:54,060;47:55,660;"- He was calling a play before he said"
47:55,660;47:56,660;"he was gonna do a fake spike."
47:56,660;47:59,660;"It took him like 45 seconds to get it off too."
47:59,660;48:03,420;"Yeah, and the awareness of just like time out and things like that."
48:03,420;48:06,380;"Like I made a note towards the end of the game as well."
48:06,380;48:10,940;"You know, he executed the way he was supposed to, but I think he left like 30"
48:10,940;48:11,940;"seconds on the clock."
48:11,940;48:16,140;"And I guess that at some point Brady would never let that happen."
48:16,140;48:16,620;"Yeah."
48:16,620;48:16,940;"Oh, yeah."
48:16,940;48:19,620;"I bet he looks back on that now and be like, Oh, what the fuck was I thinking?"
48:19,620;48:20,260;"Right."
48:20,260;48:21,980;"And it almost came back to hunt them too."
48:21,980;48:24,020;"So it's a big deal."
48:24,020;48:24,700;"Yeah."
48:24,700;48:26,460;"Yeah."
48:26,460;48:28,100;"Um, yeah."
48:28,100;48:31,780;"Yeah, we now I want to make sure we talk about that. But yeah, let's let's go back to the"
48:31,780;48:36,820;"Patriots defense, right because there was one stat at the beginning of the game that I thought"
48:36,820;48:42,500;"felt a little bit like this season kind of where"
48:42,500;48:46,980;"No, they mentioned that the Patriots defensive backs had scored more touchdowns"
48:46,980;48:51,220;"Than pages wide receivers by a margin of two to one. Yeah, that's"
48:51,220;48:56,420;"Which is brutal. It is very reminiscent of today though"
48:56,740;49:01,460;"A little bit. I mean not quite to the same extent. No, no, but yeah"
49:01,460;49:04,620;"That was a"
49:04,620;49:10,380;"Mean it to your point. I mean that's that's sort of why Terry Glimma was brought back. I guess exactly"
49:10,380;49:12,380;"Yeah, because it it had been"
49:12,380;49:19,180;"What I think a lot of comedy his favorite word is when talking about offense like this it had been anemic right?"
49:19,180;49:21,580;"It hit yeah, it hadn't been much I"
49:24,100;49:31,100;"Mean if we're gonna do a bit of a crossover Brian Cox who's been I think probably the defensive player of this season so far up into this point"
49:31,100;49:36,660;"Yeah, you know, he's the energy behind that defense too"
49:36,660;49:41,740;"So I mean oh my god, yeah guys are just throwing their bodies around yeah, and they're feeding off of him"
49:41,740;49:44,320;"You can you can feel it from from watching the game"
49:44,320;49:50,060;"But I think his big play of this game actually came on offense when he lined up his full back on a third one"
49:50,060;49:53,540;"You know and then they threw it to him and he caught it and got a first down"
49:53,540;49:58,340;"That's pretty awesome. That was beautiful. I'm like, Oh my God, a linebacker catching"
49:58,340;50:02,660;"passes from Tom Brady. This is this is some trickery. And like, Oh, just you wait."
50:02,660;50:11,380;"Rables, Rables time is coming. I mean, yeah, we don't need to touch up that now, but man,"
50:11,380;50:15,940;"his number is as a tight end or phenomenal. Really, yeah, they're out of control."
50:15,940;50:21,940;"The other the other quote I had related to the offense actually here,"
50:21,940;50:28,020;"Jumping all over the place was um tight end has been really absent from the passing game. This is where they miss a player like Ben Coates"
50:28,020;50:30,900;"Mmm, which you could replace Ben Coates with"
50:30,900;50:38,100;"Rob Gronkowski this year and it feels again very familiar in the red zone. Yeah, it's a good point"
50:38,100;50:46,580;"I mean there was talk of like, you know, the present day Patriots sort of resembling the 2003 and 2004 Patriots whereas solid defense"
50:46,580;50:49,540;"You know the these sort of shorter plays"
50:50,260;50:53,260;"relying on passing backs or receiving backs."
50:53,260;50:56,380;"So you might be right."
50:56,380;50:58,100;"Now I don't know if that has to do with Brady's age."
50:58,100;50:58,940;"I don't think so,"
50:58,940;51:00,860;"'cause I don't think his place following that much."
51:00,860;51:03,700;"I think it's just a structure of the team at this point."
51:03,700;51:05,900;"- Yeah, I think this year it's mostly just injuries"
51:05,900;51:10,900;"to all the big beef on offensive side of the ball, yeah."
51:10,900;51:15,100;"- Yeah, but in 2001,"
51:15,100;51:18,100;"I guess it was just building a foundation that this,"
51:18,100;51:26,140;"Well, I mean, I was going to say Brady can kind of build off of and, you know, have a security blanket, but I guess with the guy like blood."
51:26,140;51:30,380;"So you probably would want a security blanket if he could pick up that concept as well."
51:30,380;51:31,380;"Right."
51:31,380;51:33,100;"And I don't think you ever did, obviously, but."
51:33,100;51:35,700;"Yeah, no, I don't think so either."
51:35,700;51:46,100;"I think one of the bright spots I noticed on defense was every time lawyer, Malloy Blitz."
51:46,940;51:49,740;"Because his timing was in the pack of blood."
51:49,740;51:50,740;"Yeah."
51:50,740;51:56,340;"The, the, I wish that we could show this play, but, uh, which one there was a couple."
51:56,340;52:00,260;"Well, there's one that he blasted Flutey and he was like, it was just, it was just"
52:00,260;52:05,060;"my lawyer and him and, uh, he flew to his credit."
52:05,060;52:08,580;"I mean, he tried to kind of get away, but, uh, he did not."
52:08,580;52:10,260;"And it was not have a chance."
52:10,260;52:10,820;"Yeah."
52:10,820;52:14,300;"But yeah, cause it was one of those ones where he came from his safe position"
52:14,300;52:15,420;"and just timed it perfectly."
52:15,420;52:18,040;"So he hit the line and just came through unblocked"
52:18,040;52:20,780;"and he did it once on a running plate too"
52:20,780;52:25,520;"and caught LT in the backfield and just like lit him up."
52:25,520;52:28,480;"That man could, he could lay the wood like no other."
52:28,480;52:30,780;"- Right, we're delivered the wood"
52:30,780;52:33,100;"as we learned last week on football."
52:33,100;52:35,220;"- Yes, that is correct, yes."
52:35,220;52:38,420;"Speaking of football or not, football,"
52:38,420;52:41,060;"let's get to ya boy Lee Johnson."
52:41,900;52:46,900;"Because what you were doing out there could be considered either football or not football."
52:46,900;52:48,900;"I don't think."
52:48,900;52:51,900;"Did you like that?"
52:51,900;52:52,900;"Yeah."
52:52,900;52:54,900;"That was a segue right there, but it was great."
52:54,900;52:56,900;"And you're absolutely right."
52:56,900;52:58,900;"I don't know what the hell is going on with this guy."
52:58,900;53:02,900;"You know, it's funny to me before we even get into what happened in this game with this guy."
53:02,900;53:07,420;"At the end of the game, they interviewed over there basically like, you know, what if, what"
53:07,420;53:12,220;"you get caught what happens and he basically said I've killed us enough to"
53:12,220;53:16,260;"direct quote I've killed us enough if it happens it happens"
53:16,260;53:20,980;"yeah he's 40 years old we finished the game because of like one of his plays"
53:20,980;53:26,540;"with negative 19 Russian guys so all at all I am this I don't know maybe this"
53:26,540;53:30,580;"was his last game we'll find out but yeah I'm not sure actually he admitted"
53:30,580;53:36,380;"that he has been sucking and he was okay with being cut essentially I mean"
53:36,380;53:41,980;"this this was bad. His first punt was awful. And his second punt was really bad, but he got a"
53:41,980;53:50,380;"good bounce off it. But the last punt, uh, it felt like your typical Patriots way of losing the game,"
53:50,380;53:56,860;"where he got he got the, I think he got the, he was standing on his own 10 yard line, got the ball,"
53:56,860;54:02,540;"and went to go punt it was taken forever and a free rusher came in. So he tried to like take the"
54:02,540;54:05,980;"ball and like put it round his back. I think he was going to try sides at the guy and then"
54:05,980;54:11,740;"kick it, but they got caught him. So we kind of had it in his like, he was holding onto the end of"
54:11,740;54:17,500;"the ball with his fingers and he was getting spun around and the ball just like flew out of his"
54:17,500;54:22,380;"hand backwards. So now the ball sitting on the five yard line, the guy that tackled him gets up,"
54:22,380;54:27,340;"picks up the ball, Lee Johnson gets up and just kind of like watches him and then realize,"
54:27,340;54:32,140;"oh fuck, this place still going and goes try to tackle him. He gets lit up by some other guy who's"
54:32,140;54:37,580;"come and knock his head off all the other guy who recovered the fumble just waltzes in for a"
54:37,580;54:42,780;"touch and who was a backup fullback. He wasn't even like some sort of role player on this team."
54:42,780;54:48,460;"Right. Well, you know why he did that, which doesn't make any sense to me, but he has been"
54:48,460;54:54,700;"really for so long at this point that he said he'd seen this, you know, he's been rushed by a"
54:54,700;54:59,820;"million guys. And so he feels that like because they're all full steam ahead, you could sort of"
54:59,820;55:02,740;"of like, you know, fake them out and then get the ball off."
55:02,740;55:07,500;"But he said that even when he was in the grass with a vendor, he felt confident"
55:07,500;55:08,940;"that he could still get the kickoff."
55:08,940;55:11,900;"If anybody can see this play, he is holding it out."
55:11,900;55:16,580;"Like I can't even like give a proper analogy of this, but he's basically holding"
55:16,580;55:17,980;"it out so that anybody can grab it."
55:17,980;55:24,700;"Yeah, I feel like I'm going to see if I can cap that play and we'll put it online."
55:24,700;55:28,260;"And if that happens nowadays, that guy is cut tomorrow."
55:28,340;55:34,180;"Oh my god. And it's it's it's on sports centers, not top 10 for weeks as well."
55:34,180;55:35,900;"Cause it was brutal."
55:35,900;55:40,860;"And this was to put the Patriots down by 10 points with eight minutes left in the game."
55:40,860;55:42,260;"Yeah."
55:42,260;55:47,500;"And at this point, because again, I didn't know the score or anything going into it."
55:47,500;55:48,740;"So I was just like, Oh, wow."
55:48,740;55:49,780;"Well, they blew it."
55:49,780;55:55,700;"No, I was going to say this is exactly the point where I thought, wait, they, they"
55:55,700;55:59,300;"win this one, right? Like, did they run it out of time real"
55:59,300;56:00,220;"fucking fast here?"
56:00,220;56:04,180;"That's funny. Well, I was thinking, man, like, this is"
56:04,180;56:06,740;"going through my head a lot where, and again, I didn't know"
56:06,740;56:08,540;"what the score was going to be. So I was like, man, are they"
56:08,540;56:11,140;"gonna start off the season like one for like this isn't"
56:11,140;56:15,860;"insane? And then I was thinking, you know, you see, there's it's"
56:15,860;56:20,180;"like the butterfly effect, right? So you see one, Bledso is"
56:20,180;56:22,700;"like coaching up Brady, they're all like best friends."
56:22,700;56:23,660;"Yes. Yeah. Yeah."
56:23,940;56:27,100;"basically holding hands and sharing secrets."
56:27,100;56:32,900;"And then he's also riding high."
56:32,900;56:35,540;"Belichick is giving him opportunities."
56:35,540;56:38,940;"And of course, he wins this game and things change"
56:38,940;56:40,180;"as the season goes on."
56:40,180;56:53,920;"Maybe"
56:53,920;56:58,760;"Bledsoe within a week or two comes back. It could definitely change the course of everything. I mean"
56:58,760;57:03,240;"Yeah, that point decided to go with the backup anywhere to see what he has but it's true"
57:03,240;57:12,600;"Everything could be different and we're already said with these rules nowadays and if Bledsoe stayed with the greatest coach of all time"
57:12,600;57:15,360;"He could very well be the goat. Okay"
57:19,680;57:22,420;"be honest with yourself now he would have been good i don't know if he would have"
57:22,420;57:25,580;"been the goat he would have been the goat he he came"
57:25,580;57:26,580;"he"
57:26,580;57:29,500;"just just remember we're talking about your blood so in fourth quarters of"
57:29,500;57:30,200;"games here"
57:30,200;57:31,020;"here"
57:31,020;57:35,100;"you know that i don't know how to throw a uh... he would put up numbers"
57:35,100;57:37,860;"yet but you learn how to think it done"
57:37,860;57:40,660;"right here i would be getting to him"
57:40,660;57:44,060;"uh... and we would be talking about blood so potentially having twelve"
57:44,060;57:45,460;"super bowls right now"
57:45,460;57:46,980;"but instead"
57:46,980;57:53,660;"Brady, which potentially with like six at the moment, but potentially seven, we"
57:53,660;57:59,940;"know, but I'm not saying 12. We might we I'm not saying we might be better off"
57:59,940;58:04,820;"with blood so the things would have been different. Yes, I think so. So thank"
58:04,820;58:11,700;"God. And thank God for Lee Johnson. Guys, Brady can thank him probably for a"
58:11,700;58:15,780;"spot because he became the hero without Lee Johnson. Maybe there's no heroics at"
58:15,780;58:20,860;"the end. Maybe not this level of heroics. You know what though? I'm going to retract"
58:20,860;58:27,300;"my statement on Lee Johnson. Fuck it. I like him. Yeah, I agree. He was he was the character"
58:27,300;58:32,500;"that this team needed. Definitely a blue guy. Is that like a Batman reference? Like it"
58:32,500;58:39,660;"was the he was the villain that the hero needed? Sure. All right. We'll go with that."
58:39,660;58:43,980;"Anyways, yeah, he was the villain that the Patriots needed, man. I hope he sticks around"
58:43,980;58:45,740;"for the rest of the year. I don't know what happened."
58:45,740;58:50,840;"Yeah, me too. Yeah. So yeah, so I mean, that sets up this, the"
58:50,840;58:52,860;"pages down by 10 with eight minutes left."
58:52,860;58:55,660;"Right. I'm saying obviously it's all."
58:55,660;59:00,740;"That's great. But they, uh, they get the ball back. They drive down"
59:00,740;59:03,860;"the field and get inside the 10, but then kick a field goal"
59:03,860;59:06,660;"because they ran out of time or they ran out of like they got"
59:06,660;59:09,380;"on fourth down and they decided to kick a field goal instead."
59:09,380;59:13,460;"So now it's like, I thought it was funny because the"
59:13,460;59:18,100;"And now there's again fantastic. They're going look, what do you think? What do you think happens?"
59:18,100;59:24,500;"I think you got to go for a touchdown. You're this close. You got to go for a touchdown. And then when they bring out the the field goal unit,"
59:24,500;59:30,940;"they're like, this is a smart play. You got to take the field goal here. You're down by two anyway, down by two schools."
59:30,940;59:39,060;"I don't know yet. But they were also saying that they're like, Oh, they definitely should go for it here. It's like they I'm not surprised."
59:39,060;59:42,380;"leave the offense on the field. They should be going for touch"
59:42,380;59:45,380;"on you. It makes sense because it was third down."
59:45,380;59:51,540;"Right. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So it didn't get it then. And Brady's"
59:51,540;59:53,660;"running completion. Then fourth down comes and they they"
59:53,660;59:55,900;"trot the field goal. Like, Oh, actually, yeah, no, the field"
59:55,900;59:57,020;"goal here makes a lot of sense."
59:57,020;01:00:03,300;"Oh, so yeah, so they kick the field goal and there's like"
01:00:03,300;01:00:08,520;"four minutes left in this game with Le Donien Thomas and Doug"
01:00:08,520;01:00:10,960;"fluting his fourth quarter magic, which we had heard about."
01:00:10,960;01:00:14,640;"Pretty much for the previous three hours, I'd say."
01:00:14,640;01:00:18,360;"But the pages hold him three and out barely."
01:00:18,360;01:00:23,760;"The first, the first play of that drive was an eight yard run by LT."
01:00:23,760;01:00:25,360;"To get them the second and two."
01:00:25,360;01:00:26,240;"Right."
01:00:26,240;01:00:28,240;"We're getting towards the two minute warring."
01:00:28,240;01:00:31,000;"I'm like, they, no, they, they do win this, right?"
01:00:31,000;01:00:34,880;"That was, that was the second one, but then they, they held him two more runs, held him."
01:00:34,880;01:00:37,840;"Got to the, I think the two minute warring is it like that."
01:00:37,960;01:00:39,000;"Call a couple of timeouts."
01:00:39,000;01:00:41,320;"Get the ball back."
01:00:41,320;01:00:42,440;"Troy Brown."
01:00:42,440;01:00:45,560;"Troy Brown has a ridiculous punt return."
01:00:45,560;01:00:47,560;"He does."
01:00:47,560;01:00:50,320;"And even before that, it was before the two minute warning."
01:00:50,320;01:00:54,480;"They, uh, it was, um, after that, that eight yard run, it was the second"
01:00:54,480;01:00:56,280;"and two and a third and one with bow."
01:00:56,280;01:00:56,680;"Yes."
01:00:56,680;01:00:58,840;"Um, I think it was like two 23 left."
01:00:58,840;01:00:59,440;"Yeah."
01:00:59,440;01:01:00,360;"That's right."
01:01:00,360;01:01:01,000;"Yeah."
01:01:01,000;01:01:04,200;"So yeah, Troy Brown gets the punt return and even with that penalty that gets"
01:01:04,200;01:01:06,560;"called, it's still sizable."
01:01:06,760;01:01:11,880;"Yeah, because his return brings it to like the San Diego, San Diego 40."
01:01:11,880;01:01:13,760;"Yeah, like it was a ridiculous return."
01:01:13,760;01:01:17,380;"It's like your typical Troy Brown return, but then got called back for holding,"
01:01:17,380;01:01:20,060;"put them back on their own 40, which is still great field position."
01:01:20,060;01:01:20,900;"Yeah."
01:01:20,900;01:01:26,920;"And then Brady, Brady from this point forward and the rest of the game."
01:01:26,920;01:01:31,480;"It was like, and I'm talking defense offense, everything."
01:01:31,820;01:01:37,220;"It was probably one of the better games I've watched in a long time."
01:01:37,220;01:01:40,220;"It was yeah, it was like I was super excited."
01:01:40,220;01:01:45,020;"I'm sitting or yelling at my my TV, even though I know what happened at the"
01:01:45,020;01:01:45,500;"end."
01:01:45,500;01:01:46,020;"Right."
01:01:46,020;01:01:49,900;"I'm like, there's no way he got that because there was, you know, the"
01:01:49,900;01:01:52,980;"typical, it was basically Brady and Troy Brown at the end of the game."
01:01:52,980;01:01:54,380;"All that last drive, it felt like."
01:01:54,380;01:01:54,940;"Yeah."
01:01:54,940;01:01:57,540;"Although they haven't got about, yeah, 26 yards."
01:01:57,540;01:01:57,940;"That's right."
01:01:57,940;01:01:58,180;"Yep."
01:01:58,180;01:01:59,020;"The yard line."
01:01:59,020;01:01:59,820;"Yep."
01:01:59,820;01:02:00,460;"That's true."
01:02:01,020;01:02:05,340;"But like, that I like, so it was 40 seconds left when they're on the three."
01:02:05,340;01:02:06,240;"And this is what I'm talking about."
01:02:06,240;01:02:06,940;"They had one time out."
01:02:06,940;01:02:07,440;"Yes."
01:02:07,440;01:02:10,320;"I basically like Brady burns it with 30 seconds left."
01:02:10,320;01:02:12,300;"There's no way they do that now."
01:02:12,300;01:02:15,000;"They would probably wait for about 25 seconds, maybe."
01:02:15,000;01:02:15,420;"Yeah."
01:02:15,420;01:02:16,380;"I was gonna say 17."
01:02:16,380;01:02:16,620;"Yeah."
01:02:16,620;01:02:18,620;"Enough to run three plays and that's it."
01:02:18,620;01:02:19,740;"Exist that."
01:02:19,740;01:02:24,840;"That's what you're going to, you're going to keep running plays until you either run out of time or, well, you're going to run four"
01:02:24,840;01:02:26,460;"plays and you're going to do as quickly as possible."
01:02:26,460;01:02:28,740;"So yeah, leave yourself just enough time to do that."
01:02:28,740;01:02:29,440;"Yeah."
01:02:29,440;01:02:29,900;"And that's it."
01:02:29,900;01:02:30,580;"But yeah, you're right."
01:02:30,580;01:02:34,820;"And then the commentators are gushing over the play,"
01:02:34,820;01:02:37,660;"which is basically just a play action,"
01:02:37,660;01:02:40,580;"like a heavy run play action passing to"
01:02:40,580;01:02:44,060;"Jermaine Wiggins in the back corner of the end zone,"
01:02:44,060;01:02:46,700;"who was a lot bigger than I remember him being."
01:02:46,700;01:02:48,900;"- Yeah, and a hefty boy, that one."
01:02:48,900;01:02:51,580;"- But also like pretty like shifty too."
01:02:51,580;01:02:54,540;"He's like, you know, he had a little bit of agility to him,"
01:02:54,540;01:02:57,220;"but I felt-- - But he was definitely not"
01:02:57,220;01:03:00,100;"receiving option that the charges were"
01:03:00,100;01:03:02,620;"at all worried about because he was wide the fuck open."
01:03:02,620;01:03:04,920;"- Yeah, but I feel like this was foreshadowing"
01:03:04,920;01:03:06,760;"basically the whole playoff run."
01:03:06,760;01:03:07,680;"- Yeah, I agree."
01:03:07,680;01:03:09,100;"- We'll talk about, but Jermaine Wiggins"
01:03:09,100;01:03:11,020;"wasn't a household name, but I mean,"
01:03:11,020;01:03:13,160;"he's nearing the gear to my heart."
01:03:13,160;01:03:17,100;"- Yeah, so yeah, so that ties it up"
01:03:17,100;01:03:20,700;"with a few seconds left, like 30 something seconds left."
01:03:20,700;01:03:22,540;"You know, Paige is kicking off"
01:03:22,540;01:03:25,260;"and the charges had a ridiculous return again"
01:03:25,260;01:03:27,180;"on a kickoff like they'd basically start"
01:03:27,180;01:03:29,100;"the 40-yard line every drive."
01:03:29,100;01:03:34,260;"right. And then but wasn't that the one that tobacco Jones laid out the returner?"
01:03:34,260;01:03:39,180;"Which was right? Yeah. No, that one was. Yeah. Yeah. That and that was a, that was a"
01:03:39,180;01:03:44,220;"lawyer, a lawyer's kit. You just pretty sure that I shoulder knocked it over"
01:03:44,220;01:03:49,220;"tackling in the kickoffs and all that from that point on, everything was just"
01:03:49,220;01:03:53,500;"spectacular. It was like almost like too much. Oh, yeah, it was. Oh, yeah,"
01:03:53,500;01:04:07,500;"everything was perfect. So yeah, obviously the charges don't score. They almost got in a field goal range and then some like fuckery with Doug Flute try to spike the ball."
01:04:07,500;01:04:10,500;"I don't think I've ever seen this before. No, but he so."
01:04:10,500;01:04:12,500;"Then when I was watching this game original."
01:04:12,500;01:04:23,480;"Yeah, so he pulled the ball up to like pull his arm back to spike it and the ball fell out of his hand and then he like tried to spike it but missed and the page recovered it but be the"
01:04:23,480;01:04:27,840;"The ref said because they blew the whistle when the ball hit the ground, they still got"
01:04:27,840;01:04:30,680;"the ball back, but it moved the field go back five yards."
01:04:30,680;01:04:31,680;"Yeah."
01:04:31,680;01:04:35,080;"Who said it being like a 52 yards, a 57 yarder."
01:04:35,080;01:04:37,360;"And the kicker came up like three yards short."
01:04:37,360;01:04:41,680;"Well, and that was a big controversy not in that game, but like for a couple of years"
01:04:41,680;01:04:44,400;"where it was that whole thing where can you challenge something that has been whistled"
01:04:44,400;01:04:49,000;"down and there were enough of these plays that the eventually turned it over to what"
01:04:49,000;01:04:50,000;"it is today."
01:04:50,000;01:04:55,680;"Where you can pretty much challenge everything and overturn it, but yeah, because the whistle blue"
01:04:55,680;01:04:57,760;"There's nothing that"
01:04:57,760;01:05:02,360;"Dollar check to do about it right because that was the rule back in that that time right?"
01:05:02,360;01:05:10,360;"But yeah, so I mean even that because if you saw the replay you could see a bunch of the"
01:05:10,360;01:05:14,800;"Sideline for the charges wrong to the field thinking the guy hit the field because it was straight down the middle"
01:05:14,800;01:05:17,680;"He just missed it short by a couple yards right"
01:05:18,000;01:05:24,760;"So then I think the the kickoff that you were talking about was the one in overtime. Yes. Yes"
01:05:24,760;01:05:28,520;"You're right. I got the mix up because the charges actually won the toss right"
01:05:28,520;01:05:31,160;"Yeah, and return the ball to the 40 yard line"
01:05:31,160;01:05:36,660;"So they didn't need many yards. You go what 20 yards in your within field goal range now"
01:05:36,660;01:05:42,160;"Venatory could never kick into the end. No, not until they moved the"
01:05:42,160;01:05:45,080;"Yeah, not until they move the"
01:05:45,080;01:05:46,920;"kickoff up"
01:05:46,920;01:05:48,920;"Right, and it's not even like the"
01:05:48,920;01:05:54,560;"Gostowski thing where like you get like booted high up in the year and travel. Yeah, put it at the what no"
01:05:54,560;01:05:56,720;"He's put it like the 13 yard line. Yeah, man"
01:05:56,720;01:06:04,080;"Yeah, it was it was not a position of strength for this team at this point, right?"
01:06:04,080;01:06:11,400;"But yeah, so the Chargers get the ball at their own 40 knee basically what 20 25 yards to go"
01:06:11,400;01:06:16,720;"Yeah, and they had actually been driving like late in the second half of this game"
01:06:16,720;01:06:22,440;"the Patriots defense felt like they were kind of wearing down a bit, but in this particular"
01:06:22,440;01:06:29,040;"instance, they held, they charged one three and out, had to punt the ball back to the Patriots."
01:06:29,040;01:06:36,520;"First play from scrimmage Brady froze a bomb down the right side of the field to Patton,"
01:06:36,520;01:06:38,320;"I believe it was, David Patton."
01:06:38,320;01:06:42,720;"Yeah, but the crazy thing about this play is that it was an all-out blitz by San Diego"
01:06:42,720;01:06:45,040;"And he stood in the pocket."
01:06:45,040;01:06:51,120;"He kind of did his little dance in there and threw it up for classic, like PI."
01:06:51,120;01:06:51,720;"Yeah."
01:06:51,720;01:06:53,840;"And it was like it was a blatant past."
01:06:53,840;01:06:54,920;"It was."
01:06:54,920;01:06:55,360;"Yeah."
01:06:55,360;01:06:55,920;"Yeah."
01:06:55,920;01:07:03,240;"So Patton got dragged down by a molding who had a whole section the next day's paper,"
01:07:03,240;01:07:05,360;"talking about how he didn't think it was an actual legit call."
01:07:05,360;01:07:10,080;"But he obviously didn't watch the replay because it was pretty blatant."
01:07:10,080;01:07:14,860;"He got the ball was thrown a little bit too inside and he was playing inside technique"
01:07:14,860;01:07:19,140;"And so Pat tried to cut back inside to him and he just fucking straight up tackles ass"
01:07:19,140;01:07:25,020;"Yeah, and I've never seen anybody celebrate harder for getting a pass interference called"
01:07:25,020;01:07:30,020;"Then David Patton on that play he was dancing like a motherfist do like a legitimate jig"
01:07:30,020;01:07:31,020;"well, and it's"
01:07:31,020;01:07:33,020;"fun to do is there a"
01:07:33,020;01:07:37,120;"their celebration after this game was reminiscent of"
01:07:37,800;01:07:43,720;"Every team that I think we hate like you remember when like the Broncos with like we did yes"
01:07:43,720;01:07:46,720;"Yes, the past he's like freaking it was like the Super Bowl for them"
01:07:46,720;01:07:49,000;"This one it's Super Bowl at that time"
01:07:49,000;01:07:55,200;"Yeah, it's like the even the Ravens beating the Patriots this year with Lamar Jackson where they're taking the team photo after the game"
01:07:55,200;01:07:57,200;"Oh, yeah"
01:07:57,200;01:07:59,640;"Like this is this is the pager Super Bowl at this point"
01:07:59,640;01:08:03,960;"Yeah, it's so funny, but of course it ends on a"
01:08:05,120;01:08:10,800;"Venitary field roll. Oh, hang on a second. I gotta relocate for a second. Oh boy"
01:08:10,800;01:08:14,520;"Well, this is embarrassing"
01:08:14,520;01:08:21,480;"College eyes no you leave in don't be a bitch. She told me I live my life"
01:08:21,480;01:08:32,200;"There's nothing wrong with technical difficulties. I don't know if you're grabbing a snack or something what you're doing. I mean, I"
01:08:32,440;01:08:34,980;"Don't know we were hands are right now. I can't really see them"
01:08:34,980;01:08:39,560;"I'm shifting to the living shifting what"
01:08:39,560;01:08:43,620;"My whole setup to the living rooms there I can go to bed"
01:08:43,620;01:08:49,080;"No, but"
01:08:49,080;01:08:54,480;"We gotta keep this we gotta keep some of this you can't cut it out because it's BS"
01:08:54,480;01:08:58,780;"You gotta listen back to it if you're aggressive cut it, but some of it could be good"
01:08:59,760;01:09:06,560;"Well, I just didn't want to skip over the fact that you were trying to just like end this game without talking about"
01:09:06,560;01:09:10,320;"Brady on the next third down because I think this was"
01:09:10,320;01:09:14,980;"Probably I don't say the biggest Brady play, but it was kind of very"
01:09:14,980;01:09:21,660;"I don't know how to put it. This was kind of like that"
01:09:21,660;01:09:27,360;"It was a it was a third down it's like third and three or something like after the the passing appearance and"
01:09:27,360;01:09:29,720;"the"
01:09:29,720;01:09:34,480;"Charge brought pressure from both sides. So it's a guy coming unblocked right in a Brady's face"
01:09:34,480;01:09:39,960;"Another guy coming on his blind side who caught him like below the knees and then the other guy like chopped him over the top"
01:09:39,960;01:09:45,560;"Mmm, and you just like floated the ball over the the rush of two of them and hit oh, you're right. Yeah"
01:09:45,560;01:09:46,960;"Yeah, it was a nice touch pass"
01:09:46,960;01:09:50,360;"Yeah, cuz they were like right on the border of field goal range"
01:09:50,360;01:09:55,400;"Yeah, and Brady just like stood there and just waited to the last possible second just like lost it over the guy"
01:09:55,800;01:10:00,560;"so that fault could get the first down and now they're like well within like middle of"
01:10:00,560;01:10:06,360;"Filgal range is like a 40-something yarn instead of like a 50 like a long 50 yarder. You are correct"
01:10:06,360;01:10:08,360;"And so that was just like"
01:10:08,360;01:10:15,280;"The like the that beginning inkling of oh this Brady kid like he he doesn't get rattled at all like that"
01:10:15,280;01:10:21,080;"Just imagining like watching group led so in those situations for all these years"
01:10:21,560;01:10:30,280;"Yeah, he would have handled that. Yeah, how how he would have handled that versus this kid who's what is this his second official start"
01:10:30,280;01:10:39,580;"Third game. Yeah, so it's just that kind of like this was I think that it's just those little plays like that where you think"
01:10:39,580;01:10:42,320;"This kid might be all right"
01:10:42,320;01:10:48,440;"But yes that ended up not being so bad. There's all that whole ten year gap where we"
01:10:49,040;01:10:53,120;"thing and I'm really pissed off about that which maybe bloods close the gap. Yeah, I don't know."
01:10:53,120;01:11:01,600;"But maybe he's all right. But yes, that does lead to the field goal you so desperately"
01:11:01,600;01:11:09,440;"want to get to. Yeah, man, Vividitary all the way. Redeemed to sell money. And they also kicked"
01:11:09,440;01:11:14,160;"the field goal on third down, if you remember. They did. Yeah. Just in case there's another"
01:11:14,160;01:11:18,160;"tactic by bill and the announcers were crapping themselves."
01:11:18,160;01:11:20,720;"They had no idea what to do about it."
01:11:20,720;01:11:22,640;"They're like, Oh, it's kicking on the third down."
01:11:22,640;01:11:25,080;"Oh, what is going on here?"
01:11:25,080;01:11:28,000;"Then they didn't obviously understand why."
01:11:28,000;01:11:29,280;"Well, you know, it's funny."
01:11:29,280;01:11:35,040;"Why get in the, um, you know, those, those newspaper columns where they would"
01:11:35,040;01:11:38,080;"have like sort of like who's better on what side of the ball for every"
01:11:38,080;01:11:41,280;"game. The Patriots were always negative on everything except for coaching."
01:11:41,280;01:11:42,560;"And it was always as true."
01:11:43,280;01:11:47,480;"And I feel like, cause that time Belichick was an outside of being a defensive guy for the Giants."
01:11:47,480;01:11:48,720;"I mean, he was okay."
01:11:48,720;01:11:49,180;"Yeah."
01:11:49,180;01:11:50,960;"Um, but he always won the edge."
01:11:50,960;01:11:53,840;"And now I'm realizing it's because nobody knew what the hell he was ever doing."
01:11:53,840;01:11:55,160;"So it must be so true."
01:11:55,160;01:11:55,440;"Yeah."
01:11:55,440;01:11:56,600;"Yeah."
01:11:56,600;01:12:01,240;"I always come up to this like one, like bullshit thing that I was like, what, what was he doing here?"
01:12:01,240;01:12:01,760;"Oh my God."
01:12:01,760;01:12:03,640;"It's the genius of Belichick again."
01:12:03,640;01:12:05,720;"Cause he like, he really hadn't proven himself at this point."
01:12:05,720;01:12:08,360;"He had had that stint with the Browns where he'd done okay."
01:12:08,360;01:12:12,280;"And then he had his, uh, defensive game plan for the Super Bowl."
01:12:12,280;01:12:14,800;"when he was on the Giants as the defensive coordinator"
01:12:14,800;01:12:19,120;"in the football hall of fame, but as a head coach,"
01:12:19,120;01:12:20,460;"he wasn't like this."
01:12:20,460;01:12:24,200;"He didn't, I don't think he had that genius label yet."
01:12:24,200;01:12:26,480;"- No, and I mean, he went, yeah, the five and 11."
01:12:26,480;01:12:30,280;"I mean, it shouldn't really garner that much, but."
01:12:30,280;01:12:31,960;"- Yeah."
01:12:31,960;01:12:35,320;"- He definitely, he always edged them out"
01:12:35,320;01:12:38,440;"according to the announcers in the media,"
01:12:38,440;01:12:41,080;"which I guess was smart for once."
01:12:41,080;01:12:42,720;"But they actually got that right."
01:12:42,720;01:12:44,220;"Yeah."
01:12:44,220;01:12:45,220;"Yeah."
01:12:45,220;01:12:46,660;"Yeah, I know it was a hell of a game, man."
01:12:46,660;01:12:48,660;"I enjoyed it."
01:12:48,660;01:12:49,660;"Yeah."
01:12:49,660;01:12:52,720;"And it was also weird that going into the game--"
01:12:52,720;01:12:55,300;"and I guess after this game-- so going into the game,"
01:12:55,300;01:12:57,820;"they had a nine game winning streak versus the Chargers"
01:12:57,820;01:12:59,940;"dating back to the 7D."
01:12:59,940;01:13:00,940;"Yes."
01:13:00,940;01:13:01,440;"So--"
01:13:01,440;01:13:02,820;"Chargers of all teams."
01:13:02,820;01:13:03,320;"I know."
01:13:03,320;01:13:03,940;"It's so funny."
01:13:03,940;01:13:05,060;"And they kept it going."
01:13:05,060;01:13:06,020;"So 10 straight."
01:13:06,020;01:13:07,940;"So that was pretty great."
01:13:07,940;01:13:08,260;"Yeah."
01:13:08,260;01:13:10,340;"Eat that, San Diego."
01:13:10,340;01:13:12,440;"Yeah, San Diego is."
01:13:12,440;01:13:16,140;"You've got your weather, but we've got our 10 game winning streak."
01:13:16,140;01:13:17,600;"Yeah, fuckers."
01:13:17,600;01:13:18,500;"All right."
01:13:18,500;01:13:22,020;"Yeah, I mean, it's awesome."
01:13:22,020;01:13:28,480;"Now, you know, we've reached the end of the game here and we did not really talk"
01:13:28,480;01:13:32,380;"about, I mean, we talked a little bit about it, but we haven't really pointed"
01:13:32,380;01:13:35,900;"out the announcers as opposed to previous games."
01:13:35,900;01:13:39,180;"And I thought they were so professionally boring."
01:13:39,660;01:13:45,620;"that they were tolerable, but I was annoyed that I couldn't get anything out of them."
01:13:45,620;01:13:54,300;"Yeah, I had one quote now, but the one thing I'd like to start off by saying is, buddy, your name is Ian, not"
01:13:54,300;01:13:54,860;"I am."
01:13:54,860;01:13:56,180;"I know I am Neil."
01:13:56,180;01:14:00,420;"I wrote it as I because I, you know, I want to be accurate here."
01:14:00,420;01:14:02,140;"No, but it's still Ian."
01:14:02,140;01:14:05,900;"It is spelled in I and Eagle and Solomon Wilkots."
01:14:05,900;01:14:06,660;"Yes."
01:14:07,100;01:14:08,100;"Pretty is."
01:14:08,100;01:14:10,100;"Solomon World Cots is a fantastic name."
01:14:10,100;01:14:14,940;"For some reason, every time I see that name, I think apricots, and I don't know why, but"
01:14:14,940;01:14:18,340;"I feel like I was."
01:14:18,340;01:14:21,340;"I picture apricots."
01:14:21,340;01:14:23,340;"Apricots, huh?"
01:14:23,340;01:14:25,020;"How do you pronounce it?"
01:14:25,020;01:14:26,540;"It's a bold, bold."
01:14:26,540;01:14:27,540;"Apricots?"
01:14:27,540;01:14:28,540;"I go with apricots."
01:14:28,540;01:14:29,540;"Do you?"
01:14:29,540;01:14:30,540;"Yeah."
01:14:30,540;01:14:32,060;"That sounds a little pretentious."
01:14:32,060;01:14:36,260;"Well, growing up because, you know, my parents from England, so they always pronounce things"
01:14:36,260;01:14:37,260;"It was funny."
01:14:37,260;01:14:42,200;"So like it was it was yogurt and said yogurt and I got a whole bunch of shit for that at"
01:14:42,200;01:14:43,200;"school."
01:14:43,200;01:14:44,200;"Oh, yeah."
01:14:44,200;01:14:46,800;"I April cuts is like at least reasonable."
01:14:46,800;01:14:51,240;"That's what I yeah I got to go with the long days and the long vowels because that's usually"
01:14:51,240;01:14:52,240;"more Americans."
01:14:52,240;01:14:53,240;"I don't actually know."
01:14:53,240;01:14:56,080;"I legit don't know if you're fucking with me or not."
01:14:56,080;01:14:58,080;"I think I."
01:14:58,080;01:14:59,080;"Maybe apricots."
01:14:59,080;01:15:00,080;"I don't know."
01:15:00,080;01:15:01,080;"Yeah."
01:15:01,080;01:15:02,080;"I'm not."
01:15:02,080;01:15:03,080;"My parents are Portuguese."
01:15:03,080;01:15:04,920;"- I'm not gonna do my fan- - My fan-tour Portuguese,"
01:15:04,920;01:15:07,520;"so I'm not doing my fan-tour in this form."
01:15:07,520;01:15:10,320;"- That's fair, but Abracot sounds too like,"
01:15:10,320;01:15:11,680;"this is how the English pronounce it,"
01:15:11,680;01:15:13,520;"and you're gonna get shit on in third grade"
01:15:13,520;01:15:16,000;"for saying it incorrectly, so I'm gonna do my fan-tour."
01:15:16,000;01:15:17,920;"- Okay, fair enough."
01:15:17,920;01:15:18,760;"Go on, this is yours."
01:15:18,760;01:15:21,760;"- But I had one comments from them."
01:15:21,760;01:15:23,700;"They were talking about meeting"
01:15:23,700;01:15:25,520;"Lydanian Talmensen for the first time."
01:15:25,520;01:15:28,440;"I don't know which one I was that said it,"
01:15:28,440;01:15:29,800;"but he said I was very surprised"
01:15:29,800;01:15:31,400;"with the size of his lower body."
01:15:32,360;01:15:38,160;"Oh, yeah, I feel like that can be a long term, but I do know what that one means."
01:15:38,160;01:15:41,360;"So it wouldn't be a question for you, but bringing that up."
01:15:41,360;01:15:46,840;"I think he did eventually clarify that he was talking about his, his size."
01:15:46,840;01:15:50,320;"Yes. Yes."
01:15:50,320;01:15:52,720;"Yeah, he's like a green region."
01:15:52,720;01:15:54,800;"Yeah. Oh, he just the lower body in general."
01:15:54,800;01:15:56,240;"It was all very big."
01:15:56,240;01:15:58,560;"Yeah. Oh, oh, I see."
01:15:58,560;01:16:02,280;"OK, so that was I thought he meant it the other way, which is kind of,"
01:16:02,280;01:16:09,160;"weird because the other guy was laughing too. I don't know. But that does bring me to the"
01:16:09,160;01:16:12,680;"next thing where I didn't think I was going to have enough terms that I didn't understand."
01:16:12,680;01:16:13,680;"But I got a couple."
01:16:13,680;01:16:14,680;"Oh, you did. Okay."
01:16:14,680;01:16:18,640;"You know, for a little bit of, and you know, I'm assuming we're going to run out of these"
01:16:18,640;01:16:21,480;"things that I don't know because I usually know a lot."
01:16:21,480;01:16:24,560;"But you're learning. Yeah. So you'll know them from here on out."
01:16:24,560;01:16:27,760;"So I don't know if this is ever going to come back. But for now, we got another football"
01:16:27,760;01:16:34,240;"football going on here. And let me, you know, like I said, I'm gonna throw out a couple of things"
01:16:34,240;01:16:38,080;"that I don't quite get. I did get the lower body thing. Well, I thought that I didn't see"
01:16:38,080;01:16:43,920;"clarified. But if you could just clarify these things for me, explain it to the people out there."
01:16:43,920;01:16:53,040;"Absolutely. Typical terms. But so the first one is carrying the load."
01:16:55,360;01:16:57,360;"carrying football and football."
01:16:57,360;01:17:01,440;"That is technically football, yes."
01:17:01,440;01:17:03,000;"Okay, so what does that mean?"
01:17:03,000;01:17:09,760;"I think it's oftentimes when running backs tend to get a higher workload."
01:17:09,760;01:17:14,280;"And the end that the team is kind of running through them and they're getting into a rhythm."
01:17:14,280;01:17:17,880;"The running back is said to be carrying the load."
01:17:17,880;01:17:19,040;"Oh, I see."
01:17:19,040;01:17:20,600;"Carrying the team on their back sort of."
01:17:20,600;01:17:23,720;"Oh, so wait, could a quarterback carry the load as well?"
01:17:23,720;01:17:24,920;"Or does that not apply?"
01:17:24,920;01:17:29,920;"It probably could, but it tends to be used in,"
01:17:29,920;01:17:31,480;"with running back to some reason."
01:17:31,480;01:17:32,840;"Probably because they're dragging people"
01:17:32,840;01:17:34,680;"around on their backs as well."
01:17:34,680;01:17:37,160;"So it's also like a physical carrying of the load."
01:17:37,160;01:17:38,560;"- Gotcha."
01:17:38,560;01:17:40,200;"All right, so that makes sense."
01:17:40,200;01:17:45,200;"Next one here is taking it right up in there."
01:17:45,200;01:17:47,040;"- Ooh."
01:17:47,040;01:17:54,680;"I can see how that could be confused as a football term."
01:17:54,680;01:17:57,720;"Okay. Wait, do you think it's not football on this one?"
01:17:57,720;01:18:01,040;"I'm more on the fence with this one."
01:18:01,040;01:18:02,920;"Taking it right up in there."
01:18:02,920;01:18:04,720;"I think I was, I was in sure."
01:18:04,720;01:18:08,240;"I think there's some context around that that would probably be pretty valuable."
01:18:08,240;01:18:09,760;"Well, that's, that's true."
01:18:09,760;01:18:11,560;"I didn't write down what came before."
01:18:11,560;01:18:12,880;"After so I'm not really sure."
01:18:12,880;01:18:15,320;"It just kind of threw me out because I've heard before."
01:18:15,320;01:18:18,000;"I'm wondering if you had the wrong tab open for that one."
01:18:18,000;01:18:20,280;"Oh, no, no."
01:18:20,280;01:18:21,320;"What do you mean by that?"
01:18:21,320;01:18:24,640;"Um, I mean, I think that, uh,"
01:18:24,640;01:18:30,040;"you may have been on a site that was a background with some yellow. Yes, I was."
01:18:30,040;01:18:34,720;"Yeah, okay. Yeah, but I don't know. So we're gonna say not football on that one."
01:18:34,720;01:18:39,480;"Yeah, that's a gray area. I think we're gonna, yeah. Okay, this one I'm pretty"
01:18:39,480;01:18:44,580;"certain of what it is, but the next one was getting excited every time he touches"
01:18:44,580;01:18:50,720;"the ball. And like I think that's football. Who are they talking about?"
01:18:50,720;01:18:56,200;"I don't know. I don't know. I'm going to do a better job about this because because because that I think that would"
01:18:56,200;01:19:01,540;"Great explain whether it was or wasn't football because if we're talking about"
01:19:01,540;01:19:06,520;"Let's say Doug flute then that's probably football. But if we're talking about"
01:19:06,520;01:19:14,080;"True blood so in this case and maybe not. Oh, I see. Yeah, I gotta I gotta do it better with the with the context because I"
01:19:14,080;01:19:17,800;"I'm not sure on that one. So we'll I don't know if it"
01:19:19,920;01:19:25,080;"I got two more on this one one. Oh, it is about with the Indian I wrote so we go nice. Okay"
01:19:25,080;01:19:31,800;"Tomlinson only has one goal of one. Oh, sorry. I fucked that up one hole"
01:19:31,800;01:19:38,920;"To go through the time only has one hole to go through and I think we were talking about last week"
01:19:38,920;01:19:45,180;"Oh, yes, gaping holes and what not gaping holes and yeah and squeezing through them or something the tight holes or something"
01:19:45,180;01:19:48,960;"Yeah, I'm guessing and this is like you said just learning as we go"
01:19:49,680;01:19:57,180;"He only has one hole to go through is when the alignment aren't doing that great of a job or something."
01:19:57,180;01:20:00,380;"And like, you walk me through this one. I think it's something that..."
01:20:00,380;01:20:09,180;"No, I think you're on the right track. And it might even be like a play call specific as well, where there's only one specified hole that's trying to be blocked open."
01:20:09,180;01:20:12,380;"Oh, okay. So it was designed that way."
01:20:12,380;01:20:17,500;"Yes, and I don't think it's anything to do with whoever he is or is"
01:20:17,500;01:20:20,860;"in dating as well and how she feels about that sort of stuff."
01:20:20,860;01:20:24,260;"Oh, in this case, what do you think he's into?"
01:20:24,260;01:20:26,860;"Like in that respect, if we're talking about that, I don't know."
01:20:26,860;01:20:31,500;"I don't know if you've ever talked to my guess is probably humiliation sort of"
01:20:31,500;01:20:32,500;"things."
01:20:32,500;01:20:34,740;"So just just a wild guess."
01:20:34,740;01:20:38,860;"What he's all the receiving end of this."
01:20:38,860;01:20:41,740;"I could see that."
01:20:41,740;01:20:42,240;"Yeah."
01:20:42,240;01:20:43,240;"OK."
01:20:43,240;01:20:43,840;"All right."
01:20:43,840;01:20:44,040;"Yeah."
01:20:44,040;01:20:44,400;"I don't know."
01:20:44,400;01:20:45,240;"That's the one here there."
01:20:45,240;01:20:48,040;"But I think it's a winding issue thing."
01:20:48,040;01:20:51,240;"Well, I'm then finally this one the announcer said."
01:20:51,240;01:20:53,840;"And again, I don't have context on what the hell he was talking about."
01:20:53,840;01:20:54,840;"So I apologize."
01:20:54,840;01:20:56,640;"Well, we'll try to figure it out anyway."
01:20:56,640;01:20:56,940;"All right."
01:20:56,940;01:21:01,040;"He says, I want to be one of the eight men in the box."
01:21:01,040;01:21:03,040;"Oh boy."
01:21:03,040;01:21:07,140;"And that one really like hurt my ears up a little bit."
01:21:07,140;01:21:08,040;"So that's a far enough."
01:21:08,040;01:21:08,540;"A ball."
01:21:08,540;01:21:10,640;"You listen to these games different than most people."
01:21:10,640;01:21:12,900;"(laughing)"
01:21:12,900;01:21:15,640;"- I'm just curious."
01:21:15,640;01:21:20,580;"- There is a box in football."
01:21:20,580;01:21:21,420;"- Okay."
01:21:21,420;01:21:23,180;"- And there do happen to be men in that box."
01:21:23,180;01:21:25,900;"So I think in this case, that football."
01:21:25,900;01:21:27,640;"There can be up to eight, yes."
01:21:27,640;01:21:28,480;"- Okay."
01:21:28,480;01:21:30,500;"- It's usually how many defenders are in that box,"
01:21:30,500;01:21:34,500;"which is within a few yards of the line of scrimmage."
01:21:34,500;01:21:35,660;"- Oh, I got you okay."
01:21:35,660;01:21:36,500;"- In the middle there."
01:21:36,500;01:21:37,340;"- So short."
01:21:37,340;01:21:39,100;"- Like towards the line, I'm in a game."
01:21:39,100;01:21:39,940;"- Yes, yeah."
01:21:39,940;01:21:42,420;"A lot of these are trenches as they call it."
01:21:42,420;01:21:43,620;"Yes, exactly."
01:21:43,620;01:21:44,620;"Okay."
01:21:44,620;01:21:46,100;"Now that makes sense."
01:21:46,100;01:21:47,100;"So that's all I got."
01:21:47,100;01:21:50,460;"I'll try to have more context if any of these things pop up in the future."
01:21:50,460;01:21:51,700;"That'd be beautiful."
01:21:51,700;01:21:52,700;"Yeah."
01:21:52,700;01:21:53,900;"Yeah, that's a great, that's a great segment."
01:21:53,900;01:21:54,900;"I love it."
01:21:54,900;01:21:55,900;"Well, thank you."
01:21:55,900;01:21:57,500;"I'm learning a lot."
01:21:57,500;01:21:58,500;"Good."
01:21:58,500;01:21:59,500;"Good."
01:21:59,500;01:22:00,500;"That's what we're here for."
01:22:00,500;01:22:05,420;"We want to share our knowledge of football and our love of football with the greater population."
01:22:05,420;01:22:09,460;"So I appreciate you bringing these things and being so vulnerable."
01:22:09,460;01:22:13,060;"No, saying that you don't know things and bringing that to the forefoot."
01:22:13,060;01:22:16,060;"Yeah, it's not my forte, but I'm trying to work on it."
01:22:16,060;01:22:17,260;"No, I appreciate that."
01:22:17,260;01:22:18,660;"I appreciate that as well."
01:22:18,660;01:22:19,660;"All right."
01:22:19,660;01:22:23,860;"So with that being said, how about we get into our best and worst to wrap this up?"
01:22:23,860;01:22:24,860;"All right."
01:22:24,860;01:22:26,160;"That sounds good to me."
01:22:26,160;01:22:28,860;"Did you want to go first?"
01:22:28,860;01:22:35,300;"Well, I also wanted to talk a little bit about just a little thing that I found out"
01:22:35,300;01:22:38,420;"about Troy Brown and Terry Glenn before we get into that."
01:22:38,420;01:22:44,340;"And it was basically, well, Terry Glenn, I don't know if he says things to be a"
01:22:44,340;01:22:47,340;"brace of or not, but it was just interesting to the little sound bites that"
01:22:47,340;01:22:51,940;"like, you know, I found, but when after the game, he was talking about braiding"
01:22:51,940;01:22:55,180;"and they were like, you know, how do you think he did or whatever?"
01:22:55,180;01:22:58,700;"And he said he's young and wants to prove himself."
01:22:58,700;01:22:59,980;"That's an advantage for us."
01:22:59,980;01:23:04,340;"He might not have tried some of the plays that he did if he was eight or nine"
01:23:04,340;01:23:07,300;"years in. I was wondering, is that a shot a drew?"
01:23:07,300;01:23:09,860;"I don't know."
01:23:09,860;01:23:14,080;"I mean, it's I don't think he would say that, but it just kind of came off as"
01:23:14,080;01:23:16,460;"like you're kind of throwing them on the bus a little bit."
01:23:16,460;01:23:20,140;"I think it was more is like, he's too stupid to know better is what it feels"
01:23:20,140;01:23:20,420;"like."
01:23:20,420;01:23:21,180;"Okay. Yeah."
01:23:21,180;01:23:21,700;"It was a drag."
01:23:21,700;01:23:23,940;"You try to say the right thing and it came off a little bit weird."
01:23:23,940;01:23:24,780;"Yeah."
01:23:24,780;01:23:29,060;"Um, and then the other thing that I thought was funny was that apparently"
01:23:29,060;01:23:32,820;"Terry went through his, uh, you know, Tom Brady's first touchdown pass, the"
01:23:32,820;01:23:38,740;"football into the stands for the game so that he was actually a little bit annoyed by that."
01:23:38,740;01:23:41,220;"He would have given the football to Brady."
01:23:41,220;01:23:42,740;"Of course he would."
01:23:42,740;01:23:43,740;"Right."
01:23:43,740;01:23:44,740;"So it's true."
01:23:44,740;01:23:45,740;"He's you both personalities there."
01:23:45,740;01:23:47,740;"But yeah, that's the worst here."
01:23:47,740;01:23:48,740;"Yeah."
01:23:48,740;01:23:52,500;"I mean, we've talked quite a bit about everything."
01:23:52,500;01:23:57,820;"But I would say one thing that we did not talk about is Antoine Smith didn't have a"
01:23:57,820;01:23:58,820;"great game."
01:23:58,820;01:24:00,460;"I think he had like 30 or 40 yards rushing on everybody."
01:24:00,460;01:24:01,460;"He didn't have a touchdown."
01:24:01,460;01:24:04,620;"was in the third was on the goal line."
01:24:04,620;01:24:08,020;"And, you know, he was running up the middle basically."
01:24:08,020;01:24:09,780;"And Junior say out, it was one of those"
01:24:09,780;01:24:12,180;"that he timed perfectly like you were talking about."
01:24:12,180;01:24:13,020;"- Yeah."
01:24:13,020;01:24:15,980;"- And he just pops Antoine Smith."
01:24:15,980;01:24:17,820;"- He took his fucking head off."
01:24:17,820;01:24:19,980;"- Yeah, and he falls back like two or three yards."
01:24:19,980;01:24:25,140;"And then somehow ducks under a couple of people flying out"
01:24:25,140;01:24:27,100;"and then dives for the touchdown."
01:24:27,100;01:24:29,180;"- Yeah, it doesn't fall over on that sail hit,"
01:24:29,180;01:24:30,620;"which I don't know if it ever happened."
01:24:30,620;01:24:32,260;"Like did you see sales reaction?"
01:24:32,260;01:24:33,740;"It was like, how the hell did that guy knock?"
01:24:33,740;01:24:35,620;"- Yeah, yeah, he was celebrating"
01:24:35,620;01:24:37,060;"that he tackled over two yard loss"
01:24:37,060;01:24:39,620;"and he ended up scoring touchdown from it."
01:24:39,620;01:24:41,900;"- Yeah, no, that was pretty badass."
01:24:41,900;01:24:43,900;"- Again, that was actually gonna be my best as well."
01:24:43,900;01:24:44,740;"Just so you know."
01:24:44,740;01:24:45,580;"- Oh really?"
01:24:45,580;01:24:49,940;"That's what, and then the, well, I mean,"
01:24:49,940;01:24:51,720;"that I guess that my second best was"
01:24:51,720;01:24:53,780;"Lydanian's fumble recovered by Brian Cox,"
01:24:53,780;01:24:54,880;"it's because fuck him."
01:24:57,740;01:25:02,740;"And my worst is, and I'm gonna have to change this one"
01:25:02,740;01:25:05,720;"because it was everything that Lee Johnson did,"
01:25:05,720;01:25:07,280;"but now that we used that,"
01:25:07,280;01:25:10,100;"he made ""Breaky the Hero"" that he is,"
01:25:10,100;01:25:12,260;"I'm gonna, I got no worst."
01:25:12,260;01:25:15,840;"- I love it."
01:25:15,840;01:25:16,840;"I always look on the bright side."
01:25:16,840;01:25:18,040;"That's beautiful."
01:25:18,040;01:25:18,880;"- Right."
01:25:18,880;01:25:20,040;"I like it."
01:25:20,040;01:25:25,040;"- My best was, well, I guess I'm gonna switch it up"
01:25:26,800;01:25:30,080;"to an observation that I noticed,"
01:25:30,080;01:25:34,200;"that Doug Floody throwing a football to Tim Dwight,"
01:25:34,200;01:25:37,280;"that has got to be the shortest connection"
01:25:37,280;01:25:39,040;"in the history of football, correct?"
01:25:39,040;01:25:41,520;"- Do you mean height-wise?"
01:25:41,520;01:25:44,120;"- Yes, they're both five-nine."
01:25:44,120;01:25:47,920;"And I can't think of, unless Drew Brees is,"
01:25:47,920;01:25:49,600;"but no, we already used this attitude,"
01:25:49,600;01:25:51,320;"Brees is super tall."
01:25:51,320;01:25:53,320;"Kyle or Murray may be throwing to some--"
01:25:53,320;01:25:56,400;"- Russell Wilson is what, five-eleven I think, so."
01:25:56,400;01:25:58,760;"Yeah, yeah, he's holding on six feet."
01:25:58,760;01:26:00,960;"So I mean, I mean,"
01:26:00,960;01:26:03,320;"- Two five nine, two five nine white guys"
01:26:03,320;01:26:08,960;"connecting on a successful forward pass in the NFL in 2001,"
01:26:08,960;01:26:11,400;"I think is a highlight in anybody's book."
01:26:11,400;01:26:12,480;"- I have no commentary."
01:26:12,480;01:26:16,720;"I don't know what, what, I mean, I don't even know"
01:26:16,720;01:26:17,920;"what to say about that."
01:26:17,920;01:26:20,600;"But I, you know, I have no comment on height."
01:26:20,600;01:26:25,080;"I have no comment on, you know, I just, I, um,"
01:26:25,080;01:26:28,760;"It's just something that you don't see very often."
01:26:28,760;01:26:30,200;"You don't see it."
01:26:30,200;01:26:31,200;"We got the..."
01:26:31,200;01:26:32,200;"It isn't an anomaly."
01:26:32,200;01:26:35,800;"We can agree that it isn't an anomaly."
01:26:35,800;01:26:36,800;"Okay."
01:26:36,800;01:26:38,040;"Well, I'll take that."
01:26:38,040;01:26:39,040;"I like that."
01:26:39,040;01:26:40,040;"Okay."
01:26:40,040;01:26:42,520;"That was my best just being able to see that."
01:26:42,520;01:26:55,040;"And my worst is watching the Chargers kickoff team celebrating as a winner."
01:26:55,040;01:27:01,360;"if they've won the game, making a tackle on a kickoff that got returned back to the 35"
01:27:01,360;01:27:07,720;"year old line. It's just so typical charges. And I was like getting pissed off that the"
01:27:07,720;01:27:13,300;"Patriots are doing sack dance on your field at the end of the game after beating you when"
01:27:13,300;01:27:20,200;"they should love. Oh, yeah, that is classic. It's just, you know, it was an idea game that"
01:27:20,200;01:27:22,640;"He was also like riding the bike for like half the game."
01:27:22,640;01:27:26,100;"I feel like I know that was two thousand."
01:27:26,100;01:27:31,120;"Yeah, it was 2007 where he went in and him in."
01:27:31,120;01:27:32,800;"I have the quarterback."
01:27:32,800;01:27:46,460;"Well, I think it was Phil"
01:27:46,460;01:27:50,960;"he, you know, Lydanian Thomas, a game with the Chargers and the Patriots ended pretty"
01:27:50,960;01:27:52,720;"much the same way."
01:27:52,720;01:27:53,720;"It sure did."
01:27:53,720;01:27:55,440;"That's right."
01:27:55,440;01:28:00,160;"So yeah, but I think this is a quality game so far on our list of games to watch."
01:28:00,160;01:28:03,120;"This is probably number one for me of the ones we've watched so far."
01:28:03,120;01:28:06,560;"I would definitely recommend viewing it."
01:28:06,560;01:28:07,560;"Yeah."
01:28:07,560;01:28:11,920;"I mean, I think this goes on the board of should watch."
01:28:11,920;01:28:13,560;"Hey, put it up."
01:28:13,560;01:28:19,880;"But, you know, if you find a copy, even with commercials, just sit through the early 2000s."
01:28:19,880;01:28:22,120;"They were interesting, weren't they?"
01:28:22,120;01:28:24,040;"They're fantastic."
01:28:24,040;01:28:26,080;"Cedric the entertainer, baby."
01:28:26,080;01:28:26,760;"Someone butled."
01:28:26,760;01:28:27,760;"Oh, yeah."
01:28:27,760;01:28:31,720;"By shaking them up by dancing because he's got a girl in his living room."
01:28:31,720;01:28:34,120;"And then once he opens it, it sprays in her face."
01:28:34,120;01:28:35,040;"That's right."
01:28:35,040;01:28:39,160;"And then I remember a few other Cedric commercials."
01:28:39,160;01:28:40,360;"So hopefully we get to see those."
01:28:40,360;01:28:41,560;"Yeah."
01:28:41,560;01:28:50,260;"All right. Well, I think that about wraps it up for week five of the 2001 season. Thanks"
01:28:50,260;01:28:53,920;"for being here, Mike. It was a joy to share this with you."
01:28:53,920;01:29:00,280;"Yeah, it was really fun. Like I said, I'm trying to be more vulnerable and open up and just"
01:29:00,280;01:29:07,160;"say, ""You know what, man? I appreciate you as a human being."" And while my time could"
01:29:07,160;01:29:11,080;"be used for other things. It's not the worst thing in the world."
01:29:11,080;01:29:15,320;"I agree. Yeah. And it's always a pleasure to be able to"
01:29:15,320;01:29:17,400;"to shoot the shit with you. So."
01:29:17,400;01:29:21,520;"All right. See, you went genuine. I was kind of I veered off a"
01:29:21,520;01:29:25,800;"little bit about it. But yeah, I disagree. It felt genuine to me."
01:29:25,800;01:29:26,920;"So I'll take it. Not."
01:29:26,920;01:29:30,760;"All right. Well, until next week, what is next week?"
01:29:30,760;01:29:34,360;"I don't even know. And what are we looking forward to? Do you want to"
01:29:34,360;01:29:37,120;"know? I don't want to know. You know, I'll get off."
01:29:37,120;01:29:39,120;"and you can tell them, but I'm done."
01:29:39,120;01:29:41,560;"(laughs)"
01:29:41,560;01:29:44,240;"- The pages go visit the Indianapolis Colts."
01:29:44,240;01:29:45,080;"- God damn it."
01:29:45,080;01:29:46,920;"- Unless we got like forward to."
01:29:46,920;01:29:49,760;"The Colts that they blew the doors off recently."
01:29:49,760;01:29:50,800;"The week before. - That's true."
01:29:50,800;01:29:52,320;"- The week before."
01:29:52,320;01:29:54,560;"- I mean, is Pete Manning playing or?"
01:29:54,560;01:29:57,200;"- Do you want me to tell you?"
01:29:57,200;01:29:58,200;"- No, I don't!"
01:29:58,200;01:29:59,480;"You pass the test, buddy."
01:29:59,480;01:30:01,000;"(laughs)"
01:30:01,000;01:30:03,000;"- I got you, yes he is playing."
01:30:03,000;01:30:03,840;"- No, fuck."
01:30:03,840;01:30:06,400;"(laughs)"

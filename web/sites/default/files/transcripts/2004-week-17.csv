00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:19,440;"I am not your mother."
00:19,440;00:24,920;"Welcome back to the Pages Dynasty Podcast."
00:24,920;00:27,040;"I'm your host, Eni Brown."
00:27,040;00:33,520;"the podcast where we are going back and rewatching every single game. Yes, every single game of"
00:33,520;00:39,840;"the Patriots, starting to see star in 2001. And this week, we are wrapping up the 2004 regular season,"
00:39,840;00:49,760;"week 17 of the woeful at the time 49ers come to town. With me as always are my brothers,"
00:50,640;00:52,920;"Middle brother, Steve."
00:52,920;00:54,400;"How are you, Steven?"
00:54,400;00:55,880;"- I'm hanging in there."
00:55,880;00:57,920;"I like the throwing it back"
00:57,920;01:00,280;"and doing the recording in your car again, Andy."
01:00,280;01:01,120;"- I am, yes."
01:01,120;01:04,800;"I have been relegated to the vehicle."
01:04,800;01:06,120;"- Relegated here, exiled."
01:06,120;01:08,760;"- I mean, there's synonyms."
01:08,760;01:12,120;"Now that I have a tiny human Bogarding,"
01:12,120;01:14,600;"the other recording space that I was using,"
01:14,600;01:15,600;"which was my bedroom."
01:15,600;01:16,520;"- And our bo-guarding?"
01:16,520;01:19,120;"- Yeah, what's Bogarding mean?"
01:19,120;01:20,440;"- Hoarding, basically."
01:20,440;01:22,040;"after him, Humphrey Bogart."
01:22,040;01:23,880;"Yeah, I don't know why."
01:23,880;01:26,360;"I don't know who, I don't even know Humphrey Bogart is."
01:26,360;01:27,800;"No, I just know the term Bogarting."
01:27,800;01:29,400;"I mean, talking."
01:29,400;01:35,800;"It means selfishly appropriate or keep something, especially a lit marijuana cigarette."
01:35,800;01:41,480;"Yeah, it is big in the, in that world from what I heard."
01:41,480;01:43,000;"It says Andy."
01:43,000;01:45,800;"I mean, I just, I know a lot of the pun is."
01:45,800;01:46,760;"You're going to have it in here."
01:46,760;01:48,200;"Yeah, how do you guys know that?"
01:48,200;01:48,600;"I do."
01:48,600;01:56,960;"you. You the no it's speaking of potheads also with us is Greg Brown as you may have heard"
01:56,960;02:02,680;"Greg how are you? I'm good. I'm just learning about Humphrey Bogart here. Is it really named"
02:02,680;02:06,960;"after him because I'm just assuming that? Well come up when you Google but that makes"
02:06,960;02:15,840;"sense. Yeah. Nick name Bogey. Name one Bogart movie. Oh he's an actor. I literally don't"
02:15,840;02:16,840;"Yes."
02:16,840;02:18,840;"I'm going with the wind."
02:18,840;02:19,840;"No, close."
02:19,840;02:20,840;"Really?"
02:20,840;02:21,840;"We're going with the wall."
02:21,840;02:22,840;"Castle Blanca."
02:22,840;02:23,840;"Ooh, I was right there."
02:23,840;02:24,840;"Yeah."
02:24,840;02:26,840;"Shot in the dark."
02:26,840;02:29,840;"We don't watch movies growing up."
02:29,840;02:33,840;"That's the kind of movie we would have wanted to watch anyways."
02:33,840;02:34,840;"Probably."
02:34,840;02:35,840;"It was 1942."
02:35,840;02:37,840;"We were watching anything."
02:37,840;02:42,240;"I remember sitting and watching Pride and Prejudice on VHS with Mom because it was a"
02:42,240;02:43,840;"television and the TV was on."
02:43,840;02:44,840;"on to going to watch."
02:44,840;02:49,120;"And he's blaming mom for us missing out on Casablanca in 1942."
02:49,120;02:50,120;"That's right."
02:50,120;02:51,120;"Hey, Jesus."
02:51,120;02:57,240;"That's the type of movie that dad would rent from Kelly Library on VHS and bring home"
02:57,240;02:58,600;"black and white movies."
02:58,600;02:59,600;"No way."
02:59,600;03:00,600;"No."
03:00,600;03:01,600;"What were they?"
03:01,600;03:05,120;"He watches with bullshit like English comedy things like red war."
03:05,120;03:06,120;"Black out."
03:06,120;03:07,120;"Yeah."
03:07,120;03:08,120;"Yeah."
03:08,120;03:10,120;"We're like, this is not funny at all."
03:10,120;03:12,840;"It's mildly amusing and it's better than fucking nothing."
03:12,840;03:14,120;"I didn't play with my brother's."
03:14,120;03:14,520;"That's for sure."
03:14,520;03:14,960;"Yeah."
03:14,960;03:16,720;"Tell me about it."
03:16,720;03:18,800;"Brothers are the worst."
03:18,800;03:21,200;"Speaking of the worst."
03:21,200;03:23,880;"Ninety percent on rotten tomatoes."
03:23,880;03:24,920;"Yeah, some winka."
03:24,920;03:26,160;"Sure."
03:26,160;03:32,560;"Speaking of the worst, this 49ers team, um, worst in the NFL."
03:32,560;03:36,040;"They would end up with the number one draft pick in the following year."
03:36,040;03:37,960;"Speaking of the worst, this game is the worst."
03:37,960;03:39,240;"Can we just get that out of the way?"
03:39,240;03:40,120;"Yeah."
03:40,120;03:41,480;"It's not particularly watchable."
03:41,640;03:44,480;"Did I watch the highlights and I almost didn't make it through that."
03:44,480;03:47,640;"The highlights are only a minute and 21 seconds long."
03:47,640;03:48,760;"Yeah, there's not many."
03:48,760;03:50,200;"There are not many highlights in this."
03:50,200;03:54,200;"This is one of those games that you don't even watch in real time."
03:54,200;03:56,400;"Never mind 20 years later."
03:56,400;04:01,280;"Like this is the 13 and two Patriots hosting the two and 13 49ers."
04:01,280;04:03,120;"There's not much intrigue in this."
04:03,120;04:04,760;"And you watch the whole thing?"
04:04,760;04:05,520;"I did."
04:05,520;04:08,560;"There is there's nothing to play for in this game."
04:08,560;04:09,960;"You watch the whole game."
04:10,040;04:13,160;"whole game. You are a baby."
04:13,160;04:16,360;"You're a sicko, dude."
04:16,360;04:19,200;"It might be the most outrageous thing you've done."
04:19,200;04:21,280;"This is worse than the solo podcast."
04:21,280;04:24,320;"And all of us, you know, for posterity's sake,"
04:24,320;04:25,600;"the Celtics are in the middle of their."
04:25,600;04:29,680;"It's a little playing in the finals right now."
04:29,680;04:33,280;"And Andy's watching a week 17 meaningless game."
04:33,280;04:35,280;"Actually, that's a good question."
04:35,280;04:37,480;"Andy, have you watched any of the Celtics? No."
04:37,480;04:39,280;"Yeah. Got it."
04:39,280;04:42,080;"For a couple of reasons. One, I don't watch basketball."
04:42,080;04:44,400;"- Why does that? - It does interest me."
04:44,400;04:46,800;"- Don't like black people? - No, just not enough violence."
04:46,800;04:50,000;"- Although from what I've seen on violence..."
04:50,000;04:53,440;"- You say the violence? - Yeah, there's not enough hitting."
04:53,440;04:56,720;"- Oh, not enough violence. - Yeah, not enough violence."
04:56,720;04:56,960;"- I..."
04:56,960;05:00,160;"- Let me tell you about a guy named Draymond Green."
05:00,160;05:03,600;"- Well, that's what I was going to say. I've been on Twitter, obviously, for our"
05:03,600;05:07,920;"Twitter account, hence. From the highlights I've seen on Draymond, he seems to be"
05:08,720;05:12,080;"bringing the football back into basketball. So maybe I'll tune in."
05:12,080;05:15,520;"Also, the second point is they the game start after my bedtime."
05:15,520;05:17,600;"That's a four month old."
05:17,600;05:18,880;"That would get complete."
05:18,880;05:20,960;"Thanks a lot, China. Just fucking Shanghai."
05:20,960;05:21,640;"I can try."
05:21,640;05:25,120;"Like, oh, the ratings are down. Why?"
05:25,120;05:26,880;"Sometimes a naughty boy."
05:26,880;05:27,880;"That's a good China."
05:27,880;05:32,840;"Let's talk about the Celtics a little bit, though."
05:32,840;05:36,640;"As we do on this page, it's podcast."
05:36,640;05:39,000;"Hey, I will give you 60 seconds."
05:39,000;05:42,080;"That Andy is Boston strong."
05:42,080;05:43,920;"Go 60 seconds."
05:43,920;05:44,640;"You're on the clock."
05:44,640;05:45,200;"I'll check."
05:45,200;05:46,400;"Belichick loves the Celtics."
05:46,400;05:49,120;"He's been wearing a Celtics hat in his news conferences all week."
05:49,120;05:49,800;"That's right."
05:49,800;05:51,280;"Do you want to talk about in your 60 seconds?"
05:51,280;05:52,480;"OK, OK."
05:52,480;05:52,800;"All right."
05:52,800;05:54,800;"So this is kind of relatable to the Patriots, though."
05:54,800;05:57,040;"I want to get your guys opinion on this."
05:57,040;06:03,080;"There's a lot of hubbubble about the the the Boston crowd,"
06:03,080;06:03,840;"Channing."
06:03,840;06:06,160;"Fuck you, Draymond."
06:06,440;06:09,040;"Yeah, like, ""Fock you, Draymond."""
06:09,040;06:11,440;"What do you think about that?"
06:11,440;06:14,640;"Is there a baby or is that yours, Andy?"
06:14,640;06:16,840;"You know, that is, I believe."
06:16,840;06:17,840;"That's interesting."
06:17,840;06:18,840;"Hang on."
06:18,840;06:21,840;"Let me do this."
06:21,840;06:23,640;"But we don't want the kids here and what I just said."
06:23,640;06:24,840;"And that's a big no-no."
06:24,840;06:28,240;"No, no, that my phone had connected to Bluetooth apparently."
06:28,240;06:31,840;"And my wife has my phone because she's using it as the baby monitor."
06:31,840;06:32,440;"So..."
06:32,440;06:33,440;"Oh, okay."
06:33,440;06:34,440;"So that is..."
06:34,440;06:36,240;"That is Karen making the parents."
06:36,240;06:41,720;"Wow. I hope you didn't hear me cuss on the podcast."
06:41,720;06:45,240;"That was terrible, Greg."
06:45,240;06:48,240;"Anyway, what you were talking about the chanting?"
06:48,240;06:53,240;"Yeah. Steve Kerr said it was classless."
06:53,240;06:59,240;"Thompson said it was classless."
06:59,240;07:01,240;"Dream On didn't really say anything."
07:01,240;07:04,240;"His wife went on Instagram and was like,"
07:04,240;07:07,320;"How dare they swear with young children in the thing."
07:07,320;07:09,880;"And then the worst part is,"
07:09,880;07:12,120;"Dreamon was in the post-game interview"
07:12,120;07:13,560;"with his son sitting around next to him."
07:13,560;07:14,880;"It was 'cause like three years old."
07:14,880;07:15,720;"And they're like, ""How'd you play?"""
07:15,720;07:17,440;"And he's like, ""I played like shit."""
07:17,440;07:19,640;"So he's swearing in front of his own child."
07:19,640;07:21,120;"And the wife's got no problem with that,"
07:21,120;07:25,640;"but a crowd singing it at a 9 p.m. basketball game."
07:25,640;07:27,640;"- Maybe the wife does have a problem with that."
07:27,640;07:28,680;"He heard about it when he got home."
07:28,680;07:31,080;"- I'm in for it until it gets racist."
07:31,080;07:32,480;"'Cause like the soccer, you know,"
07:32,480;07:34,840;"They have swung too far on that pendulum."
07:34,840;07:36,380;"- Yeah, with the monkey chance"
07:36,380;07:37,280;"and throwing bananas at us,"
07:37,280;07:38,840;"that's not growing stuff."
07:38,840;07:39,680;"- Yeah."
07:39,680;07:40,520;"- Can't be doing that."
07:40,520;07:41,920;"- You can, you can, fuck you."
07:41,920;07:42,760;"I mean, you're going to--"
07:42,760;07:43,600;"- You can share whatever it is."
07:43,600;07:46,120;"- You're living a event for an NBA finals, like,"
07:46,120;07:46,960;"you're gonna hear some really--"
07:46,960;07:48,320;"- That's the best part of an English soccer game"
07:48,320;07:50,760;"is the quality of the chance that they come up with."
07:50,760;07:51,920;"- Exactly, yeah, I agree."
07:51,920;07:54,200;"- So that, I think the only problem I have with it"
07:54,200;07:59,200;"is that it's not, it's not interesting enough."
07:59,200;08:01,000;"Like, fuck you, Drammy,"
08:01,000;08:03,080;"I feel like the Boston crowd can do better than that."
08:03,080;08:04,800;"- Well, as American sports in general,"
08:04,800;08:05,640;"they don't really agree."
08:05,640;08:06,640;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree."
08:06,640;08:09,560;"- And football is the weakest too, the chanting."
08:09,560;08:10,760;"- Yeah."
08:10,760;08:11,600;"- Well, let's break Brown."
08:11,600;08:12,440;"- They can't do this."
08:12,440;08:14,760;"- American soccer fans are the worst."
08:14,760;08:15,680;"- Yes, yeah, yeah."
08:15,680;08:18,800;"- American soccer fans just are just fucking,"
08:18,800;08:19,640;"just corny and shawty."
08:19,640;08:21,600;"- They make my skin crawl."
08:21,600;08:22,440;"- Go out."
08:22,440;08:23,280;"- How fucking corny they are."
08:23,280;08:25,560;"- I kind of want you to relive this."
08:25,560;08:27,480;"- Give me an example, Chancrok."
08:28,760;08:30,880;"Well, they do that."
08:30,880;08:33,080;"They stole that skull one, right?"
08:33,080;08:34,280;"They do that one."
08:34,280;08:37,720;"I believe we will win that one's."
08:37,720;08:40,320;"That one's like at least like, I don't know."
08:40,320;08:42,400;"It's nice to listen to, but it's corny."
08:42,400;08:43,680;"- Super fucking corny."
08:43,680;08:45,360;"- It sounds it, right? Try hard."
08:45,360;08:47,480;"- And I think I figured out why too,"
08:47,480;08:50,080;"'cause like you watch the crowd when they show it"
08:50,080;08:51,480;"in like an English Premier League,"
08:51,480;08:55,120;"and those guys are like the blue collar like,"
08:55,120;08:58,240;"you know, ship face guys"
08:58,240;09:00,560;"They're just funny as it is, like as people."
09:00,560;09:03,000;"And then you watch a US thing and it's like,"
09:03,000;09:05,320;"a lot of those guys are fans 'cause it's hipster"
09:05,320;09:08,120;"and it's like, you know, I wanna be different"
09:08,120;09:11,120;"so I'm a soccer fan rather than just liking it"
09:11,120;09:13,280;"'cause you like soccer, you know?"
09:13,280;09:14,600;"So those guys are like the kids"
09:14,600;09:16,000;"like a bullied in high school."
09:16,000;09:17,520;"They've never been funny to begin with."
09:17,520;09:20,240;"And they think this is like emboldened them to be in there."
09:20,240;09:23,560;"Like I wanna fit in with how they sing in Europe, you know?"
09:23,560;09:24,400;"And it's just like--"
09:24,400;09:26,560;"But they don't have the creativity to come up with anything."
09:26,560;09:28,240;"They're not naturally funny people."
09:28,240;09:30,080;"So it just comes out terribly."
09:30,080;09:32,960;"Is there anything worse than somebody who's not funny that tries to be?"
09:32,960;09:37,240;"Cause I used to work with people like that and they are awful."
09:37,240;09:39,200;"Yeah, to listen to."
09:39,200;09:40,080;"Yes."
09:40,080;09:40,880;"Dre Wong Green."
09:40,880;09:43,640;"Dre Wong Green is a bitch."
09:43,640;09:45,400;"And this 49ers team too."
09:45,400;09:46,920;"Yeah."
09:46,920;09:47,280;"Yeah."
09:47,280;09:47,280;"Yeah."
09:47,280;09:49,080;"So we're done with this one thing."
09:49,080;09:51,080;"I'm done with this."
09:51,080;09:52,600;"I still got more than something."
09:52,600;09:53,240;"I know you do."
09:53,240;09:54,760;"We can stay on it."
09:54,760;09:56,680;"Maybe, maybe you should start a podcast."
09:56,680;09:57,080;"Yeah."
09:57,080;09:58,400;"See, let's start our own podcast."
09:58,400;09:58,960;"Yeah, good."
09:58,960;10:02,800;"I can be the Greg Brown of that podcast, but I don't want you in the games."
10:02,800;10:05,960;"I just come up with bullshit to derail it and be perfect."
10:05,960;10:07,160;"Yeah, actually."
10:07,160;10:08,200;"No, you're Andy."
10:08,200;10:10,680;"You're the I'm the English soccer fan."
10:10,680;10:12,520;"You're the American soccer fan and that."
10:12,520;10:13,640;"Oh, is that right?"
10:13,640;10:14,200;"Yeah."
10:14,200;10:14,960;"I don't think so."
10:14,960;10:20,560;"You want to be like me and bullshit, but he's just you don't have the skill set."
10:20,560;10:21,880;"We'll say."
10:21,880;10:23,080;"Start your podcast, Greg."
10:23,080;10:26,720;"speaking of not having a skill set, maybe you should start a podcast and then come back"
10:26,720;10:31,360;"to me. I know what I am. All right. And it's not organizational guy."
10:31,360;10:36,160;"Hard to know when you are staying in your lane. Yeah. I guess so. Speaking of staying in your"
10:36,160;10:44,040;"lane, let's talk about this for your not his team. They did not do very well. They like"
10:44,040;10:49,000;"we said two and 14. Their only wins. Both of them came against the Cardinals. Both of"
10:49,000;10:52,360;"them came in overtime. That's how close they were to being out in 16."
10:52,360;10:53,700;"What was the Cardinals record?"
10:53,700;10:55,360;"Uh, they were mediocre."
10:55,360;10:56,160;"Okay."
10:56,160;10:59,440;"I don't think they quite made the playoffs, but you can look that up stat check."
10:59,440;11:02,360;"Definitely not losing to the worst team in the league twice."
11:02,360;11:04,440;"No, no, they were not."
11:04,440;11:06,520;"Uh, I think the Jets are one of the worst."
11:06,520;11:07,920;"No, it was a dolphin driver, right?"
11:07,920;11:11,360;"Because the, uh, the night courage wore orange."
11:11,360;11:13,000;"Cause that rhymes."
11:13,000;11:20,920;"Uh, this was, um, uh, four nights team coached by Dennis Erickson, which I don't"
11:20,920;11:23,800;"recognize except I feel like I had a phone that was made by"
11:23,800;11:26,160;"Erickson back in the day of flip phones."
11:26,160;11:27,960;"Yeah, it's only Erickson. I remember."
11:27,960;11:32,000;"They made an iPod competitor too, if I remember correctly."
11:32,000;11:33,400;"Oh, maybe. Yeah."
11:33,400;11:34,560;"With Walkman."
11:34,560;11:36,200;"That sounds familiar."
11:36,200;11:36,960;"Yeah. Yeah."
11:36,960;11:38,760;"But yeah, Erickson spells slightly different."
11:38,760;11:44,880;"The Lee, I think, but he was almost a 500 coach for the Seahawks for four years"
11:44,880;11:45,840;"and then came in."
11:45,840;11:49,160;"Uh, coach, the stumps are fired at two and 14 and they got fired."
11:50,040;11:54,480;"Um, the fun fact about him is that out of his 13 challenges in his NFL career,"
11:54,480;11:55,880;"he only managed to win four of them."
11:55,880;11:57,760;"So good for him."
11:57,760;12:00,000;"Hadn't figured out the challenges."
12:00,000;12:02,040;"Well, it was early, but yeah."
12:02,040;12:03,060;"Yeah."
12:03,060;12:04,900;"No one knows the challenges are anymore."
12:04,900;12:07,880;"Even then, well, everybody still gets them now though."
12:07,880;12:12,520;"It's like flipping a coin and he comes up heads four out of 13 times."
12:12,520;12:15,240;"You know, that's, that's still a pretty bad."
12:15,240;12:19,520;"So, um, uh, the other coach of note,"
12:19,520;12:23,680;"I think that we will see a lot more of in some fun times"
12:23,680;12:26,760;"is Dan Quinn, who's a defensive line coach here."
12:26,760;12:29,540;"He will have quite the history against the Patriots."
12:29,540;12:30,840;"Of course he loses here."
12:30,840;12:34,320;"No surprise, no spoilers, but 2014,"
12:34,320;12:37,480;"he is also the defensive coordinator for the Seahawks"
12:37,480;12:39,040;"who Brady torched in the fourth quarter."
12:39,040;12:40,560;"That's Super Bowl."
12:40,560;12:42,360;"And then 2016 he hadn't had his fill"
12:42,360;12:44,640;"and he is now the head coach of the Falcons."
12:44,640;12:47,200;"Brady torched in the second half of the Super Bowl."
12:48,520;12:50,160;"I don't know if he's still coaching."
12:50,160;12:51,000;"- That was my question."
12:51,000;12:52,400;"Is he still a legal to that like breaking up?"
12:52,400;12:54,400;"- I feel like a tap point."
12:54,400;12:57,920;"No, apparently he is the Dallas defensive coordinator."
12:57,920;13:01,400;"I think he got fired mid-ray through 2020."
13:01,400;13:06,240;"Something like that, yeah."
13:06,240;13:08,840;"I didn't say, but I feel like that's what happened."
13:08,840;13:12,920;"So not a great record since then,"
13:12,920;13:16,840;"but I mean, he was okay, head coaches, the Falcons,"
13:16,840;13:19,480;"But I mean, I don't think you come back from from that defeat."
13:19,480;13:21,240;"No."
13:21,240;13:26,640;"Um, and to just to tell you a little bit about the, um, this 49ers team, they had one pro bowler."
13:26,640;13:30,040;"It was their long slapper, long snapper, Brian Jennings."
13:30,040;13:31,760;"Well, it doesn't have to get one."
13:31,760;13:33,320;"I don't think so."
13:33,320;13:36,200;"I think I think we've had Brown's teams that didn't."
13:36,200;13:40,760;"Um, but they, they, would you say it going?"
13:40,760;13:42,040;"I think they changed that."
13:42,040;13:45,000;"I thought that was baseball that had to have at least one player per team."
13:46,480;13:47,320;"What's that?"
13:47,320;13:48,320;"I'll stack."
13:48,320;13:50,480;"All right."
13:50,480;13:53,720;"But they're draft."
13:53,720;13:56,480;"When we look at this, I just look at Wikipedia,"
13:56,480;13:59,480;"and it shows like their table of all their draft picks."
13:59,480;14:02,520;"And if they're in blue, that means they made the roster."
14:02,520;14:05,000;"And if they're in yellow, that means they made at least"
14:05,000;14:06,400;"one pro ball."
14:06,400;14:08,480;"And just about every single one of their picks"
14:08,480;14:11,600;"made the roster, which I don't think is a good sign for such"
14:11,600;14:14,200;"a bad team, because that just means they were so bad"
14:14,200;14:16,200;"that they had to start all their rookies."
14:16,200;14:18,120;"but only one of them ever made a pro ball."
14:18,120;14:20,640;"And that is Andy Lee, who is their punter."
14:20,640;14:21,480;"- Yep."
14:21,480;14:24,680;"- Who I believe, I don't know if he's retired"
14:24,680;14:27,520;"or not this season, but he, as of last I checked,"
14:27,520;14:31,240;"he is the sole active player left from this 2004 draft."
14:31,240;14:33,200;"- He's still playing, he's the only one."
14:33,200;14:39,880;"- Let's see, but this game was on NFL on Fox,"
14:39,880;14:41,920;"which we don't see very often."
14:41,920;14:45,600;"And we had Kurt Menefee and Tim Green as the commentators."
14:45,600;14:49,320;"I'm green. That's what I thought. But no, Tim Green, who was much less"
14:49,320;14:52,320;"excited. I think you like some sausage. I mean, would you like some"
14:52,320;14:56,280;"sausage? The fact I cook sausage often for breakfast and I"
14:56,280;15:00,680;"sing that to myself every time. Dude, he's the man. He's weird as"
15:00,680;15:05,800;"fuck. Yeah, I know he's not. Hmm. Have you seen him recently?"
15:05,800;15:10,280;"Like in interviews? Recently? No, he's very self aware. He knew"
15:10,280;15:13,320;"what he was doing the whole time. Oh, I'm sure he did. Yeah."
15:13,440;15:14,440;"But it's not actually weird."
15:14,440;15:15,800;"He's just like playing a character."
15:15,800;15:16,560;"Okay."
15:16,560;15:21,000;"Hey, if it makes, I mean, you still got, you still got to have some weird shit going"
15:21,000;15:21,600;"on upstairs."
15:21,600;15:23,120;"If that's the character you just had to play."
15:23,120;15:23,720;"I don't know."
15:23,720;15:25,240;"Some people might call you weird, Andy."
15:25,240;15:27,520;"Yeah, but I accept it."
15:27,520;15:30,040;"I don't, I don't try to tell people I'm normal."
15:30,040;15:33,880;"But you're not playing and he's actually weird."
15:33,880;15:34,520;"Yeah."
15:34,520;15:35,400;"He's not weird."
15:35,400;15:36,600;"I'm coming from the two."
15:36,600;15:39,000;"He's autistic, maybe."
15:39,000;15:42,240;"ADHD."
15:42,240;15:43,240;"Thank you very much."
15:43,240;15:53,160;"Oh, I feel bad for you, Andy, and I feel bad for Curtis Conway on this team."
15:53,160;15:54,160;"Curtis Conway."
15:54,160;15:55,760;"That's the only name I really recognize."
15:55,760;15:57,760;"This is his last year of his career."
15:57,760;16:02,520;"Imagine this is your swan song, the two and 14 49ers."
16:02,520;16:03,520;"Yeah, not great."
16:03,520;16:08,680;"Well, you don't recognize Kevin Barlow, the running back or Tim Tae or Ken Dorsey"
16:08,680;16:10,840;"or John Engelberger."
16:11,240;16:13,900;"I mean, obviously, Ken Dorsky is a fucking legend."
16:13,900;16:16,100;"Brandon Lloyd was on this team."
16:16,100;16:16,900;"Who?"
16:16,900;16:17,900;"Brandon Lloyd."
16:17,900;16:18,900;"Brandon Lloyd."
16:18,900;16:19,900;"Oh, he was."
16:19,900;16:22,500;"He didn't play in this game."
16:22,500;16:24,260;"If he did, he didn't have a catch."
16:24,260;16:27,140;"I remember saying, he may have been hurt."
16:27,140;16:29,220;"I don't know."
16:29,220;16:30,220;"There's just so many."
16:30,220;16:33,420;"I like, so, you know, a lot of these old games are like, man, it's a lot of no names."
16:33,420;16:35,180;"We can see the sprinkling."
16:35,180;16:37,180;"There's nobody on here."
16:37,180;16:39,540;"Yeah, there's always like a name like, oh, that guy, that's right."
16:39,540;16:40,540;"Yeah, I remember, he was good."
16:40,540;16:47,180;"Their defense team doesn't have that. No, it's a full defense of no names. Yeah, there's nobody"
16:47,180;16:52,660;"Yeah, they're defensive leaders were there strong safety Tony parish no idea"
16:52,660;16:56,660;"defensive and John Engelberger who I feel like I would have remembered"
16:56,660;17:01,900;"Where he like even anywhere good just because of the name. That's amazing name and"
17:01,900;17:05,660;"Derek Smith their linebacker with the team. That's actually no name name"
17:06,100;17:10,020;"Yeah, the Derek Smith is like a Madden created player name"
17:10,020;17:12,100;"Celine Rashid"
17:12,100;17:16,420;"Arnaz battle was on the scene though. Oh, I remember from"
17:16,420;17:20,100;"But let's talk about Dorsey"
17:20,100;17:28,020;"Let's talk about Dorsey. All right. Talk about Dorsey for me then. He's a legend. Is he yeah? He's an all-time underrated guy"
17:28,020;17:30,660;"in what way"
17:30,660;17:33,700;"Like he all he does is win, but he never gets the accolades"
17:34,580;17:36,580;"You do you realize"
17:36,580;17:41,900;"Yeah, he was a two-time Heisman finals that team with Ray Lewis and"
17:41,900;17:44,980;"Everybody they made the thirty for thirty about yeah. Oh"
17:44,980;17:49,940;"Wait, I'm like all Kendra's is gonna be good and then you got the NFL"
17:49,940;17:54,820;"I didn't do shit. Well, he was a seventh round draft back after being a two-time Heisman finalist. Yep"
17:54,820;17:58,500;"There was a reason though obviously because he didn't win"
17:58,500;18:01,380;"It wasn't particularly good in this game"
18:01,820;18:07,440;"Yeah, but he's we just talked about how bad the team was we talk about the all-time about the circumstances of a quarterback"
18:07,440;18:09,440;"I don't think it's fair shake"
18:09,440;18:14,440;"Yeah, you throw him on a team like this. It's like he played for the Browns to after that"
18:14,440;18:20,160;"So it's not really like he ever stood a chance. It's true, but you could also say that this team"
18:20,160;18:22,800;"the year after"
18:22,800;18:26,200;"they had the first overall pick took Alex Smith who"
18:26,200;18:29,320;"Similar skill set would you say"
18:30,200;18:32,800;"Yeah, to the Ken Dorsey, I guess."
18:32,800;18:35,040;"Yeah. And he turned the team around."
18:35,040;18:37,080;"Alex Smith did he though?"
18:37,080;18:38,520;"Did he though?"
18:38,520;18:40,120;"Comparatively, yeah."
18:40,120;18:43,280;"Maybe Andy's just not giving any credit to Kaepernick."
18:43,280;18:45,520;"Yeah. Interesting."
18:45,520;18:47,960;"Kevin came after this."
18:47,960;18:50,640;"Also, also, he doesn't watch basketball."
18:50,640;18:53,000;"Fuck basketball."
18:53,000;18:54,920;"Makes you wonder, Steve, doesn't it?"
18:54,920;18:57,640;"I'm just pointing out the facts here."
18:58,800;19:02,920;"a Ken Dorsey who couldn't beat out Tim Rate. I feel like that's probably not a."
19:02,920;19:05,780;"Why are you a"
19:05,780;19:06,280;"boss?"
19:06,280;19:07,000;"Dorsey Hader."
19:07,000;19:10,440;"Uh, I'm just a realist, Greg."
19:10,440;19:12,320;"Do you know what Ken Dorsey's doing right now?"
19:12,320;19:12,960;"What's he doing?"
19:12,960;19:13,160;"All right."
19:13,160;19:13,800;"It's selling cars."
19:13,800;19:17,280;"No, he's the offensive coordinator for the Buffalo bills."
19:17,280;19:18,440;"Is he really?"
19:18,440;19:20,480;"Yeah."
19:20,480;19:24,040;"He was like the quarterback's coach and Brian Dayball left."
19:24,040;19:24,920;"All right."
19:24,920;19:26,960;"He's a defensive coordinator."
19:26,960;19:33,600;"away. So we will actually see how good he is. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. So suck on that, Andy."
19:33,600;19:39,280;"You know, the number one offense in the NFL. Yeah, the one that he wasn't the offensive coordinator"
19:39,280;19:42,960;"of. Well, he's quarterback's coach of the best quarterback in the NFL."
19:42,960;19:46,880;"No, I shall. Unless Steve, unless you're right."
19:46,880;19:54,800;"We'll see. We got to win. That's a ball. I can't believe I didn't even I thought he was just"
19:54,800;20:03,120;"God's NFL. Yeah, I figured he'd be like, uh, trying to sell crypto to people these days. Hey,"
20:03,120;20:10,400;"Niner Sands, you remember me? It's Ken Dorsey. And my buddy, Joe Nameth, he doesn't be selling in"
20:10,400;20:17,440;"Florida, not San Francisco. Hey, Miami. Go to you. Yeah."
20:18,640;20:25,040;"Yep. Speaking of the you, Vince Wilfork in this game. Was he you? Yeah, he was at the"
20:25,040;20:33,360;"you. Yeah. I use a rookie Vince Wilfork, starting to show his why he is Vince Wilfork in this game."
20:33,360;20:38,800;"One of the highlights, one of the few highlights is when he puts the center on skates, basically"
20:38,800;20:43,040;"picks him up and throws him at the running back, causing him back to fumble, which was recovered by,"
20:43,040;20:47,520;"I believe, Earthwind Morland of all people. So if you're the type of person who's looking for an"
20:47,520;20:53,280;"Earthman Morlins highlight that will be your one. You came the right place. Yeah, I don't know if"
20:53,280;21:00,320;"there'll be another. So get it while you can. What are some negative things that happen this game"
21:00,320;21:08,720;"for the Patriots? They're a streak of 20 games scoring first, remember? We talked about that like"
21:08,720;21:12,880;"the fact that they had done this so long actually ended in this game of all of all games."
21:14,800;21:18,240;"because the 49ers actually scored a touchdown first because the Patriots drove down the field"
21:18,240;21:24,480;"twice to open the game. Then Corey Dillon fumbled the first time and then Brady got picked off"
21:24,480;21:31,440;"the second drive which set up there. The 49ers opening TD. The 49ers would not score again."
21:31,440;21:37,440;"I'm not even sure they crossed midfield again. Watchability score of probably one in this game."
21:37,440;21:43,360;"This might be the worst game that we've seen. They go, they miss a field goal in the second quarter."
21:43,360;21:44,480;"They did nothing."
21:44,480;21:46,320;"They're in a new chippy."
21:46,320;21:48,080;"Yeah, it didn't go."
21:48,080;21:49,360;"That's my turn because I'm the"
21:49,360;21:50,320;"pages scored again."
21:50,320;21:50,880;"That was it."
21:50,880;21:51,040;"Yeah."
21:51,040;21:53,120;"That was the end of it."
21:53,120;21:54,000;"And they had their chance."
21:54,000;21:55,760;"I can talk Peterson."
21:55,760;21:57,040;"Yeah."
21:57,040;21:57,760;"How is that?"
21:57,760;21:59,600;"Like they don't even put ponpon fumble down"
21:59,600;22:00,480;"fumble end of game."
22:00,480;22:02,800;"And this is also like a 49"
22:02,800;22:04,080;"scene that like they got the ball."
22:04,080;22:05,840;"They actually picked off Brady a couple times."
22:05,840;22:09,040;"Or no, they picked him off and then"
22:09,040;22:11,520;"had a strip sack like under two minutes."
22:11,520;22:12,880;"And they had all three time outs and they're"
22:12,880;22:15,080;"They're at like their own 30 or something like that."
22:15,080;22:22,560;"And they tried one deep shot and then it didn't work."
22:22,560;22:24,720;"So they just like ran out the clock."
22:24,720;22:25,720;"- It was ridiculous."
22:25,720;22:28,320;"And they interviewed the head coach."
22:28,320;22:29,680;"- He's like, ""Well, you know, we tried,"
22:29,680;22:30,560;"but we got sacked."
22:30,560;22:32,960;"So we didn't want to give the ball back to him."
22:32,960;22:34,560;"So we just ran out the clock."""
22:34,560;22:36,680;"Like, well-- - That's part."
22:36,680;22:37,680;"- That's when the game ended."
22:37,680;22:39,200;"- Seven, seven and half."
22:39,200;22:40,040;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
22:40,040;22:42,080;"- Take that as a two and 13 team."
22:42,080;22:47,000;"I guess, but that was kind of, but it was like showing that you didn't trust your team,"
22:47,000;22:48,000;"though, right?"
22:48,000;22:49,000;"Why would you trust them?"
22:49,000;22:50,000;"They're two and 13."
22:50,000;22:55,440;"Well, I mean, fumble the ball and give it away."
22:55,440;23:02,080;"But yeah, half time because this was an NFL on Fox, you get the NFC commentators."
23:02,080;23:07,280;"So one of the quotes was the thing that is undone during the all season are their turnovers."
23:07,280;23:11,560;"He says about a team coming in 13 and two on the season."
23:11,560;23:16,600;"So yeah, undone all the time, but they showed some stat that said the Patriots over the"
23:16,600;23:20,640;"past two years are 30 and four."
23:20,640;23:25,960;"And all four of those losses, they had at least four turnovers and at the half they had three."
23:25,960;23:30,000;"So I mean, it's understandable why they're kind of trying to bring that up."
23:30,000;23:34,440;"But like, yeah, you're not going to win a game with four turnovers, generally."
23:34,440;23:36,640;"Yeah, radio is those with meltdown games."
23:36,640;23:41,320;"Well, you had one couple weeks ago against the Dolphins were in the, uh, when courage"
23:41,320;23:43,920;"for orange, Steve, before picks."
23:43,920;23:46,040;"Steve fucking thing."
23:46,040;23:48,920;"Yeah, but he doesn't have meltdown games anymore."
23:48,920;23:53,040;"Like this, this back in these days, he used to have like one every once in a while,"
23:53,040;23:55,200;"like at least one of season, right?"
23:55,200;23:59,080;"Like in 2001, remember you threw like four picks in the fourth quarter against the"
23:59,080;23:59,680;"Broncos."
23:59,680;24:00,200;"Yeah."
24:00,200;24:04,920;"After starting the his career, never having thrown an exception in like a few"
24:04,920;24:07,480;"games, then he got them all out in once."
24:07,480;24:11,480;"Um, I'm surprised he didn't make more of this being a Tom Brady revenge game."
24:11,480;24:18,000;"Because this was the news where like, you know, Brady was from San Mateo and like"
24:18,000;24:20,400;"grew up loving the 49ers in Joe Montana."
24:20,400;24:23,920;"And then like being salty that the 49ers didn't draft him."
24:23,920;24:29,080;"I'm going to guess that whoever was a GM in 2000 is no longer the GM"
24:29,080;24:30,840;"on two or 13 team."
24:30,840;24:32,240;"Oh, can we stat check that?"
24:33,920;24:36,360;"Who was the who was a 49er GM in 2000?"
24:36,360;24:39,440;"Greg, I don't know."
24:39,440;24:41,080;"It's such a good step."
24:41,080;24:43,600;"I tried to look at the promo question that couldn't find an answer from"
24:43,600;24:43,800;"the"
24:43,800;24:45,920;"killing it."
24:45,920;24:48,080;"I'm glad we keep your eye on that."
24:48,080;24:50,000;"Very Donny."
24:50,000;24:51,400;"He was a GM and 04."
24:51,400;24:55,360;"There was a who was it in 2000 when they could have drafted Tom Brady."
24:55,360;24:56,600;"I've got to the bottom of that."
24:56,600;24:58,760;"He was 2001 GM."
24:58,760;25:00,720;"Oh, so then who was 2000?"
25:00,720;25:03,560;"They got fired for not drafting Tom Brady in 2001."
25:03,560;25:05,560;"So"
25:05,560;25:10,360;"It's been getting fired though. Gerard cherry in this game was like playing like a bad out of hell"
25:10,360;25:12,840;"doubting puns at the goal line"
25:12,840;25:19,240;"By they're talking about how he was actually waived and resigned this week. So I think somebody gm 2009ers bill Walsh"
25:19,240;25:25,180;"Aha mosty daisies. Yeah, well, see daisies probably should have drafted the next"
25:25,180;25:29,000;"Joe Montana, but oh well who was it that said that they"
25:29,000;25:31,720;"Had like a third round"
25:31,720;25:35,800;"There's someone famous bill, Paulian bill, Paulian yeah, he said he had a first round"
25:35,800;25:40,280;"Autumn or something stupid. Yeah, well, yeah sure you did. That's why you didn't draft"
25:40,280;25:43,320;"That's the quickest way for me to fucking think you're phony"
25:43,320;25:45,080;"Yeah"
25:45,080;25:47,080;"Say shit like that. I just"
25:47,080;25:50,760;"We didn't see it coming. We got that one wrong. That's fine"
25:50,760;25:55,400;"This is like you're not gonna get everyone right but to be like, yeah, why I saw it coming? I just you know, I didn't do it"
25:55,400;25:58,200;"That is the biggest"
25:58,200;26:01,560;"Idiot if you know you so good. Why did you have to be?"
26:01,560;26:05,160;"Well, yes. So, oh, yeah, no, I knew the Celtics were going away. I just didn't say that."
26:05,160;26:08,360;"Yeah. I thought I definitely thought it before the game. I just didn't tell anybody."
26:08,360;26:09,320;"Yeah. Yeah."
26:09,320;26:13,560;"He did. I put that money where your mouth is."
26:13,560;26:23,400;"Let's see what else. So, the difference between these two teams was basically shown in the first"
26:23,400;26:29,400;"quarter. The Patriots driving down their first drive, Corey Dillon fumbles the ball. He"
26:31,000;26:35,080;"catch the screen pass and it gets knocked out as you go into the ground for an extra cover."
26:35,080;26:42,520;"And then they immediately have three penalties in a row. They have holding and then holding and"
26:42,520;26:48,920;"then a false start. So they're now at first in 34, which is not a great way to take advantage"
26:48,920;26:54,280;"of a turnover. But then they would eventually score touchdown and the Patriots immediately"
26:54,280;26:59,240;"march straight down the field and tie the game on a micro-able when you're going to touch that"
26:59,240;27:05,560;"catch, which kind of shows the difference in resiliency between the two teams, I think."
27:05,560;27:11,080;"And also the fact that yeah, it's a meaningless week 17 game though."
27:11,080;27:15,000;"That's what we have to put all we have to view all of this through the lens of."
27:15,000;27:15,960;"Yeah."
27:15,960;27:18,920;"Nobody on that field really gives a shit about the final score."
27:18,920;27:23,160;"They're just playing to either not get hurt or try and get signed by someone next year."
27:23,160;27:26,840;"Maybe I watched that highlight and it was a fourth quarter,"
27:27,800;27:33,940;"Corey Dillon touchdown where on Davey hands off to Corey Dillon and just nobody even wants to touch him and Corey"
27:33,940;27:40,360;"doesn't want to go ahead. He just kind of falls over a little bit like the pro ball. Yeah, and it fell is not worth playing"
27:40,360;27:48,440;"if you're not playing at 100 percent. Right. It's almost insulting to the game football. Yeah. That's true. I do think this 49"
27:48,440;27:55,800;"defense was playing till the end. The offense gave up at the half. Have you ever guys been on a team where you just like give up? Yeah."
27:56,360;27:57,360;"Every team Greg."
27:57,360;28:02,080;"Steve's the reason the teams give up."
28:02,080;28:07,080;"I'm in the other guy's who gives a fuck."
28:07,080;28:10,360;"The first one that like undoes their tie at a wedding."
28:10,360;28:13,320;"Everyone just likes like dominoes after that."
28:13,320;28:15,200;"Actually, I'm the opposite now."
28:15,200;28:16,240;"I got a new strategy."
28:16,240;28:18,400;"I keep it on the whole time."
28:18,400;28:19,840;"Your last guy would tie."
28:19,840;28:22,280;"Dude, I got a new one."
28:22,280;28:24,160;"It's tie the tire on your head."
28:24,160;28:25,400;"That's that guy."
28:26,000;28:27,480;"I think Steve would be that guy."
28:27,480;28:28,400;"Not even."
28:28,400;28:29,640;"She goes wild with that."
28:29,640;28:31,520;"They knew."
28:31,520;28:36,040;"Now he's pictured Steve as the the tie around your head."
28:36,040;28:37,760;"OK. Oh, yeah, we've all been out in the."
28:37,760;28:40,920;"I mean, I'm the one who splits the pants right up the ass scene, you know, that is true."
28:40,920;28:42,640;"You have just once though, right?"
28:42,640;28:44,360;"Or the one time I remember."
28:44,360;28:45,200;"Yeah."
28:45,200;28:47,960;"I tell everybody that story is pretty good."
28:47,960;28:50,680;"Kids just got to dunk."
28:50,680;28:51,800;"He doesn't know where to put it."
28:51,800;28:53,680;"Steve, Steve's built for weddings."
28:53,680;28:54,200;"Yeah."
28:54,200;28:55,200;"Yeah."
28:55,200;28:58,000;"Thank God I got three and three weeks in October."
28:58,000;29:00,480;"But yeah, I did."
29:00,480;29:01,480;"I don't know what that."
29:01,480;29:02,160;"Yeah."
29:02,160;29:06,400;"But as you alluded to Steve, the, the starter did not play in the fourth quarter."
29:06,400;29:09,720;"Roan, even though the score was only 14 seven."
29:09,720;29:13,280;"Patriots, the future of the Patriots, Roan, Davey, Roan, Davey."
29:13,280;29:17,840;"Roan, Davey, a linebacker playing quarterback, dude."
29:17,840;29:19,000;"A huge man."
29:19,000;29:20,160;"Huge."
29:20,160;29:22,560;"He can move to throw on the run."
29:22,560;29:23,200;"Almost throw it."
29:23,200;29:24,120;"I had an art of a question."
29:24,480;29:25,520;"He was the head of his time."
29:25,520;29:28,080;"If he, Roan Day becomes out now, he's by the first round pick."
29:28,080;29:30,280;"Roan Day, like, um,"
29:30,280;29:32,440;"like so tools."
29:32,440;29:34,440;"He's like a Jacobi percent."
29:34,440;29:38,920;"I think that I think that's probably his ceiling is Jacobi percent."
29:38,920;29:41,600;"I think he was just too big."
29:41,600;29:44,520;"He was a big guy, but he could move though, just like Jacobi could."
29:44,520;29:46,080;"Yeah."
29:46,080;29:48,400;"Ken, I think it's two, two, forty five."
29:48,400;29:49,400;"That's a big boy."
29:49,400;29:50,000;"It's a big boy."
29:50,000;29:50,160;"Yeah."
29:50,160;29:51,920;"But I mean, everybody's bigger than that in those days."
29:51,920;29:53,280;"Like what will I back us back then?"
29:53,280;29:55,280;"He's Jamaican."
29:55,280;29:57,280;"Had to be big."
29:57,280;30:01,280;"Rowan Devi rules, dude."
30:01,280;30:05,280;"Did you know he was player of the year in NFL Europe?"
30:05,280;30:06,280;"I did."
30:06,280;30:09,280;"He tore it up in NFL Europe."
30:09,280;30:11,280;"For Lynn Thunder."
30:11,280;30:13,280;"They're bringing that back."
30:13,280;30:15,280;"NFL Europe."
30:15,280;30:17,280;"Yeah, it's about to expand the tag."
30:17,280;30:19,280;"of course."
30:19,280;30:21,540;"(laughing)"
30:21,540;30:25,940;"- Jags aren't good enough for that."
30:25,940;30:27,940;"No, we actually want some real players."
30:27,940;30:31,740;"- Yeah, Jags Civil just ends up coming in last"
30:31,740;30:32,740;"in NFL Europe."
30:32,740;30:37,620;"- Well, I think the rule is you're only allowed to roster."
30:37,620;30:41,820;"I wanna say it's four football players from America"
30:41,820;30:44,260;"on each team, a maximum of four,"
30:44,260;30:46,180;"and only two of them or two or three of them"
30:46,180;30:48,820;"be on the field at the same time. So it's cool."
30:48,820;30:51,420;"They're definitely trying to get like home grown talent to play these games."
30:51,420;30:55,380;"Most of the teams, I think, are in like the Germany area"
30:55,380;31:00,500;"with a few here and there. I think a couple like Italian teams, things like that."
31:00,500;31:03,380;"The Germans like football. Apparently. Yeah."
31:03,380;31:05,980;"Well, the NFL is going to Germany this year, isn't there?"
31:05,980;31:08,980;"Yeah, I'm just playing over there. Yeah. Yeah."
31:08,980;31:11,300;"We have a couple of games Munich."
31:11,300;31:12,820;"I'm assuming."
31:12,980;31:17,140;"Allianz Arena. Yeah, I think the tickets were like surprisingly affordable when they came out."
31:17,140;31:20,460;"You're gonna go Andy? I'm not."
31:20,460;31:23,980;"Why? Because I have a four month old."
31:23,980;31:26,180;"Yeah, I'm having a house."
31:26,180;31:30,780;"I'm just going to the grocery store about myself is like an adventure."
31:30,780;31:33,460;"By that point, you can be a luke some food and water out for him."
31:33,460;31:34,620;"He'll be fine. Yeah."
31:34,620;31:34,940;"Yeah."
31:34,940;31:37,540;"Let's get him. Give him a couple of shots of Jack."
31:37,540;31:38,940;"Yeah, it'll be fine."
31:38,940;31:40,500;"Put him up for a few hours."
31:40,500;31:41,540;"Yeah."
31:42,300;31:44,820;"That's all I need to go to Germany watch for a couple hours."
31:44,820;31:47,620;"We find a red eye at there and back again."
31:47,620;31:49,100;"Go for the weekend."
31:49,100;31:52,980;"Can you name the"
31:52,980;31:56,060;"the Davey five?"
31:56,060;32:00,460;"The five quarterbacks drafted ahead of"
32:00,460;32:01,300;"bro on Davey."
32:01,300;32:05,020;"Absolutely not."
32:05,020;32:07,260;"I'll listen and Dorsey."
32:07,260;32:09,900;"No, this is 2002."
32:11,620;32:17,380;"David Carr, Joey Harrington, Patrick Ramsey, Josh McCown, and David Garard."
32:17,380;32:21,580;"So you could argue that he was on par with all of those and the page"
32:21,580;32:22,860;"that got him for cheek."
32:22,860;32:25,620;"All those names are better."
32:25,620;32:26,700;"Yeah."
32:26,700;32:29,220;"Come on, team Greg here, except maybe Patrick Ramsey."
32:29,220;32:29,740;"Yeah."
32:29,740;32:30,140;"I don't know."
32:30,140;32:31,620;"I think it's a situational thing, Greg."
32:31,620;32:32,540;"I think it's a situation."
32:32,540;32:35,100;"You don't know because he had to sit behind Tom Bray the whole time."
32:35,100;32:38,060;"Maybe he was as good as them talent wise."
32:38,060;32:39,740;"Maybe you just didn't get his chance."
32:39,740;32:41,020;"I agree with that."
32:41,140;32:47,180;"Yeah, but as far as like accomplishments, you know, Joey Harrington really put up"
32:47,180;32:47,940;"those accomplishments."
32:47,940;32:51,780;"I think Joey Harrington, more people know the name Joey Harrington than"
32:51,780;32:53,660;"know the name Rohan Navy."
32:53,660;32:55,100;"Not listen to this podcast."
32:55,100;33:01,540;"Also, starting NFL games as opposed to being a backup is for sure more"
33:01,540;33:03,340;"accomplished, even if you lose those games."
33:03,340;33:06,660;"It is telling that he never plays for another team."
33:06,660;33:08,020;"Yeah."
33:08,340;33:13,380;"If you can win a starting job, maybe the Patriots just really valued him so much that they wouldn't let him go."
33:13,380;33:15,380;"He only played the Patriots."
33:15,380;33:17,380;"The spin zone brown over there."
33:17,380;33:18,300;"Let him go."
33:18,300;33:22,140;"After the season, and this is the last game he shows up in."
33:22,140;33:23,420;"That's fine."
33:23,420;33:26,020;"You know how he ended up losing his job?"
33:26,020;33:28,140;"Doug Flute."
33:28,140;33:29,940;"Really?"
33:29,940;33:30,500;"Mm hmm."
33:30,500;33:30,780;"Okay."
33:30,780;33:33,100;"According to Wikipedia.com."
33:33,100;33:36,740;"Upon returns to the Patriots, he losses backup."
33:37,420;33:42,700;"job to Doug Flute and lost the third string slot to Matt Castle."
33:42,700;33:44,140;"Oh, we're interesting."
33:44,140;33:45,460;"Foreshadowing."
33:45,460;33:48,500;"Rowan's middle name is St. Patrick."
33:48,500;33:50,700;"That's pretty dope."
33:50,700;33:52,340;"Everything gets lit on."
33:52,340;33:55,020;"So Rowan St. Patrick's, Davey."
33:55,020;34:00,020;"Dude, this guy rules from Jamaica."
34:00,020;34:02,700;"Why St. Patrick?"
34:02,700;34:03,940;"A thing in Jamaica."
34:03,940;34:07,260;"I think religion is the same everywhere."
34:07,260;34:08,100;"- Yeah, I guess."
34:08,100;34:11,700;"- Yeah, it's probably, you know, the Jamaican,"
34:11,700;34:13,940;"the Irish say that I feel like they have a similar vibe."
34:13,940;34:16,860;"No, Jamaicans and Irish shit."
34:16,860;34:18,700;"(laughing)"
34:18,700;34:19,540;"- What?"
34:19,540;34:21,300;"- See, I view them as complete opposites."
34:21,300;34:22,820;"- I got similar vibes."
34:22,820;34:24,900;"- I know, I know, I know."
34:24,900;34:26,980;"- People are like miserable drunken pricks"
34:26,980;34:30,060;"that live in a terrible climate and are super pasty."
34:30,060;34:32,220;"Jamaicans are like, yam on."
34:32,220;34:33,740;"- Well, I was gonna bring them right into that."
34:33,740;34:35,860;"I was talking about, no, I think they're vibes."
34:35,860;34:38,940;"So the Irish love to have a good time."
34:38,940;34:40,700;"Did you make it love to have a good time?"
34:40,700;34:41,620;"- That's true."
34:41,620;34:42,780;"The times that they have,"
34:42,780;34:44,700;"the good time that they have are slightly different."
34:44,700;34:46,460;"- Yeah, I guess."
34:46,460;34:47,300;"I just see."
34:47,300;34:49,100;"- Vibes were a little more cynically."
34:49,100;34:50,620;"- The vibes are similar."
34:50,620;34:52,140;"That's all I'm saying."
34:52,140;34:53,980;"- It seems like he's a consultant now."
34:53,980;34:57,020;"- Oh yeah, he's not the offensive coordinator"
34:57,020;34:58,900;"of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers or something?"
34:58,900;35:00,060;"- Something like that."
35:00,060;35:02,500;"I got his consultant at Money Management International,"
35:02,500;35:04,940;"which is so big."
35:04,940;35:08,220;"played arena football. Everybody played arena football."
35:08,220;35:13,700;"There was a player in this game, I think, who, the guy that picked off Tom Brady, they"
35:13,700;35:18,940;"were talking about how he played in the AFL 2, the second division arena football."
35:18,940;35:23,860;"Really? Yeah. Where you only got paid, you got paid 50 bucks if your team won the game."
35:23,860;35:30,500;"Oh, and that was a few years ago. And now he's starting quarterback on the awful, but starting"
35:30,500;35:34,500;"quarterback in the AFL for the 49ers and picking off Tom Brady. That's, I mean, that's, that's"
35:34,500;35:39,300;"me bring you kids, all right? Until your grandkids one day, I picked off Tom Brady."
35:39,300;35:44,980;"Don't worry about it. But speaking of money management, Steve, Corey Dillon in this game"
35:44,980;35:53,140;"achieved one of his incentives, which was going over 1600 yards, and he matched it. So we got"
35:53,140;35:58,900;"an extra 375k for his 100-yard rushing game in this game, which is the first time"
35:59,940;36:03,780;"running back, went over 1600 and like a very long time for the Patriots."
36:03,780;36:07,300;"And since, right? Yeah, I don't think everybody has since."
36:07,300;36:18,420;"Definitely not. No, I got a question, not a rhetorical, but who is the all time Patriots"
36:18,420;36:23,300;"backup quarterback Tom Brady. Oh, nice Andy. It's a good one."
36:25,220;36:29,460;"I mean, in the sense that they never played, they never like came to fruition."
36:29,460;36:33,860;"So no castle, no Brady, no cam."
36:33,860;36:36,580;"Well, your count, though, is what about percent?"
36:36,580;36:38,980;"Or your counts, percent counts."
36:38,980;36:43,540;"But percent started in, um, yeah, but I mean, like a season, they didn't play a season."
36:43,540;36:48,100;"Um, like two seasons, Michael Bishop, Michael Bishop."
36:48,100;36:49,220;"That's who I was thinking too."
36:49,220;36:51,860;"Michael Bishop, all time backup."
36:51,860;36:54,100;"Everybody was so hyped on Bishop."
36:54,820;36:57,020;"And then you could throw Garoppolo in that too."
36:57,020;36:58,300;"Yes, that's the way."
36:58,300;36:59,660;"Garoppolo made it to a Super Bowl."
36:59,660;37:01,060;"I don't think you can throw him in that same thing."
37:01,060;37:03,860;"Yeah, but I mean, if you can't put Matt Castle in there, then you can't put."
37:03,860;37:07,380;"I'm viewing it through this lens of the guy that was the backup that everybody"
37:07,380;37:09,340;"used to be like, you've watched me pre-season goal."
37:09,340;37:11,380;"He looked pretty good with the second unit."
37:11,380;37:13,860;"Maybe, you know, maybe there's something there."
37:13,860;37:15,820;"Like we used to say that with Bishop all the time."
37:15,820;37:17,180;"We used to say that with Davy."
37:17,180;37:19,340;"We used to say that with Garoppolo."
37:19,340;37:21,460;"Hoyer, everyone kind of knew it sucked."
37:21,460;37:22,300;"It's dim."
37:22,300;37:24,020;"Who was the answer?"
37:24,020;37:30,980;"Yeah, what was the, um, the one Greg when we went to, um, the, the preseason practice."
37:30,980;37:32,860;"And it was like right after Brady was good."
37:32,860;37:33,660;"It was around this time."
37:33,660;37:36,660;"Um, he's a head coach now."
37:36,660;37:37,940;"Oh, yeah."
37:37,940;37:39,260;"The guy from Texas tech."
37:39,260;37:40,140;"Yeah."
37:40,140;37:40,380;"Yeah."
37:40,380;37:40,880;"What's his name?"
37:40,880;37:43,940;"Um, it was an O'Connell."
37:43,940;37:46,580;"He was after the fancy looking guy."
37:46,580;37:47,380;"Yeah."
37:47,380;37:47,700;"Yeah."
37:47,700;37:48,500;"A Sirelle."
37:48,500;37:49,940;"Oh, Arizona."
37:49,940;37:52,940;"Say it against Eve Patrick Mahomes."
37:53,460;37:57,660;"No, oh, you should have fucking made him repeat it because it's something so"
37:57,660;38:03,700;"done. Arizona, a coach, someone out there is like Cliff Kingsbury."
38:03,700;38:04,820;"Yeah, that's him. Yes."
38:04,820;38:06,420;"Cliff. That's a good one too. Yep."
38:06,420;38:08,300;"And then you were you were hiring him."
38:08,300;38:09,020;"You're like, he's the next song."
38:09,020;38:10,980;"It's got to be Garoppolo."
38:10,980;38:15,380;"He had by far the most hype around him."
38:15,380;38:17,620;"Yeah. I think he was just"
38:17,620;38:22,500;"an all-in-game. We played three quarters and was lit and then immediately got hurt."
38:22,860;38:23,860;"Oh, yeah."
38:23,860;38:25,860;"Talk about a flash in the pan."
38:25,860;38:26,700;"How was that?"
38:26,700;38:29,020;"That game we were all so hyped up."
38:29,020;38:30,780;"I mean, Brissette was the same though."
38:30,780;38:31,900;"I mean, he had like a ring."
38:31,900;38:34,140;"No, no, no, no."
38:34,140;38:35,220;"And he'd be great."
38:35,220;38:36,060;"He's different."
38:36,060;38:37,140;"His release."
38:37,140;38:38,140;"How quick it was."
38:38,140;38:40,100;"And he was a second round pick."
38:40,100;38:41,300;"So people were like, well,"
38:41,300;38:43,940;"Belichick must have seen something, you know, like he did."
38:43,940;38:46,300;"I mean, he's good when he's not hurt."
38:46,300;38:48,180;"Yeah, he's really good."
38:48,180;38:49,300;"He just always hurt."
38:50,860;38:57,340;"Best the best abilities availability, right Greg. That's right. All right. Bishop though. Bishop was awesome. Yeah"
38:57,340;39:01,440;"Yeah, he was he was backing up Drew Bladso and they would bring him on"
39:01,440;39:06,300;"Basically only to throw Hail Mary's and he completed one once I was like why isn't he playing more?"
39:06,300;39:12,400;"But what I I believe he like couldn't he had struggled to learn the playbook or something like that because"
39:12,400;39:17,580;"He was from Kansas. I think is seventh or a graphic. Yeah, and"
39:18,580;39:23,860;"And so he just like I remember there be like they bring him in a like goal line situations to run like the option"
39:23,860;39:25,780;"and he would still like"
39:25,780;39:29,700;"They'd have to be like be like false starts and delay again something like that"
39:29,700;39:32,460;"So which it didn't quite work out"
39:32,460;39:35,460;"also on that topic speaking of guys who"
39:35,460;39:40,860;"Flash but never didn't quite work out Bethel Johnson had a pretty decent game"
39:40,860;39:45,100;"Yeah, he had a very Bethel Johnson game. Let me say I like"
39:48,180;39:51,340;"I think Bethel Johnson is a lot better than I had in my head."
39:51,340;39:55,940;"Yeah, I agree, but he always just can't stay on the field is a problem."
39:55,940;40:00,740;"Like half the games, it's like he was not dressed to play because he didn't"
40:00,740;40:03,460;"participate well in practice this week or something like that."
40:03,460;40:04,580;"That was steep."
40:04,580;40:06,220;"Yeah."
40:06,220;40:08,700;"What not participating practice?"
40:08,700;40:09,700;"Yeah."
40:09,700;40:13,700;"But he actually slide on type one Thornton when they drafted in this year."
40:13,700;40:16,260;"Oh, you know, there's a next up Johnson."
40:16,260;40:18,100;"And he's actually like, that was good."
40:18,100;40:18,700;"Yeah."
40:18,700;40:19,620;"It's really good in these games."
40:19,620;40:21,820;"Uh, he was actually returning punts in this game."
40:21,820;40:22,620;"First one he did."
40:22,620;40:23,380;"He took it to the house."
40:23,380;40:27,500;"Be like a call back for like a, and if he block in the back, that didn't actually"
40:27,500;40:29,140;"need to be blocked, which is stupid."
40:29,140;40:31,740;"It was the worst, but yes."
40:31,740;40:35,980;"And, but he also like had a deep bond from bomb from Rowan that he just like"
40:35,980;40:37,980;"let go right through his hands right at the end of the game."
40:37,980;40:39,620;"So kind of a typical."
40:39,620;40:41,460;"So you thought the referee was bad, Andy?"
40:41,460;40:44,340;"Referene was fine."
40:44,340;40:45,580;"What about the comment?"
40:45,580;40:48,540;"No, these referees were definitely like, let's get the fuck out of here."
40:48,540;40:49,420;"We're not calling anything."
40:49,420;40:50,980;"Let's clip that one, Steve."
40:50,980;40:53,340;"Yeah, he just said the referee was fine."
40:53,340;40:54,140;"Yeah."
40:54,140;40:55,580;"It's all good."
40:55,580;40:58,140;"I don't believe I don't believe my years."
40:58,140;40:59,500;"All right."
40:59,500;41:02,460;"How do you think the refereeing has been in the NBA playoffs?"
41:02,460;41:04,140;"One game was bad."
41:04,140;41:06,780;"The other ones, yeah, it hasn't been bad in the finals, actually."
41:06,780;41:09,820;"How is it better than the heat in the Buck series?"
41:09,820;41:10,740;"There's atrocious."
41:10,740;41:14,060;"But you want physical basketball."
41:14,060;41:15,460;"You should have watched the Buck series, Andy."
41:15,460;41:17,460;"Yeah, that was football."
41:17,460;41:18,960;"I don't want physical basketball."
41:18,960;41:20,960;"I want you said there's not violence."
41:20,960;41:22,960;"Yeah, there's a lot of violence."
41:22,960;41:23,960;"That's not violence."
41:23,960;41:24,960;"You like concussions?"
41:24,960;41:25,960;"Yeah."
41:25,960;41:26,460;"Yeah."
41:26,460;41:30,360;"I mean, not for the players sake."
41:30,360;41:32,960;"No, but for entertainment sake, there's nothing better."
41:32,960;41:34,460;"Washington big hit."
41:34,460;41:36,960;"I mean, what was that segment of these have?"
41:36,960;41:39,960;"So you got lit up."
41:39,960;41:40,960;"Whatever hell it was."
41:40,960;41:41,960;"Yeah."
41:41,960;41:42,800;"- Yeah."
41:42,800;41:46,340;"They had fucking VHS videos of like,"
41:46,340;41:48,400;"NFL's greatest hits."
41:48,400;41:50,640;"And it was just like people getting their heads taken off."
41:50,640;41:51,480;"- Yeah."
41:51,480;41:52,320;"- I can't watch."
41:52,320;41:53,720;"- The Lorn's Tale or Blind Side and Quarterback"
41:53,720;41:56,200;"for like 45 minutes on VHS."
41:56,200;41:57,640;"- It's different when they have a helmet on,"
41:57,640;42:00,680;"like compared to like MMA, I can't watch MMA."
42:00,680;42:01,520;"- Oh yeah, no I can't."
42:01,520;42:02,400;"- And they like knock someone out"
42:02,400;42:04,560;"and then just smoke them in the face"
42:04,560;42:05,920;"like twice when they're on the ground."
42:05,920;42:06,960;"- Yeah, before the,"
42:06,960;42:08,440;"yeah the referee can get there to break it up."
42:08,440;42:09,760;"- It's brutal."
42:09,760;42:11,720;"- You're gonna have a different kind of mind to be able to be like,"
42:11,720;42:14,960;"I knocked this guy out, but I'ma hit him until somebody tears me off him."
42:14,960;42:15,920;"Just in case."
42:15,920;42:16,760;"Yeah."
42:16,760;42:18,600;"Fucking crazy."
42:18,600;42:18,960;"Yeah."
42:18,960;42:19,240;"Great."
42:19,240;42:20,480;"She is."
42:20,480;42:22,680;"All right."
42:22,680;42:24,360;"Want to do a best and worst?"
42:24,360;42:28,640;"Actually, no, Greg, we didn't you want to talk about the, um, playoff picture before we do that."
42:28,640;42:30,440;"Oh boy."
42:30,440;42:33,520;"Yeah, that's what I thought we're doing it live."
42:33,520;42:36,200;"Let's do it live."
42:36,200;42:36,760;"Fuck it."
42:36,760;42:38,920;"I would be love."
42:38,920;42:41,000;"I would love to see a podcast you ran."
42:41,000;42:49,000;"All right, so I will see here 2004."
42:49,000;42:55,000;"Standing sorry division winners let's let's talk division winners right obviously the paths when east."
42:55,000;43:01,000;"Pittsburgh Steelers are the number one seed in the AFC with the 15 and one record."
43:01,000;43:04,000;"Was it the last tee?"
43:04,000;43:05,000;"It was a brief."
43:05,000;43:08,000;"It was week one, whatever it was."
43:08,000;43:11,000;"Yeah, yeah, because it was a week one or two."
43:11,000;43:13,400;"One, because Ben lotser comes in week two."
43:13,400;43:14,400;"So Roth is first."
43:14,400;43:18,400;"Yeah, but I think that could have been the loss, but it wasn't a game you started."
43:18,400;43:21,000;"So it didn't go as this is my segment."
43:21,000;43:24,400;"Well, answer the fucking questions then."
43:24,400;43:26,900;"Yeah, this is a stupid question."
43:26,900;43:27,900;"Back check it."
43:27,900;43:32,340;"All right."
43:32,340;43:33,340;"Back to business."
43:33,340;43:38,420;"ASES South, the Indianapolis Colts 12 and 4, the West Chargers 12 and 4."
43:38,420;43:44,580;"So the usual suspects in the AFC Pats, Steelers Colts Chargers, Broncos and"
43:44,580;43:47,540;"the Jets sneak in as the wild cards."
43:47,540;43:48,020;"Okay."
43:48,020;43:48,660;"Yes."
43:48,660;43:53,100;"And and the bills they were saying in this game, the commentators are the bills"
43:53,100;43:56,580;"were the team that got hot late and nobody wanted to play them if they made"
43:56,580;43:57,100;"the playoffs."
43:57,100;44:01,100;"So probably good for AFC, the bills are not like the playoffs."
44:01,100;44:02,460;"They finished a game out."
44:02,900;44:05,220;"But these cults, they're also talking about them."
44:05,220;44:09,700;"And they put up a little, um, you know, stat thing about them, uh,"
44:09,700;44:13,060;"Peyton Manning set the NFL record for 49 touchdown passes."
44:13,060;44:15,220;"Most touchdown passes ever breaking Dan Marino's record."
44:15,220;44:19,060;"So their second straight AFC South title, they also had three wide receivers"
44:19,060;44:23,500;"on this team with a thousand yards and 10 touchdowns, which had never been"
44:23,500;44:24,380;"done the NFL before."
44:24,380;44:26,580;"So this is a fucking offensive wagon."
44:26,580;44:29,460;"Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne and you named the third guy."
44:29,460;44:30,620;"Dallas Clark."
44:30,620;44:31,860;"No."
44:31,860;44:40,900;"Here Garçon Brandon Stokley and Dwight Frini leads the NFL with 16 sacks."
44:40,900;44:47,060;"And the number two offense in the league, you can't sit at Chiefs when seven and nine."
44:47,060;44:49,100;"Miss left. Oops."
44:49,100;44:50,100;"Whoopsie daisies."
44:50,100;44:56,060;"So what does the NFC look like NFC? NFC East. The NFC sucked. Yeah."
44:56,060;45:03,160;"Yeah, the Eagles wanted at 13 and three of the only teams to finish above 500 Giants Cowboys and Redskins all had six wins"
45:03,160;45:08,340;"kind of see north good our good buddy five ray 10 and six"
45:08,340;45:12,700;"Wins the division Vikings are in at eight and eight as a wild card"
45:12,700;45:20,660;"Falcons win the south 11 and five and the Seahawks win the West nine and seven"
45:21,140;45:28,320;"The Rams get in with an eight and eight record so two 500 teams is your wildcards dog shit conference"
45:28,320;45:31,500;"Yeah, two five hundred and nine and seven two nine and seven"
45:31,500;45:34,220;"one nine and seven"
45:34,220;45:37,180;"There's only one team that had less than six losses"
45:37,180;45:40,860;"Good Lord. That's Tina one soon. So basically the"
45:40,860;45:44,620;"Eagles had a cake walk to the Super Bowl"
45:44,620;45:47,140;"Which is the only reason I got there because as they are fourth attempt"
45:47,140;45:52,980;"I think getting the AFC the NFC championship game. They finally hold Andy break through"
45:52,980;45:56,740;"Yeah, and Ian Donovan, but it sounds like they had a cakewalk to do it"
45:56,740;46:00,540;"So we got Colts Broncos chargers jets"
46:00,540;46:04,140;"Pat's and the Steelers get a buy"
46:04,140;46:11,460;"And wait who the Colts playing the Colts are playing the Broncos Colts Bronco. Oh, I think I remember that"
46:11,460;46:16,380;"Yeah, that was a game where nobody punted. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely bar burner. I thought that was last year"
46:16,380;46:19,020;"I think the locals in that last year too."
46:19,020;46:20,220;"I think they do it back in back years."
46:20,220;46:22,780;"Oh, until they meet the Patriots."
46:22,780;46:24,020;"Yeah, we'll know how that goes."
46:24,020;46:28,660;"Yeah, I'm excited about this, this playoff run."
46:28,660;46:34,820;"I did like that they showed the place where they hang the banners in New England,"
46:34,820;46:38,860;"like they had them on the walkway and there was only two."
46:38,860;46:43,340;"And just so empty with just the two banners like, Oh, that's quaint."
46:43,340;46:44,140;"I remember those days."
46:44,900;46:46,500;"All right, so that's that's the playoff thing."
46:46,500;46:46,820;"Yeah."
46:46,820;46:47,340;"Yeah."
46:47,340;46:49,620;"MVP Peyton Manning, of course."
46:49,620;46:52,860;"Who's the fan player there?"
46:52,860;46:55,460;"Walter Peyton, man of the year work done."
46:55,460;46:58,100;"OK, worked on it."
46:58,100;46:59,740;"He's done like a shit ton of work."
46:59,740;47:02,060;"He like builds people houses, I think now."
47:02,060;47:04,460;"Like, yeah, super big humanitarian."
47:04,460;47:05,620;"Didn't he?"
47:05,620;47:06,580;"He did."
47:06,580;47:08,380;"He built a house for somebody famous."
47:08,380;47:10,100;"I think I'm gonna go to Marjax or something."
47:10,100;47:11,380;"Really?"
47:11,380;47:12,980;"Yeah, I think I saw it."
47:12,980;47:14,980;"- Look that shit up Andy."
47:14,980;47:19,680;"Defensive player of the year, Ed Reed."
47:19,680;47:23,400;"Big Ben Rookie of the year for offense"
47:23,400;47:27,240;"and Jonathan Vilma, AP defensive rookie of the year."
47:27,240;47:30,060;"- He had a pick six against the"
47:30,060;47:35,760;"against the Rams in this final week"
47:35,760;47:40,120;"to send the just to the playoffs."
47:40,120;47:44,760;"Interesting, interesting comeback player of the year, Drew Brees."
47:44,760;47:47,000;"Oh, right."
47:47,000;47:49,480;"With the Saints, right?"
47:49,480;47:50,800;"This is his first year on the sides."
47:50,800;47:53,720;"I believe I think he's still on the Chargers, isn't he?"
47:53,720;47:55,000;"Mm."
47:55,000;47:56,520;"That's like a looksy poo here."
47:56,520;47:57,200;"No."
47:57,200;47:59,120;"Yeah, Drew Brees is still on the Chargers because right?"
47:59,120;48:01,960;"Because that's why they shipped him out is because he had what was it?"
48:01,960;48:03,520;"Like elbow washers or something like that."
48:03,520;48:06,520;"Uh, the helper knew something like that."
48:06,520;48:08,320;"I could be wrong."
48:08,680;48:11,560;"It's crazy to think about Drew Brees's Chargers days."
48:11,560;48:12,160;"Like that."
48:12,160;48:12,400;"Yeah."
48:12,400;48:12,840;"Oh, yeah."
48:12,840;48:16,600;"I thought he like was OK and then got her and then got shipped out."
48:16,600;48:18,240;"I know he went to the playoffs."
48:18,240;48:20,720;"He must have shipped out after this year."
48:20,720;48:21,200;"Awesome."
48:21,200;48:22,240;"Yeah."
48:22,240;48:27,680;"Greg, so you were close, but it's not as happy a story anymore."
48:27,680;48:28,160;"Oh, no."
48:28,160;48:30,200;"By providing families with a positive home environment,"
48:30,200;48:33,240;"WCB ladies below in 2006, one of these homes"
48:33,240;48:36,720;"that done built through his charity,"
48:36,720;48:38,680;"happen to go to the family future NFL player."
48:38,680;48:40,320;"Is Sean Watson."
48:40,320;48:40,820;"Oh, no."
48:40,820;48:45,720;"How many how many women were molested in that house?"
48:45,720;48:49,640;"He's like, can you meet me at the much out at home?"
48:49,640;48:51,680;"It's only like 30 minutes away."
48:51,680;48:52,160;"Oops."
48:52,160;48:57,120;"So let's talk about that."
48:57,120;48:58,160;"Both circle."
48:58,160;48:59,560;"Let's talk about that."
48:59,560;49:01,920;"Do you think the Sean Watson plays this year?"
49:01,920;49:04,160;"No, probably not."
49:04,160;49:05,320;"Probably not."
49:05,320;49:10,920;"Well, they suspended, uh, who was the Ridley for gambling on football for a year, which is crazy."
49:10,920;49:11,720;"Yeah."
49:11,720;49:13,480;"And so it's got to be more than that, right?"
49:13,480;49:15,640;"I think it's so inconspicant with it."
49:15,640;49:15,960;"Yeah."
49:15,960;49:18,600;"66."
49:18,600;49:20,440;"That's just so much."
49:20,440;49:21,800;"In 17 months."
49:21,800;49:22,280;"Yeah."
49:22,280;49:23,080;"It's a good one."
49:23,080;49:26,200;"Just think about the logistics of that."
49:26,200;49:26,440;"Right."
49:26,440;49:28,520;"It's a numerous years every week."
49:28,520;49:32,920;"Dude, I can't even text this group chat once we..."
49:32,920;49:33,800;"We know."
49:33,800;49:34,800;"And this guy's out here."
49:34,800;49:36,800;"I'm getting you to show up on a fucking podcast."
49:36,800;49:41,480;"Like God damn full time job, buttering him up and then presenting his penis."
49:41,480;49:42,680;"That's a lot of effort."
49:42,680;49:44,360;"Dude, he's getting like multiple massages from me too."
49:44,360;49:47,240;"Like he's he's fucking criminally horny."
49:47,240;49:48,200;"Yeah."
49:48,200;49:54,200;"And the fact that the Houston Texans kind of like provided him hotel rooms and"
49:54,200;49:55,160;"NDA's and shit."
49:55,160;49:56,920;"NDA's they gave him an NDA."
49:56,920;49:57,720;"Yeah."
49:57,720;49:59,000;"He's fucking Google it."
49:59,640;50:03,840;"How do you feel about Robert Crafts thing as well?"
50:03,840;50:08,760;"Well, it's different, but it's different."
50:08,760;50:13,080;"But it's also see to me, both in hand is from the souss."
50:13,080;50:16,480;"Yeah, but to me, the issue is the volume, dude."
50:16,480;50:21,120;"Like if you if if someone just went to some fucking massage"
50:21,120;50:22,960;"parlor that they knew, right?"
50:22,960;50:28,960;"Like I would never do that, but whatever this guy's got to think."
50:29,080;50:32,320;"But this guy is 66 different women."
50:32,320;50:36,960;"Yeah. Like that is like, how does he even have the time to do that?"
50:36,960;50:39,960;"He's got to be so like kind of like screw loose,"
50:39,960;50:44,160;"deranged, criminally horny to even go through with that."
50:44,160;50:48,760;"Something that that just strikes me as something that I would never even conceive"
50:48,760;50:49,760;"of doing."
50:49,760;50:52,640;"Yeah. I could see myself doing like never in a million years."
50:52,640;50:53,480;"No."
50:53,480;50:57,480;"That's just the end to thinking, you think you can get away with it."
50:58,440;51:04,220;"He thinks women were just not going to say anything about him just pulling his dick out at a massage. That's crazy. Right?"
51:04,220;51:06,220;"They got away at the 66 times."
51:06,220;51:08,340;"Like he almost did get away with it."
51:08,340;51:10,580;"Anyway, he's doing criminal charges."
51:10,580;51:12,700;"Yeah, I feel for record contract."
51:12,700;51:14,880;"Yeah, he got $230 million Gary"
51:14,880;51:15,980;"is guaranteed."
51:15,980;51:17,420;"Fucking ridiculous."
51:17,420;51:18,580;"He can't wait."
51:18,580;51:20,000;"Crazy."
51:20,000;51:21,260;"You think he sees that money?"
51:21,260;51:25,940;"That's why when people are like Kaepernick, you know, like"
51:26,800;51:33,760;"They're black balling them. It's like, no, if you're good enough, they'll look past anything in the world."
51:33,760;51:43,680;"Saying unless it goes against the shield. I mean, just look at the dance night or stuff."
51:43,680;51:47,840;"I think they don't like that. There's a whole lot of smoke now about him getting released because"
51:47,840;51:54,080;"or him having to sell the team because it came out that he was shorting the NFL money."
51:54,080;51:57,040;"And he was like cooking the books on like how much they were making."
51:57,040;51:57,600;"Really?"
51:57,600;51:58,000;"Yeah."
51:58,000;52:02,320;"And so there's a whole bunch of like, like, owners and stuff coming up and be like,"
52:02,320;52:04,080;"well, you know, maybe we'll have to take a phone."
52:04,080;52:04,800;"You know, all this shit."
52:04,800;52:05,440;"Okay, dude."
52:05,440;52:06,720;"I'd love to see him go down."
52:06,720;52:12,320;"So of all the shit he's done, the reason he gets let go is because he's hiding money from the NFL."
52:12,320;52:14,560;"Yeah, that makes sense."
52:14,560;52:16,480;"Well, there's a very rice video and then just like,"
52:16,480;52:17,040;"and whatever."
52:17,040;52:19,360;"And then it came out and like, ah, I'm gonna do something."
52:19,360;52:20,160;"Right."
52:20,160;52:20,400;"Yeah."
52:21,280;52:29,920;"If it is long as it doesn't hurt the shield they're fine with it and I think maybe you could argue that so like he's hurting the shield"
52:29,920;52:34,000;"Yeah, what's hurting the shields? Oh, yeah, he is now"
52:34,000;52:38,960;"Yeah, but it was also one of those calculator risks of you know, yeah"
52:38,960;52:43,920;"If you over like all the other exactly if you're good enough to the crowd's calculated wrong"
52:43,920;52:49,520;"What a surprise can you imagine if they're out three first round picks two hundred thirty million dollars again?"
52:50,320;52:52,520;"What about two three first rounds?"
52:52,520;52:53,920;"Yeah. Oh my God."
52:53,920;52:54,840;"Yeah."
52:54,840;52:58,160;"And Baker Mayfield still on the roster and won't play."
52:58,160;52:59,080;"Well, it's like, yeah,"
52:59,080;53:00,680;"Baker's never going to play there."
53:00,680;53:01,360;"No, he will not."
53:01,360;53:04,480;"This could be an all time meltdown from a franchise standpoint."
53:04,480;53:05,480;"All time. Yeah."
53:05,480;53:07,640;"They were so close and then they just."
53:07,640;53:09,920;"That just made me really happy."
53:09,920;53:11,720;"But correct."
53:11,720;53:17,440;"It's the most brown shit ever because they were like starting to turn around."
53:17,440;53:18,880;"They had like a good squad."
53:19,560;53:21,840;"I gave the Chiefs a run in the playoffs."
53:21,840;53:24,960;"Fantastic."
53:24,960;53:27,080;"Man, that's awesome."
53:27,080;53:28,040;"Yep."
53:28,040;53:29,720;"So good."
53:29,720;53:30,680;"Jesus."
53:30,680;53:32,960;"Anyways, Roe v."
53:32,960;53:34,280;"Roe v. Wade, what do you think of that?"
53:34,280;53:37,840;"Very no."
53:37,840;53:40,080;"Only your thoughts on you, all the taxes."
53:40,080;53:40,760;"I will not."
53:40,760;53:41,480;"OK."
53:41,480;53:43,400;"Get rid of all doors."
53:43,400;53:44,880;"No, no doors."
53:44,880;53:47,160;"No doors, no ceilings, no windows."
53:47,160;53:47,640;"Right."
53:48,000;53:51,600;"- Just helicopter them in and then they,"
53:51,600;53:53,520;"they helicopter them out once in the room."
53:53,520;53:54,800;"- Yeah, fine."
53:54,800;53:56,960;"Dude, I think we should all just be like the Matrix"
53:56,960;53:58,240;"where they put us in those pods"
53:58,240;54:01,520;"and they just download thoughts and dreams into our brains"
54:01,520;54:02,920;"and then we're completely safe"
54:02,920;54:04,080;"'cause we're in the pods."
54:04,080;54:05,560;"- Completely safe, yeah."
54:05,560;54:07,120;"- How do you know we're not in the Matrix right now, Greg?"
54:07,120;54:09,160;"- And we're happy, well, 'cause we're not happy, Andy."
54:09,160;54:10,720;"- Well, maybe I'll just, maybe once we get"
54:10,720;54:11,880;"to a certain level of unhappiness,"
54:11,880;54:13,120;"they just reset it and start over,"
54:13,120;54:14,600;"like you're rebooting a computer."
54:14,600;54:15,960;"- I'm happy."
54:15,960;54:17,560;"I'm happy. - You see the dogging shit, dude."
54:17,560;54:18,560;"You seem happy."
54:18,560;54:20,160;"Dogs and shit aren't happy."
54:20,160;54:21,000;"- They know."
54:21,000;54:21,840;"- Pigs and shit."
54:21,840;54:23,200;"Pigs and shit."
54:23,200;54:24,320;"I don't think dogs enjoy,"
54:24,320;54:25,720;"well actually some dogs do enjoy"
54:25,720;54:26,560;"being in their own show."
54:26,560;54:27,400;"- See, comment."
54:27,400;54:28,800;"If they get something gross,"
54:28,800;54:30,760;"no one can grab their socks all over it."
54:30,760;54:31,600;"- Yeah."
54:31,600;54:35,120;"- Oh yeah, we have friends that we saw recently,"
54:35,120;54:38,000;"they have two dogs and one of them apparently,"
54:38,000;54:39,080;"they used to live in California,"
54:39,080;54:40,760;"so they're on the beach"
54:40,760;54:43,400;"and they let the dogs off the leash"
54:43,400;54:47,400;"in one rental away and they went to go get it."
54:47,400;54:51,560;"And they saw him rolling around in something that turned out to be the carcass of a dead seal."
54:51,560;54:52,780;"Ooh."
54:52,780;54:53,620;"Yeah."
54:53,620;54:56,120;"And they both threw up trying to clean the dog afterwards."
54:56,120;54:57,360;"It smelled so bad."
54:57,360;54:58,920;"The dog was unbelievably happy."
54:58,920;54:59,560;"Oh, yeah."
54:59,560;55:00,960;"I bet he's camouflaged."
55:00,960;55:02,080;"So good."
55:02,080;55:05,400;"Some fucking seal guts to see."
55:05,400;55:08,360;"Follow me about his role in it."
55:08,360;55:10,360;"Unbelievable."
55:10,360;55:11,080;"Rancid."
55:11,080;55:12,440;"Yeah."
55:13,680;55:16,080;"It's like when we were back at the old house,"
55:16,080;55:19,620;"when we were by the lake, I was like walking along the shoreline"
55:19,620;55:21,480;"and like walking on rocks."
55:21,480;55:21,980;"Yeah."
55:21,980;55:24,240;"Because it was kind of the water was kind of down."
55:24,240;55:27,320;"And I stepped on one and I was like, oh, that's a furry rock."
55:27,320;55:28,960;"And it was just a dead beaver."
55:28,960;55:31,640;"[LAUGHTER]"
55:31,640;55:33,480;"Fucking gross."
55:33,480;55:34,120;"Gross dude."
55:34,120;55:37,280;"Freak me out for years."
55:37,280;55:39,600;"He's just fucking super careful"
55:39,600;55:42,600;"about where I walked after that."
55:42,600;55:43,100;"Yeah."
55:43,100;55:44,180;"- Yeah, it's nasty."
55:44,180;55:45,020;"- Yeah."
55:45,020;55:47,180;"- What's the beaver population around here guys?"
55:47,180;55:50,140;"- Around where?"
55:50,140;55:51,140;"We live in different places."
55:51,140;55:51,980;"- He's walking."
55:51,980;55:52,820;"He's got a check it."
55:52,820;55:53,660;"Check the stats."
55:53,660;55:54,900;"- Googlyc, don't scare me."
55:54,900;55:56,620;"- North Carolina beaver population."
55:56,620;55:57,460;"- Oh, he knows."
55:57,460;55:58,460;"Every time you do a therapy."
55:58,460;55:59,580;"- He does not have to go easy as are."
55:59,580;56:01,380;"- Oh, we're so talking about the same beavers."
56:01,380;56:03,460;"(laughing)"
56:03,460;56:04,700;"- Yeah."
56:04,700;56:06,100;"- It's like half of them, right?"
56:06,100;56:08,100;"(laughing)"
56:08,100;56:08,940;"- 50, 50."
56:08,940;56:11,660;"(laughing)"
56:11,660;56:15,100;"- They have attached it, they have a thing in Darrow."
56:15,100;56:18,220;"It's called the Beaver Queen pageant."
56:18,220;56:19,300;"- What?"
56:19,300;56:20,740;"- The Beaver Queen pageant."
56:20,740;56:22,060;"- No, no, I heard you, I just."
56:22,060;56:25,620;"- Okay, I don't really know where it came from,"
56:25,620;56:27,220;"but it's like they do like a newsletter"
56:27,220;56:29,300;"in the neighborhood, they hand out fires,"
56:29,300;56:33,460;"like a big thing, like girls dress up as like a beaver"
56:33,460;56:36,660;"and do whatever creative thing they can do."
56:36,660;56:40,340;"And like clockwork, every time something gets given to us"
56:40,340;56:43,580;"I was like, Oh, Kelly, wasn't that your nickname in high school?"
56:43,580;56:48,220;"I probably made that joke like 60 times."
56:48,220;56:50,860;"And it just keeps getting funnier and funnier."
56:50,860;56:52,940;"And you fucking cackled at it every time, don't you?"
56:52,940;56:55,620;"I get the fucking hilarious beaver queen."
56:55,620;56:59,780;"The best part about a joke is that the only you need to find it funny for it to be funny."
56:59,780;57:04,500;"Dude, just fills me with joy."
57:04,500;57:05,740;"It's thinking about it."
57:05,740;57:08,000;"(laughing)"
57:08,000;57:14,580;"- Oh boy, that's my best of the week."
57:14,580;57:15,500;"(laughing)"
57:15,500;57:16,420;"- Beaver queen jokes."
57:16,420;57:20,740;"- Yeah, the other go to line is not the name"
57:20,740;57:21,580;"of your sex tape."
57:21,580;57:23,980;"- Yeah, that's a good one."
57:23,980;57:26,180;"- Yeah, probably works for Beaver queen."
57:26,180;57:27,020;"Oh, that could be you."
57:27,020;57:28,460;"You could be the Beaver queen."
57:28,460;57:29,300;"- Yeah."
57:29,300;57:30,220;"- You need me your sex tape."
57:30,220;57:31,060;"- That's true."
57:31,060;57:32,940;"- You should mix it up next time."
57:32,940;57:35,700;"- No, now stay with the original drag."
57:35,700;57:37,700;"Just not in the ground."
57:37,700;57:38,700;"Yeah."
57:38,700;57:40,700;"You know, repetition."
57:40,700;57:41,700;"Yeah."
57:41,700;57:42,700;"That's what makes it fun here."
57:42,700;57:43,700;"Got to get your rest."
57:43,700;57:44,700;"Joke it to the ground."
57:44,700;57:45,700;"Yeah."
57:45,700;57:46,700;"All right."
57:46,700;57:47,700;"That's your bet."
57:47,700;57:49,700;"What's your worst, Craig?"
57:49,700;57:52,700;"We 17 football."
57:52,700;57:56,700;"They should just make a rule where if it doesn't affect either team,"
57:56,700;57:58,700;"you can just sit it out."
57:58,700;57:59,700;"Yeah."
57:59,700;58:01,700;"Isn't that why they're all."
58:01,700;58:03,460;"- Oh, I'm a bibbiclaine."
58:03,460;58:06,460;"- Yeah, they're all divisional games, though, aren't they?"
58:06,460;58:07,900;"- Yeah. - Nope."
58:07,900;58:11,040;"- Although now there's an 18th week, and so who knows?"
58:11,040;58:12,980;"- Yeah, sure."
58:12,980;58:14,380;"- I guess they'll never do that, huh?"
58:14,380;58:16,220;"I had a phone that needs their buckaroosh."
58:16,220;58:17,500;"- Oh, yeah."
58:17,500;58:19,940;"Even, here's a hot take."
58:19,940;58:24,140;"Pre-season football is better than week 17 football."
58:24,140;58:25,540;"- Yes, there's more excitement."
58:25,540;58:27,940;"- That's a very hot take, I had to disagree completely."
58:27,940;58:28,840;"- No way."
58:28,840;58:31,580;"- Yeah, no, that's, no."
58:31,580;58:32,420;"- The fourth preseason game?"
58:32,420;58:36,700;"- Like this sort of week 17, it's just meaningless."
58:36,700;58:41,380;"- It's less meaningless than..."
58:41,380;58:43,420;"- No, 'cause if preseason, you're like excited about"
58:43,420;58:45,820;"rookies, your first time getting a see-um,"
58:45,820;58:48,300;"like, oh, that could be good, you know?"
58:48,300;58:49,740;"Week 17, you're like, I don't give a shit,"
58:49,740;58:51,460;"just give me the playoffs."
58:51,460;58:53,500;"More than 49ers, like, I don't care,"
58:53,500;58:55,180;"so I'm gonna go home, I don't even wanna watch this."
58:55,180;58:56,580;"- We're on the clock."
58:56,580;58:58,260;"- Who we drafting?"
58:58,260;59:00,940;"- That's what Chris Verman said in the highlights."
59:00,940;59:01,780;"- What?"
59:01,780;59:04,640;"- He's like, the Patriots versus the 49ers"
59:04,640;59:05,940;"who were already on the clock."
59:05,940;59:07,960;"(laughing)"
59:07,960;59:10,000;"- Yeah, they were."
59:10,000;59:10,840;"- They were."
59:10,840;59:13,000;"- Locked up that number one draft pick"
59:13,000;59:16,080;"where they use to pick Alex Smith."
59:16,080;59:19,640;"- And then third round, they draft Frank Gore."
59:19,640;59:20,940;"So not a bad draft."
59:20,940;59:21,780;"- Wow."
59:21,780;59:22,840;"- Yeah."
59:22,840;59:23,880;"- Couple of stalwarts."
59:23,880;59:25,440;"I guess that's what happens when you pick first"
59:25,440;59:26,580;"and each round."
59:26,580;59:27,720;"- Yes."
59:27,720;59:30,320;"- So, all right Steve, you got any best and worst?"
59:30,320;59:32,540;"I have a best and worst one thing."
59:32,540;59:34,580;"Same call."
59:34,580;59:35,120;"Yeah."
59:35,120;59:35,860;"Okay."
59:35,860;59:38,880;"And his name is Jeff Carr."
59:38,880;59:40,120;"Yeah."
59:40,120;59:41,600;"I knew we were going to call him out."
59:41,600;59:43,520;"Oh, why is he your best?"
59:43,520;59:47,360;"Just because he didn't have, he didn't come on here and that's nice."
59:47,360;59:48,320;"So we'd have to talk to him."
59:48,320;59:53,840;"And your worst is the fact that you know, you care to explain the context of who"
59:53,840;59:54,560;"Jeff Carr is."
59:54,560;59:57,720;"It's the worst because the worst decision he ever made."
59:57,720;59:59,600;"He was our friend growing up."
59:59,600;01:00:03,000;"Inu Hampshire and it's like, I don't know,"
01:00:03,000;01:00:05,680;"it's for the 49ers, 'cause I like Jerry Rice."
01:00:05,680;01:00:06,520;"That's it."
01:00:06,520;01:00:08,680;"That was his whole thought process."
01:00:08,680;01:00:09,960;"- That was odd."
01:00:09,960;01:00:12,840;"- I mean, I was like that too, but then I graduated"
01:00:12,840;01:00:14,400;"third grade in real life."
01:00:14,400;01:00:16,320;"- But he's like a huge Red Sox fan,"
01:00:16,320;01:00:17,240;"so it didn't make any sense."
01:00:17,240;01:00:18,920;"- It's not like-- - It's a new Celtics guy."
01:00:18,920;01:00:20,080;"- Yeah."
01:00:20,080;01:00:20,920;"- Well, it's the privilege."
01:00:20,920;01:00:21,760;"- Yeah."
01:00:21,760;01:00:23,240;"- Well, everything but the Patriots."
01:00:23,240;01:00:24,240;"- And then why?"
01:00:24,240;01:00:26,080;"- Yeah, that doesn't make any sense to pick three of them,"
01:00:26,080;01:00:27,200;"but not the fourth."
01:00:27,200;01:00:29,400;"- And he did it like right before."
01:00:29,400;01:00:36,520;"like Tom Brady. It's like, yes, it's sit there. And this is the first time the niners have come up and"
01:00:36,520;01:00:41,560;"just think about his poor life there. What does he say as rationalist?"
01:00:41,560;01:00:45,240;"Like Jerry Rice, that is it. I've asked him so many times."
01:00:45,240;01:00:50,920;"So I loved Jerry Rice too. I had a huge Montana and Steve Young fan."
01:00:50,920;01:00:57,800;"I loved Joe Montana. I had his Joe Montana's action figure. Remember those little starting"
01:00:57,800;01:00:58,800;"I'm putting that line up guys."
01:00:58,800;01:00:59,800;"Remember that?"
01:00:59,800;01:01:00,800;"Fucking love that one."
01:01:00,800;01:01:02,520;"And that Jerry Rice poster in my room for you."
01:01:02,520;01:01:03,520;"I used to play."
01:01:03,520;01:01:05,640;"I play with that so much that the numbers rubbed off."
01:01:05,640;01:01:07,920;"Like it's just like a blank jersey now."
01:01:07,920;01:01:08,920;"Nope."
01:01:08,920;01:01:09,920;"Phrasing."
01:01:09,920;01:01:14,360;"We're borderline here."
01:01:14,360;01:01:15,360;"Very naughty."
01:01:15,360;01:01:16,360;"All right."
01:01:16,360;01:01:21,720;"So your best and worst is India to have been playing with things a little too much for"
01:01:21,720;01:01:22,720;"me as a kid."
01:01:22,720;01:01:23,720;"That's right."
01:01:23,720;01:01:27,760;"Music call me Beaver Queen in high school."
01:01:27,760;01:01:30,000;"(laughing)"
01:01:30,000;01:01:31,640;"- Beaver King."
01:01:31,640;01:01:33,360;"- No, they call me Beaver King."
01:01:33,360;01:01:34,200;"- Definitely not Beaver King."
01:01:34,200;01:01:37,400;"It was a very hurtful being called Beaver Queen."
01:01:37,400;01:01:38,240;"- That's cool."
01:01:38,240;01:01:39,080;"- Beaver King."
01:01:39,080;01:01:43,200;"All right, best and worst."
01:01:43,200;01:01:44,320;"Can I revise my worst?"
01:01:44,320;01:01:46,480;"My worst is you watching this game, Andy,"
01:01:46,480;01:01:48,520;"which is just a psychopath move, dude."
01:01:48,520;01:01:50,320;"- No, you cannot revise that."
01:01:50,320;01:01:51,160;"- All right, go ahead."
01:01:51,160;01:01:52,800;"- And I literally just had it on."
01:01:52,800;01:01:54,760;"- On my computer while I was working, so."
01:01:54,760;01:01:55,920;"- Mm."
01:01:55,920;01:01:57,240;"- Only half watched it."
01:01:57,240;01:02:01,620;"But I watched enough to take enough notes to carry this podcast since neither of you actually watched a fun game."
01:02:01,620;01:02:02,620;"Good for you."
01:02:02,620;01:02:07,340;"The best is the Patriots tie the best record after winning a Super Bowl."
01:02:07,340;01:02:09,140;"14 and 2."
01:02:09,140;01:02:12,300;"I didn't have enough time to go back and find out who the other team is."
01:02:12,300;01:02:19,540;"So if you know and you let us know who it was and you're correct, well, we'll send you a t-shirt."
01:02:19,540;01:02:20,540;"How about the 49ers?"
01:02:20,540;01:02:23,140;"That was Scott was."
01:02:23,140;01:02:24,980;"Pittsburgh Steelers."
01:02:24,980;01:02:27,140;"I mean, we can guess all the fucking want,"
01:02:27,140;01:02:29,260;"but you know, a lot of you know if that's correct."
01:02:29,260;01:02:31,100;"So if somebody sends us a correct answer"
01:02:31,100;01:02:31,940;"- One of us can."
01:02:31,940;01:02:32,780;"- On social media or something,"
01:02:32,780;01:02:33,900;"you can find it on the website,"
01:02:33,900;01:02:36,820;"passpad.com, find out on social media."
01:02:36,820;01:02:38,140;"If you send us the correct answer,"
01:02:38,140;01:02:39,540;"we will send you a teacher."
01:02:39,540;01:02:43,020;"So that was the best."
01:02:43,020;01:02:46,900;"Also, I don't know if this is the best or worst,"
01:02:46,900;01:02:49,740;"but they showed a list of the most,"
01:02:49,740;01:02:51,780;"the quarterbacks with the highest winning percentage"
01:02:51,780;01:02:53,660;"since 1970,"
01:02:53,660;01:02:57,600;"'cause this time Tom Brady was top with a 771 percentage."
01:02:57,600;01:03:01,700;"Other four quarterbacks in the top five, Jim McMahon,"
01:03:01,700;01:03:07,680;"Danny White of the Cowboys, Dan Marino and Mark Rippin."
01:03:07,680;01:03:12,100;"He's a fucking random assortment of quarterbacks"
01:03:12,100;01:03:14,140;"to be on the winningest quarterbacks list."
01:03:14,140;01:03:15,460;"- Danny White."
01:03:15,460;01:03:17,100;"- Danny, well yeah, I mean he was old school."
01:03:17,100;01:03:18,580;"- What?"
01:03:18,580;01:03:20,220;"- Back when the Cowboys were good, I think."
01:03:20,220;01:03:23,580;"Like Roger Starbuck era, ish, I believe."
01:03:23,580;01:03:24,960;"Jim McMahon. He was at you."
01:03:24,960;01:03:26,580;"Brady's. Huh?"
01:03:26,580;01:03:28,140;"Well, was Tom Brady's winning percentage?"
01:03:28,140;01:03:30,920;"770. Jim McMahon was 754."
01:03:30,920;01:03:33,000;"That was with the 85 Bears era."
01:03:33,000;01:03:34,020;"It's still current."
01:03:34,020;01:03:36,260;"Danny White was 738."
01:03:36,260;01:03:36,980;"So not bad."
01:03:36,980;01:03:38,380;"Dan Marino, 705."
01:03:38,380;01:03:41,180;"So it's the fact that he won that many games."
01:03:41,180;01:03:43,660;"That's such a high clip and never won a Super Bowl."
01:03:43,660;01:03:44,220;"It's pretty rough."
01:03:44,220;01:03:48,980;"And then Mark Rippon of the Washington at the time, Redskins, 689."
01:03:48,980;01:03:53,140;"Best winning percentage since 1970, which is a little"
01:03:53,140;01:03:53,980;"- It's ridiculous."
01:03:53,980;01:03:56,660;"- We got a bi-week next to you, Greg."
01:03:56,660;01:03:58,400;"- Brady's 764."
01:03:58,400;01:03:59,540;"- There is a bi-week."
01:03:59,540;01:04:02,060;"Is Brady's actually better now?"
01:04:02,060;01:04:02,900;"No, 764."
01:04:02,900;01:04:03,740;"- It's even going to go before."
01:04:03,740;01:04:04,580;"- Okay, yeah, 770."
01:04:04,580;01:04:05,740;"You're going down slightly."
01:04:05,740;01:04:06,820;"Still top of that list though."
01:04:06,820;01:04:07,660;"- What a bump."
01:04:07,660;01:04:11,020;"- No, yeah, no, so yeah, the pages will have a bi"
01:04:11,020;01:04:12,780;"in the first round of the playoffs."
01:04:12,780;01:04:15,500;"And after that, we will be up."
01:04:15,500;01:04:17,340;"- What's that? - We got an idea."
01:04:17,340;01:04:22,340;"- Bi-weeks, we should watch a pre-dynasty game."
01:04:22,940;01:04:27,340;"instead. I've got a couple that I could recommend. Yeah."
01:04:27,340;01:04:29,420;"Because then we can just pick and choose whichever one that we can"
01:04:29,420;01:04:31,140;"watch like sick games. Okay."
01:04:31,140;01:04:34,940;"I mean, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, the games."
01:04:34,940;01:04:36,260;"Yeah, something mine."
01:04:36,260;01:04:39,780;"Oh, what about finding the recordings? Any how you gonna find"
01:04:39,780;01:04:41,780;"the recording? Dude, they're out there. I've seen a couple."
01:04:41,780;01:04:43,380;"Don't worry about it. I know, Greg."
01:04:43,380;01:04:45,580;"I'll fucking worry about it, Steve."
01:04:45,580;01:04:48,060;"I got it. It is autism's on it."
01:04:48,060;01:04:49,420;"I got games."
01:04:51,380;01:04:54,300;"All right. I'm not going to share with you fucking knuckleheads."
01:04:54,300;01:04:56,140;"Knuckleheads."
01:04:56,140;01:04:56,940;"Do that Andy."
01:04:56,940;01:04:58,140;"Hucklefuck family."
01:04:58,140;01:04:59,300;"You have to share with your family."
01:04:59,300;01:05:00,060;"Mom says so."
01:05:00,060;01:05:00,780;"That's right."
01:05:00,780;01:05:01,300;"Family."
01:05:01,300;01:05:01,780;"I just want to be."
01:05:01,780;01:05:02,740;"Mom's sharing with y'all."
01:05:02,740;01:05:04,100;"I just own you both."
01:05:04,100;01:05:05,580;"You can't do that."
01:05:05,580;01:05:06,380;"I'm just did."
01:05:06,380;01:05:07,460;"I just did."
01:05:07,460;01:05:08,180;"No."
01:05:08,180;01:05:10,140;"So yeah."
01:05:10,140;01:05:10,340;"All right."
01:05:10,340;01:05:12,820;"I mean, if you want to pick a game next week, we can pick a"
01:05:12,820;01:05:13,260;"rando."
01:05:13,260;01:05:15,580;"I'm fine with that."
01:05:15,580;01:05:16,580;"I got one in mind."
01:05:16,580;01:05:17,260;"You do."
01:05:17,260;01:05:17,900;"Yeah."
01:05:17,900;01:05:18,540;"What is it?"
01:05:19,220;01:05:21,780;"Uh, the first Patriots game I went to."
01:05:21,780;01:05:24,020;"Oh, good."
01:05:24,020;01:05:24,380;"Okay."
01:05:24,380;01:05:24,860;"Hail Mary."
01:05:24,860;01:05:25,580;"It was a dude."
01:05:25,580;01:05:26,620;"It was a crazy game."
01:05:26,620;01:05:27,220;"Oh, no."
01:05:27,220;01:05:31,900;"So, uh, actually this just came up recently because on Twitter, I did a thing where"
01:05:31,900;01:05:34,100;"I had people post their favorite plays."
01:05:34,100;01:05:38,620;"Um, and I replied with the highlight of that play."
01:05:38,620;01:05:40,540;"They don't have."
01:05:40,540;01:05:41,260;"Yeah."
01:05:41,260;01:05:45,860;"And one of them was the Ben Coats touchdown."
01:05:46,740;01:05:50,660;"after the Hail Mary passing interference to be Buffalo Bills."
01:05:50,660;01:05:53,140;"Yeah, it's a great game."
01:05:53,140;01:05:54,340;"We can find that game."
01:05:54,340;01:05:58,060;"And I told everybody how salty I was that you got to go and set"
01:05:58,060;01:06:03,780;"at me because I believe at the time, Dad's the reason he took"
01:06:03,780;01:06:06,300;"you and set him new because he had taken me to a red talk team"
01:06:06,300;01:06:06,660;"that year."
01:06:06,660;01:06:10,620;"And so you got to be more and I didn't get to go to a"
01:06:10,620;01:06:12,140;"pages game until like 2006."
01:06:12,140;01:06:13,580;"You went to a Bruins game first, though."
01:06:13,580;01:06:14,420;"That's true."
01:06:14,740;01:06:15,740;"97."
01:06:15,740;01:06:18,500;"Oh, two red socks game for us."
01:06:18,500;01:06:20,260;"I have a new worst."
01:06:20,260;01:06:21,260;"Okay."
01:06:21,260;01:06:24,820;"It's watching Greg pick his nose with a pair of tweezers right now."
01:06:24,820;01:06:27,620;"What the fuck are you doing, bro?"
01:06:27,620;01:06:29,660;"Is that why your hands covering the street?"
01:06:29,660;01:06:32,100;"Yeah, I don't have to watch that."
01:06:32,100;01:06:33,100;"Noted."
01:06:33,100;01:06:35,060;"I'm picking your teeth with a knife."
01:06:35,060;01:06:36,060;"Yeah."
01:06:36,060;01:06:37,060;"Give it time."
01:06:37,060;01:06:38,300;"They're the long and curly ones."
01:06:38,300;01:06:40,140;"They get a little tickly up there, you know?"
01:06:40,140;01:06:41,140;"They do."
01:06:41,140;01:06:42,140;"I fucking hate it."
01:06:42,140;01:06:44,500;"And then you pull it out and it feels like you're pulling out of your fucking brainstem."
01:06:44,500;01:06:48,340;"I just brutal your frontal cortex is up there. Yeah, thanks Steve"
01:06:48,340;01:06:52,900;"That's what I mean. I pull I pull out ones that are like inches long whose eyes this thing brutal"
01:06:52,900;01:06:55,060;"You sure you didn't pull that off your pubes?"
01:06:55,060;01:06:58,060;"See this thing is massive"
01:06:58,060;01:07:05,500;"Okay, it's it's a little terrifying sometimes I do this as when you get like six in one and I'm sorry"
01:07:05,500;01:07:13,580;"Why did I say something very naughty"
01:07:13,580;01:07:16,460;"Yeah, Gregory definitely is sometimes a naughty boy"
01:07:16,460;01:07:24,380;"Especially when he's pulling those hairs and ejaculating because of it all right. I think we are"
01:07:24,380;01:07:29,100;"Finished so next week we will have a random game from the sounds of it"
01:07:29,100;01:07:32,300;"And then after that we'll meet back here for"
01:07:32,300;01:07:35,900;"The Patriots hosting the Colts and the AFC divisional run"
01:07:35,900;01:07:37,980;"playoffs"
01:07:37,980;01:07:38,780;"playoffs"
01:07:38,780;01:07:44,800;"Why are you next week to see how much of a blubbering little bitch Greggy and you're on the page"
01:07:44,800;01:07:50,420;"I see podcast. I'm gonna get me to record some new material"
01:07:50,420;01:07:53,420;"Alright, well, yeah, I'm into the sound by war"
01:07:53,420;01:07:57,420;"I don't know mine"
01:07:57,420;01:08:03,660;"I'm slowly I'm slowly building a few so okay. All right, but until next week playoffs. I like it"
01:08:05,420;01:08:09,220;"Yeah, I got a I got a fart machine. Oh good. So"

01:08:14,940;01:08:17,500;"Realistic Greg"
01:08:17,500;01:08:24,700;"I was my favorite number 11 is my favorite. Oh good. Oh good Greg. Oh want me to make it rain"
01:08:24,700;01:08:34,860;"The this is this awful con this is so bad all right until next week or next episode"

01:08:38,220;01:08:40,980;"Boys, enjoy your Celtics."
01:08:40,980;01:08:43,580;"I've had that for like three years."
01:08:43,580;01:08:44,420;"It's awesome."
01:08:44,420;01:08:45,980;"I'm so happy for you."
01:08:45,980;01:08:46,900;"Enjoy your Celtics."
01:08:46,900;01:08:49,020;"Go Celtics Celtics in five, baby."

01:08:51,140;01:08:53,260;"And until next week, we will see you later."
01:08:53,260;01:08:55,260;"- Yeah, later."
01:08:55,260;01:08:56,100;"- Real later."
01:08:56,100;01:08:56,940;"- Bye."

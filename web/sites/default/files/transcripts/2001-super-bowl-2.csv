00:00,000;00:06,800;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:15,680;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,680;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:20,240;"I am not your mother."
00:20,240;00:27,280;"Alright, so this is what we talked about, the super special episode."
00:27,280;00:30,840;"We've finally gotten to our first Super Bowl of the Dynasty."
00:30,840;00:34,120;"And with us today, we have no offense to our other guests,"
00:34,120;00:37,000;"but probably our most famous guest, I would say."
00:37,000;00:40,680;"Former Patriots linebacker and three times Super Bowl champion"
00:40,680;00:42,040;"Matt Chatham."
00:42,040;00:43,680;"Matt, thanks for joining us."
00:43,680;00:44,800;"Well, thanks for having me on."
00:44,800;00:46,440;"This is fun, and I'm glad I worked out."
00:46,440;00:48,040;"This is a quarantine time."
00:48,040;00:49,960;"So we've all got a lot of time on our hands."
00:49,960;00:50,640;"Yes, we do."
00:50,640;00:56,440;"It's been OK so far, at least for me."
00:56,440;01:00,440;"I don't know how it's been for you, Matt, but it's actually starting to finally drag this past week."
01:00,440;01:06,200;"Yeah, I think we're kind of reaching that point, right? Where it's kind of the monotony of it all."
01:06,200;01:10,440;"I was having a blast with FamilyTime. We're having a great time getting closer and"
01:10,440;01:14,600;"spending more time with otherwise wouldn't have, but I think we're running out of stuff to do."
01:14,600;01:19,800;"It's like, you can only watch so many movies, you know, you can only make so many different meals,"
01:19,800;01:22,600;"and then it's like, okay, what else is out there?"
01:22,600;01:24,840;"Yeah, that's exactly right. I saw it. It was a podcast."
01:25,720;01:27,960;"We were rewatch every game from the dynasty."
01:27,960;01:31,640;"Yeah, this probably really worked."
01:31,640;01:34,120;"It was the perfect timing for it."
01:34,120;01:34,440;"Yeah."
01:34,440;01:36,360;"If only we had planned it that way."
01:36,360;01:39,880;"But yeah, I thought it'd get easier once the weather got nicer,"
01:39,880;01:43,480;"but now we just sit outside and do nothing instead of sitting inside and doing nothing."
01:43,480;01:46,040;"Just literally run out of shit to do."
01:46,040;01:48,200;"Yeah."
01:48,200;01:53,400;"So yeah, so I wanted to get into the Super Bowl 36 and stuff."
01:53,400;01:59,000;"And the first one I kind of just touch a bit on you and your journey as a"
01:59,000;02:03,240;"page because it from we've talked about this on our podcast kind of throughout"
02:03,240;02:08,040;"this season but you're kind of that true Bella Checchi and success story of that."
02:08,040;02:13,160;"The kind of system that Bella Checchi has has put in place over these past 20 years"
02:13,160;02:17,480;"of players a lot like yourself."
02:17,480;02:22,480;"- I would put myself sort of in that group of that 2000 team."
02:22,480;02:25,840;"So I'll do my bio real quick."
02:25,840;02:27,640;"I was actually a Ram initially."
02:27,640;02:43,200;"I was an Under-"
02:43,200;02:50,640;"I was an undrafted guy. I was like, you know, sort of in that realm of pre-season all-American"
02:50,640;02:54,880;"head into your senior season. Maybe a guy like that has a chance to be in the field,"
02:54,880;02:58,800;"but you really kind of don't know. You know, you're kind of just on the cusp of being really"
02:58,800;03:02,240;"good at this level. What does that mean? Do I have a chance to the next all that kind of stuff?"
03:02,240;03:08,400;"And I went to my version of the senior bowl at FCS level. They have this. It's no longer exist,"
03:08,400;03:13,180;"but it was called the snowball back then it was inside North Dakota State's North Dakota State is"
03:13,180;03:18,780;"They've actually had ESPN game days gone there book in the last couple years, but that kind of a wag in"
03:18,780;03:21,260;"It's gonna say"
03:21,260;03:28,300;"Went to UNH, so we kind of have an idea of it. Okay. Yeah, one more North Dakota State year after year after year"
03:28,300;03:32,560;"I mean, I've told this on you know, many a media media my guests since I've been doing this stuff"
03:32,560;03:37,440;"But plan in North Dakota State is as cool of an environment as a negative ever saw in the NFL"
03:37,440;03:42,140;"It's smaller obviously, but it's like an arena football game. It's like tight on top of you while"
03:42,140;03:47,520;"But anyway, so I went up to that senior bullish kind of game for the small schools and"
03:47,520;03:50,920;"Born pretty well, but I kind of jacked up my mcl"
03:50,920;03:53,160;"I came away with a little sprained played through it"
03:53,160;03:54,000;"but"
03:54,000;04:00,340;"In the sort of workouts after I was not combined ready and I was a combine alternate anyway at the time"
04:00,340;04:06,160;"So you really need the testing against bigger time guys and you know the exposure to bigger time players"
04:06,160;04:07,240;"or sort of make that case."
04:07,240;04:11,320;"And I was able to bench and I was able to do some of the stuff."
04:11,320;04:14,460;"I used to have a leg press thing, like a leg Cybex test"
04:14,460;04:17,040;"leg type thing that was part of combine testing."
04:17,040;04:18,920;"But there's only a few things I could do."
04:18,920;04:19,920;"And that hurts you."
04:19,920;04:21,840;"So then I go on-- so I mean, I think"
04:21,840;04:22,640;"it's part of the story."
04:22,640;04:24,480;"I go and draft it."
04:24,480;04:26,680;"I thought I was going to be a middle or late round guy."
04:26,680;04:28,040;"And then I don't get drafted."
04:28,040;04:30,760;"I'm offered to deal with the Rams, Colts, and Browns."
04:30,760;04:33,440;"Kind of just through my agent's guidance,"
04:33,440;04:35,400;"choose the Rams in part because we"
04:35,400;04:39,120;"thought that was the most vulnerability outside linebacker kind of thing where maybe you could"
04:39,120;04:45,280;"make a roster. And I was there in 99 and that was my rookie season that's the year of the"
04:45,280;04:52,800;"Rams won the Super Bowl. And I was a really goofy story. Leonard Little was a really good"
04:52,800;04:56,960;"player for them the first round draft the year before 98 and Leonard had unfortunately"
04:56,960;05:00,600;"gotten in that the deal with the drunk driving accident."
05:00,600;05:02,320;"Oh yeah, we talked about that."
05:02,320;05:06,720;"Yeah, so that's my position. I think that was in part some of my agents thinking at"
05:06,720;05:10,560;"their time about why that would be a great place to go. It looks like when there's"
05:10,560;05:15,600;"starter won't be there kind of thing. So maybe the veteran moves into that spot. You can slide"
05:15,600;05:22,240;"in and win a backup job. That's a great opportunity. But that off season in '99, it was announced"
05:22,240;05:29,600;"that it was time served and different times in 1999 than now obviously. If you were an"
05:29,600;05:31,240;"You're involved in action like that."
05:31,240;05:33,560;"You're probably gonna miss a year, if not more."
05:33,560;05:35,400;"But back then, it was, I think it had happened"
05:35,400;05:38,920;"late in the season in '98, and he sat for those games,"
05:38,920;05:40,640;"and then they made that decision later that summer."
05:40,640;05:42,040;"So it was a weird situation,"
05:42,040;05:43,720;"not like Belichick type stuff,"
05:43,720;05:45,800;"but they, you know, where he keeps it cryptic."
05:45,800;05:47,600;"And, you know, you just never know"
05:47,600;05:50,400;"where you're standing as a team with the Rams."
05:50,400;05:51,800;"My position coaches came to me and was like,"
05:51,800;05:53,680;"""Well, okay, Leonard's back."""
05:53,680;05:56,440;"And he's a really huge part of what we do."
05:56,440;05:58,800;"And that means you're basically not gonna"
05:58,800;06:00,980;"probably make a team now. It's like, dude, it's like July."
06:00,980;06:06,000;"So, you know, we hadn't even gotten a preseason games that we'd had"
06:06,000;06:08,760;"intersquad stuff, I think with Tennessee or something like that."
06:08,760;06:12,640;"But I pretty much learned before even getting to the preseason games"
06:12,640;06:15,200;"that, Hey, you're fighting for a practice squad job. And in my head,"
06:15,200;06:18,240;"I'm like, that's bullshit. You know, like, I want to, I could have"
06:18,240;06:19,800;"gone, I could have gone to Cleveland. I could have gone to"
06:19,800;06:25,240;"Andy. I could make a roster here. So I did a little petulant thing,"
06:25,240;06:27,960;"I guess, in retrospect, and was like, all right, well, I'm not"
06:27,960;06:34,360;"I'm not going to go through these two of days without an opportunity to actually make a team."
06:34,360;06:40,120;"So I left, which is weird. And so, you know, I went to Charlie Army who was the GM at the time"
06:40,120;06:43,080;"and I had a pretty good relationship with coach for me. I mean, I think you like me. That was one"
06:43,080;06:48,440;"of the places much like New England that keeps a lot of undrafted guys, London Fletcher's one example,"
06:48,440;06:54,200;"but the Rams brag about how many undrafted guys they bring up much like, you know, the Patriots do."
06:54,200;06:58,400;"They find a lot of those kinds of gems type idea,"
06:58,400;07:00,280;"but I went to them and was like, man,"
07:00,280;07:02,240;"I just want to play in the NFL."
07:02,240;07:03,760;"And it looks like there's no opportunity here."
07:03,760;07:05,200;"He says, oh, but you've been on practice squad"
07:05,200;07:06,040;"to mention move up."
07:06,040;07:08,920;"And for a kid in 99, coming from small school,"
07:08,920;07:11,040;"practice squad to me meant like hold a bag"
07:11,040;07:12,560;"and be somebody else's dummy."
07:12,560;07:13,920;"And I was like, I'm not doing that."
07:13,920;07:15,720;"- Yeah, 22, that's--"
07:15,720;07:17,040;"- Yeah, exactly."
07:17,040;07:19,520;"I mean, that obviously is not really what it is"
07:19,520;07:20,840;"in the practice squad world."
07:20,840;07:23,000;"I mean, I think in retrospect, after growing up"
07:23,000;07:25,800;"a little bit, you realize that is sort of an army cusp thing and there are opportunities"
07:25,800;07:30,760;"there. But I didn't see it that way as a young kid. So I went back to school. So in '99,"
07:30,760;07:35,000;"I still was under a four-ride scholarship at USD and I wanted to finish up my degree."
07:35,000;07:41,880;"So I left camp. I left camp. And they have a designation sort of where they kind of continue"
07:41,880;07:46,360;"to hold your rights, like a futures contract kind of thing. And so '99, which would have"
07:46,360;07:51,800;"been my rookie year, I went back to school. And so then, you know, Charlie's calling"
07:51,800;07:55,560;"like November and my agent's calling and they're saying okay do you still want to do this?"
07:55,560;08:00,520;"Yeah, and I'm like yeah, I do and I graduated that fall and then I came back"
08:00,520;08:06,520;"the next off season in 2000 as if that were sort of my rookie season again. And then that's the"
08:06,520;08:10,680;"year where I went all the way through camp and thought I made the roster for the Rams."
08:10,680;08:15,320;"Got my playbook at the end of the fourth preseason game and went through the weekend"
08:15,320;08:20,600;"stayed at the hotel in Holiday Inn in her city and thought hey I made it and we got to like Monday"
08:20,600;08:23,600;"or maybe it was Sunday, sometime over that weekend,"
08:23,600;08:25,760;"where I thought I'd made the cut,"
08:25,760;08:27,880;"I came to the team meeting, had my new playbook"
08:27,880;08:32,720;"for the week one, and there was an injury"
08:32,720;08:35,800;"at one of the receiver spots, and they came to me and said,"
08:35,800;08:38,600;"""Hey, we're gonna be a little thin,"
08:38,600;08:41,320;"we're gonna have to bring an extra wide receiver body"
08:41,320;08:42,520;"in for week one."""
08:42,520;08:44,620;"Basically, you must be number 53,"
08:44,620;08:46,560;"it's kind of what I learned, I think, in that moment."
08:46,560;08:48,880;"- Yeah. - I made it, but I'm 53,"
08:48,880;08:50,560;"you know, I'm 53 on the 50th."
08:50,560;08:54,880;"So they said, hey, we're going to put you on practice"
08:54,880;08:55,640;"call for just the week."
08:55,640;08:57,040;"We're going to have to release you right now."
08:57,040;08:59,240;"Just took a little transaction, hide you,"
08:59,240;09:01,280;"bring you back when this thing's done."
09:01,280;09:03,080;"I was put on waivers."
09:03,080;09:06,480;"And Scott Pioli, how you're here if we had no England,"
09:06,480;09:07,400;"claimed me."
09:07,400;09:09,960;"So what I thought was just going to be a little, hey,"
09:09,960;09:11,320;"sucks you won't get to play on week one,"
09:11,320;09:14,200;"but you're still beyond the team thing."
09:14,200;09:16,240;"You're exposed to waivers, anyone can get you."
09:16,240;09:20,200;"And Scott apparently had been an advocate of mine,"
09:20,200;09:22,200;"I've known more about me and I had no interaction"
09:22,200;09:24,080;"with the team prior with knowing when prior"
09:24,080;09:25,080;"to them doing that."
09:25,080;09:27,080;"But so I was claimed."
09:27,080;09:28,680;"So then all of a sudden I'm on a plane up here"
09:28,680;09:30,840;"and I played on week one with a Tats in 2000,"
09:30,840;09:31,640;"bills first year."
09:31,640;09:34,960;"And I'm about to see, I love to stop purely"
09:34,960;09:36,120;"for all he did for my career."
09:36,120;09:38,920;"But it was a total surprise."
09:38,920;09:41,800;"So for me, and I know I spent a lot of time on that story,"
09:41,800;09:44,960;"but the background there to what the Ram thing meant to me"
09:44,960;09:47,160;"was kind of different."
09:47,160;09:49,640;"The fact that we ended up playing the Apatycore team"
09:49,640;09:55,480;"one championship was cool for me because my story had kind of started with them, never really got"
09:55,480;10:01,480;"going and it's no fault of their own. I mean I think they were still high on me but you know"
10:01,480;10:04,840;"the Patriots do this a lot too while they're exposed to the guidawavers and hope to keep them"
10:04,840;10:09,560;"off practice for a while and retain them but Rann has tried to do that with me and somebody else"
10:09,560;10:14,040;"grabbed me. So I still kind of have a soft spot for that place. They were patient with me leaving"
10:14,040;10:20,200;"you know, leaving them prior to camp and coming back, but it just didn't work out and ended up in"
10:20,200;10:25,640;"this place and oddly enough that that ends up being replaced. Wow. Yeah, I because yeah, we tried"
10:25,640;10:31,000;"to do some some research on you before we did this and none of that is in your Wikipedia. I have to"
10:31,000;10:41,640;"Yeah, I think I know what I'm doing this afternoon. So, so what what was like, were you a fan of a"
10:41,640;10:47,720;"team growing up then? So when you live in Iowa, I don't know if it's it's not something I think"
10:47,720;10:51,240;"you'd understand as a New Englander because you've got a team right? You obviously have the paths,"
10:51,240;10:55,640;"you go far enough south. Maybe you're far enough south into Connecticut, maybe you're a giant"
10:55,640;10:58,760;"span or something. But if you live in this region, there's there's generally a team that is"
10:58,760;11:03,800;"affiliated with you, you know, even if you're out as far as Western, I mean, you're part of New"
11:03,800;11:08,680;"England. You're a team, you live in Iowa, you don't have a team. You're kind of, Iowa is the Iowa"
11:08,680;11:15,240;"Hawkeyes. I mean, Hayden Fry, you know, that sort of storied college place, much like Nebraska,"
11:15,240;11:20,920;"Nebraska Cornhusker. If you live in Nebraska, your protein is your college. It's like an Alabama"
11:20,920;11:26,440;"type idea. Iowa is very much the same way. So there's a lot of my friends. I lived in"
11:26,440;11:32,200;"Sioux City, Sioux City, Iowa. It's comparable size. It's just short of 100,000. It feels a little"
11:32,200;11:34,480;"Worcestershire, you know, it's a very blue collar town."
11:34,480;11:36,920;"A comparable size, I guess, to that."
11:36,920;11:39,720;"But we, you know, so you have just a blend of people"
11:39,720;11:40,720;"'cause you kind of sit in the middle."
11:40,720;11:43,760;"There are NFL fans, but some are Chiefs fans,"
11:43,760;11:45,880;"some are Vikings fans, some are Bears fans,"
11:45,880;11:47,440;"some are Packers fans."
11:47,440;11:49,920;"You get enough, Soussé, he actually sits in three states,"
11:49,920;11:52,400;"Dye West South Dakota and Nebraska,"
11:52,400;11:54,120;"depending on what part of town you're in."
11:54,120;11:56,360;"And so the Western portion, some of those people,"
11:56,360;11:59,000;"'cause they sit in Nebraska, will be Broncos fans."
11:59,000;12:01,760;"So, again, another long-wind, long-wind way to say,"
12:01,760;12:03,360;"And they don't have it."
12:03,360;12:05,720;"Yeah, you kind of just cheer for you, cheer for,"
12:05,720;12:09,120;"because we sit literally in the middle of maybe four or five markets,"
12:09,120;12:11,600;"you know, six hours in every direction."
12:11,600;12:15,160;"So I was a Raiders fan, which is kind of goofy,"
12:15,160;12:17,000;"which has nothing to do with any of that."
12:17,000;12:20,880;"But I was a big guy, like how we long quite a bit."
12:20,880;12:25,320;"You know, he was defensive lineman, stud guy that I just kind of dug his game."
12:25,320;12:27,360;"But I was a safety number 42."
12:27,360;12:29,960;"Ronnie Lott wore that obviously for a while."
12:29,960;12:33,960;"I kind of dug Ronnie and I was a big tall skinny kid that played safety initiative before I got"
12:33,960;12:35,800;"I grew and became a linebacker"
12:35,800;12:37,240;"So yeah, I was kind of a Raiders fan"
12:37,240;12:42,200;"Which for me was was neat because my very first preseason game wasn't regular season game unfortunately"
12:42,200;12:48,120;"My first my first time where I got to wear an NFL uniform in game situation and go against another team"
12:48,120;12:50,520;"It was against Raiders a first preseason game there"
12:50,520;12:55,240;"For the Rams, so that was cool 10 Browns out there running around the field and you're just like"
12:55,640;13:00,440;"I was there's biggest saucers. That was a really, really cool day."
13:00,440;13:06,200;"So you're the second Raiders fan we've had on and neither of them are from either Oakland or"
13:06,200;13:11,160;"LA. The other one we had on, he got into the Raiders through hip hop, actually."
13:11,160;13:13,800;"Yeah, they got a brand new to that."
13:13,800;13:20,760;"So I would say like starter jackets guys, like satin jackets and all of this time."
13:20,760;13:26,600;"All through like that. I'm a you know 80s kid and early 90s and high school and all that so like yeah"
13:26,600;13:31,560;"Raiders were like one of those brands that you know Raiders the Bulls were kind of that way too"
13:31,560;13:37,840;"Just like these are huge 80s 90s brands that if you didn't have an affiliation you probably were cheering for one of those just by the ball"
13:37,840;13:44,000;"Yeah, I think that was the Cowboys for me growing up Cowboys free. Okay. Yeah, that was a little behind you"
13:45,480;13:50,800;"Yeah, so the Cowboys were the team you rooted for if you didn't didn't watch football, I think"
13:50,800;13:53,320;"Right, right"
13:53,320;13:58,780;"So what was your connection to the Steelers since you clearly just went on like a revenge tour in 2001?"
13:58,780;14:05,840;"Yeah, right no Steelers love whatsoever. Yeah, I don't you know what I would say this though when you're like a kid from"
14:05,840;14:11,480;"Non NFL world, you know, like if you're here locally you can grow up in Premiere"
14:11,480;14:14,040;"or whatever, you can grow up in Georgia or whatever,"
14:14,040;14:15,840;"or you're a Franklin kid or whatever."
14:15,840;14:16,840;"You're from some small area here."
14:16,840;14:18,760;"You can maybe even if it's just once a year,"
14:18,760;14:20,320;"once every two years, three years, four years,"
14:20,320;14:21,160;"or whatever it is,"
14:21,160;14:23,640;"you can go to Shaper Stadium or Patriot Stadium"
14:23,640;14:25,280;"or whatever, Sullivan's,"
14:25,280;14:29,320;"you can have sort of brushes within a felt life."
14:29,320;14:31,040;"You can go to an NFL stadium,"
14:31,040;14:33,040;"you can drive by an NFL stadium."
14:33,040;14:35,440;"So you're around it, at least you're aware of it."
14:35,440;14:40,120;"Out there, like just even the site of those iconic helmets"
14:40,120;14:44,680;"like give you like you know like goosebumps like you walk on the field and it's just that"
14:44,680;14:48,840;"you know the old steel curtain look and it's just so cool when you're you know those are the"
14:48,840;14:54,680;"things I've only seen on TV and I never had been to an NFL game in my life until I played in one."
14:54,680;15:00,520;"Well so I like yeah so when we you know when I had gone up through college at the University of"
15:00,520;15:04,440;"South Dakota we have a school in our conference back then at the conference doesn't exist anymore"
15:04,440;15:09,560;"it's called the NCC so that was North Dakota State South Dakota South Dakota State"
15:09,560;15:13,320;"All those schools, Northern Colorado was in there and Mankato, a lot of good hockey"
15:13,320;15:15,240;"school, St. Cloud State's free to hockey program."
15:15,240;15:16,240;"Yep."
15:16,240;15:20,360;"And Minnesota Mankato, I think they're actually called Minnesota State now, but Mankato State"
15:20,360;15:26,360;"had a team in our conference, I was school in our conference, and they host the Vikings"
15:26,360;15:28,960;"training camps to have for years and years and years."
15:28,960;15:33,400;"And one time a year they get to play a home game and what used to be the Metrodome."
15:33,400;15:38,000;"So that was my one little brush, or I got to play a road game against Mankato in the"
15:38,000;15:40,560;"the Metro Dome, but it sucked."
15:40,560;15:43,360;"'Cause the Metro Dome's huge,"
15:43,360;15:46,960;"and there were like two, three, 4,000 fans on stand."
15:46,960;15:48,760;"So this was like trickling down the front row"
15:48,760;15:51,120;"kind of deal, terrible environment."
15:51,120;15:52,480;"- So we'll take a red ski."
15:52,480;15:54,280;"- Yeah, I was gonna say, I've been a revolution skater."
15:54,280;15:55,360;"That was like it."
15:55,360;15:56,200;"(laughing)"
15:56,200;15:57,640;"- It's that feel."
15:57,640;15:59,960;"So yeah, so my point of bringing that up is just"
15:59,960;16:04,040;"when you are a kid like me without really any NFL"
16:04,040;16:07,400;"sort of brushes, you see a Steelers helmet across me,"
16:07,400;16:08,860;"You see a Raiders helmet across,"
16:08,860;16:11,540;"we see a Niners helmet, a Packers helmet."
16:11,540;16:14,120;"I mean, those things just, it just,"
16:14,120;16:15,280;"it gives you goosebumps."
16:15,280;16:16,320;"It's just such a cool thing."
16:16,320;16:18,360;"Even if you didn't necessarily cheer"
16:18,360;16:19,800;"for one of them or cheer against."
16:19,800;16:21,640;"- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
16:21,640;16:24,160;"- Did you have like a favorite way stadium to go to?"
16:24,160;16:28,960;"- So this is a, this is a Corneas Hell kind of story,"
16:28,960;16:31,840;"but I still laugh about it 'cause it was my one moment."
16:31,840;16:36,680;"So I played, I don't think I got to go to Lambo"
16:36,680;16:39,840;"or the Packers are at until well into my career."
16:39,840;16:40,740;"I think I've played there,"
16:40,740;16:42,320;"ended up playing there a few times,"
16:42,320;16:44,200;"maybe once or twice with the Jets."
16:44,200;16:47,840;"Once, I think maybe just once with the Packers"
16:47,840;16:49,480;"were the Patriots, those Patriots were six years"
16:49,480;16:52,960;"and I feel like maybe we had one trip there in the six."
16:52,960;16:53,880;"I maybe none."
16:53,880;16:56,000;"I know we played the Packers at home,"
16:56,000;16:57,880;"but I hadn't been there a lot."
16:57,880;16:58,720;"So I feel like, you know,"
16:58,720;17:00,280;"I'd been in the NFL for a handful of years"
17:00,280;17:02,160;"by then four, five, six years, something like that."
17:02,160;17:04,400;"And I think it was my first trip to Green Bay."
17:04,400;17:06,360;"And I think the first one was actually a preseason game"
17:06,360;17:08,120;"and we came back and played there later in the regular season."
17:08,120;17:08,960;"I think that's correct."
17:08,960;17:10,840;"But anyway, it was my first time in Lambo, right?"
17:10,840;17:12,600;"And that's kind of like a big deal again"
17:12,600;17:16,240;"to like a football fan because even if you're ambivalent"
17:16,240;17:18,480;"with the Packers thing, cheer form, not cheer form,"
17:18,480;17:21,160;"still just being in Lambo is kind of, you know,"
17:21,160;17:24,080;"it's like a Fenway kind of thing for baseball."
17:24,080;17:27,000;"So I just remember, this is Corny as hell,"
17:27,000;17:32,000;"but back in the early days, I'll give Tom Brady credit"
17:32,000;17:32,840;"for this."
17:32,840;17:35,600;"Brady was one of the very first guys that I knew,"
17:35,600;17:40,120;"actually our strength coach, Mike Wojcick and Tom were the two sort of forefront guys"
17:40,120;17:43,620;"on this that had iTunes libraries."
17:43,620;17:48,120;"On their laptops, this is before even like the iPod stuff got started, but Tom had like"
17:48,120;17:50,440;"iTunes library really, really early."
17:50,440;17:54,520;"We always be on as Apple and this is before Apple computers were really cool or new or"
17:54,520;17:56,080;"whatever."
17:56,080;18:00,360;"This was kind of just like the early days of Apple and Tom would be up at like ungodly"
18:00,360;18:04,980;"hours downloading songs and making these playlists and this is you know during the"
18:04,980;18:10,840;"2000 season this is like right when I iPod I think came out the iPod the"
18:10,840;18:13,920;"handheld thing came out like after the 2000 season I think it was like the"
18:13,920;18:19,080;"2001 off-season yeah that does and anyway so yeah somewhere in that range and you"
18:19,080;18:22,920;"know I have like an extensive CD collection and cassettes and all that kind"
18:22,920;18:26,120;"of stuff so we were all trying to download shit to our laptops and make"
18:26,120;18:30,640;"he's playlists but Tom was like an assassin with a stuff like you so into it"
18:30,640;18:33,680;"now lana okay you know I got my already have my CDs I don't get this time I"
18:33,680;18:41,720;"don't really understand my vinyls Tom what are you doing so anyway he was like"
18:41,720;18:45,080;"really really into that and I was a little late to the game but part of the"
18:45,080;18:49,240;"incentive to get it on your iPod was because we had one of those attachments"
18:49,240;18:53,480;"you know like a little adapter that would allow you to plug it into the to"
18:53,480;18:58,520;"little weight room. So the the Patriots weight room, you if you could get your own playlist in"
18:58,520;19:02,120;"there, you could sort of control the thing. And it's not because obviously Thomas in your"
19:02,120;19:05,960;"already at any time like that, he was just a guy who had a playlist. And everyone else is"
19:05,960;19:12,440;"fucking popping in a cassette tape or something. Right. So he did that. And it kind of incentivized"
19:12,440;19:16,840;"a lot of us to go out and like figure this shit out. So so we went by about iPods, I started to"
19:16,840;19:22,520;"make my own stuff and ungodly amount of hours. It's been where I remember, what is that? That"
19:22,520;19:27,320;"ghetto boys. Damn feels good to be a gangster. I remember downloading that song overnight."
19:27,320;19:32,080;"My office was like upstairs in the loft and it would, it was downloading the song. And"
19:32,080;19:36,520;"from the time I went to bed, it took the morning to download like that single song on like"
19:36,520;19:41,000;"naps, naps, or whatever it would play. And you better hope it was the right song. Not"
19:41,000;19:45,080;"just the file that was named that way. Oh, yeah. This is the closest I've ever felt"
19:45,080;19:50,280;"to Tom Brady in my life. I have to say. And it would just, it would just play like, you"
19:50,280;19:55,200;"like I'd be sitting there in half a sleep at one o'clock two o'clock three o'clock whatever and it would pop on"
19:55,200;20:00,560;"Like those songs partially downloaded and which are playing and you wake up like what the fuck is it there?"
20:00,560;20:05,160;"But anyway, so I had I had this like I'd gotten to the point where I had you know"
20:05,160;20:10,160;"I had a pretty robust library and had had my pregame playlist exactly as I wanted"
20:10,160;20:16,160;"It was still on that first first or second sort of a generation iPod and I had it with me"
20:16,160;20:19,960;"And I always took it out the pregame warmups and we were now in Green Bay"
20:19,960;20:23,140;"for this first time that I've ever been to Lambo."
20:23,140;20:27,580;"And Lambo's the walk away from the locker room"
20:27,580;20:29,900;"to the field is unusually long."
20:29,900;20:31,240;"Like Denver is a little bit that way"
20:31,240;20:32,860;"in the new stadium in Invesco."
20:32,860;20:35,020;"But most of them, you know, you're 50 yards,"
20:35,020;20:37,420;"maybe 100 yards, you know, you're close."
20:37,420;20:39,180;"Lambo has this weird tunnel."
20:39,180;20:40,860;"The tunnel's really long and really steep,"
20:40,860;20:42,420;"but then it kind of lines back through sort of"
20:42,420;20:43,740;"the underbelly of the stadium."
20:43,740;20:45,780;"So it takes like a long walk"
20:45,780;20:47,660;"and you're going through these sort of hallowed halls"
20:47,660;20:48,660;"kind of feel."
20:48,660;20:52,140;"And I just remember I, back at the time,"
20:52,140;20:54,060;"I just had my iPod on shuffle."
20:54,060;20:55,860;"So no particular play-alitrader roll,"
20:55,860;20:58,820;"it's just so every one of the 800-ish songs"
20:58,820;21:01,320;"or whatever could possibly pop up at any moment."
21:01,320;21:05,180;"And I had hit play and I started walking down this"
21:05,180;21:07,980;"like windy thing, I don't remember exactly what song was on,"
21:07,980;21:10,700;"but as I hit that, as I'm walking anyway,"
21:10,700;21:13,300;"but as I come down that final tunnel stretch"
21:13,300;21:16,780;"and I pop right out the tunnel you look"
21:16,780;21:19,220;"you see the field for the first time,"
21:19,220;21:21,380;"looks like we made it, Popson."
21:21,380;21:24,140;"That looks like we made it."
21:24,140;21:25,620;"Who the hell sings that?"
21:25,620;21:29,420;"It's Corny as hell, you know, like 70s."
21:29,420;21:31,340;"Oh my gosh, I built the whole story up"
21:31,340;21:32,820;"and I can't think of his name."
21:32,820;21:34,100;"(laughs)"
21:34,100;21:35,780;"But that was kind of my life."
21:35,780;21:38,820;"Oh, you know, like the Angels, whatever,"
21:38,820;21:40,700;"kind of looks like we made it."
21:40,700;21:43,460;"And I'm walking out of the Lambo and just,"
21:43,460;21:49,540;"I will always rather just get a kick out of that and chuckle every time I think of it because the way the song"
21:49,540;21:56,400;"Tined up right as I hit this iconic sort of a football venue Barry Manoloff Barry Manoloff. There you go"
21:56,400;22:00,880;"Barry Manoloff. There's a fact. Yeah, we'll dub that into this. Oh"
22:00,880;22:05,940;"Over over my singing"
22:09,200;22:15,340;"So you mentioned South Dakota State they were arrival of yours at the time is that right? Yeah"
22:15,340;22:21,420;"So so Venetary is a few years older than me. I think it was a senior when I was a senior when I was a freshman"
22:21,420;22:26,420;"I believe or either senior sophomore something like that. He's a couple years out ahead of me and that's our rival"
22:26,420;22:28,420;"Yeah, so South Dakota State"
22:28,420;22:34,260;"Another guy you might may or may not know this is gonna take some hardcore and I felt fan this but"
22:35,180;22:41,920;"Steve Haydn was a tight end for the Browns played about the same amount of years as I did someone that eight nine-ish range"
22:41,920;22:48,040;"Something like that. Steve was Steve was alongside Kellen Winslow when he was there. So Winslow"
22:48,040;22:51,000;"Junior or whatever there he was a"
22:51,000;22:55,120;"Winslow and Haydn were there two tight end sets and Haydn and I are the exact same age"
22:55,120;23:00,040;"So he was at state all four years that I was at you and so he's an NFL prospect"
23:00,040;23:03,080;"I'm an NFL prospect and we played against each other all four soon"
23:03,160;23:06,400;"We've had a surprisingly so there was another running back James White"
23:06,400;23:19,560;"Why can't I literally cannot think of the backstand holy shit terrible of me USD had another running back that was small"
23:19,560;23:24,600;"Kind of like James body white that James body type so the very very similar that way"
23:24,600;23:28,160;"But anyway, gosh, it's so bad. I made it going air and I know this but we had a running back"
23:28,160;23:33,080;"It was really really good that went to South Dakota from South Dakota went to the Browns also around that time"
23:33,080;23:36,080;"And once again, it's you know, I'm sure that'll come to me later"
23:36,080;23:39,800;"But point was you know, we have a handful of event. Oh guys come through there"
23:39,800;23:45,020;"There's a some brushes with South Dakota. We didn't have any beef with Adam when you're on the pants"
23:45,020;23:48,400;"Not really. I mean, I kind of give him a hard time now"
23:48,400;23:54,420;"You know you kick her so I don't think you're gonna get really really into the whole like rivalry stuff"
23:54,420;23:58,400;"He just does his job doesn't accept really well obviously, but I gave him some shit"
23:58,400;24:00,800;"So two years I I call a"
24:01,240;24:09,980;"Games for ESPN generally I'm up here doing you know, maybe it used to be UMass games then VC then Syracuse, UConn"
24:09,980;24:14,120;"I kind of stay regional. I don't travel much because of NFL obligations, but yeah"
24:14,120;24:18,800;"Generally I'm doing games up in the Northeast and then when it comes playoff times. I'll end up doing a UNH game"
24:18,800;24:22,120;"Maine go down to James Madison things like that"
24:22,120;24:24,880;"but we had"
24:24,880;24:30,960;"Two years ago South Dakota State actually advanced to I believe it was the final four"
24:30,960;24:35,000;"of the FCS playoffs sort of bracket."
24:35,000;24:38,040;"And maybe it was still just the final eight stage"
24:38,040;24:39,080;"when I had this particular game."
24:39,080;24:41,440;"But anyway, they were down at a school called Kennesaw State,"
24:41,440;24:42,680;"which is in Atlanta."
24:42,680;24:45,320;"And Kennesaw State has like a newish,"
24:45,320;24:47,280;"like two, three, four year old stadium"
24:47,280;24:51,280;"that's like one of those built the venue just for soccer."
24:51,280;24:52,760;"- So they have like a minor league soccer team"
24:52,760;24:55,040;"where they build those really cool sort of low sitting,"
24:55,040;24:59,480;"but like brand new with like eating decks right on top"
24:59,480;25:00,360;"of the seats is really cool."
25:00,360;25:05,120;"really cool little stadium, but South Dakota State was actually their opponent."
25:05,120;25:10,560;"For all these years where I do the BCS stuff through the regular year, but then when the"
25:10,560;25:15,600;"whole season starts, I don't do bowls, I do the playoff game."
25:15,600;25:19,200;"I'm always wanting these assignments where, ""Yeah, give me South Dakota State or give"
25:19,200;25:21,000;"me North Dakota State schools I used to do."""
25:21,000;25:22,000;"They never give to me."
25:22,000;25:23,960;"I always keep me with the Northeast stuff."
25:23,960;25:27,320;"I got a South Dakota State assignment, so I was really fired up about it."
25:27,320;25:30,680;"Yes, Texan Adam, I'm like, oh, I'm going to talk so much shit on the air."
25:30,680;25:34,960;"Like I just do the bias call, bias call in the history of ESPN."
25:34,960;25:41,200;"But no, I actually held my tongue and the, the, the head coach there now is the same"
25:41,200;25:43,640;"guy that was there when I was the head coach subco state."
25:43,640;25:46,400;"Same guys when I was there years and years ago."
25:46,400;25:48,120;"And we have to be the coaches conference during the week."
25:48,120;25:52,920;"And I, you know, so we did the coaches call with the other broadcasters, the ESPN crew"
25:52,920;26:00,680;"stuff and and I got on and I kind of just bit my tongue and didn't say a whole lot and he came on"
26:00,680;26:06,200;"and gave a little spiel and he said hello Matt oh yeah of course I remember you Matt we kind of"
26:06,200;26:10,440;"had a little little coyote and jackrabbit back and forth but then we had to dive into it so I knew"
26:10,440;26:14,040;"I'd sort of been put on notice that like okay I gotta I gotta call this straight."
26:14,040;26:18,280;"I mean Zolak does that every Sunday right?"
26:21,720;26:28,120;"So it was fun though, I went backstage, so behind the scenes, they always have a production room where"
26:28,120;26:32,760;"food's available for crew and staff before any game early at the end of fellow college level."
26:32,760;26:36,760;"But I went down to sort of the official's room and where all the food was being served."
26:36,760;26:39,640;"And I was going to grab a few plates and take it back up to the booth."
26:39,640;26:44,040;"And in the hallway is this whole crew of the South Dakota State cheerleader."
26:44,040;26:48,520;"So there's 15 of these young girls and they're like blue and yellow stuff."
26:48,520;26:52,040;"and I'm like, they're not gonna have these girls a young as shit. I'm in my early 40s."
26:52,040;26:57,240;"I'm not gonna have any idea who I am. So I'm just gonna ask them to take a picture"
26:57,240;27:01,000;"and they'll recognize me with my L.O.L.E.S.P.N. garb or whatever being down here that,"
27:01,000;27:05,880;"""Oh, it must be one of the broadcasters or some random dude."" So I asked them to take a picture"
27:05,880;27:10,440;"and they all got around me and kind of arms around everyone. We're all gonna smile and I said,"
27:10,440;27:14,360;"""On three, one, two, three, go yotes."" Now, yotes is the South Dakota thing."
27:14,360;27:18,820;"So, not only, you know, I had our producer or whatever take in the photo."
27:18,820;27:22,360;"One of the guys was down there with me and I got them all to one, two, three, go."
27:22,360;27:23,060;"Yeah, it's an eighth."
27:23,060;27:23,560;"They were that."
27:23,560;27:25,060;"And they all kind of look good."
27:25,060;27:29,260;"It snapped and I sent it back to Adam and had some fun with that."
27:29,260;27:33,160;"But, but unfortunately, once the game got gone, I'm not, I'm being facetious."
27:33,160;27:34,560;"I would say, call the straight game."
27:34,560;27:38,260;"I would almost be accused of maybe being too complimentary for state on that."
27:38,260;27:39,360;"Yeah."
27:39,360;27:40,460;"That's how it happens."
27:40,460;27:41,860;"It does."
27:42,860;27:48,140;"We have no love, Lost Fair South Dakota, say either because they beat the crap out of you."
27:48,140;27:54,060;"Oh, really? Okay. That can, yeah. Back in 2017. Jack rabbits. Yeah."
27:54,060;27:57,660;"Well, they know. That was the big thing. I think they've out-law of that now,"
27:57,660;28:02,540;"they don't allow us to do it, but they always, we always, there was always a dead rabbit every"
28:02,540;28:09,340;"time, every time the school's play, because, you know, we're the coyotes. Yeah. Emphasis on coyotes."
28:09,340;28:10,340;"It's not coyote."
28:10,340;28:13,340;"That's sacrilegious to say that."
28:13,340;28:15,020;"It's not the correct pronunciation."
28:15,020;28:16,460;"So it's coyote, it's not coyote."
28:16,460;28:18,380;"But anyway, we're actually--"
28:18,380;28:21,100;"it's like a natural predator kind of situation with coyotes"
28:21,100;28:21,540;"and rabbits."
28:21,540;28:26,020;"So any one of those games, there's always a dead jackrabbit."
28:26,020;28:27,020;"And they're really big."
28:27,020;28:28,060;"It's not like your regular bunny."
28:28,060;28:30,580;"It's like a large jackrabbit thrown on the field."
28:30,580;28:32,260;"Thrown on the field, thrown on the core,"
28:32,260;28:34,100;"whenever we have any kind of thing."
28:34,100;28:35,780;"But I think they got in some trouble for that,"
28:35,780;28:37,460;"and probably an animal rights thing or something."
28:37,460;28:38,460;"I don't know."
28:38,460;28:47,900;"I just I just made the realization that yo in your Twitter bio is coyote. I was I was gonna ask you about it"
28:47,900;28:52,700;"And I googled it. It said it was the past tense of yeet and I was like"
28:52,700;29:04,420;"I'm so proud of my school. I feel like I grew I grew up at the wrong time"
29:04,420;29:10,620;"Obviously the Patriots stuff worked out swimmingly as far as timing there, but USD right now is like said"
29:10,620;29:14,340;"It's an FCS school, so it's comparable in size to the stuff the schools we mentioned out here"
29:14,340;29:17,380;"but we have a dome that's called the Dakota Dome and"
29:17,380;29:19,900;"It's"
29:19,900;29:23,340;"Very similar. Gosh. They don't really build them out here in the Northeast"
29:23,340;29:24,460;"It's you know"
29:24,460;29:29,060;"The Metro Dome was a bigger version of this back in that day the silver dome in Detroit all these kind of 80s"
29:29,060;29:32,300;"More 80s 70s 80 builds have kind of come and gone"
29:32,300;29:33,980;"but the Dakota Dome is still there."
29:33,980;29:37,500;"They put a solid ceiling over the top of it now,"
29:37,500;29:39,180;"so it's not the old bubble pop."
29:39,180;29:41,740;"But they're putting solid seating on both sides."
29:41,740;29:43,300;"So anyone who's bored listening to this podcast,"
29:43,300;29:45,620;"we got all this time on our hands."
29:45,620;29:49,780;"When you jump off here and go to--"
29:49,780;29:51,740;"I think it's like--"
29:51,740;29:53,380;"I don't know-- when you go to a USD's website, whatever"
29:53,380;29:54,740;"those University of South Dakota websites,"
29:54,740;29:57,580;"they've got like this stadium progression thing right now."
29:57,580;29:59,940;"They're putting solid seating on both sides."
29:59,940;30:04,180;"So now you've got this like 20,000 seat, gorgeous,"
30:04,180;30:07,740;"packed to the Gills FCS program"
30:07,740;30:09,940;"that looks like nothing in the country."
30:09,940;30:12,300;"And I'm just like, gosh, I wanna go,"
30:12,300;30:13,460;"can I go back to school?"
30:13,460;30:14,700;"(laughing)"
30:14,700;30:16,180;"It's sick."
30:16,180;30:18,260;"I mean, you're obviously familiar with UNH,"
30:18,260;30:19,140;"you know what that venue is like."
30:19,140;30:19,980;"It's nice to see up here."
30:19,980;30:20,980;"- It's not the same, well."
30:20,980;30:21,980;"- But yeah."
30:21,980;30:23,180;"- No, it's not the same."
30:23,180;30:25,540;"And Maine is solid enough,"
30:25,540;30:27,980;"but it's just the big metal stands kind of thing."
30:27,980;30:30,080;"You see this venue and you're like, holy shit,"
30:30,080;30:32,280;"that's an FCS school."
30:32,280;30:37,040;"I mean, I do BC games regularly throughout these years"
30:37,040;30:41,200;"and that's alumni stadium, but it's a 40-ish thousand state."
30:41,200;30:42,720;"The aluminum stands kind of thing."
30:42,720;30:43,880;"It's pretty basic."
30:43,880;30:44,880;"This is sick."
30:44,880;30:46,360;"You look like, oh my God."
30:46,360;30:47,880;"- I got it up on Google right now."
30:47,880;30:48,760;"It's unbelievable."
30:48,760;30:50,560;"- Yeah, it's ridiculous."
30:50,560;30:52,280;"It's supposed to be ready for the season,"
30:52,280;30:53,640;"but I don't know if it's gonna be ready or not"
30:53,640;30:55,160;"with all this stuff going on."
30:55,160;30:57,480;"- But if the season's gonna be ready here."
30:57,480;31:01,840;"Right. So you played when they built the news team as well for the paths."
31:01,840;31:03,600;"What was that like? Like,"
31:03,600;31:06,800;"yeah, so locker rooms and all that. Yeah."
31:06,800;31:09,640;"I think I had two seasons, obviously at the old place."
31:09,640;31:14,240;"So again, with the contrast of the Rams stuff, I started that first, you know,"
31:14,240;31:18,400;"my first out of South Dakota thing and you're in a division two school at the"
31:18,400;31:21,360;"time. So, you know, the facilities are nothing like the NFL."
31:21,360;31:23,320;"So I'm all excited to go. I'm going to the NFL."
31:23,320;31:27,400;"It's first class. The Rams were in this place called their training facilities"
31:27,400;31:33,680;"in Earth City. So Earth City is like this gorgeous, like, you know, full training facility out"
31:33,680;31:39,600;"in the burbs kind of thing. So a glass facility, racquetball courts, indoor field, basketball"
31:39,600;31:44,280;"court, you know, it's just gorgeous. Meatorms are sick. Like everything's really nice. First"
31:44,280;31:49,720;"class, the field looks like a golf course. Like it's just like nothing I've ever seen"
31:49,720;31:54,520;"in my life. And I'm like, that's the NFL. That's what it's supposed to be like, I guess,"
31:54,520;32:00,640;"And then you know the dome is downtown the TWA dome and those are like the facilities that like I've made it"
32:00,640;32:04,380;"I'm in the FL. Yeah, this is what it's supposed to be like and then when I got released and you're"
32:04,380;32:07,000;"shuffled off here and I"
32:07,000;32:09,480;"stayed out at the Weston"
32:09,480;32:14,700;"At the airport so you know they fly into Logan stay overnight. It's a really nice Western next to the"
32:14,700;32:17,200;"It's not a West anymore. I think it's filled now"
32:17,200;32:20,960;"But anyway the one right next to the airport so it's like okay. I'm in downtown Boston"
32:20,960;32:23,660;"This is cool, and this is a badass hotel. This is nice"
32:23,660;32:25,660;"Okay, drive down 95"
32:25,660;32:30,220;"We all do"
32:30,220;32:33,820;"And then I get out and I'm like wait that like"
32:33,820;32:39,260;"Old-patred stadium and it's like, oh, it's okay. It's kind of a college bowl"
32:39,260;32:42,140;"So that's big it's still big and that's cool and everything"
32:42,140;32:45,820;"But and then I get instead of staying anymore nights in the nice west end"
32:45,820;32:51,260;"We're put up in the end zone. Oh the end zone motel across the street from the stadium and"
32:52,220;32:54,180;"God bless, we had some really good times there."
32:54,180;32:55,820;"The owners are really nice people at the time."
32:55,820;32:58,380;"I think that's changed ownership, but it's a shiver."
32:58,380;33:00,900;"I mean, it's not like a really nice place,"
33:00,900;33:03,740;"but we had a party scene kind of hotel,"
33:03,740;33:06,260;"but it did not have an NFL feel to it."
33:06,260;33:09,020;"But then the stadium itself, you know,"
33:09,020;33:11,140;"like you go into our meeting rooms where,"
33:11,140;33:14,620;"you know, like the chairs that have the desk"
33:14,620;33:16,380;"that kind of holds, like a folding chair,"
33:16,380;33:18,500;"with a folding arm thing to write on."
33:18,500;33:20,900;"Like that's, I mean, with partitions,"
33:20,900;33:23,700;"like you would have some office, complex kind of thing."
33:23,700;33:25,460;"Like the rooms weren't really divided."
33:25,460;33:27,420;"We had like the standing rolling partitions"
33:27,420;33:29,060;"and seats that roll up."
33:29,060;33:31,300;"And like it was like, I'm like, holy shit,"
33:31,300;33:32,500;"this is the NFL."
33:32,500;33:36,780;"And for me, I would say the facilities weren't that much"
33:36,780;33:38,300;"better than what I knew at South Dakota."
33:38,300;33:39,460;"- I was just gonna ask, yeah."
33:39,460;33:41,100;"- Yeah."
33:41,100;33:43,060;"So there's two good years of that though."
33:43,060;33:45,380;"And it was still cool on game day,"
33:45,380;33:47,060;"stadium from the field looks pretty sweet,"
33:47,060;33:49,220;"but the facilities aren't nearly as nice."
33:49,220;33:50,500;"But then when they built the new thing,"
33:50,500;33:53,540;"it was called CMGI stadium before the Gillette."
33:53,540;33:54,540;"You remember that?"
33:54,540;33:56,620;"The Gillette Flip."
33:56,620;33:57,780;"But I have a bunch of--"
33:57,780;34:01,020;"I have a box somewhere with a bunch of CMGI logoed stuff"
34:01,020;34:03,820;"because that announced launch."
34:03,820;34:05,700;"Their CMGI was all over everyone."
34:05,700;34:06,580;"They were like the--"
34:06,580;34:08,060;"Yeah, the plates."
34:08,060;34:11,500;"The like Yahoo of the Northeast at the time, I think."
34:11,500;34:12,820;"Like something like that."
34:12,820;34:15,340;"They went under in the dot com bubble."
34:15,340;34:17,500;"Exactly."
34:17,500;34:18,500;"Exactly."
34:18,500;34:22,600;"training camp at Bryant or was it at Foxboro?"
34:22,600;34:25,620;"- Yeah, I think I did two training camps at Bryant,"
34:25,620;34:26,940;"maybe three."
34:26,940;34:31,940;"At one point Coach Belichick flipped it to up here"
34:31,940;34:36,220;"and we started staying at an extended stay"
34:36,220;34:38,140;"at what it was called like the residence"
34:38,140;34:40,540;"and or something like that over in Foxboro"
34:40,540;34:41,380;"so that we could, you know,"
34:41,380;34:42,460;"so instead of the on college,"
34:42,460;34:44,660;"we were staying back here in the woods in Foxboro"
34:44,660;34:46,140;"and then we'd come over here and do it at the stadium."
34:46,140;34:51,180;"But yeah, we were, I think we got maybe three or four camps here at the stadium."
34:51,180;34:53,060;"And it's absolutely night and day."
34:53,060;34:54,580;"I mean, one quick story from that."
34:54,580;34:58,460;"I had, so when I grew up out in South Dakota, going to school at the University of South"
34:58,460;34:59,460;"Dakota, I grew up Iowa."
34:59,460;35:02,540;"But at USD, we actually had two coaches."
35:02,540;35:07,660;"I had a coach, Walt Hausman, Haus, we call him, Haus is a rock star legend."
35:07,660;35:10,460;"He's, I don't know if you remember a few years ago, they had the L.A."
35:10,460;35:15,580;"Kiss that the team that was owned by the band Kiss and they had a reality show on one of"
35:15,580;35:17,180;"those TLC or something like that."
35:17,180;35:19,580;"- Nope, nope, I haven't seen that."
35:19,580;35:21,300;"- Okay, but anyway."
35:21,300;35:22,140;"- Does it on Netflix?"
35:22,140;35:24,480;"'Cause I'm looking for shit to watch right now."
35:24,480;35:26,320;"- Yeah, I just was, I don't know,"
35:26,320;35:28,020;"maybe it's one of those ones you can find online,"
35:28,020;35:29,540;"but it was one of those reality shows"
35:29,540;35:32,100;"that follows an arena team around and the whole joke,"
35:32,100;35:35,300;"you know, it was like Gene Simmons owns the football team"
35:35,300;35:38,260;"and like, you know, it was, anyway, it was crazy,"
35:38,260;35:40,740;"but House was the defensive coordinator for that team."
35:40,740;35:42,260;"He's my old coach from way back when,"
35:42,260;35:43,740;"but House is from New Hampshire."
35:43,740;35:47,660;"So, houses got the accent, not hard courties, Boston,"
35:47,660;35:49,140;"but like still a New England,"
35:49,140;35:51,980;"it's gonna sound very New England to a South Dakota kid."
35:51,980;35:54,260;"So, houses, you know, a South Dakota guy,"
35:54,260;35:57,780;"and we had this other guy that was a strength coach."
35:57,780;36:02,420;"And he was from out here and had much more of a,"
36:02,420;36:05,220;"you know, very, very heavy Boston accent kind of thing."
36:05,220;36:08,580;"And so, that strength coach was,"
36:08,580;36:10,240;"so, given this very quickly."
36:10,240;36:12,940;"So, I'm at training camp at Bryant, like you mentioned."
36:12,940;36:17,540;"I'm out there on the field in 2000, head spinning, you know, it's, oh, it couldn't have been"
36:17,540;36:21,300;"2000. Sorry, it had to be 2001 because I missed training camp in 2000. I was in St. Louis."
36:21,300;36:25,860;"So my first, my first Bryant training camp, oh, one, I guess. So I'm out there on the"
36:25,860;36:29,220;"field and the way it always works is you only do autographs. Like kind of still do this"
36:29,220;36:33,420;"now. You only do autographs with the, by position group. So they don't let, you know,"
36:33,420;36:37,220;"they, today's running backs, today's linebackers, today's tight ends, today's quarterbacks,"
36:37,220;36:40,780;"whatever it is. So when you're walking up field coach, would encourage you, it's like,"
36:40,780;36:44,220;"it's not your day, don't go over and do it because then everyone will be expected to"
36:44,220;36:51,020;"dive in. So they did it sort of in sequences. So I, it was one of those days where I knew"
36:51,020;36:54,260;"our group wasn't supposed to go over there. So when it was our time to go, we just had"
36:54,260;36:57,180;"to walk up the field. But you know, a lot of people yell out to you and want you to"
36:57,180;37:03,340;"come stop and sign something. And this guy is yelling. And again, I'm some, you know,"
37:03,340;37:08,700;"young guy, I'm not the guy people's, they were pined for their my autograph, right?"
37:08,700;37:15,780;"But for some reason there's this guy who had his shirt off, huge guy, shirt off the entire"
37:15,780;37:21,660;"time like you know like I don't know Ray Vance or whatever like he's just like he's just"
37:21,660;37:24,060;"screaming my name throughout the practice."
37:24,060;37:26,060;"Big barrel just the guy."
37:26,060;37:27,060;"He's shot him."
37:27,060;37:28,060;"He's shot him."
37:28,060;37:29,060;"He's shot him."
37:29,060;37:30,060;"He's shot him."
37:30,060;37:31,060;"He's shot him."
37:31,060;37:32,060;"He's trying to get my attention."
37:32,060;37:35,700;"The entire time all the way the linebackers are busting my balls like who the fuck is that?"
37:35,700;37:37,680;"that just won't stop saying her name."
37:37,680;37:41,620;"And then when we went by, I may have, I don't know"
37:41,620;37:43,680;"if I wave her acknowledged, but I certainly didn't stop"
37:43,680;37:46,420;"'cause we were told not, you know, I'm doing what I'm told."
37:46,420;37:48,240;"It's not our day we can't stop the sign."
37:48,240;37:51,220;"Well, anyway, that guy was Tom Jenkins,"
37:51,220;37:53,220;"who was my strength coach at USD."
37:53,220;37:56,620;"Now, I had no clue that that was him."
37:56,620;37:59,500;"And so this is before like, you know,"
37:59,500;38:01,780;"I guess I probably had an email."
38:01,780;38:04,800;"So I'm getting a text message months later"
38:04,800;38:08,100;"about why did you punk me in front of all my friends"
38:08,100;38:09,900;"and why did you not acknowledge me?"
38:09,900;38:11,420;"And I'm like, what?"
38:11,420;38:12,260;"Like, what?"
38:12,260;38:13,580;"Oh, chanks, my bad, dude."
38:13,580;38:16,220;"So anyway, that was like my--"
38:16,220;38:20,500;"that-- if you can imagine, that voice in South Dakota,"
38:20,500;38:22,180;"we had two hardcore New Englanders"
38:22,180;38:24,060;"throughout that throughout my four years."
38:24,060;38:26,860;"So it was always a little piece of that in my life,"
38:26,860;38:29,660;"even before I knew really what this was all about out here."
38:29,660;38:31,300;"You should have tweeted at you with like a big chunk"
38:31,300;38:32,700;"of meat or something."
38:32,700;38:34,540;"[LAUGHTER]"
38:34,540;38:37,820;"Yeah, but again, this is pre social media."
38:37,820;38:39,540;"I maybe had a cell phone."
38:39,540;38:40,900;"Yeah, I probably had a cell phone in a one."
38:40,900;38:42,780;"Yeah, probably like right towards the end of college,"
38:42,780;38:45,060;"I think midway through college in like 97 or eight,"
38:45,060;38:47,380;"I think they got my first big chunky cell phone,"
38:47,380;38:48,380;"but it's not like, you know,"
38:48,380;38:49,860;"you didn't text people really that much then."
38:49,860;38:52,020;"And it maybe was an email, but I'm fucking, no,"
38:52,020;38:53,660;"I think my wife and I shared an email"
38:53,660;38:54,740;"when I first wanted the NFL."
38:54,740;38:57,420;"So it's like, it's how do you get a little one"
38:57,420;38:58,260;"another back then?"
38:58,260;39:01,780;"- Yeah, it baffles me how we managed to do it,"
39:01,780;39:02,860;"get by with landlines."
39:02,860;39:03,700;"- That's the best."
39:03,700;39:05,740;"- Right, right?"
39:05,740;39:08,140;"- By the way, I'm looking up this LA kiss"
39:08,140;39:11,740;"and their jerseys are outrageous."
39:11,740;39:12,580;"- Outrageous, yeah."
39:12,580;39:13,700;"- It's exactly what you'd expect"
39:13,700;39:16,380;"if someone from Kiss designed a uniform."
39:16,380;39:17,220;"- Yeah."
39:17,220;39:18,060;"- Oh yeah."
39:18,060;39:20,060;"- Walt Hausmann's his name, Haus is a stud."
39:20,060;39:21,740;"He was a really good offensive lineman."
39:21,740;39:23,580;"I believe it Iowa that went on to the plate"
39:23,580;39:26,460;"for a couple years, NFL, but he's got really jacked up."
39:26,460;39:29,060;"But Haus was, you know, how reality shows are."
39:29,060;39:30,980;"Like they always try to hone in on a few"
39:30,980;39:32,540;"of the big, big personality guys."
39:32,540;39:36,700;"house is just wild, a screamer, they just good good dude."
39:36,700;39:38,820;"All the players love him probably has a dip in it all"
39:38,820;39:40,100;"in that all times."
39:40,100;39:44,380;"Big cat lover like he's just he's a he's a very eccentric guy."
39:44,380;39:45,900;"One of my favorite coaches of all time,"
39:45,900;39:49,460;"a smart football guy, but house was like this, you know,"
39:49,460;39:52,580;"again, I'm coming from some two division to school."
39:52,580;39:54,380;"And you know, 15, 20 years later,"
39:54,380;39:56,780;"there's this reality show with my old defensive coordinator"
39:56,780;39:57,900;"on there and it's like, oh, well, you see,"
39:57,900;40:00,740;"you guys are getting to see what I got to see with this player."
40:00,740;40:02,300;"Oh, he is from New Hampshire."
40:02,300;40:04,940;"We're from New Hampshire as well originally."
40:04,940;40:05,780;"And from there, Matt."
40:05,780;40:06,620;"- And from Baltimore."
40:06,620;40:07,460;"- Yeah, Matt."
40:07,460;40:08,300;"- Yeah, there you go."
40:08,300;40:10,460;"- He coached at St. Anselm College,"
40:10,460;40:13,100;"which is literally five minutes down the street from it."
40:13,100;40:13,940;"- Yeah, I was not."
40:13,940;40:15,060;"- I believe house is retired now,"
40:15,060;40:18,300;"but just a great guy, good dude."
40:18,300;40:19,660;"Coach all throughout arena,"
40:19,660;40:21,580;"and then small college stuff with us."
40:21,580;40:24,580;"And man, I love it."
40:24,580;40:26,980;"He used to actually come up to a Patriots camp."
40:26,980;40:30,060;"And when, you know, the arena is obviously trying to,"
40:30,060;40:34,860;"arena footballs trying to pick at guys that look like may not make a roster, you know,"
40:34,860;40:39,020;"like there's something to them that can still play. They're good players, but they're going"
40:39,020;40:44,300;"to get snipped on 53 and they might be part of that next 10. So he was always, he was"
40:44,300;40:49,860;"always up here in those later years evaluating trying to, hey, Chad, who's not going to make"
40:49,860;40:54,060;"it, but do you like? I love that stuff. It's great."
40:54,060;40:59,620;"It's like Kurt Warner, right? He was a, he's an Iowa guy too. Did you, did you interact"
40:59,620;41:02,420;"with them when you were at the ranch that little bit?"
41:02,420;41:03,260;"- Very little."
41:03,260;41:05,520;"So remember '99's that off season"
41:05,520;41:08,660;"when the ACL gets blown out,"
41:08,660;41:10,300;"the Trent Green's ACL gets blown out."
41:10,300;41:12,860;"And so by my little story earlier"
41:12,860;41:13,980;"about how when I left camp,"
41:13,980;41:18,980;"that was I left camp the week of the first pre-seizing game."
41:18,980;41:21,700;"So this announcement had come right around that time,"
41:21,700;41:23,220;"had the little meaning."
41:23,220;41:26,180;"I went through a practice or two after they told me that."
41:26,180;41:28,900;"And I stood there for the entire two and a half hours,"
41:28,900;41:30,800;"just watching and I was furious,"
41:30,800;41:32,960;"like said, the whole emotional reaction thing."
41:32,960;41:36,600;"But, anyhow, so I didn't actually see the,"
41:36,600;41:38,240;"it was Rodney too, I think it was Rodney Harrison"
41:38,240;41:40,240;"went through a Trent's knee."
41:40,240;41:41,080;"- That's right."
41:41,080;41:41,920;"- Yeah, man."
41:41,920;41:44,520;"- And that preseason game, yeah."
41:44,520;41:46,680;"But that happened, I believe a week or two"
41:46,680;41:48,160;"into preseason, maybe the third week,"
41:48,160;41:50,120;"something like that, so I missed that part."
41:50,120;41:52,480;"So, in fairness, the time when I was there,"
41:52,480;41:54,520;"Kurt was just, you know, back up quarterback."
41:54,520;41:57,120;"And my draft class, or my class,"
41:57,120;41:59,120;"I wasn't probably one of the undrafted guys, but"
41:59,120;42:02,560;"Jo Jermaine was in that group. Do you remember him from Ohio State? Yeah,"
42:02,560;42:09,200;"Jo Jermaine was the other. Could he be the second? Could he be the third? So at the time I left, I really, you know,"
42:09,200;42:15,600;"it wasn't the Kurt Warner story yet. So had a few interactions with him, but not a ton, but obviously a super decent guy,"
42:15,600;42:18,960;"but I didn't get to see him be the kind of player he became until I was"
42:18,960;42:24,000;"Yeah, he was the second time rating drafted. I will"
42:26,080;42:33,080;"That was another school. It went to the University of Northern Iowa and that's another school sort of in the FCS same conference as USD now."
42:33,080;42:41,080;"So that's a competitor. Cool school. I went there for recruiting trip and it was one of the one of my coolest memories."
42:41,080;42:48,080;"There was a, you remember Offspring? You remember the band Offspring from first ever CD? Extangent."
42:48,080;42:56,720;"on the og, right? Yeah. So that, that, uh, I'm blanking on that one song. It, I'm terrible"
42:56,720;43:00,440;"about bringing up song names, but you're not remembering the name. But I remember on that"
43:00,440;43:05,040;"recruiting trip, it was one of those, like, you know, almost like Johnny B. Good, that"
43:05,040;43:10,120;"old movie, like one of the sickest recruiting trips I remember, you go into this house party"
43:10,120;43:16,940;"after we'd left the game. And they had actually opened the back door and then opened the front"
43:16,940;43:22,940;"or and they ran a slip and slide all throughout the home and and they had kegs"
43:22,940;43:26,180;"at one side where they had opened the top of the keg and were living in that"
43:26,180;43:32,100;"rundown of slip and slide. Whatever that song was from offspring that"
43:32,100;43:37,500;"black eye it was they were hit early on there in the keep and separated maybe"
43:37,500;43:42,240;"90s yeah, no, not can't worry. You'd hear it"
43:42,240;43:50,120;"Whatever it is"
43:50,120;43:53,700;"Yeah, it will come up with it, but they killed the lights in the house and"
43:53,700;43:58,220;"They started playing that song and there's you know like 200 people in this old house"
43:58,220;44:03,340;"And they flip on the kegs running down the slipping slide out from the back door out the front door of the home"
44:03,340;44:07,360;"And people run into the backyard and slide throughout the front of the house while that offspring"
44:07,360;44:09,360;"that's how I remember that."
44:09,360;44:12,360;"I'm pretty sure that's how Greg's Easter just went to."
44:12,360;44:15,360;"Just by myself."
44:15,360;44:19,360;"There you go."
44:19,360;44:25,360;"All right, well, I mean, we've kept you longer than we told you we would."
44:25,360;44:28,360;"Boys, do you have any last questions you want to ask Matt before we"
44:28,360;44:29,360;"firstly let him go?"
44:29,360;44:33,360;"I'm a little interested in like, build up to the Super Bowl like that Super Bowl"
44:33,360;44:36,360;"medium week and actually talk about the Super Bowl."
44:36,360;44:37,920;"Well, do we? Oh, yeah."
44:37,920;44:40,400;"All the time."
44:40,400;44:42,840;"And there were unfortunately I do have all the time in the world right now."
44:42,840;44:46,480;"But so I'll say this."
44:46,480;44:50,920;"It was weird, especially getting the experience in next two and you know,"
44:50,920;44:54,280;"the pace of the week, you know, based on the one we had Houston and Jacksonville,"
44:54,280;44:56,400;"this next couple, that's kind of what it's supposed to feel like."
44:56,400;45:00,160;"But you'll remember I, the Rams had an incredible advantage."
45:00,160;45:04,800;"I would say, I'm incredible, but a nice one because they want at home against"
45:04,800;45:06,320;"the Eagles to go to the Super Bowl."
45:06,320;45:12,120;"We won on the we won on the road against the Steelers and you'll remember this is the 9/11 year"
45:12,120;45:18,400;"So we've lost a week. We've lost a week of the season where the NFL paused things during the year and"
45:18,400;45:21,520;"When we lost that week the"
45:21,520;45:25,300;"Basically what was chewed up was the that extra week of the Super Bowl"
45:25,300;45:29,560;"So there wasn't two weeks there's just one so when you went on the road against the Steelers"
45:29,560;45:35,360;"I want to say the AFC game was the afternoon game. I believe it was on that Sunday"
45:35,360;45:40,640;"So, you know, we're clinc, we're clenching early evening and we're having our trophy party"
45:40,640;45:46,960;"there on the field and then we got a hop on a plane and and fly back to Foxborough and then go to New Orleans the next day."
45:46,960;45:50,080;"So, you know, if you're St. Louis, you'd be Philly,"
45:50,080;45:54,080;"you're at least homes and then the guys all go back to their houses, grab their bags"
45:54,080;45:57,840;"and you probably meet the next morning you take off on a flight for New Orleans. We had to fly back."
45:57,840;46:03,600;"So we had to fly back in the middle of night, you know, obviously the drinks are flown, we're having a blast, you know,"
46:03,600;46:08,040;"You're making it the Super Bowl work, but we have to, you know, late night flight from"
46:08,040;46:11,480;"Pittsburgh back to New England, but everyone's got to be back the next morning with their"
46:11,480;46:13,720;"bags pack at the stadium."
46:13,720;46:17,560;"And ops is, you know, the guys that work in operations over the team are trying to put"
46:17,560;46:19,720;"together a Super Bowl plan on the fly."
46:19,720;46:24,320;"But I just remember being, you know, maybe you sleep a little on the plane or maybe not,"
46:24,320;46:28,000;"but you're arriving back in the middle of the morning, you got to go home pack a bag for"
46:28,000;46:31,280;"an entire week's day in New Orleans and your back at the stadium."
46:31,280;46:36,360;"I don't remember exactly the times obviously, but something like that like the flip is so quick and"
46:36,360;46:38,880;"Now you've got your bags packed for a week"
46:38,880;46:43,020;"Coach Bellachik's coming in with his itinerary that they've probably put together on the flight"
46:43,020;46:49,120;"I guess I don't know when one would have time for all that but and then work turning around and jumping on the jet and"
46:49,120;46:53,120;"Going to New Orleans. So it was quick. It was a whirlwind"
46:53,120;46:59,320;"You did not really have an opportunity to let it all sink in but then that evening in Monday night"
47:00,240;47:07,320;"I would imagine we touched down maybe sometime that afternoon or something like that. We went there was a group of 10 12 of us something like that"
47:07,320;47:11,240;"Emerald Lagasi was has this restaurant called Nola and"
47:11,240;47:16,040;"Had was hosting the handful of us and so we you know"
47:16,040;47:19,720;"We ate it at emerald's place and he kind of hosted dinner was really cool"
47:19,720;47:22,520;"You know again your kind of like celebrity eyes kind of like"
47:22,520;47:25,080;"Had spent on like getting to do all these cool things"
47:25,080;47:29,400;"But we went there to Nola's real quick had a really great dinner that night with a handful of guys"
47:29,400;47:33,120;"And then we're down to Bourbon Street for kind of our one night out"
47:33,120;47:38,400;"It's the one night where you don't have a curfew or whatever and you kind of just let loose and a bunch of the Rams guys"
47:38,400;47:43,000;"We're down there as well. I think Larry Flary Flint's I know this is obviously not a highbrow place"
47:43,000;47:45,680;"but Larry Flint has one of those sort of"
47:45,680;47:48,840;"about balcony hangover"
47:48,840;47:53,920;"Bourbon Street kind of places and all that stuff so a bunch of other guys were in there"
47:53,920;47:58,860;"Which some of my old friends from from St. Louis and then a bunch of us after leaving Noah's one up there"
47:58,860;48:01,900;"We kind of have a little bit it's kind of weird but two teams are kind of interacting"
48:01,900;48:07,020;"down on Berber Street the night before all gets going but it was that quick though that you just"
48:07,020;48:12,940;"basically arrived there after I mean shoot it was 24 hours from we're sitting at dinner in Nola's"
48:12,940;48:17,820;"24 hours from when we were in the stadium at Pittsburgh today and after I've gone back to New England"
48:17,820;48:24,940;"back again and then you have your wild night out there got pretty pop and then the next morning"
48:24,940;48:31,260;"you're doing media day. So that whole in the stadium pictures. Yeah, it was that fucking quick."
48:31,260;48:35,980;"So that's what Tuesday was. And then you're in the Wednesday practice week. So all I remember,"
48:35,980;48:39,900;"I don't remember a lot of the details of it. Just like little anecdotes like that. Because it"
48:39,900;48:45,740;"happened so frickin fast. So that's that was one of the ones where when people I remember stories,"
48:45,740;48:51,180;"like individual things that we did in Houston or in Jackson, the way better than New Orleans,"
48:51,180;48:54,180;"of New Orleans was like, whoa, that came quick."
48:54,180;48:56,680;"Like it just, you know, you're into a game plan,"
48:56,680;48:58,420;"like basically the very next day"
48:58,420;49:00,180;"and just trying to get up to speed really quickly"
49:00,180;49:01,260;"and play a game."
49:01,260;49:02,220;"- Wow, that's crazy."
49:02,220;49:03,340;"Yeah, it doesn't mean you get a lot of time"
49:03,340;49:06,100;"to study that Rams walk through tape either, you know?"
49:06,100;49:07,260;"All their practices."
49:07,260;49:08,420;"(laughing)"
49:08,420;49:09,540;"- Exactly."
49:09,540;49:11,340;"It's almost as if that didn't happen."
49:11,340;49:14,020;"(laughing)"
49:14,020;49:16,100;"- I read that article on the athletic"
49:16,100;49:17,060;"that you wrote about that."
49:17,060;49:18,740;"So I was like, we gotta bring that up."
49:18,740;49:21,060;"(laughing)"
49:21,060;49:25,700;"just it drove me nuts, especially since I have a lot of respect, independent of that one situation"
49:25,700;49:29,700;"with a lot of those guys in St. Louis, the bot into it. I don't know why they did. But I can"
49:29,700;49:33,540;"understand that when you know, when you've had disappointment and loss that you would want to"
49:33,540;49:38,980;"believe that something like that was at the heart of it, but it's just not true. So and that's a"
49:38,980;49:44,580;"crazy thing. Like, you know, we just, it was such a quick week. And I think one of the things that"
49:44,580;49:48,420;"when people wanted to find a way of how are we so good on defense, you know, we must have known"
49:48,420;49:55,580;"something. I had some secret blah blah blah. Like it was so incredibly helpful for us to have played them really tight and lost at that"
49:55,580;49:59,380;"You'll remember that home game that we had with them in November, December, what it was with Rams"
49:59,380;50:05,620;"That was so helpful to kind of flesh through what really worked for us that we could now build a game plan around it"
50:05,620;50:08,580;"Also look at you know all the times the Rams have been just smoking people"
50:08,580;50:15,220;"And allowing the receivers and backs and tight ends just run off a line untouched. That was to me one of the first"
50:15,220;50:17,100;"real"
50:17,100;50:21,660;"hardcore Belichick game plans that was, you know, really what won it for us."
50:21,660;50:26,460;"If we'd adopted a different game plan and we had done something comparable to what you'd"
50:26,460;50:30,780;"seen all the other teams that tried to slow them down do, we probably got beat, you know."
50:30,780;50:36,940;"But it took a very particular approach to beat those guys and coach taught it to us again in"
50:36,940;50:40,780;"the sort of expedited manner because it was such a quick week, but it was like you can't"
50:40,780;50:44,300;"learn everything in this environment. You just can learn here quickly what you can't do."
50:44,300;50:46,060;"They can't free release up the line."
50:46,060;50:50,460;"You know, Ernie Conwell, Stutt, big blocking tight end, very athletic."
50:50,460;50:54,300;"And Williams, the other tight end, they've got really good athletic tight ends."
50:54,300;51:01,100;"All those receiver groups, Isaac Bruce to my draft class or my rookie class, Tori Holt."
51:01,100;51:07,420;"And you know, Horn was still there, like an all the third receiver's name."
51:07,420;51:11,500;"But Ricky Poltlaw obviously Paul, yeah, obviously Marshall and Ricky Prole."
51:11,500;51:14,800;"And, you know, it's just an incredibly talented group."
51:14,800;51:19,900;"If you let them build on you and, you know, get easy releases off the line and make their break"
51:19,900;51:22,100;"at 12 to 15 yards, they're going to murder you."
51:22,100;51:25,900;"But if you beat them up at the line, you know, that's, I don't know, it's just, it was one of the first times"
51:25,900;51:30,700;"where we, where I think approach won a game that I can, that I'm aware of."
51:30,700;51:35,200;"I mean, I'm not big NFL Australian guy, but it was just how incredibly important the approach"
51:35,200;51:38,300;"that we adopted, you know, played, played that role in the outcome."
51:38,300;51:45,660;"I mean, it was similar to Bella Chex game plan against the bills when he was the defensive coordinator for the Giants, too."
51:45,660;51:47,180;"I think that's it."
51:47,180;51:50,380;"I think they told them that they wanted Thurmond Thomas to run for 100 yards."
51:50,380;51:52,940;"And if he did, they would win the game sort of thing."
51:52,940;51:54,700;"It had shades of that, at least."
51:54,700;51:55,980;"Shades of that."
51:55,980;51:56,380;"There you go."
51:56,380;51:57,980;"Yeah, I don't know."
51:57,980;51:58,620;"I wasn't there."
51:58,620;52:02,220;"Do you have any like guys who played with it?"
52:02,220;52:04,620;"You still keep in touch with the event like really close friends on the team."
52:04,620;52:06,860;"We're talking Patriot stuff."
52:07,420;52:09,100;"Patriots, any more online?"
52:09,100;52:09,940;"Patriots, yeah."
52:09,940;52:16,620;"So I would say the group of guys that that stays in touch"
52:16,620;52:18,300;"the most is really your position group."
52:18,300;52:21,580;"So you know, Larry is one of my go buddies and I were obviously"
52:21,580;52:28,780;"together here for for for five of those six years and is has gone on to do a lot"
52:28,780;52:29,940;"of different things in coaching."
52:29,940;52:34,900;"You know, he was a special teams assistant at the for the Giants for several"
52:34,900;52:40,540;"years before he got its first coordinator job with the Texans, had that for a few seasons,"
52:40,540;52:45,620;"and now he's the assistant up in Seattle. And it does kind of suck, having, you know,"
52:45,620;52:50,260;"one of your boys that was, you were tight us with live on the other side of the country."
52:50,260;52:54,380;"But, you know, so we just kind of, yeah, you're unfortunately forced to keep contact through"
52:54,380;52:56,420;"texting and stuff like that."
52:56,420;52:57,420;"We recommend that."
52:57,420;52:58,420;"Sorry, I'm a podcast because."
52:58,420;52:59,420;"Well, there you go."
52:59,420;53:01,420;"That's literally what we did."
53:01,420;53:02,420;"And everybody made help."
53:02,420;53:03,420;"So there you go."
53:03,420;53:04,420;"Yeah."
53:04,420;53:08,060;"I mean, it's generally, it's unfortunate that a few of the guys"
53:08,060;53:11,340;"still live around here, Patrick Pask was used by Patrick's,"
53:11,340;53:13,980;"my neighbor on virtually everything I did as a pro"
53:13,980;53:14,700;"and special team."
53:14,700;53:18,220;"So on the kickoff, some of the L3, Patty is the L2."
53:18,220;53:21,240;"So he's right next to me on punt team, on the guard,"
53:21,240;53:22,340;"Pask the tackle."
53:22,340;53:24,900;"So Pat and I were kind of like, I don't know,"
53:24,900;53:27,340;"wingman or whatever, something like that."
53:27,340;53:29,740;"And just about everything we did, we were always alongside"
53:29,740;53:31,340;"one another coordinated really well together."
53:31,340;53:33,500;"So Patty still lives down here in Rhode Island."
53:33,500;53:34,980;"It's a Lincoln guy."
53:34,980;53:38,780;"So I do see him some, you know, wish some more joined"
53:38,780;53:40,940;"Jersey's local."
53:40,940;53:44,700;"The Copan has got his place down in East Greenwich."
53:44,700;53:46,780;"He opened up that line cider brewing place."
53:46,780;53:48,580;"So he's incredibly busy with that."
53:48,580;53:50,740;"Yeah, Copan isn't doing as much media anymore."
53:50,740;53:53,660;"So you've gifted his toe in that did for a few years of media."
53:53,660;53:55,700;"But he's really involved in that brewery."
53:55,700;53:57,100;"And it sounds like it's pretty badass."
53:57,100;53:59,980;"I usually just, I actually physically haven't been down there."
53:59,980;54:01,860;"But I've gotten cases of his stuff."
54:01,860;54:02,700;"It's really good."
54:02,700;54:07,300;"Highly recommended if anyone's going down there that line the copes got his hands and that stuff"
54:07,300;54:11,160;"But yeah, Russ Hochstein Russ Hochstein is a is an Nebraska kid"
54:11,160;54:13,860;"one from the University of Nebraska and"
54:13,860;54:18,620;"Grew up in Hardington, which is in town not too far from where I was in Sioux City"
54:18,620;54:21,300;"but Hope Hope Stein is I"
54:21,300;54:27,020;"Say Russ is kind of the prim an example what happens a lot of guys in the NFL you go to your host city"
54:27,020;54:30,780;"Or you know the city that you kind of grew up in you settle there"
54:31,780;54:36,340;"Russ is two towns away and I see Russ once or twice a year."
54:36,340;54:37,540;"He's a great dude."
54:37,540;54:38,380;"We get along really well."
54:38,380;54:39,860;"Our family's getting along great."
54:39,860;54:42,460;"But you just end up-- I live in Rentham"
54:42,460;54:45,020;"and I basically see Rentham people now."
54:45,020;54:46,300;"So it sucks."
54:46,300;54:48,300;"Like there, you know."
54:48,300;54:50,300;"It's-- KFALK was here for years,"
54:50,300;54:52,180;"but then now he's moved back down to Louisiana."
54:52,180;54:53,100;"That's right."
54:53,100;54:56,820;"I think I've got four A's obviously doing radio."
54:56,820;54:58,540;"So he's local."
54:58,540;55:00,740;"I'm probably also still here."
55:00,740;55:01,580;"- Wiggy's kind of it."
55:01,580;55:05,180;"And Wiggy's still here, yeah, obviously he and I worked"
55:05,180;55:06,780;"for years together on ""Nesson"""
55:06,780;55:09,080;"but now he's doing all radio and no TV anymore."
55:09,080;55:11,860;"So, but all those names that I mentioned,"
55:11,860;55:13,980;"we're all around here, but we're all kind of living"
55:13,980;55:15,860;"in different towns, we see each other a little,"
55:15,860;55:16,860;"but not a lot."
55:16,860;55:20,140;"Bruski's obviously, but Brube is down a Bristol"
55:20,140;55:22,020;"few days a week, but he lives in North Attabro,"
55:22,020;55:23,700;"so he's not too far away."
55:23,700;55:27,460;"So, yeah, honestly, even though you're here-ish,"
55:27,460;55:30,380;"I think we talk through text messages more"
55:30,380;55:33,700;"We do it person, which is, I think, just more life."
55:33,700;55:35,540;"Yeah, I think that's a common thing."
55:35,540;55:40,260;"So, I mean, we have to ask the obvious question of, like, do you have the phone number for"
55:40,260;55:41,260;"Troy Brown?"
55:41,260;55:42,260;"Troy Brown."
55:42,260;55:48,580;"Yeah, because we are the Browns."
55:48,580;55:52,060;"We also, we were discussing this last night, we're going to ask you, and then we got a"
55:52,060;55:56,300;"discussion, does, is Troy Brown the type of guy that actually has a cell phone?"
55:56,300;55:59,300;"Because he strikes me like he made me know."
55:59,300;56:01,700;"I definitely am not gonna be able to give that one out."
56:01,700;56:03,000;"(laughing)"
56:03,000;56:04,300;"Yeah, yes, yes."
56:04,300;56:08,200;"- Like how early was he on the iPod train?"
56:08,200;56:10,860;"- Ooh, I don't remember."
56:10,860;56:14,200;"So okay, so I have to be deliberate here."
56:14,200;56:19,200;"And so the groups don't lift together necessarily."
56:19,200;56:22,580;"So that my whole thing was the linebacker group."
56:22,580;56:24,300;"Sometimes the line would go in with us as well."
56:24,300;56:25,820;"Maybe tight ends, 'cause we're like mid,"
56:25,820;56:27,780;"I think we're called the, what do they say?"
56:27,780;56:30,460;"Lightweights, middleweights, heavies or something like that."
56:30,460;56:31,780;"So I think we're always in the middle group."
56:31,780;56:35,400;"So the receivers and maybe the running backs and the DBs"
56:35,400;56:36,580;"and stuff, they all work out together,"
56:36,580;56:38,000;"quarterbacks are with them."
56:38,000;56:40,700;"And then the middleweight stuff, which is us,"
56:40,700;56:43,300;"linebackers and maybe the D line."
56:43,300;56:44,280;"Now D line's more heavy."
56:44,280;56:46,260;"So mostly linebackers and tight ends"
56:46,260;56:48,580;"and maybe the full backs or whatever we work out together."
56:48,580;56:50,900;"So whatever Troy, music, Troy's,"
56:50,900;56:53,180;"let's know we're probably not in lifting groups right now."
56:53,180;56:55,500;"So it's more your body type guys,"
56:55,500;56:57,100;"those middle sites."
56:57,100;56:59,100;"he's probably listening classical"
56:59,100;57:01,820;"(laughing)"
57:01,820;57:04,460;"- Ah, he's a, you know, he's from Western,"
57:04,460;57:06,660;"what school in West Virginia?"
57:06,660;57:08,900;"I don't know, I don't know Troy's musical taste,"
57:08,900;57:09,900;"I swear I can't."
57:09,900;57:12,460;"(laughing)"
57:12,460;57:13,300;"- Foyled."
57:13,300;57:19,220;"- Oh Greg, you wanted to ask about Brian Cox, didn't you?"
57:19,220;57:23,660;"- Yeah, I mean, just from watching all the games in '01,"
57:23,660;57:26,500;"he's like one guy that like stood out as someone"
57:26,500;57:33,460;"like it didn't jump to mind like looking back, but when we actually go through watching the games,"
57:33,460;57:39,060;"you're like, wow, Brian Cox is electric, like just from like a personality standpoint and"
57:39,060;57:45,780;"to that and from a play standpoint too. So yeah, he had a really interesting role on that team and"
57:45,780;57:54,980;"something that so Brian wasn't there in 2000. The 2000 team was the team was five and 11. And"
57:55,860;58:01,140;"you know, I don't know what the exact number was, maybe half, it seemed like half, maybe it wasn't"
58:01,140;58:07,220;"quite that dramatic, but there was a real house clean from between 2000 and 2001. So Cox was one"
58:07,220;58:12,180;"of those new off-season free agents in the O1 crew. Roman Fyfer was the other one. So Fyfe is a"
58:12,180;58:16,900;"stud, really, just a tremendous pro, really lucky to have played with him all those years, but Fyfe"
58:16,900;58:21,700;"came in and Cox came in and those are kind of the two new additions to the linebacker room."
58:22,340;58:26,180;"And Andy, Amanda, Andy Katz, and where it had those neck problems."
58:26,180;58:28,940;"So Andy was having surgeries and his career was ending."
58:28,940;58:31,260;"It was kind of all happened around that same time."
58:31,260;58:33,540;"Cox was coming in as Andy was kind of going out."
58:33,540;58:37,900;"And I believe TJ, Ted Johnson, he's, you know, obviously that really"
58:37,900;58:40,740;"good player for the for the organization for years, but TJ had had."
58:40,740;58:43,500;"I think it was his bicep thing then at the time."
58:43,500;58:44,340;"I don't remember."
58:44,340;58:45,900;"But he was, I thought they said it was a back."
58:45,900;58:46,900;"He was a little."
58:46,900;58:48,260;"Yeah."
58:48,260;58:49,860;"He was a little banged up at the time."
58:49,860;58:50,700;"Cox came in."
58:50,700;58:55,700;"So it was timely that Brian could pop in and play Mike linebacker and that was at the days before"
58:55,700;59:00,060;"Bruce Key was a mic. Bruce Key was more of a will. In other words, a weak sideline backer."
59:00,060;59:05,540;"So your mic is traditionally your big hammer guy and Cox's tall. I think these were about the same height"
59:05,540;59:11,020;"645 type guy, but Brian was heavy. Like he was I mean, he was like what I weigh now unfortunately"
59:11,020;59:19,060;"I mean, he was like 260 type and I was more of a 250 state, but Cox was just one of the thickest"
59:19,860;59:25,660;"on contact, heaviest hitters, at least to the linebacker, that I had never really been around."
59:25,660;59:30,060;"And the crazy part is, Brian was pretty shitty in the weight room."
59:30,060;59:35,660;"And I joke in that because he was such an absolute animal on the field,"
59:35,660;59:40,260;"which was always a good reminder that it's not just the weightlifter guys"
59:40,260;59:42,460;"that necessarily hit the hardest or play the best."
59:42,460;59:44,460;"And Cox was a pre-amended example of that."
59:44,460;59:47,860;"He was really poor at things like bench press and things like that,"
59:47,860;59:51,620;"which you wouldn't expect because he was absolute assassin on the field."
59:51,620;59:56,500;"But the reason I said his role was unique is Brian was kind of like the much, much older"
59:56,500;01:00:01,540;"vet when he was brought in on one and he was kind of a, you know, I don't know,"
01:00:01,540;01:00:06,100;"speed dial to the front office kind of guy like Bill would have a man you could tell a lot to"
01:00:06,100;01:00:11,540;"how are things in a locker room. You know, he was sort of meant to be kind of the go between"
01:00:12,260;01:00:15,060;"and enforcer a little bit, you know."
01:00:15,060;01:00:17,540;"And so Brian actually had a little tension"
01:00:17,540;01:00:20,620;"because I'd gotten in trouble for a couple,"
01:00:20,620;01:00:22,020;"I had two personal fouls and one game"
01:00:22,020;01:00:23,420;"against the Broncos early."
01:00:23,420;01:00:24,260;"- Oh yeah."
01:00:24,260;01:00:26,860;"- And the coach had laid,"
01:00:26,860;01:00:31,380;"yeah, coach had laid into me in post-game"
01:00:31,380;01:00:35,020;"and then Cox said something to me in the locker room"
01:00:35,020;01:00:37,620;"and we, you know, it didn't get the blows"
01:00:37,620;01:00:39,980;"but it was tense between me and I."
01:00:39,980;01:00:42,140;"And I'm telling you this because I love Brian."
01:00:42,140;01:00:44,860;"He's a great guy and that we were tense then"
01:00:44,860;01:00:47,020;"and because he was the sort of the older guy"
01:00:47,020;01:00:48,740;"telling the line of the coaches"
01:00:48,740;01:00:51,020;"and I was just leaving the fuck alone time"
01:00:51,020;01:00:52,980;"to try and charge my job here."
01:00:52,980;01:00:54,180;"I'm not trying to fuck up."
01:00:54,180;01:00:56,540;"It's just, you know, I had a couple bad calls."
01:00:56,540;01:00:59,500;"But anyway, so it's funny because then as I grow"
01:00:59,500;01:01:02,580;"and become a vet and then Cox was into coaching,"
01:01:02,580;01:01:03,980;"Brian was my coach."
01:01:03,980;01:01:05,500;"So he was in New York when I was in New York."
01:01:05,500;01:01:07,500;"So the Cox was brought down there with,"
01:01:07,500;01:01:09,100;"he was brought down there with me and Jeannie."
01:01:09,100;01:01:13,660;"So it was funny because that one year Cox was, you know, you know, the head he has against"
01:01:13,660;01:01:16,540;"Indianapolis that really turned the tide of that game."
01:01:16,540;01:01:21,340;"One of the big blow up shots over the middle and, you know, Cox was just such a stud for"
01:01:21,340;01:01:24,620;"that early group, less emotional leader kind of guy."
01:01:24,620;01:01:29,580;"But he was also, I think one of the biggest lessons I got from Brian was his toughness"
01:01:29,580;01:01:33,340;"and just that he played with one of the worst injuries I've ever seen."
01:01:33,340;01:01:34,580;"He basically had a broken foot."
01:01:34,580;01:01:35,580;"Yeah."
01:01:35,580;01:01:37,300;"Now when you break your foot, you can't fucking run."
01:01:37,300;01:01:42,720;"He would put, you know, like you'll see offensive lineman, they'll do that like club thing where they put the giant club on a hand"
01:01:42,720;01:01:47,780;"And you know, maybe it's even a close-fist and they don't have fingers and they're able to you know, they're able to play"
01:01:47,780;01:01:54,580;"Assemblants of their normal game cocks did that with a foot and like I've never I've never seen that before like he's getting a shot up"
01:01:54,580;01:02:01,220;"If you look at the way he had it taped his foot was like a club foot like he had so much tape on his ankle and he"
01:02:01,220;01:02:05,340;"Foot I don't know exactly where the break was but he had a break somewhere there down in his foot"
01:02:05,340;01:02:10,860;"And he was so big, you know, in the mid season and late season with us, but you"
01:02:10,860;01:02:14,660;"wasn't really healthy yet played through that thing through the playoffs. And I"
01:02:14,660;01:02:17,940;"want to, if I recall, I don't think he had much of a role in the Super Bowl. I"
01:02:17,940;01:02:22,380;"think by then he was, it was a little more reduced because he was so fucked up"
01:02:22,380;01:02:26,660;"physically. But I just remember, you know, I went through some things later in my"
01:02:26,660;01:02:32,100;"career. I shredded my toe and a sesmoi tear basically like, you know, when"
01:02:32,100;01:02:34,940;"someone has an ACL reconstruction, I kind of had one of those for my foot."
01:02:34,940;01:02:39,520;"Like I absolutely shredded my foot and I used to have to take a pair of shoes and"
01:02:39,520;01:02:43,400;"I get a new pair of shoes for each game and have to cut a little X out of the side"
01:02:43,400;01:02:47,700;"So my says my joint could stick out the side of my shoe like because there's not enough room in the shoe for width"
01:02:47,700;01:02:50,980;"Like my I mean I had a fucked up toe like I basically"
01:02:50,980;01:02:55,380;"Shouldn't have been a shouldn't have been out there was getting that shot up and was just limping along"
01:02:55,380;01:03:01,700;"But I always remember you know, I like thinking okay Brian played with his broken. I got a stress fracture"
01:03:01,700;01:03:06,080;"I've got a badly dislocated toe. I can barely walk but I do remember as an older"
01:03:06,080;01:03:11,140;"player going, ""Okay, you know, if I can, Brian got out there and be cocks went out and"
01:03:11,140;01:03:14,540;"played on a broken foot."" And I was similarly limited. You could tell"
01:03:14,540;01:03:18,500;"be cocks was limited too. But his whole thing was off the ball, middle linebacker"
01:03:18,500;01:03:21,540;"by that point. He's like, ""I can still take three hard strides and hit the"
01:03:21,540;01:03:24,820;"shit out of the garden front of me. I can't cover anyone at this juncture. I can be"
01:03:24,820;01:03:28,460;"able to pass for us."" But what can I still do with my body limited this way?"
01:03:28,460;01:03:32,940;"And I just I don't you always lose a good example for me because I remember he figured it out"
01:03:32,940;01:03:35,980;"He played through the pain take what you got to take to get out there"
01:03:35,980;01:03:41,800;"And I had a very similar situation that later in my career that I had to deal with and I always kind of thought back to how Fox was"
01:03:41,800;01:03:43,800;"a little bit inspiring that way, but"
01:03:43,800;01:03:50,300;"Yeah, he was he was an important guy in those in those in that old one run because he was a very emotional leader"
01:03:50,300;01:03:56,660;"And he dealt with a lot to get the game day himself and his role kind of had been flowed like a lot of guys have happened"
01:03:56,660;01:03:59,300;"But, you know, I was glad I got to play with him there."
01:03:59,300;01:04:01,140;"And even though there was a little tension early on,"
01:04:01,140;01:04:02,500;"and you got to be my coach later on,"
01:04:02,500;01:04:05,300;"it ended up being a guy that I really respected."
01:04:05,300;01:04:07,940;"Yeah, because I remember, I think he got,"
01:04:07,940;01:04:12,340;"I was like a chop block or something against the Broncos,"
01:04:12,340;01:04:13,380;"is how he broke it."
01:04:13,380;01:04:15,300;"Because he was a little fine."
01:04:15,300;01:04:17,780;"He ended up kind of, yeah, swinging on the guy,"
01:04:17,780;01:04:18,820;"because he'd just dove at his feet."
01:04:18,820;01:04:19,700;"Absolutely remember that."
01:04:19,700;01:04:20,900;"He was in the Broncos game, you're right."
01:04:20,900;01:04:21,860;"Yeah, remember that."
01:04:21,860;01:04:23,460;"But then he came back like five weeks later,"
01:04:23,460;01:04:24,260;"and we were talking about it."
01:04:24,260;01:04:25,700;"We had no idea how that was off."
01:04:25,700;01:04:30,700;"- Yeah, he came back quicker from that than Terry Glenda from his hamstring."
01:04:30,700;01:04:31,700;"I believe his work."
01:04:31,700;01:04:32,700;"- Yeah, hamstring sucked, man."
01:04:32,700;01:04:33,700;"I hate those things."
01:04:33,700;01:04:37,700;"I've gone through that because it sounds like such a, it sounds like kind of a pussy injury."
01:04:37,700;01:04:38,700;"Oh, your hammy's."
01:04:38,700;01:04:41,700;"But like once you've porn one of those things, they never heal."
01:04:41,700;01:04:46,700;"And if you happen to have a job where it requires you to open up and go full speed, I cover kickoffs"
01:04:46,700;01:04:47,700;"obviously."
01:04:47,700;01:04:52,700;"And then you're going to have a job where it requires you to open up and go full speed."
01:04:52,700;01:04:56,660;"open up and go full speed. I covered kick-offs obviously for my whole career."
01:04:56,660;01:04:59,940;"Hamstrings suck like you would you literally rather just break the arm."
01:04:59,940;01:05:03,980;"Break the arm, break the bone clean, clean break, what a heel. Hamstrings are kind"
01:05:03,980;01:05:07,500;"of those things where you get a tear in them where they start to open up and"
01:05:07,500;01:05:12,140;"they never heal and you can't run and it's just you know all my hammy it just"
01:05:12,140;01:05:16,140;"sounds like something that's not like as cool as like I broke my leg or I you"
01:05:16,140;01:05:19,580;"know I'd separated my shoulder or something like hamstring sound terrible."
01:05:19,580;01:05:22,280;"I pull the muscle, but if you, I don't know."
01:05:22,280;01:05:23,120;"I just know it."
01:05:23,120;01:05:24,320;"I dealt with that one season."
01:05:24,320;01:05:26,720;"And for my job, you have to sit over there, sit over,"
01:05:26,720;01:05:28,560;"sit over there, then run down and cover a kick off"
01:05:28,560;01:05:30,600;"and maybe play a few plays on defense."
01:05:30,600;01:05:32,640;"And it's just when your hammies are jacked up,"
01:05:32,640;01:05:34,020;"it's not good."
01:05:34,020;01:05:35,280;"So I can imagine being a guy like that"
01:05:35,280;01:05:37,560;"where you have to run 40 yards down field"
01:05:37,560;01:05:39,840;"when I'm back to the huddle, run 25 yard out cut"
01:05:39,840;01:05:40,840;"and then go down or a 15."
01:05:40,840;01:05:42,140;"Like if your hammies are jacked up,"
01:05:42,140;01:05:44,640;"it's a pain in the ass to say that much."
01:05:44,640;01:05:49,440;"- Greg, don't you have hamstring issues?"
01:05:49,440;01:05:52,560;"I have, now I have like knee tendinitis stuff."
01:05:52,560;01:05:53,400;"- Oh, that's right."
01:05:53,400;01:05:54,720;"I thought I was answering."
01:05:54,720;01:05:55,880;"- Yeah."
01:05:55,880;01:05:57,640;"- I've been giving you crap for hamstring issues"
01:05:57,640;01:05:58,480;"for no reason."
01:05:58,480;01:06:03,960;"- Greg used to play soccer at UNH, so."
01:06:03,960;01:06:05,600;"He's the closest thing we have to a match at him"
01:06:05,600;01:06:06,920;"in our family."
01:06:06,920;01:06:08,240;"- There you go."
01:06:08,240;01:06:10,160;"- UNH is a cool school, man."
01:06:10,160;01:06:15,000;"I'm just, I'm sad that they didn't have the hockey season"
01:06:15,000;01:06:21,640;"cut short because I've I've I try to do hockey's hit like as many venues as we can a year here's my"
01:06:21,640;01:06:27,560;"kids 11 year old kid a really good hockey player and we don't get up the bees game very often so"
01:06:27,560;01:06:31,400;"we try to hit every venue we can in hockey's and UNH is one I haven't hit I've never been up the"
01:06:31,400;01:06:37,000;"mains I don't think I haven't been to Merrimack yet either I think we had hit just about everything"
01:06:37,000;01:06:40,520;"and this was going to be off season where we're going to tick off those last few and then the"
01:06:40,520;01:06:42,080;"the season got got started."
01:06:42,080;01:06:43,840;"Best late plans, right?"
01:06:43,840;01:06:45,440;"There you go."
01:06:45,440;01:06:48,240;"Yeah. All right. Well, Matt, we've"
01:06:48,240;01:06:51,000;"we've taken one of you."
01:06:51,000;01:06:54,640;"So I look for a 20 minute."
01:06:54,640;01:06:58,000;"Is that accurate? I think I took your time to"
01:06:58,000;01:07:00,640;"no, I just talk and talk and talk."
01:07:00,640;01:07:03,160;"I took the day off today because what the hell is"
01:07:03,160;01:07:05,240;"I'm going to do a PTO this year?"
01:07:05,240;01:07:07,400;"You know, yeah, I am good to go."
01:07:07,400;01:07:09,560;"Oh, I'm working today."
01:07:09,560;01:07:11,560;"you're on the clock right now."
01:07:11,560;01:07:12,560;"Yeah."
01:07:12,560;01:07:15,560;"All right."
01:07:15,560;01:07:20,560;"But yeah, I think I have no other."
01:07:20,560;01:07:23,560;"Nothing else on my list that I want to bring up."
01:07:23,560;01:07:27,560;"Well, shout out is the razor show, right?"
01:07:27,560;01:07:29,560;"That's your podcast."
01:07:29,560;01:07:30,560;"Yeah."
01:07:30,560;01:07:31,560;"Yeah."
01:07:31,560;01:07:33,560;"So the razor show on the athletic is up."
01:07:33,560;01:07:35,560;"We haven't done any episodes since the obviously,"
01:07:35,560;01:07:37,560;"So it's Jeff Howes there now."
01:07:37,560;01:07:40,560;"Obviously Jeff Howes are our lead reporter guy"
01:07:40,560;01:07:41,560;"and I'm the analyst."
01:07:41,560;01:07:45,560;"But the razor show has been, I think we did one episode"
01:07:45,560;01:07:47,560;"after the Super Bowl and kind of said dormant."
01:07:47,560;01:07:50,560;"So if you're bored and you want to go listen to episodes"
01:07:50,560;01:07:52,560;"from last year or the rest, but we haven't been,"
01:07:52,560;01:07:54,560;"we haven't been razor showing this offseason yet."
01:07:54,560;01:07:57,560;"So Nick Underhill was the other writer obviously"
01:07:57,560;01:07:59,560;"up with us at the athletic and Nick has now moved back down"
01:07:59,560;01:08:00,560;"to New Orleans."
01:08:00,560;01:08:04,560;"So it's just Jeff and I right now and we're not doing much."
01:08:04,560;01:08:07,460;"I'm just an in-season writer, so I'm not really doing a whole hell of a lot right now."
01:08:07,460;01:08:10,600;"But if you're bored and you want to go look at all the stuff, it's all their archives."
01:08:10,600;01:08:11,600;"Let's put it that way."
01:08:11,600;01:08:14,480;"Yeah, we'll throw a link in the show notes for that."
01:08:14,480;01:08:15,480;"Yeah."
01:08:15,480;01:08:16,480;"All right, Matt."
01:08:16,480;01:08:17,680;"Still doing Nessin's the plug."
01:08:17,680;01:08:18,680;"There you go."
01:08:18,680;01:08:19,680;"So Nessin's--"
01:08:19,680;01:08:20,680;"Hey, guys."
01:08:20,680;01:08:23,280;"--where I think we're actually starting to-- well, but this is going to be the show will"
01:08:23,280;01:08:24,280;"be shown later."
01:08:24,280;01:08:25,280;"So maybe not by then."
01:08:25,280;01:08:26,920;"Maybe by then, we'll actually be on TV again."
01:08:26,920;01:08:27,920;"Who knows?"
01:08:27,920;01:08:30,080;"But right now we're just doing the from-home stuff."
01:08:30,080;01:08:31,080;"Oh, man."
01:08:31,080;01:08:32,080;"Beautiful."
01:08:32,080;01:08:41,560;"man. All right. Well, thank you again, Matt. This has been"
01:08:41,560;01:08:43,960;"fantastic. Yeah, it's been awesome myself."
01:08:43,960;01:08:49,820;"Thanks for having me. Yeah. My pleasure. All right, yeah,"
01:08:49,820;01:08:53,520;"take care guys. Take it. Thanks. Bye. Bye."

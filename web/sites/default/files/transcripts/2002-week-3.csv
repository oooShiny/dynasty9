00:06,860;00:11,040;"you have the choice not to. My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:11,040;00:15,820;"to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid. You still want to listen? Go right"
00:15,820;00:17,820;"I am not your mother"
00:17,820;00:25,000;"Hi welcome welcome back to my pages"
00:25,000;00:28,780;"Dynasty football, you know, I can't do this with video on"
00:28,780;00:33,180;"We're gonna start this over"
00:33,180;00:35,700;"Welcome back to the pages dynasty podcast"
00:35,700;00:41,820;"2002 still trucking along in the good times 2002"
00:42,460;00:49,860;"Andy why do you think it's welcome back this could be the first episode they listen to we've been over this in earlier episodes if you're if you're just starting here I"
00:49,860;00:54,260;"Don't know what to tell you I mean if I was starting at one episode"
00:54,260;00:58,220;"It would be week three versus the Chiefs in 2002. I mean to be fair"
00:58,220;00:59,940;"This is a pretty good one-off game"
00:59,940;01:05,620;"So if you're here just for the one-off game and you remember this then congrats to you. I would"
01:05,620;01:08,900;"2001"
01:08,900;01:10,900;"What about our Spanish listeners"
01:10,900;01:19,260;"Well, I remember Steve has when he went to Mexico, he came back with some, was some Spanish stuff that you like."
01:19,260;01:24,460;"Yeah, well, everything I know about Spanish, I learned from dad anyways, we already covered that."
01:24,460;01:26,660;"We should do an episode in Spanish."
01:26,660;01:30,660;"No, we should."
01:30,660;01:33,860;"Fucking see, you're always the same."
01:33,860;01:40,460;"Well, I think German and you guys can do it in Spanish."
01:40,660;01:41,660;"Mm."
01:41,660;01:43,660;"Moy bien."
01:43,660;01:46,780;"El Partido was Moebueno."
01:46,780;01:51,020;"Those are the bases pulled from the baller."
01:51,020;01:53,180;"This game actually was pretty good."
01:53,180;01:54,660;"This game was amazing."
01:54,660;01:56,620;"The second half of this game was amazing."
01:56,620;01:58,140;"It was."
01:58,140;02:01,980;"It was a lot like I don't remember this game, but"
02:01,980;02:02,820;"stuff."
02:02,820;02:03,740;"It's worth a watch."
02:03,740;02:04,100;"Yeah."
02:04,100;02:05,580;"So here's something I wanted."
02:05,580;02:06,180;"I wanted to do."
02:06,180;02:08,060;"I figured we should start the game with"
02:08,060;02:09,940;"like a watchability score"
02:09,980;02:12,460;"Because some of these, we're going through all of them and some of these."
02:12,460;02:14,200;"Man, that's so great."
02:14,200;02:23,260;"And there's been some losses to the dolphins in Miami back in the one season that we definitely, that would probably be at the zero on the."
02:23,260;02:28,460;"I don't know what scale would we do through one out of six on parties."
02:28,460;02:32,500;"Oh, is that too much of a dick measuring contest?"
02:32,500;02:34,180;"Well, we haven't."
02:34,580;02:36,500;"I mean, we're going to win more than six on party."
02:36,500;02:40,780;"So that's just a artificial because it could be 10 and three years, you know,"
02:40,780;02:43,580;"they could, but for now we could always increase it."
02:43,580;02:48,700;"But I think for now in terms of watchability, should we do one, one through six?"
02:48,700;02:52,860;"I mean, we should scale it on like coaches."
02:52,860;02:58,220;"You know, like what coach, what coaches teams are the most fun to watch?"
02:58,220;03:04,460;"Like like Mark, like Mark is great to watch, you know, Andy"
03:04,460;03:06,900;"read. Usually pretty good to watch."
03:06,900;03:08,860;"Good call. Jim Harbaugh games are"
03:08,860;03:11,180;"usually entertaining, the very"
03:11,180;03:13,500;"least. Yeah. Yeah. But not all"
03:13,500;03:15,580;"I like the one, three, six Mike"
03:15,580;03:19,460;"malarkey. Well, they're"
03:19,460;03:21,340;"entertaining if you're enjoyed"
03:21,340;03:23,260;"Pat's blowouts. Yeah, I would I"
03:23,260;03:24,420;"would say I'll put Dick for meal"
03:24,420;03:27,060;"games in that because as well as"
03:27,060;03:28,820;"he could coach offense, he's that"
03:28,820;03:31,060;"bad at coaching a defense. Big"
03:31,060;03:38,300;"deck. So I think the chiefs in this this season will go eight"
03:38,300;03:43,380;"and eight, but they would lead the league in scoring and would be"
03:43,380;03:44,980;"like 30 in."
03:44,980;03:47,740;"Yeah, you're going to steal my scouting report already."
03:47,740;03:50,060;"Oh, all right. Yeah, let's do that."
03:50,060;03:52,700;"I haven't decided on a watchability score."
03:52,700;03:54,940;"Let's go one through six one Barney's Andy."
03:54,940;03:56,460;"That's six."
03:56,460;03:57,820;"It definitely is a six."
03:57,820;04:00,860;"It was actually no, let's call it a five because you can."
04:00,860;04:03,860;"Okay. Yeah. A five and only watch the second half, I would say."
04:03,860;04:07,100;"Well, five of them parties and AFC Championship."
04:07,100;04:09,420;"So five point five. Okay."
04:09,420;04:11,260;"Okay. Yeah. All right."
04:11,260;04:13,340;"Is it is an AFC Championship trophy?"
04:13,340;04:14,540;"Is that even a half though?"
04:14,540;04:16,220;"I mean, yeah."
04:16,220;04:18,740;"And then a AFC East is a point two five."
04:18,740;04:20,740;"Okay. All right."
04:20,740;04:22,060;"I like that. Fair enough."
04:22,060;04:25,460;"So we'll give this a five point five because I think there's still like"
04:25,460;04:29,820;"maybe two marginal steps up, you know, if it wasn't week three."
04:29,820;04:37,320;"I would I would even go a hard five. I think there was some sloppiness in this game. It was entertaining, but you're right"
04:37,320;04:42,920;"Billion penalties. Yeah. Well, I didn't actually watch it. So I'm gonna let you guys"
04:42,920;04:49,280;"Start the score. I am shocked and appalled"
04:49,280;04:57,560;"Yeah, all right, so the score of this one for those who can actually count that high was"
04:59,040;05:05,480;"In overtime no less 41 38 New England Patriots your New England Patriots over the Chiefs"
05:05,480;05:11,840;"Which is pretty impressive considering the game was 10 to 9 Chiefs at the at the half"
05:11,840;05:17,000;"So this second half was yeah an absolute bond burner"
05:17,000;05:21,040;"But Greg tell us a bit about the Chiefs"
05:21,040;05:24,000;"Sure your scouting reports that"
05:24,680;05:31,760;"Well, like you said Andy this team was as about as lopsided from offense to defense as it comes"
05:31,760;05:39,160;"They were on offense this year. They were first in points in fourth in yards and on defense"
05:39,160;05:44,840;"They were 28 10 points allowed and 30 second deadly in yards. Yeah"
05:44,840;05:48,480;"According to wiki"
05:48,480;05:58,880;"pd.com. It's the second largest offense to defense imbalance in what's that 20 from 1992 to 2010."
05:58,880;06:04,000;"Holy shit. So almost the first. Yeah. That's an obvious question."
06:04,000;06:12,160;"That 1992 CLC Hawks, I guess. Wow. It's been before my time, but yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
06:12,160;06:18,400;"So if you look at the, so Dick Vermeil's head coach, if you look at the rosters, it makes sense to"
06:18,400;06:25,720;"So the offense Trent Green quarterback priest Holmes Dante Hall Tony Gonzalez, so yeah"
06:25,720;06:33,200;"Do their offensive line stacked as well. Yeah, willy roll from will shields and Ryan waters or winters. Oh"
06:33,200;06:38,900;"Yeah, really rof is an all-time name. Yeah, especially for a line. Yeah, yeah"
06:38,900;06:45,920;"Would did Berman have a nickname for him? I feel like he would have probably well probably willy pot rof really"
06:47,360;06:51,460;"Like it's Steve, but if you look at their defense like"
06:51,460;06:56,240;"There's literally not a single name. I recognize yeah"
06:56,240;07:00,400;"I think defense is is is putting it generously"
07:00,400;07:03,960;"These guys are fucking nobodies"
07:03,960;07:08,680;"My favorite was all-time name Mike Mazzoski"
07:08,680;07:15,840;"Luski do you recognize him? He had a hundred twenty five tackles that year. I just confused him with"
07:16,560;07:18,560;"Yeah, Mike was asking from"
07:18,560;07:20,960;"Monster Zink. Oh"
07:20,960;07:25,040;"Ray Crockett. Why do I know Ray Crockett's name?"
07:25,040;07:27,920;"See, you're thinking of Betty Crockett. No."
07:27,920;07:30,640;"Is he like a destruct player or something?"
07:30,640;07:36,160;"Is that Crockett? Yeah, I think he's like he played in a different team and I knew his name. He was their son."
07:36,160;07:39,360;"I played for Denver for a long time. I mean, I recognize some I recognize"
07:39,360;07:44,880;"Clemens that I don't even recognize him. Yeah, I didn't know anybody in their defense besides him."
07:44,960;07:47,200;"No, you think of a heat is Andy Patton."
07:47,200;07:51,200;"It's just monster, the Ren V thrown in"
07:51,200;07:55,200;"Monty Beisel. Didn't he play for the"
07:55,200;07:58,000;"paths badly for a few years?"
07:58,000;08:01,200;"You like. Yeah, he was a name as well."
08:01,200;08:02,000;"Oh, for one."
08:02,000;08:04,160;"Oh, like he was on special teams."
08:04,160;08:05,760;"2005."
08:05,760;08:06,760;"Yep."
08:06,760;08:09,760;"He had one Anderson kicker."
08:09,760;08:11,240;"Again."
08:11,240;08:12,240;"With that hard."
08:12,240;08:13,760;"Oh, uh, face mask."
08:14,480;08:20,400;"You go straight out of like the 19 the from the one from the 1970s. I don't think that's hard"
08:20,400;08:24,720;"when first came in the league. Oh, yeah. He's like, I'm keeping this face the opposite of our"
08:24,720;08:35,040;"though. All right. Want me to continue my, my gut. I think that's all I had. Oh, wait, that's"
08:35,040;08:41,080;"finally our favorite in a game here. They're eight and a half point favorites going over"
08:41,080;08:45,240;"under 43 and a half. So I got a second. I got to go inside."
08:45,240;08:50,240;"I hope you bet the over. My internet's fucked. Oh, I said,"
08:50,240;08:53,440;"maybe we can turn video back on. I thought only Greg had"
08:53,440;08:56,960;"computer problems. Was not remember that Steve?"
08:56,960;09:02,520;"Is it not?"
09:02,520;09:09,280;"Said me we can turn a video back on. Did I send you that snap"
09:09,280;09:12,960;"chat from last night with my ear painted. No, maybe I haven't"
09:12,960;09:15,840;"checked my Snapchat very frequently. You should I've been"
09:15,840;09:20,760;"sending you a bunch of ridiculous snapshots. Oh, here we go."
09:20,760;09:30,160;"That's gross. I got it. That's pretty gross. Did you, did you"
09:30,160;09:34,880;"see my Snapchat story right now? No, check that shit out. I'll"
09:34,880;09:35,880;"I'll give you the caption."
09:35,880;09:37,960;"It's called ""Pound Town USA."""
09:37,960;09:41,620;"- Should I watch this?"
09:41,620;09:42,460;"- Yeah."
09:42,460;09:44,440;"(laughs)"
09:44,440;09:46,140;"- Does bugs be funky?"
09:46,140;09:49,600;"- You're going out and making more bugs."
09:49,600;09:50,440;"- It's bug porn."
09:50,440;09:54,000;"It's like that movie Bugs Life or that movie Ants"
09:54,000;09:55,480;"if they were fucking each other."
09:55,480;09:56,320;"- Yeah."
09:56,320;09:57,160;"(laughs)"
09:57,160;09:58,000;"What the fuck?"
09:58,000;09:58,840;"- All right."
09:58,840;10:03,160;"- Dude, I can't, I don't know how you have the mustache"
10:03,160;10:04,940;"over your lip, Greg, this insane."
10:04,940;10:06,600;"I would drive you nuts."
10:06,600;10:08,440;"- Yeah, it's wicked gross, but the fact that Kelly--"
10:08,440;10:09,600;"- That's what I was feeling."
10:09,600;10:11,640;"- Yeah, Kelly hates it, so I leave it."
10:11,640;10:12,640;"(laughs)"
10:12,640;10:14,080;"- I would drive me nuts."
10:14,080;10:16,940;"Like I'd put with my beard hair in my hair's getting"
10:16,940;10:19,400;"so long, I twirl it like constantly."
10:19,400;10:20,920;"- Oh god, yeah."
10:20,920;10:23,480;"- Yeah, you can, yeah, that's enough of that."
10:23,480;10:24,920;"- That's so fucking gross."
10:24,920;10:28,420;"All right."
10:28,420;10:31,840;"Looking good, Greg, all right."
10:31,840;10:35,840;"Hey, but it's about as dumb as your fucking profile pick, bro."
10:35,840;10:37,480;"Cool, bro."
10:37,480;10:40,640;"Looks like someone outlined your head in a marker."
10:40,640;10:42,040;"Cool, bro."
10:42,040;10:47,840;"All right."
10:47,840;10:49,640;"Let's talk football."
10:49,640;10:51,200;"It's talking football."
10:51,200;10:51,920;"All right."
10:51,920;10:55,040;"See, if you want to tell me about this game."
10:55,040;10:59,680;"Well, I don't know how much Dick Brineel saw because it looked like he was"
10:59,680;11:02,200;"squinting the whole time with like his teeth, you know, like that."
11:02,200;11:05,200;"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
11:05,200;11:07,280;"Sucking his teeth. Yeah."
11:07,280;11:09,600;"I just took me a while to get over that."
11:09,600;11:14,720;"But it does. Can you describe that for our listeners the best way you can?"
11:14,720;11:16,760;"Because I just saw it on video and it makes sense."
11:16,760;11:18,120;"Yeah. Like when you squint, right?"
11:18,120;11:21,080;"You generally like you kind of like pull your cheeks up a little bit."
11:21,080;11:24,560;"And it's like a half a mile, but he would just like let the lips go over"
11:24,560;11:27,600;"like all the way over his teeth, show his gums and everything the whole time."
11:27,600;11:28,080;"Yeah."
11:28,080;11:29,700;"Or his teeth are sticking out."
11:29,700;11:34,800;"I mean, if you think picture Dick Vermeil and just like him squinting with his teeth sticking out."
11:34,800;11:37,640;"And you'll know exactly what we're talking about."
11:37,640;11:40,600;"I feel like it's like a horse who's got peanut butter in his mouth."
11:40,600;11:43,200;"He's like, he's pulling his lips all the way back."
11:43,200;11:44,280;"Yeah, it's like that."
11:44,280;11:48,600;"But I like he that's the defining picture in my head of him, though, before all this."
11:48,600;11:50,240;"I feel like it's his natural face."
11:50,240;11:53,000;"Yeah, with the squint, you've never seen him in like a rain game."
11:53,000;11:54,720;"He's always like super sunny."
11:54,880;11:55,960;"Maybe it's just so bad."
11:55,960;11:58,600;"This like second element is watching his defense play."
11:58,600;12:00,880;"He's not that bad."
12:00,880;12:03,160;"God, he's such a white person though."
12:03,160;12:04,600;"So what?"
12:04,600;12:07,680;"If you just go Google dig for me, it's like this guy."
12:07,680;12:10,440;"This guy is the whitest human life."
12:10,440;12:16,120;"He's like, well, my wife dresses me, you know."
12:16,120;12:19,400;"She's got a good sense of style."
12:19,400;12:23,040;"I have a lot of collared pullovers, but I hang them up in the"
12:23,480;12:25,400;"Well, I'm hangers because I don't want them to get wrinkled."
12:25,400;12:26,400;"Yeah."
12:26,400;12:31,160;"I like the vest because my core stays warm, but my arms, you know, there's still"
12:31,160;12:32,160;"nice and cool."
12:32,160;12:34,160;"I like to be able to move around a lot."
12:34,160;12:36,240;"It's enough."
12:36,240;12:39,680;"You don't like I dig for meal impressions?"
12:39,680;12:40,600;"No."
12:40,600;12:41,440;"Oh, I see."
12:41,440;12:43,240;"I have some audio of Dick for me."
12:43,240;12:48,080;"Because he was apparently super pissed about the injury situation."
12:48,080;12:49,720;"Um,"
12:51,040;12:53,640;"you talk about that halftime like as he's walking off"
12:53,640;12:56,080;"yes as he's walking off of our favorite"
12:56,080;12:58,120;"bony burns thing"
12:58,120;12:59,520;"uh... money"
12:59,520;13:01,320;"yeah"
13:01,320;13:04,600;"she uh... she went to go interview on real quick"
13:04,600;13:06,640;"and so she said"
13:06,640;13:09,280;"just like asked about because there was a bunch of injuries to their defense of"
13:09,280;13:09,680;"back"
13:09,680;13:10,920;"play that reckless"
13:10,920;13:12,080;"let's go to my neighbor and see"
13:12,080;13:13,720;"i don't know the camp problem"
13:13,720;13:16,080;"safe to say this might be a sticky situation"
13:16,080;13:19,240;"we have a problem serious problem and how do you deal with it well we try to get"
13:19,240;13:23,200;"the 46 man rule change so the players we have in our roster can suit up and play"
13:23,200;13:25,680;"that's the number one way we do with it but we don't"
13:25,680;13:28,920;"so we'll try to get a safety rate to play and help us out there but it's a"
13:28,920;13:33,540;"problem right now hopefully their pocket come back and play"
13:33,540;13:36,280;"alright coach thanks"
13:36,280;13:39,280;"what was he so mad about"
13:39,280;13:45,040;"not getting a 46 man roster yeah I think he they had some injuries late in"
13:45,040;13:49,360;"week in terms of defensive backs and then Crockett went out."
13:49,360;13:50,040;"He got hurt."
13:50,040;13:51,720;"I think he came back eventually."
13:51,720;13:56,000;"They got this calf got stepped on or something, but so they were like,"
13:56,000;13:58,160;"they didn't have enough cornerbacks to suit up."
13:58,160;14:02,080;"Probably why you saw an explosion of points in the second half."
14:02,080;14:04,640;"That makes sense."
14:04,640;14:07,040;"Is Bonnie still around these days?"
14:07,040;14:08,000;"Great question."
14:08,000;14:08,800;"Stat check."
14:08,800;14:11,560;"I'm a big fan of Bonnie."
14:11,560;14:12,520;"Yeah, she was great."
14:12,520;14:13,480;"Let's see if she's still great."
14:13,480;14:21,840;"it. And also, why were we maybe she likes half"
14:21,840;14:25,960;"years, Greg? Oh, here we go. She has been named one of the one"
14:25,960;14:30,320;"of the most accomplished female sports casters in history. What"
14:30,320;14:34,840;"does that mean? One of the next like one of like 500, you"
14:34,840;14:38,720;"know, she's on the list though. I mean, none of us can say that."
14:38,960;14:41,000;"I don't know. I mean, I guess."
14:41,000;14:41,480;"All right."
14:41,480;14:42,120;"So this game."
14:42,120;14:44,600;"So much."
14:44,600;14:46,360;"This game was brutal in the first half."
14:46,360;14:50,880;"Like Andy said, I had five Peaches penalties"
14:50,880;14:56,000;"in the first five minutes, seven in the first 10 minutes,"
14:56,000;14:58,320;"and then Brady threw a pick right after that."
14:58,320;14:59,600;"Yeah."
14:59,600;15:03,160;"So the Patriots had more penalty yards and offensive yards"
15:03,160;15:04,160;"at one point."
15:04,160;15:04,760;"Yeah."
15:04,760;15:05,880;"I think OK, yeah."
15:05,880;15:08,720;"At halftime, the Patriots had nine penalties"
15:08,720;15:13,720;"for 80 yards and the Chiefs as a team"
15:13,720;15:16,920;"had less than 80 total yards gain."
15:16,920;15:18,600;"- But one of them was a pretty good"
15:18,600;15:20,520;"back shoulder throw from Trent Green"
15:20,520;15:22,520;"for that touchdown."
15:22,520;15:23,680;"- It's only a good throw, yeah."
15:23,680;15:24,520;"- A legend."
15:24,520;15:28,280;"- But yeah, if you are gonna watch this,"
15:28,280;15:30,200;"skip it the whole first half actually."
15:30,200;15:31,040;"- You have to pray to him."
15:31,040;15:35,600;"- No, no, no, watch that Kevin Falk wheel route touchdown."
15:35,600;15:36,440;"- Oh, that was pretty good."
15:36,440;15:39,040;"That was an absolutely perfect ball from Brady Hit him Mike."
15:39,040;15:42,760;"What you can do is you can go to the Patriots Dynasty website."
15:42,760;15:42,960;"- Oh, yeah, there. - Page"
15:42,960;15:46,360;"I see other flash games slash 69"
15:46,360;15:57,080;"Wow, we're gonna watch the the fall highlight in the highlight section and then go back and watch the full game"
15:57,080;16:00,260;"The full second half. Why is it games 69?"
16:00,260;16:03,040;"It's just a randomly generated number"
16:03,040;16:09,200;"It's the 16 now the 69th piece of content created on the website. That's all it was having to be this game"
16:09,200;16:11,200;"So work that well for us of course"
16:11,440;16:12,440;"Oh yes."
16:12,440;16:13,440;"Perfect."
16:13,440;16:15,360;"Why didn't I guess that?"
16:15,360;16:17,360;"Because you're not a nerd, Gregory."
16:17,360;16:21,160;"Well, you see, it's a series of ones and zeroes."
16:21,160;16:23,800;"It's a fucking number."
16:23,800;16:25,600;"It doesn't mean anything."
16:25,600;16:26,600;"Just there."
16:26,600;16:27,600;"Shut up nerd."
16:27,600;16:29,760;"I don't want to hear it."
16:29,760;16:30,760;"You fucking nerd."
16:30,760;16:32,000;"Fucking Luddite."
16:32,000;16:33,000;"Luddite?"
16:33,000;16:35,280;"Is that what you call it?"
16:35,280;16:36,280;"Yeah."
16:36,280;16:37,280;"Yeah, I called you a fucking Luddite."
16:37,280;16:40,280;"Let me Google that."
16:40,280;16:42,540;"(laughing)"
16:42,540;16:46,120;"- Gotta figure out how offended you, Mr. P.C."
16:46,120;16:49,800;"- A person, a Luddite, it says derogatory."
16:49,800;16:53,440;"A person opposed to new technology or ways of working."
16:53,440;16:54,960;"You wanna hear in a sentence?"
16:54,960;16:55,800;"- Yeah, please."
16:55,800;16:58,700;"I think I just use the sentence, but yes, please."
16:58,700;17:00,240;"Greg, you're a fucking Luddite."
17:00,240;17:01,520;"(laughing)"
17:01,520;17:04,480;"- A small-minded Luddite resisting progress."
17:04,480;17:06,560;"Oh, there's a historical definition."
17:06,560;17:07,560;"(laughing)"
17:07,560;17:10,560;"a member of any of the bands of English workers"
17:10,560;17:12,920;"who destroyed machinery, especially in cotton"
17:12,920;17:15,160;"and woolen mills, that they believed"
17:15,160;17:19,120;"was threatening their jobs, 1811 through 1816."
17:19,120;17:23,440;"- Yeah, the Luddites, the Luddites of England."
17:23,440;17:27,520;"- I hate cotton machines."
17:27,520;17:30,480;"- And you know what I hate more than cotton machines?"
17:30,480;17:31,840;"- Woolen machines."
17:31,840;17:33,640;"(laughing)"
17:33,640;17:35,000;"- Cotton and woolen."
17:35,000;17:37,080;"Yeah, that's too much technology for me."
17:37,080;17:39,520;"(laughing)"
17:39,520;17:40,360;"I'm off."
17:40,360;17:43,920;"If that makes me a Luddite, then god damn it,"
17:43,920;17:44,760;"I'm a Luddite."
17:44,760;17:50,240;"Yeah, I'm taking this one off the rails here, boys."
17:50,240;17:51,080;"Yeah, yeah, here."
17:51,080;17:51,920;"I don't know."
17:51,920;17:52,760;"(laughing)"
17:52,760;17:53,600;"If that got tracked."
17:53,600;17:54,440;"Second half."
17:54,440;17:55,280;"I'm gonna bring it right back a track."
17:55,280;17:56,120;"You ready for this?"
17:56,120;17:58,360;"Speaking of Luddites, how about these commentators?"
17:58,360;18:00,920;"I thought they were good, ish."
18:03,320;18:08,320;"Theodore wasn't as bad as I remembered with some extensions."
18:08,320;18:11,040;"There's Theodore from Dick Emberg."
18:11,040;18:14,640;"I mean, they're really atrocious."
18:14,640;18:16,800;"Now that I figured out how to do audio,"
18:16,800;18:19,080;"like import audio into this, I've got a couple of clips."
18:19,080;18:20,800;"I've got one for Dick Emberg."
18:20,800;18:22,920;"That's cool."
18:22,920;18:25,200;"And I just want to set the scene"
18:25,200;18:28,960;"that it was a quick like bubble screen to Dion Branch"
18:28,960;18:30,920;"that went for a couple yards."
18:30,920;18:37,920;"But this is how it sounded on the television broadcast."
18:37,920;18:40,040;"Look at this technology."
18:40,040;18:40,960;"Andy, ain't it what I--"
18:40,960;18:41,920;"It's for a first time."
18:41,920;18:44,880;"Has a great-grandma, a little flanker screen."
18:44,880;18:48,200;"No, it's to Antoine Smith, who was--"
18:48,200;18:51,720;"make it-- Kevin Falk was flanked out there."
18:51,720;18:53,720;"Was it the on branch of what?"
18:53,720;18:54,220;"Oh, yeah."
18:54,220;18:56,320;"Getting in the crowd a big--"
18:56,320;18:57,960;"[LAUGHTER]"
18:57,960;19:00,880;"And just for the records, if you were watching that,"
19:00,880;19:04,060;"Uh, it was clearly showing Dion Brash the entire time."
19:04,060;19:05,320;"Wow."
19:05,320;19:08,020;"Completely emblazoned to his defense."
19:08,020;19:10,640;"All, all, all those guys have a three in their number."
19:10,640;19:11,700;"Technically."
19:11,700;19:12,000;"Yeah."
19:12,000;19:12,460;"Yeah."
19:12,460;19:15,680;"One, one's a bit taller than the other."
19:15,680;19:16,540;"Yeah."
19:16,540;19:18,540;"And Antoine Smith never lines up."
19:18,540;19:19,720;"It wanted to receive her, but."
19:19,720;19:23,040;"They do all have the reason to them."
19:23,040;19:27,840;"I will say though, they had a sweet golf reference."
19:27,840;19:29,020;"So I was all about that."
19:29,020;19:29,840;"All right."
19:29,840;19:30,440;"What was it?"
19:30,760;19:35,100;"It was, uh, it was on a punt in the second quarter."
19:35,100;19:39,480;"I forget even punted it, but he, you know, hit it at the one and had a little"
19:39,480;19:40,180;"backspin on it."
19:40,180;19:40,660;"Walter."
19:40,660;19:40,860;"Yeah."
19:40,860;19:41,740;"And Walter."
19:41,740;19:42,520;"Yeah."
19:42,520;19:45,220;"I forget his reference was, but I had my own."
19:45,220;19:46,180;"I was like, he should call it."
19:46,180;19:46,720;"KV1."
19:46,720;19:49,600;"Something about a sand wedge in his, his sandwich doesn't do that."
19:49,600;19:50,380;"Yeah."
19:50,380;19:53,560;"Maybe the punter was using a KV one."
19:53,560;19:54,680;"No, sure."
19:54,680;19:55,240;"What's that?"
19:55,240;19:55,440;"Nope."
19:55,440;19:56,320;"I don't know."
19:56,320;19:56,820;"V1."
19:56,820;19:57,300;"Nevermind."
19:57,300;19:57,760;"Okay."
19:57,760;19:58,200;"Well."
19:59,220;20:01,460;"I have a Pro V1. What's a KV1?"
20:01,460;20:03,940;"You know, that joke's too high class for you guys."
20:03,940;20:06,260;"What's a fan wedge?"
20:06,260;20:07,620;"You want to hear some funny, Steve?"
20:07,620;20:11,460;"Is I have had a sleeve of Pro V1s for about two years"
20:11,460;20:16,700;"that I am unwilling to use because I know I'm just going to put them in the woods."
20:16,700;20:19,300;"So it just sits there in my bag."
20:19,300;20:21,140;"And I just every time."
20:21,140;20:23,860;"Yeah. And I just slice away on my range balls."
20:23,860;20:27,540;"So yeah, I think I've golfed with you, boys."
20:28,100;20:35,620;"once maybe twice. And I've actually left the golf course with more balls than I came with,"
20:35,620;20:39,940;"because I just use whatever I can find. I hit a ball in a certain direction, then I just go and"
20:39,940;20:43,540;"find whatever ball is out there in the woods. And then I use that one."
20:43,540;20:50,100;"Last time me and Greg played together, Greg just took some range balls onto the course with him."
20:50,100;20:56,020;"And then we got matched up with a member, and that guy was like, you're using the range balls."
20:57,220;20:58,660;"Greg's like, yeah, whatever."
20:58,660;21:05,380;"So that guy spent the next two holes, just like walking through the woods, tossing out balls are great to you."
21:05,380;21:06,980;"He didn't hit a single shot."
21:06,980;21:16,180;"He would, he would get in his car and he would drive it around to where my first shot landed and just like drop two real balls next to mine and just keep driving."
21:16,180;21:17,140;"He was the best."
21:17,140;21:22,140;"He's like the tooth fairy for like real golf balls."
21:25,940;21:31,460;"Well, once we got past that snoozer first quarter, second quarter, second half is"
21:31,460;21:31,980;"awesome."
21:31,980;21:33,700;"Things really picked up."
21:33,700;21:34,700;"They did."
21:34,700;21:34,980;"Yeah."
21:34,980;21:39,860;"Even the third quarter wasn't like crazy, but it was kind of started to get"
21:39,860;21:40,060;"out there."
21:40,060;21:42,260;"It's the third quarter."
21:42,260;21:43,900;"It's a great moment."
21:43,900;21:45,060;"The whole game."
21:45,060;21:45,620;"Right."
21:45,620;21:46,220;"Which one was that?"
21:46,220;21:49,620;"Well, the cheese scored that touchdown, right?"
21:49,620;21:50,300;"So they're up."
21:50,300;21:51,980;"Yeah."
21:53,020;22:00,060;"And then this was like the Troy Brown Drive where Brady just like they started playing zone and pretty"
22:00,060;22:06,780;"discussed Troy Troy. He goes four in a row to Troy Brown and then five in a row. Well then the fifth"
22:06,780;22:12,380;"one was the touchdown where like Brady was getting blown up. He knew he was going to take a hit and"
22:12,380;22:16,140;"he just like throws it to the corner of the end zone because he just knows that Troy is going to"
22:16,140;22:20,620;"see the same shit he sees and go to the spot. Like he threw it to a spot not even to Troy."
22:21,340;22:23,920;"and try to make a sick ass sliding dive and catch."
22:23,920;22:28,840;"And this, I wish you could arguably say this is Troy Brown's like best game."
22:28,840;22:32,520;"I would think that's right up there with the Steelers, AOC, championship one."
22:32,520;22:33,880;"Yeah. This one."
22:33,880;22:37,640;"Yeah. This one from a productive standpoint was, was better, like an offensive."
22:37,640;22:41,880;"And you got hurt too with like in the third or early fourth quarter."
22:41,880;22:43,920;"Yeah. And didn't come back."
22:43,920;22:45,920;"That's actually true."
22:45,920;22:47,760;"Or thought he would come back."
22:48,200;22:55,040;"There's like oh, yeah in overtime like oh and Troy Brown's back from his injury and it was I was like yeah"
22:55,040;22:57,040;"I was like no, that's not Troy"
22:57,040;23:01,120;"This is what I mean. She's yeah, that was free man"
23:01,120;23:06,220;"I at one point I was getting all worked out and I was getting kind of like nervous that dude or from mburg"
23:06,220;23:08,220;"We're in as bad as I thought they were"
23:08,220;23:11,880;"No, I remember this correctly they were that bad"
23:11,880;23:14,960;"we had Troy Brown ended the day with"
23:16,040;23:19,420;"Team record 16 catches for 176 yards"
23:19,420;23:27,320;"Which today is still 10th all time on the Patriots in terms of yards. It's still first in terms of catches"
23:27,320;23:34,120;"It's like what a PPR game, huh? Jesus. Okay, so that's 16 catches still stands. It's like better than"
23:34,120;23:37,100;"Welker or anybody he's tied for first"
23:37,100;23:41,600;"With in catches. Yes. Well, okay. Yeah"
23:41,600;23:45,160;"What game was that? Give us a clue?"
23:45,160;23:50,160;"So did a big game against Buffalo in Buffalo."
23:50,160;23:52,760;"- Yeah."
23:52,760;23:54,120;"- Did I get it?"
23:54,120;23:54,960;"- Final score."
23:54,960;23:58,560;"- They won that."
23:58,560;23:59,760;"- No, they lost that game."
23:59,760;24:00,760;"That's the one where--"
24:00,760;24:02,820;"- Fred Jackson had that like run that"
24:02,820;24:04,680;"put Buffalo into yogurt."
24:04,680;24:07,000;"- Like the one up 21 nothing and then they lost."
24:07,000;24:08,920;"I ended up losing it 34-31."
24:08,920;24:10,880;"'Cause I think that was,"
24:12,880;24:15,440;"What's the name from from Harvard from Harvard?"
24:15,440;24:16,760;"Ryan Fitzpatrick."
24:16,760;24:18,400;"Yes, thank you."
24:18,400;24:20,240;"It was a Ryan Fitzpatrick game where you started the game"
24:20,240;24:22,800;"throwing three interceptions and then turned around"
24:22,800;24:24,920;"and still threw four touchdowns."
24:24,920;24:26,360;"I love Fitzpatrick."
24:26,360;24:27,560;"He's the best."
24:27,560;24:30,840;"But when's Walker in that game, which I'm excited to get to now"
24:30,840;24:36,920;"and I know this, 16 catches 217 yards in two touchdowns."
24:36,920;24:37,920;"Yeah."
24:37,920;24:42,840;"We got Brown, Welker, Edelman, like Rankham."
24:42,840;24:44,560;"- Fwoo."
24:44,560;24:46,760;"- 'Cause they all make the same."
24:46,760;24:49,060;"- I like kind of have a sour taste"
24:49,060;24:51,600;"to my mouth about Welker."
24:51,600;24:54,120;"- A lot of people do because of his drop in the Super Bowl"
24:54,120;24:56,120;"and the fact they never actually won."
24:56,120;24:57,600;"- Yeah."
24:57,600;25:00,360;"- I mean, Troy Brown's having number one."
25:00,360;25:01,640;"- Yeah, what do we reckon this off of?"
25:01,640;25:02,560;"How much we like the guys?"
25:02,560;25:04,640;"'Cause Troy Brown's definitely number one,"
25:04,640;25:06,080;"if that's the case."
25:06,080;25:08,440;"- Yeah, in their prime, who you got?"
25:08,440;25:10,480;"Who would you like pick?"
25:10,480;25:11,800;"- Troy Brown."
25:11,800;25:16,360;"in their in their prime prime welcome to be honest his numbers are yeah like"
25:16,360;25:22,560;"he benefited from Randy Moss too true but he was also like doing shit on his own as"
25:22,560;25:26,920;"well like and that offense was like running gun that's when they were running"
25:26,920;25:33,120;"that hurry up and they were getting they were getting off like 75 95 plays a"
25:33,120;25:38,120;"game yeah this this this the Buffalo game was in 2011 so it's not like it was"
25:38,120;25:39,920;"just with him."
25:39,920;25:41,640;"Here's a knock on Welker, though."
25:41,640;25:45,040;"No special teams like Troy and Julian definitely"
25:45,040;25:46,880;"had impacts as pun returners."
25:46,880;25:49,400;"Welker used to return puns, but then I"
25:49,400;25:51,640;"think because he was so valuable to the offense,"
25:51,640;25:54,480;"they had Edelman's Arduino instead."
25:54,480;25:56,360;"And I remember when they made the switch"
25:56,360;25:58,440;"and I thought Elman wasn't as good."
25:58,440;26:01,720;"Also, a knock on Welker is his face"
26:01,720;26:03,240;"kind of looks like dumb."
26:03,240;26:05,240;"Yeah, he's got to get dumb face."
26:05,240;26:06,240;"That's true."
26:06,240;26:07,680;"Yeah, like Julian."
26:07,680;26:09,840;"So obviously a beautiful looking man."
26:09,840;26:13,480;"Even Troy Brown, like he's kind of a normal looking guy."
26:13,480;26:14,960;"Yeah, well, pretty gorgeous."
26:14,960;26:17,280;"He's got like dumb face."
26:17,280;26:21,200;"He's got like man manning forehead, you know, where he gets like the mark from the helmet."
26:21,200;26:21,640;"Yeah."
26:21,640;26:22,600;"It's almost on to tight."
26:22,600;26:24,000;"Mm hmm."
26:24,000;26:24,440;"Yep."
26:24,440;26:25,480;"That's fair."
26:25,480;26:26,480;"That's fair."
26:26,480;26:29,760;"I would go Troy Edelman Walker."
26:29,760;26:31,280;"I think Edelman doesn't get enough credit."
26:31,280;26:35,040;"What about you think Troy Brown would have a like huge numbers if he"
26:35,040;26:36,720;"played more seasons with Brady."
26:36,720;26:39,180;"I mean, he did in those first few years."
26:39,180;26:39,400;"Yeah."
26:39,400;26:40,140;"So probably."
26:40,140;26:43,860;"And I think just in general, I think you would have bigger numbers"
26:43,860;26:47,320;"in the more past heavy offenses of today anyway."
26:47,320;26:52,360;"Yeah, but even like as opposed to a blood cell where I feel like"
26:52,360;26:57,780;"Brady relies on that slot receiver that can just find spaces, like work through"
26:57,780;26:59,220;"his own and get it open."
26:59,220;27:01,740;"Like I feel like that's Troy Brown to it."
27:01,740;27:02,640;"Tea, right?"
27:02,640;27:04,900;"Like when I'm still in blood cell."
27:04,900;27:07,980;"But it was a different game."
27:07,980;27:11,060;"Like I feel like Troy Brown's game was a lot different"
27:11,060;27:15,180;"than Welker and Edelman in terms of like Welker and Edelman"
27:15,180;27:16,860;"or that quick shifty kind of guy"
27:16,860;27:18,060;"who can change retro real quick."
27:18,060;27:20,300;"And that was never really Troy Brown's game"
27:20,300;27:22,460;"in terms of like route running, you know?"
27:22,460;27:23,940;"- You know, that he's just new where to go."
27:23,940;27:26,180;"- I just felt like Troy Brown knew where to sit"
27:26,180;27:27,980;"in terms of his own."
27:27,980;27:31,140;"- He's pretty shifty though, maybe not as much as a shifty."
27:31,140;27:34,340;"And he also like, I feel like Troy Brown got a lot"
27:34,340;27:36,400;"his yards on those like quick bubble screens too."
27:36,400;27:38,080;"Because he's like,"
27:38,080;27:40,040;"part returner guy."
27:40,040;27:42,160;"Who got the most touchdowns?"
27:42,160;27:44,720;"Most touchdowns."
27:44,720;27:47,080;"Yeah, because that was always, I mean, Edelman"
27:47,080;27:49,160;"Handelhocker never scored touchdowns really."
27:49,160;27:50,540;"Sure."
27:50,540;27:51,280;"He just had to catch us."
27:51,280;27:52,520;"We never had that many touchdowns."
27:52,520;27:55,360;"Yeah, but Troy seems to be, I mean, rewatching"
27:55,360;27:57,160;"all these games and seeing him gaming game out."
27:57,160;27:59,120;"He's a little bit more of like a downfield threat"
27:59,120;28:01,080;"than just that slot."
28:01,080;28:02,960;"So he's seemed to score a little bit."
28:02,960;28:03,960;"Interesting."
28:03,960;28:06,240;"Like even the touch down just referenced."
28:06,240;28:08,600;"I don't know if it's a word."
28:08,600;28:10,680;"Wait."
28:10,680;28:12,280;"What is this ranking it on?"
28:12,280;28:14,560;"Touchdowns."
28:14,560;28:18,400;"All right, so the first one, there are eight, nine, and 10."
28:18,400;28:19,400;"Really?"
28:19,400;28:20,400;"Really?"
28:20,400;28:21,360;"This can't be right."
28:21,360;28:26,640;"Do you want to guess the order?"
28:26,640;28:28,920;"Are we talking like eighth place, ninth place, 10th place?"
28:28,920;28:31,840;"Or they have nine and 10 touchdowns?"
28:31,840;28:34,760;"No, eight, eight, eight place, nine place, 10."
28:34,760;28:39,560;"I think Troy probably has the longevity, right?"
28:39,560;28:40,800;"He's been there in less."
28:40,800;28:41,800;"Wrong."
28:41,800;28:50,360;"Well, Kurt has got 37, Edelman, 36, Troy, round 31."
28:50,360;28:52,760;"Dude, Randy Moss."
28:52,760;28:55,920;"He's three years."
28:55,920;28:57,520;"He's got 50 touchdowns."
28:58,520;28:59,520;"Yes."
28:59,520;29:00,520;"51."
29:00,520;29:01,520;"Insane."
29:01,520;29:05,280;"So we're counting all touchdowns, not just"
29:05,280;29:06,280;"Republicans."
29:06,280;29:07,280;"And playoffs."
29:07,280;29:08,280;"And playoffs."
29:08,280;29:09,280;"Yep."
29:09,280;29:12,960;"It's Stanley Morgan, 67."
29:12,960;29:18,640;"I've just gone back from 2000 for the Brady Bell check era."
29:18,640;29:19,640;"Dude."
29:19,640;29:22,680;"Greg, how many like pun return touchdowns do they all have?"
29:22,680;29:23,680;"Yeah."
29:23,680;29:24,840;"I'm talking."
29:24,840;29:26,640;"I'm talking to every touchdowns."
29:26,640;29:29,300;"Where is even on this list?"
29:29,300;29:29,800;"Yes."
29:29,800;29:31,040;"Because you think like if you--"
29:31,040;29:32,040;"Oh, all right."
29:32,040;29:34,400;"--if you can try to point factor against special teams."
29:34,400;29:37,880;"So all touchdowns, just like that they had something"
29:37,880;29:44,360;"to do with, be it run, pass, catch, punt return, kick return."
29:44,360;29:45,360;"What were--"
29:45,360;29:48,880;"which order was your list, Greg?"
29:48,880;29:50,840;"Welker, Edelman, Brown."
29:50,840;29:53,240;"OK."
29:53,240;29:55,360;"In terms of all touchdowns, how would you put them?"
29:55,360;30:03,560;"Brown, Edelman Walker. Greg. Saint. Edelman,"
30:03,560;30:06,720;"Welker Brown. Really?"
30:06,720;30:09,820;"Edelman has 47 touchdowns. He's"
30:09,820;30:12,560;"30. Yeah. Are you through a couple?"
30:12,560;30:14,200;"You through a couple. He's got some"
30:14,200;30:15,640;"punt return ones as well. Yeah."
30:15,640;30:18,600;"I'll throw in counts. Yeah. I'll"
30:18,600;30:20,560;"touch down. Oh, all right."
30:20,560;30:23,880;"Welker has 41. Troy Brown has 28."
30:23,880;30:28,080;"Dude this says Gino capoletty has 42"
30:28,080;30:31,340;"He's a kicker. What's that kicker slash?"
30:31,340;30:40,100;"This is TD receptions the list I'm looking at wow"
30:40,100;30:47,240;"I mean that's impressive Gino capoletty. I'm to put eat your heart out"
30:47,240;30:51,080;"This can't be right"
30:51,080;30:53,640;"receiving in Russian"
30:53,640;31:01,380;"Damn yeah. Yeah. Apparently you got you got as many as 50 passes in a season."
31:01,380;31:06,500;"God damn it. I didn't know that at all. Oh, I thought there's just a kicker."
31:06,500;31:13,060;"He's in the Hall of Fame for kicking, right? I thought so. That's that trick."
31:13,060;31:20,160;"Yeah, you tell us. I don't know what loose you're looking at. Do you have to? I mean,"
31:20,160;31:22,160;"I guess you do have to have a position, right?"
31:22,160;31:25,440;"- Yeah, oh, you have that position."
31:25,440;31:28,280;"- Dude, what a beast."
31:28,280;31:29,120;"- Right?"
31:29,120;31:32,920;"- I just loved him from his, the commentation on the radio."
31:32,920;31:34,960;"- Ooh, speaking of great commentation,"
31:34,960;31:37,760;"what did you think of when one asked the other,"
31:37,760;31:39,160;"please, no more tickling?"
31:39,160;31:42,520;"- They were talking about their tickle fight, Andy?"
31:42,520;31:43,360;"I thought of you."
31:43,360;31:44,680;"- It didn't tickle the line"
31:44,680;31:46,600;"because there's no tickling in football."
31:46,600;31:48,400;"- Yeah, but then they talked about tickling"
31:48,400;31:49,880;"for like five minutes."
31:49,880;31:52,660;"- Yeah, oh yeah, that was a lot of tickling talk."
31:52,660;31:56,800;"- Tick tock, that's how tick tock got started."
31:56,800;31:59,520;"It was actually just videos of people tickling each other."
31:59,520;32:00,840;"(laughing)"
32:00,840;32:02,000;"- I'm gonna talk about it."
32:02,000;32:04,680;"- Yeah, and then discussing afterwards."
32:04,680;32:06,440;"- Also on the broadcast, they're like,"
32:06,440;32:09,280;"what is the most heated rival?"
32:09,280;32:13,080;"Dolphins jets, bills dolphins, brown Steelers,"
32:13,080;32:17,000;"cheese raiders, Broncos raiders, Broncos chiefs."
32:17,000;32:18,200;"- What was the answer?"
32:18,200;32:21,200;"I don't, it was like a, you will calm pole. Yeah."
32:21,200;32:24,160;"I think the answer is none of the above."
32:24,160;32:29,160;"I mean, they're all terrible now. Maybe. Yeah, maybe."
32:29,160;32:31,640;"Now back in the day, probably. Yeah. I don't know."
32:31,640;32:34,760;"Well, even like, if you look at this through today's lens,"
32:34,760;32:39,640;"dolphins jets, no bills dolphins, no brown Steelers, no"
32:39,640;32:43,520;"cheese traders, not really Broncos Raiders. No,"
32:43,520;32:46,280;"Broncos cheese has got to be one of the cheese ones."
32:46,480;32:48,040;"Yeah, it's got to be it, I guess."
32:48,040;32:50,400;"You know, Geno Capital at these positions."
32:50,400;32:56,640;"Yeah. Uh, FL SE flanker split end."
32:56,640;32:57,760;"Split end. Yeah."
32:57,760;32:59,760;"Defensive back wide receiver kicker."
32:59,760;33:01,400;"Damn."
33:01,400;33:04,520;"Dude, I need, I need footage of Geno."
33:04,520;33:07,920;"I think we may have to do an episode on Geno Capitality."
33:07,920;33:10,080;"And his nickname was Duke."
33:10,080;33:11,880;"Love that."
33:11,880;33:12,720;"Duke."
33:12,720;33:13,480;"Hell yeah."
33:13,480;33:15,440;"That is such a 60s nickname."
33:15,640;33:17,640;"Hmm a"
33:17,640;33:19,640;"Duke cap already, you know"
33:19,640;33:24,200;"It's my 60s character"
33:24,200;33:35,720;"Position you play do guy, you know flanker split end let it"
33:35,720;33:39,360;"Do you think he he played with Bucko kill Roy? Oh"
33:41,040;33:45,520;"Buck I bet they didn't get along there's smoking cigarettes on the sidelines"
33:45,520;33:50,720;"Buckle was dirty. Yeah, it just hammer. It doesn't strike me as a dirty kind of guy"
33:50,720;33:57,880;"Stand up dude. That's what I'm saying. I bet he's got some skeletons in his closet. It's the six"
33:57,880;34:03,200;"I bet he played the game the right way. You just you can just feel from the way I'm gonna stay I checked that"
34:03,200;34:11,020;"Think you are I'm gonna put a genome capilletti controversy into the Google.com machine. Okay, that's not"
34:11,020;34:13,140;"I don't even go down that hole even if it exists."
34:13,140;34:13,980;"- Oh."
34:13,980;34:16,380;"- Let's talk about this game."
34:16,380;34:17,900;"- Speaking of the ram."
34:17,900;34:21,020;"- I, because it's speaking of alls."
34:21,020;34:25,660;"- I am a little disappointed that Mike didn't get to be here"
34:25,660;34:29,140;"for the Dan Dudorf, Dickenburg era."
34:29,140;34:32,420;"Because even I could get the football, not football in this."
34:32,420;34:34,260;"And so."
34:34,260;34:35,300;"- See you, see it?"
34:35,300;34:36,980;"- Yeah, so I've got just a couple."
34:38,100;34:41,180;"But there's one where they were talking about,"
34:41,180;34:44,540;"Tabaki Jones from his safety spot was pounding the whole way."
34:44,540;34:47,140;"And I'm not sure that's grammatically correct,"
34:47,140;34:48,780;"but what is he doing?"
34:48,780;34:52,280;"- I just said he's pounding the whole way."
34:52,280;34:54,380;"- Yeah, that's how you squirt through the whole way."
34:54,380;34:58,040;"- Wait, wait, pounding the whole way?"
34:58,040;35:00,420;"- No, pounding the whole way."
35:00,420;35:02,460;"- That's how you squirt through the whole, Andy?"
35:02,460;35:04,040;"- Because I think you got the sack"
35:04,040;35:05,580;"and so you're pounding the end."
35:05,580;35:08,460;"to the quarterback."
35:08,460;35:10,700;"So pounding the entire way."
35:10,700;35:11,700;"Yeah, no."
35:11,700;35:17,260;"How guys in the sense you that that's how you squirt through the hole."
35:17,260;35:20,700;"Pounding you pound the whole way squirt through the hole."
35:20,700;35:22,540;"I mean, he did. He scored through the hole and got the sack."
35:22,540;35:25,340;"I think and the force interception action."
35:25,340;35:30,380;"And then I don't know who it was, but somebody was smacked by three chiefs,"
35:30,380;35:33,420;"which I didn't think you could show on TV."
35:35,020;35:39,580;"Smacked by three chiefs. Yeah, I just smacked by three chiefs"
35:39,580;35:44,220;"Why is that why is that an innuendo?"
35:44,220;35:53,020;"How sick of that too. It's if I have to explain it to you. I mean they didn't say spanked. They said smacked"
35:53,020;35:57,340;"Well, what were you when you got in spanked as a child? What was that called?"
35:57,340;36:00,700;"Yeah, but that's like uh"
36:00,700;36:03,180;"I think that's like a our family thing"
36:04,300;36:05,740;"I don't know if it is."
36:05,740;36:10,300;"Smack to me means you could like slap in the face."
36:10,300;36:12,300;"You want me to Google smack?"
36:12,300;36:15,420;"That check smack."
36:15,420;36:16,860;"See if it has..."
36:16,860;36:19,100;"Now you can go with butt spankings?"
36:19,100;36:20,620;"You can smack your kid around, right?"
36:20,620;36:23,340;"You can smack anybody around, really."
36:23,340;36:26,700;"The, you see it in a sentence?"
36:26,700;36:29,820;"They say she gave Mark a smack across the face."
36:29,820;36:30,780;"Oh, you want to hear another one?"
36:30,780;36:32,940;"Jessica smacked his face quite hard."
36:32,940;36:39,440;"I ran smack into the back of a part. Okay. None of this has to do with spanking"
36:39,440;36:45,820;"video. I think you're looking it up on the wrong website. It's Google.com, man. If I had"
36:45,820;36:53,400;"rest my case. We want to ask Jeeves about smack slash spanking. Urban dictionary is"
36:53,400;36:58,040;"the real. Oh, there you go. No, what was it? What was the other one? Urban, the"
36:58,040;37:02,400;"The Saurus yeah, yeah. Oh here we go. That's good. We could if"
37:02,400;37:08,720;"The wiki diff like once the difference and I have spank versus smack"
37:08,720;37:20,120;"As as verbs the difference between spank and smack is that spank is to beat smack or slap a person's buttocks"
37:26,920;37:30,000;"or other object as punishment."
37:30,000;37:31,560;"- It's very regular."
37:31,560;37:35,600;"- As punishment gesture or a form of sexual interaction."
37:35,600;37:39,260;"- Well, I'm gonna say that's football then."
37:39,260;37:40,440;"I think we cleared this up."
37:40,440;37:41,280;"(laughing)"
37:41,280;37:42,520;"- I think so too."
37:42,520;37:43,800;"- That's football."
37:43,800;37:46,120;"- If those three chiefs had spanked him, then--"
37:46,120;37:49,040;"(laughing)"
37:49,040;37:50,400;"- Oh boy."
37:50,400;37:52,740;"- All right, so then this is similar,"
37:52,740;37:54,800;"but I don't know if this will create the same controversy"
37:54,800;37:56,600;"'cause it said-- - Wekehiv.com."
37:56,600;37:58,200;"Well, they both took wax."
37:58,200;38:06,680;"That one's not in UNDO either."
38:06,680;38:08,360;"Google wax, would you?"
38:08,360;38:09,520;"Wax?"
38:09,520;38:10,020;"OK."
38:10,020;38:12,520;"We're just googling random verbs."
38:12,520;38:13,720;"I'm with Greg on this one."
38:13,720;38:16,600;"That is not in UNDO either, Andy."
38:16,600;38:18,540;"It didn't tickle the line because there's"
38:18,540;38:19,440;"no tickling in football."
38:19,440;38:21,800;"Yes, that one."
38:21,800;38:22,800;"Tickling."
38:22,800;38:23,400;"Yeah."
38:23,400;38:25,080;"You're only tickling."
38:25,080;38:26,720;"Well, I guess you could take a little child."
38:26,720;38:30,680;"Let's not go down that path, though."
38:30,680;38:32,680;"What about what was tickling the line mean?"
38:32,680;38:36,160;"You know, tickler, just a good, good, good."
38:36,160;38:37,360;"All right."
38:37,360;38:38,200;"Back to the game."
38:38,200;38:40,800;"All right, doctor, you're going to start opening it up, right?"
38:40,800;38:42,960;"They Daniel Graham's first touchdown."
38:42,960;38:45,240;"Was one handed snag."
38:45,240;38:48,160;"Did actually, and this was good commentating on their part."
38:48,160;38:50,760;"He saw he said, oh, you only use one hand on that catch."
38:50,760;38:54,080;"And then on the replay, you can see that he's literally left hand"
38:54,080;39:00,840;"Snags it and secures it without even using his other hand. That's true and he looked pretty fast like he outran a corner back to the end zone"
39:00,840;39:02,560;"Yep"
39:02,560;39:04,560;"Yeah, he looked like what I think"
39:04,560;39:14,200;"That he was supposed to be the bank coach replacement. Yeah, you had then was big fast dude with hands. We force a fumble Victor Green"
39:14,200;39:17,400;"Rips it out of a pre-sombs. I think"
39:17,400;39:22,580;"Yeah, pre-sombs had a big run to like 17 18 yards and then Pat would turn that"
39:23,600;39:26,380;"Bad Brady kind of threw up behind him"
39:26,380;39:31,020;"But Patton one handed it as well and use that pivot turn and just gone for the touchdown"
39:31,020;39:33,860;"Yeah, that was a great catch at that point Brady"
39:33,860;39:39,420;"Excluding like his slow start was 27 for 36 for TDs and 312"
39:39,420;39:44,320;"In 2002 which is like insane, right? Yeah, yeah, I have enough"
39:44,320;39:49,540;"I was like how the fuck do we miss a playoffs? We're looking like an absolute wagon. Yeah"
39:49,540;39:52,660;"Except on offense anyway"
39:52,660;39:54,660;"Yeah, I"
39:54,660;40:00,340;"Connor kind of made a point earlier this year about like like Brady announcing like"
40:00,340;40:04,260;"He's here and like these three games"
40:04,260;40:09,300;"This is like last year was like okay Brady's like a game manager"
40:09,300;40:14,220;"Right like he's he makes big plays and big moments, but he's not put up crazy stats like these three games"
40:14,220;40:19,720;"He is slinging all over the way you have 400 plus yards in this game for touch"
40:19,720;40:21,480;"And I was like, for 10."
40:21,480;40:21,680;"Yeah."
40:21,680;40:24,360;"And with this, which was at the time"
40:24,360;40:26,800;"was the sixth highest in Patriots history."
40:26,800;40:27,300;"Yeah."
40:27,300;40:32,040;"So this is where, like to me, Brady, like anybody can be a Joe"
40:32,040;40:34,560;"Flacko won a Super Bowl, right?"
40:34,560;40:35,060;"Yeah."
40:35,060;40:38,360;"Eli Manning's done it twice where he goes on a hot streak"
40:38,360;40:38,960;"and rides it."
40:38,960;40:41,800;"But who is he a Baltimore?"
40:41,800;40:42,880;"Joe Flacko."
40:42,880;40:45,120;"No, the other one."
40:45,120;40:46,040;"What do you mean?"
40:46,040;40:47,840;"What is that?"
40:47,840;40:49,600;"Isn't it shots fired?"
40:49,600;40:52,640;"It's kind of bolder Trento for you."
40:52,640;40:53,840;"Yeah, Trento for a moment."
40:53,840;40:54,640;"He went with."
40:54,640;40:56,680;"Rich Ganon's got one, right?"
40:56,680;40:59,240;"Rich Ganon is good, though."
40:59,240;41:01,600;"Rex Grossman went to a Super Bowl with the Bears."
41:01,600;41:02,440;"Yeah, exactly."
41:02,440;41:03,440;"Yeah."
41:03,440;41:06,840;"But yeah, this is this is Brady come out showing that it wasn't just."
41:06,840;41:08,000;"Yeah."
41:08,000;41:13,440;"And that's the difference Brady Brady wins the Super Bowl, and then he puts in more work in the off season."
41:13,440;41:15,040;"Oh, I think which I have."
41:15,040;41:16,440;"I have a clip for that."
41:17,080;41:19,780;"Look at me. I've learned a new trick."
41:19,780;41:21,480;"Can you tell? Yeah, I like it."
41:21,480;41:25,080;"So this is actually I hate it again."
41:25,080;41:26,080;"This is a lot."
41:26,080;41:28,780;"I thought the lot I'm in."
41:28,780;41:36,480;"This is our girl Bonnie talking about Brady work on us because remember last week we didn't know about Brady's play action."
41:36,480;41:37,780;"Ooga."
41:37,780;41:42,580;"All right. Well, Dick, play action has become so much a part of the Patriots offense."
41:42,580;41:45,680;"And Tom Brady's really worked on the fakes in the off season."
41:45,680;41:47,360;"and he watched a lot of film of the great ones."
41:47,360;41:49,660;"Brett Farr, Peyton Manning, he mentioned Elvis Gruback,"
41:49,660;41:51,520;"and he said, ""The key is really consistency."
41:51,520;41:54,240;"If you watch quarterbacks, a lot of times they'll rush"
41:54,240;41:55,800;"to their hand-off point and then slow down"
41:55,800;41:57,760;"and do just the opposite when they fake."""
41:57,760;41:59,800;"Said defenses will definitely pick up on that."
41:59,800;42:01,440;"So you always have to keep what you're doing"
42:01,440;42:02,640;"exactly the same."
42:02,640;42:07,040;"- And Elvis Gruback does not fit."
42:07,040;42:08,760;"- Yeah, did she say Gruback in there?"
42:08,760;42:09,680;"- Yeah, yeah."
42:09,680;42:12,680;"She's just like, ""Oh, here's some two very highly-read"
42:12,680;42:14,080;"Hall of Fame writers."""
42:14,080;42:15,340;"I thought I misheard that."
42:15,340;42:17,200;"Like Gerbach."
42:17,200;42:20,260;"That name forever."
42:20,260;42:22,620;"And maybe he's really good play action."
42:22,620;42:24,340;"It's a great name."
42:24,340;42:26,580;"Here's, I think the real thing that makes pretty great."
42:26,580;42:28,060;"Like, I don't know."
42:28,060;42:30,060;"I don't remember this season at all."
42:30,060;42:32,280;"And, um, but I know the end result."
42:32,280;42:34,940;"Of that missing the plan."
42:34,940;42:40,140;"So he's got to fall off, but then in 2002 or 2003, he comes back even more"
42:40,140;42:40,980;"with a vengeance."
42:42,180;42:45,900;"Like to have that peak of Super Bowl start this year, the way this has."
42:45,900;42:49,700;"I don't remember this year being so awesome where three games or three and"
42:49,700;42:51,780;"oh, they're absolutely lighting people up."
42:51,780;42:53,380;"Their offense looks unstoppable."
42:53,380;42:57,460;"Their defense looks just as good as last year and then to have it all fall apart."
42:57,460;43:01,780;"And then to come back the next year and rattle off two more Super Bowl wins."
43:01,780;43:03,660;"That's what really makes pretty great."
43:03,660;43:04,780;"Yeah."
43:04,780;43:12,060;"And I think that even this year, I think, yeah, Brady led this, the, the NFL"
43:12,060;43:17,980;"touchdown. He did indeed with 28. So it's not like it was like, but I mean, back then,"
43:17,980;43:23,020;"I think that was like a reasonable amount of touchdowns to leave the league with."
43:23,020;43:31,180;"Yeah. And I mean, Stephen's saying the defense is as good as last year, but I think you're starting"
43:31,180;43:38,060;"to see cracks here. Like, look at Priest Holmes at an absolutely monster game. So I mean, yeah,"
43:38,060;43:43,340;"So let's talk about Priest on because I remember him being good, but I don't remember why."
43:43,340;43:46,340;"But apparently he led the league in a year before."
43:46,340;43:47,060;"Yeah."
43:47,060;43:49,940;"And and he was like the they were talking about it."
43:49,940;43:50,980;"The commentator talking about it."
43:50,980;43:57,420;"It was the first guy in like 20 years to lead the league in rushing when he was a free"
43:57,420;43:58,420;"agent the year before."
43:58,420;44:04,900;"So the chiefs actually had signed him prior to the 2001 season."
44:05,980;44:10,460;"And actually the Patriots were looking at him as well, but they they went on to one Smith because he was cheaper. I think"
44:10,460;44:20,700;"No, he couldn't have been cheaper doesn't sound right does it pretty songs as a nobody before he got to he's undrafted out of taxes"
44:20,700;44:27,580;"Didn't he he played for the the Ravens right before yeah for for two years, but he didn't put up really any numbers"
44:27,580;44:31,180;"I think he's still pretty highly touted though because"
44:32,140;44:35,900;"Who else was there? It wasn't Jamal Anderson at the time who was just like light and"
44:35,900;44:37,820;"league on fire and Priest Holmes is backing him up."
44:37,820;44:44,140;"I mean, maybe. I mean, he's got a decent average per carry, but I mean,"
44:44,140;44:48,540;"yeah, I think it was one of those like backup running backs that everybody fell in love with,"
44:48,540;44:51,020;"you know, and so there was a bit of a bidding market for him."
44:51,020;44:52,620;"Who's the equivalent right now?"
44:52,620;44:58,060;"It's probably a billy of, because everybody has like three running backs."
44:58,060;44:59,260;"Yeah, well, they don't."
44:59,260;45:09,420;"who was the running back for the the Ravens backup that everybody loved. I don't remember who it was."
45:09,420;45:19,340;"Yeah, he put up a three year span here in Kansas City where he's like the best running back in"
45:19,340;45:24,940;"the league. Yeah, and this was right in the midst of that. I think how many yards he's run for this"
45:24,940;45:33,660;"season was like 1600 or something ridiculous. Yeah, 1615 with another like almost 700 receiving"
45:33,660;45:38,540;"yards. Yeah, he basically was the offense of this team. And the coaches knew that going"
45:38,540;45:41,500;"in, they knew what they're getting themselves into and they still couldn't fucking stop it."
45:41,500;45:47,100;"Cause yeah, 24 touchdowns. He would, and then the next year he would set an NFL record with"
45:47,100;45:52,780;"27 touchdowns, which has, has been, has been broken like four times since then, but still,"
45:53,340;46:01,500;"But at the right. Yeah. Yeah. I always confused LT and pre-somes, but I really don't know why."
46:01,500;46:07,420;"Maybe because they both like didn't LT break that not long after. Yeah, I was like the next year."
46:07,420;46:12,460;"And then some who broke it the year after, I think. Yeah. But I always I used to always get him"
46:12,460;46:20,140;"in Jamal Lewis mixed up. I used to get him and didn't the Chiefs have another Larry Johnson"
46:20,140;46:24,460;"course maybe. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah, it was very"
46:24,460;46:27,820;"gentle. That's right. From Penn State. Yeah. Yeah. And they"
46:27,820;46:30,700;"were like kind of similar running running back styles and"
46:30,700;46:33,060;"they're the workhorse of the team and everything ran through"
46:33,060;46:37,060;"them. Yeah. Kind of like that era of of chief football"
46:37,060;46:41,700;"felt like his songs went undrafted, right? He did. Yeah. I"
46:41,700;46:44,700;"think it's because he was back in up Ricky Williams, right? Is"
46:44,700;46:47,060;"that what you're saying, Steve? Yeah, they were playing at"
46:47,060;46:50,760;"Texas together, but it was like their times weren't that crossed."
46:50,760;46:55,440;"And there's like a one year gap in priest homes, like stats at Texas."
46:55,440;46:56,800;"I have no idea what happened there, but."
46:56,800;47:03,120;"Oh, you know, well, his name is, he's priests."
47:03,120;47:07,440;"So it's definitely not like, you know, touching kids or anything."
47:07,440;47:07,600;"Yeah."
47:07,600;47:13,040;"And I'm saying, you didn't go to Penn State."
47:13,040;47:13,840;"So we're good."
47:13,840;47:15,580;"- Hey, hi, hi."
47:15,580;47:17,840;"(laughing)"
47:17,840;47:23,720;"There was stuff, I don't know, maybe you gotta hurt."
47:23,720;47:25,320;"- What a backfield."
47:25,320;47:27,240;"- Right, Jesus."
47:27,240;47:30,280;"- And when you think about it, like Ricky Williams,"
47:30,280;47:33,120;"like there's that trade where the Saints traded"
47:33,120;47:35,200;"like their entire draft."
47:35,200;47:36,040;"- Oh, right, yeah."
47:36,040;47:37,400;"- For the take to get 'em."
47:37,400;47:42,400;"And then the pre-sombs goes undrafted and career-wise,"
47:42,440;47:45,280;"got to say Priest Holmes has a better career than Ricky Williams."
47:45,280;47:48,440;"Yeah, is that true?"
47:48,440;47:51,800;"He said the touchdown record."
47:51,800;47:54,000;"Like Ricky Williams never even sniffed it."
47:54,000;47:57,360;"I mean, Ricky was a stud for a few years."
47:57,360;47:59,240;"Yeah. He was, I don't know about a stud."
47:59,240;48:00,040;"He was good."
48:00,040;48:01,640;"And then he was like just crazy."
48:01,640;48:03,920;"I hadn't like traveled the world."
48:03,920;48:05,600;"Smoked, I loved him too."
48:05,600;48:07,840;"But yeah, like the songs."
48:07,840;48:11,880;"Have you ever heard about him negotiating his own contract?"
48:11,880;48:14,100;"- No."
48:14,100;48:18,740;"Or this actually goes in hand in hand with my deep dive,"
48:18,740;48:20,760;"but when you got drafted,"
48:20,760;48:25,600;"there was like the whole hip-hop and sports"
48:25,600;48:28,800;"were becoming like intermingled to a high degree."
48:28,800;48:31,240;"So all the rappers were wearing the jerseys backwards."
48:31,240;48:32,080;"Remember that?"
48:32,080;48:33,120;"- Oh, yeah."
48:33,120;48:34,800;"- And apparently like when you got drafted,"
48:34,800;48:38,800;"he like signed on with, I don't know,"
48:38,800;48:41,680;"one of the Southern rappers had like set up"
48:41,680;48:44,040;"their own agency, sports agency."
48:44,040;48:46,320;"And they were getting some pretty big names."
48:46,320;48:50,400;"And like the contract that they drafted for him was like,"
48:50,400;48:53,000;"like 98% incentive laden."
48:53,000;48:53,920;"(laughs)"
48:53,920;48:55,320;"And like the incentives were like,"
48:55,320;48:58,080;"he had to set like NFL records"
48:58,080;49:01,680;"for like four straight seasons to get to that benchmark."
49:01,680;49:04,480;"And he's like, ""Oh, betting on myself."""
49:04,480;49:06,440;"And I like lost millions and millions of dollars"
49:06,440;49:08,840;"in the process. (laughs)"
49:08,840;49:09,680;"- Where'd that go?"
49:09,680;49:10,520;"- Yeah."
49:10,520;49:11,720;"- Who are Ricky Williams?"
49:11,720;49:16,040;"- So you wanna hear my deep dive here?"
49:16,040;49:17,120;"- Yeah."
49:17,120;49:20,040;"- So whenever I hear the name Dante Hall,"
49:20,040;49:25,040;"I think of the little Wayne song from the drought three."
49:25,040;49:28,480;"I'm gonna read you the lyric right now."
49:28,480;49:29,320;"Remember he does the X--"
49:29,320;49:31,200;"- Can you rap us the lyric, please?"
49:31,200;49:35,200;"- I'm just gonna speak it."
49:35,200;49:37,480;"(laughing)"
49:37,480;49:38,680;"Come on."
49:38,680;49:44,340;"I'm just gonna speak of a member they called me X factor and he used to do the X thing"
49:44,340;49:48,080;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, so this is the line from little Wayne. I"
49:48,080;49:51,280;"Got a great idea. We should have sex"
49:51,280;49:55,440;"Pitch I'm like Dante Hall. I just throw up the X"
49:55,440;50:00,400;"Poetry"
50:00,400;50:04,440;"Took me a second realize that was the like like the truck"
50:05,400;50:13,080;"Like the socket X like X to see yes, who used to do the socket X in the rest?"
50:13,080;50:18,440;"I know you're talking about they they ban that from the kickball field in my elementary school because everybody"
50:18,440;50:22,520;"Cross the play kickball to do the X"
50:22,520;50:30,400;"Those things like triple H or something like that. Yeah, you want to hear a couple other"
50:30,400;50:33,360;"lines from this song"
50:33,760;50:39,320;"Yeah, I mean, yeah, don't drink Kristall no more just poured on white bitches heads"
50:39,320;50:44,700;"Which actually has more context than you think apparently"
50:44,700;50:50,200;"The like the CEO of Kristall in an interview with the economist"
50:50,200;50:58,080;"They were asking about how rap culture had kind of adopted Kristall as like a sign of affluence and he basically said"
50:58,080;51:00,640;"Hey, you can't pick who drinks your beverage is you know"
51:00,640;51:04,200;"And they all took it as racist. So like Jay Z started"
51:04,200;51:10,400;"Like boycotting it. So this is Lil Wayne acknowledging that you know fuck you"
51:10,400;51:13,880;"I just pour it on white bitch's heads now. It's just kind of awesome"
51:13,880;51:20,280;"Which I never knew when I listen to the song. I just thought it was kind of funny, but it's pretty badass too"
51:20,280;51:22,280;"I thought you're pretty good. Yeah"
51:22,280;51:26,880;"Is another line if you don't like it"
51:28,360;51:30,680;"Ninja fuck you with an AIDS dick"
51:30,680;51:36,120;"It's like come on"
51:36,120;51:39,160;"Mr. Wayne is there a back sort of that one?"
51:39,160;51:43,800;"I like the self-censoring too by the way. Yeah, I'm not that yes"
51:43,800;51:48,440;"Yeah, uh, which also reminded me of my favorite rap quote ever"
51:48,440;51:53,880;"from uh dr. Dre forgot about Dre if y'all don't like me blow me"
51:55,880;51:59,760;"Which is which is just the best and I say it to Kelly all the time"
51:59,760;52:03,320;"Y'all don't like me blow me"
52:03,320;52:10,280;"So then from there I started thinking for Christmas the gift of the curse"
52:10,280;52:15,520;"So I started looking into like hey when it is like did"
52:15,520;52:21,200;"How much did Tom Brady enter like the hip-hop culture right?"
52:21,360;52:25,340;"So if they're grabbing on Dante Hall and like Tom Brady is like"
52:25,340;52:27,820;"perennial MVP"
52:27,820;52:34,700;"Like he's got to be in there at some point right and apparently the first time little Wayne mentioned mentions him is in 2011"
52:34,700;52:40,240;"For a while long time. Yeah, the song Gucci Gucci my life. It's like a movie"
52:40,240;52:44,420;"I got a leading lady my rooftop drop back like Tom Brady"
52:44,420;52:48,440;"Which is a pretty sweet line. Yeah, so that's 2011"
52:49,360;52:53,700;"11 yeah, that seems way late. It's the first time little Wayne mentions him"
52:53,700;52:58,200;"Yeah, so I know I thought so too"
52:58,200;53:04,360;"My favorite was a Rick Ross song. It's actually Walle who says it"
53:04,360;53:07,800;"He and this quote is"
53:07,800;53:15,660;"Out of this third rock ninja air it out. I'm on my Tom Brady. Y'all ninjas is Eric Crouch"
53:15,660;53:17,660;"- That's a great approach."
53:17,660;53:20,100;"(laughing)"
53:20,100;53:21,460;"- Eric Crouch, dude."
53:21,460;53:22,300;"- That's brilliant."
53:22,300;53:23,300;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:23,300;53:25,500;"- Is Eric Crouch the widest quarterback"
53:25,500;53:27,140;"to ever be mentioned in a rap song?"
53:27,140;53:29,180;"- He's gotta be up there."
53:29,180;53:30,100;"- Yeah, yeah."
53:30,100;53:32,700;"- I don't know, is there a brand in a weed in one?"
53:32,700;53:34,420;"(laughing)"
53:34,420;53:37,300;"- I mean, I feel like weed would actually be a good word"
53:37,300;53:38,660;"to fit into a rap song."
53:38,660;53:40,180;"- Definitely."
53:40,180;53:43,420;"- There's a little Kim one too, but it's just so bad."
53:43,420;53:44,260;"- We can't say that."
53:44,260;53:45,080;"- The not- - I'm not."
53:45,080;53:45,920;"- I'm not gonna ever crack."
53:45,920;53:46,760;"- I'm a writer."
53:46,760;53:48,420;"All right, this is from 2019,"
53:48,420;53:50,580;"Little Kim's song, Too Bad."
53:50,580;53:51,420;"- Oh dear."
53:51,420;53:54,100;"- I'm gonna shake it on him,"
53:54,100;53:56,540;"shake it all around like a hula hoop,"
53:56,540;53:59,380;"and now he wanna take me to Hawaii,"
53:59,380;54:02,180;"and you know I'ma go, go and get it."
54:02,180;54:05,040;"Tom Brady, I'ma throw it, throw it back."
54:05,040;54:07,060;"- What?"
54:07,060;54:08,860;"- Poetry."
54:08,860;54:10,780;"(laughing)"
54:10,780;54:12,580;"From Little Kim."
54:12,580;54:17,540;"I believe she's talking about her hips during quite a."
54:17,540;54:19,260;"Okay."
54:19,260;54:22,700;"Well, we'd explain the whole, you know, certain position."
54:22,700;54:23,260;"Yeah."
54:23,260;54:25,060;"Yeah, throwing it back."
54:25,060;54:25,740;"Yeah."
54:25,740;54:28,180;"But this Tom Brady even throw it back."
54:28,180;54:29,180;"He throws it forward."
54:29,180;54:31,060;"Yeah."
54:31,060;54:33,780;"But what is Hawaii have to do with anything?"
54:33,780;54:35,180;"The pro-ball idiot."
54:35,180;54:39,060;"It's not in Hawaii anymore."
54:39,060;54:40,900;"In Orlando."
54:41,260;54:43,060;"He want to take me to Orlando."
54:43,060;54:45,820;"That's the best."
54:45,820;54:47,020;"That's the best."
54:47,020;54:50,940;"But he but he made the but he made the Super Bowl."
54:50,940;54:52,260;"So he canceled on me."
54:52,260;54:54,300;"Here it is."
54:54,300;54:56,260;"All right."
54:56,260;54:57,060;"That's all I had."
54:57,060;55:04,180;"I thought that steep dive was going to be about Dante Hall, but it took a real strange turn."
55:04,180;55:04,780;"Yeah."
55:04,780;55:05,140;"Yeah."
55:05,140;55:07,060;"It was sick, but like."
55:07,060;55:09,980;"He wasn't like a great receiver."
55:10,180;55:15,240;"Yeah, it's first catch behind beyond the line of scrimmage in like the fourth quarter or the very end when"
55:15,240;55:22,540;"Chiefs are making it a game. Yep. And that Tony Gonzalez snag was also"
55:22,540;55:30,180;"One of the game. Yeah, but it was on tile law. He was not open and he just pulled it out"
55:30,180;55:38,140;"Yeah, the bad wrist or something like you had a yeah, they kept talking and talking about it. Yeah too too much whacking right Andy"
55:38,140;55:47,260;"right. Yeah. Smell me. I would say Dante Hall, Steven, to your point, reminding me a"
55:47,260;55:52,540;"lot of Devin Hester. I think he's shiftier than Devin Hester. Well, just in terms of"
55:52,540;55:58,980;"like Devin Hester was an incredible kick returner. Yeah, the role I'm trying so hard to make"
55:58,980;56:05,660;"him wide receiver. He just couldn't just couldn't. And it felt like Dante Hall is that similar"
56:05,660;56:09,700;"guy like they did a couple of endarounds or reverses with him just to get the ball"
56:09,700;56:15,420;"in his hands. And one of them he was electric but he is he had like a couple of punt returns"
56:15,420;56:20,660;"or kick returns that were pretty damn good in this game. But having said that in this"
56:20,660;56:25,700;"game specifically I thought Dion branch almost matched him kick return for kick return because"
56:25,700;56:29,620;"there was a lot of them this game. The damn branch is a sick kick returner. I didn't even"
56:29,620;56:34,460;"remember him returning kicks. Yeah I mean he's averaging like 30 yards a kick return in this"
56:34,460;56:39,380;"game. They were fantastic. His first two were 34 and 53 yards."
56:39,380;56:44,180;"This is what I'm starting from. Yeah. Yeah. He was great. I just"
56:44,180;56:46,740;"don't remember. And this is like his rookie season. And they"
56:46,740;56:50,220;"keep talking about how polite he is. This is, I think two games"
56:50,220;56:52,980;"in a row. They've talked about it where he starts, he starts"
56:52,980;56:55,300;"every sentence with yes, sir. Or yes, ma'am."
56:55,300;56:58,020;"Yeah, that's a that's a white commentator thing to say."
56:58,020;57:03,780;"Like, I'll tell you what, you have to call mam and ages."
57:03,860;57:04,860;"Yeah."
57:04,860;57:08,420;"It wears a belt and he doesn't even sack his parents."
57:08,420;57:12,100;"It's so polite."
57:12,100;57:15,780;"That idea."
57:15,780;57:17,020;"Go on, Greg."
57:17,020;57:18,460;"I was going to say, can you?"
57:18,460;57:24,060;"I think Dante Hall might be the shiftiest player that I can think of just off the top of my head."
57:24,060;57:25,180;"I mean, Reggie Bush."
57:25,180;57:32,340;"And what when he was at USC was like impossible to put a hand on, but beyond that."
57:32,340;57:33,540;"One name."
57:33,540;57:43,700;"All right, let me hear Barry Sanders. Hmm. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's the very sounds I can think that would be that's a good point. Yeah. But yeah, no, he's he's in that"
57:43,700;57:50,420;"in that yeah, I mean, he's not obviously not as good as a football player and like not as productive as some of those other guys but"
57:50,420;57:56,900;"Just from a pure like get the ball in his hands and that one that you watched the highlight video of Mandy"
57:57,460;58:00,340;"The one entitled Human Joystick absolutely."
58:00,340;58:03,900;"Yeah, where he runs like back like 16 yards and then like, yeah."
58:03,900;58:07,140;"Oh, well, he like gets a, a project."
58:07,140;58:11,500;"He catches the punter like the four yard line and goes backwards a couple yards"
58:11,500;58:14,020;"to the end zone and then still managed to return it for touchdowns somehow."
58:14,020;58:14,860;"Yeah."
58:14,860;58:15,900;"Why are you even catching that?"
58:15,900;58:16,500;"He's like, yeah, fuck it."
58:16,500;58:17,380;"Yeah."
58:17,380;58:18,900;"He was pretty good."
58:18,900;58:20,660;"Human highlight reel."
58:20,660;58:21,460;"It's like that."
58:21,460;58:23,980;"I see that running back to the paths picked up."
58:23,980;58:26,260;"I'm drafted guy."
58:26,500;58:29,740;"in the super short dude. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah."
58:29,740;58:33,980;"He's high like packages. He looks like he's going to be something fun to watch."
58:33,980;58:38,580;"Oh, really? I feel like I thought that about Dion Lewis when he first came here,"
58:38,580;58:40,820;"too. Yeah, and he was. He was electric."
58:40,820;58:42,700;"It was sick. Yeah."
58:42,700;58:45,820;"Lewis, break ankle like nobody. I loved it. Yeah."
58:45,820;58:48,580;"I loved Dion Lewis. I loved him. We'll get to it."
58:48,580;58:53,100;"I didn't obviously when I watched these games, I have no idea what's going to happen"
58:53,100;58:59,020;"because I don't remember the season and the Chiefs get to the one inch line."
58:59,020;58:59,900;"Right."
58:59,900;59:04,780;"There's like the receiver runs a curl, whatever, and stops one in short, like an idiot."
59:04,780;59:06,820;"And uh, and lower below."
59:06,820;59:07,740;"Yeah."
59:07,740;59:09,620;"Make sure he does not get it."
59:09,620;59:10,820;"I have a note here."
59:10,820;59:12,900;"Tell me they throw a slant and throw a pick."
59:12,900;59:16,260;"Like you have pre-somes in the backfield."
59:16,260;59:19,100;"Like he's like carried you drink green, like barely."
59:19,100;59:22,220;"You know, like he just broke a hundred yards on that fucking throw."
59:22,820;59:26,380;"to tell me and I was like, please tell me they're trying to throw it with green."
59:26,380;59:27,740;"But they don't."
59:27,740;59:29,820;"They just run it in like smart people do."
59:29,820;59:32,620;"Yeah, so it's not a Pete Carroll moment."
59:32,620;59:33,220;"This is a."
59:33,220;59:33,740;"No."
59:33,740;59:34,900;"Yeah."
59:34,900;59:36,100;"So the team and the OT."
59:36,100;59:41,420;"Yeah, the game really went down to third inches, three seconds left, one"
59:41,420;59:43,260;"play left and down by seven."
59:43,260;59:46,140;"And the Chiefs ran a priest's homes."
59:46,140;59:49,820;"Really write them into dove over the pile and almost didn't make it, but"
59:49,820;59:51,500;"managed to get there because."
59:52,500;59:58,020;"I think there was both Bruce Key and Fife were out for this game."
59:58,020;59:59,660;"So they were starting."
59:59,660;01:00:01,980;"No, sorry, starting."
01:00:01,980;01:00:04,980;"I think they're heavy packaged, what had Larry is."
01:00:04,980;01:00:08,020;"Yeah, I saw him in there."
01:00:08,020;01:00:09,020;"Way more."
01:00:09,020;01:00:13,380;"That's where they were for their lieback and core and they got gas for like a buck 80"
01:00:13,380;01:00:14,660;"by pre-somes in this game."
01:00:14,660;01:00:15,300;"Yeah."
01:00:15,300;01:00:19,300;"Yeah, the game was doing whatever he wanted on the ground."
01:00:19,300;01:00:19,820;"Yeah."
01:00:19,820;01:00:23,260;"I felt like he was averaging a first down every carry."
01:00:23,260;01:00:24,100;"- Yeah."
01:00:24,100;01:00:26,260;"- I don't think I saw a single negative play from him."
01:00:26,260;01:00:27,580;"When they thought they had him,"
01:00:27,580;01:00:29,500;"he would still get a couple yards."
01:00:29,500;01:00:31,140;"- Yeah, or at least get very crazy."
01:00:31,140;01:00:33,420;"- He was better than our member."
01:00:33,420;01:00:35,180;"I thought he was kind of like a powerback guy,"
01:00:35,180;01:00:37,660;"but he had some shiftiness to him too."
01:00:37,660;01:00:38,660;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:00:38,660;01:00:42,260;"- And he does that little like his end zone celebration"
01:00:42,260;01:00:44,500;"as he's going into the prop back memories."
01:00:44,500;01:00:46,260;"- Yeah, for sure."
01:00:46,260;01:00:48,700;"- Kind of reminded you of the tie law a little bit."
01:00:48,700;01:00:51,100;"Yeah. So that's a very Asian of that."
01:00:51,100;01:00:53,300;"I love a little bit of showmanship."
01:00:53,300;01:00:54,300;"Yeah."
01:00:54,300;01:00:56,300;"Of course, Dick Endberg on that last touchdown"
01:00:56,300;01:00:59,740;"says, ""Preach home scores and we're going to extra time."""
01:00:59,740;01:01:01,220;"And then Dan Deereau for a while,"
01:01:01,220;01:01:02,300;"people had to remind them that no,"
01:01:02,300;01:01:04,740;"they still had to keep the extra point."
01:01:04,740;01:01:07,220;"Back then it was pretty automatic, you know, whatever."
01:01:07,220;01:01:08,100;"Yeah."
01:01:08,100;01:01:09,340;"That's true."
01:01:09,340;01:01:13,300;"Especially with Morton Anderson and his 1970s face."
01:01:13,300;01:01:17,100;"I want you to commentate a game, Andy."
01:01:17,100;01:01:17,940;"All right."
01:01:17,940;01:01:24,660;"And then and then I'm referee another game and then I'm gonna sit through and watch the whole film"
01:01:24,660;01:01:27,660;"I've done"
01:01:27,660;01:01:31,140;"Hard football college fucking hard dude. Oh"
01:01:31,140;01:01:34,900;"Yeah, I have no problem referees except these ones"
01:01:34,900;01:01:40,260;"Except all of them"
01:01:40,260;01:01:44,560;"No, they're a blip. So you know how you always share the Patriots always get all the calls everything"
01:01:45,140;01:01:47,440;"Yeah, you can point him to this game because"
01:01:47,440;01:01:54,140;"There were 13 penalties called in this game and 12 more on the Patriots. Oh, maybe I made it more"
01:01:54,140;01:01:56,140;"One penalty for five yards. Maybe they did"
01:01:56,140;01:02:04,060;"But the Patriots did they bitch about it. Did they get off their game? No, they just went one the game anyway"
01:02:04,060;01:02:09,760;"Well, I mean think about that locker room bell check at halftime. They had nine in the first half"
01:02:09,760;01:02:13,780;"Game you know, so I had three more"
01:02:13,980;01:02:18,940;"He must have been so fucking mad about penalties because this wouldn't even a game if they were"
01:02:18,940;01:02:23,540;"saying selves in the foot in the first half. I don't know. I think I mean, I didn't watch the game"
01:02:23,540;01:02:27,080;"so I didn't see the penalties, but were they were they like they're driving me?"
01:02:27,080;01:02:29,260;"There's well, there's two kinds of penalties, right?"
01:02:29,260;01:02:31,700;"There's like aggression type penalties and then there's like"
01:02:31,700;01:02:33,540;"like"
01:02:33,540;01:02:41,660;"Off sides or like mental bone. Hey, holding I'm fine with passing appearances. I'm fine with that's just playing aggressive"
01:02:41,660;01:02:45,960;"You know, he was a perfect example Greg the end of the first half"
01:02:45,960;01:02:52,160;"The they pin him deep the cheese deep and they force the three and out and they punt it and it's like a crappy pond or whatever"
01:02:52,160;01:02:56,660;"And they get the ball at like the 45 on the offense and yeah"
01:02:56,660;01:02:59,860;"And the cheese 45 and then immediately fall start"
01:02:59,860;01:03:04,820;"Yeah, I was 50 and like they only have like one time no time out so never in like"
01:03:04,820;01:03:08,520;"Less than a minute in time to try and get a field goal through"
01:03:09,540;01:03:17,180;"So the ones that make those five yards are so key in that situation like all right offense get out there and boom"
01:03:17,180;01:03:19,180;"Fall start that's your ninth penalty of the half"
01:03:19,180;01:03:27,460;"It was not great now came in in opportune moments too like things to to keep drives live or you had like a really great"
01:03:27,460;01:03:28,700;"punts"
01:03:28,700;01:03:32,740;"To Dante Hall and you like you pinned them and then you had I"
01:03:32,740;01:03:38,860;"Think it was a legal man downfield on his oh and so they got their repunting kick it back to Dante Hall and"
01:03:39,180;01:03:43,660;"And he ended up with like an extra 20 yards of field position. Yeah, just stupid shit like that"
01:03:43,660;01:03:47,740;"And some of them were ticket tag. I think most of the calls were correct"
01:03:47,740;01:03:49,900;"I think in this game"
01:03:49,900;01:03:51,900;"They had two that were called"
01:03:51,900;01:03:57,340;"Where the gunners were or the like the punt team was blocking the gunners out of bounds"
01:03:57,340;01:03:59,340;"Like they pushed them out of bounds, but kept blocking them out of bounds"
01:03:59,340;01:04:05,340;"They caught two different guys. They're calling for that twice. Tyla was one of them. I think no, that's a terrible call"
01:04:06,460;01:04:09,060;"No, it's a legit college is the time to play."
01:04:09,060;01:04:10,660;"I'm sorry."
01:04:10,660;01:04:12,180;"Yeah, I think that's those sorts of"
01:04:12,180;01:04:15,020;"penalties you just never really see called, but there's two in this game."
01:04:15,020;01:04:16,140;"It's like, what are you guys doing?"
01:04:16,140;01:04:18,580;"Yes, assholes."
01:04:18,580;01:04:22,300;"Terrible referees in this one."
01:04:22,300;01:04:23,300;"All right, let's get to"
01:04:23,300;01:04:23,820;"all the time."
01:04:23,820;01:04:25,340;"I'm glad that we're time law."
01:04:25,340;01:04:27,420;"Thoughts."
01:04:27,420;01:04:29,420;"I strongly disagree."
01:04:29,420;01:04:34,700;"The rate the commentators disagreed about the original overtime rules for no one"
01:04:34,700;01:04:35,900;"gets a possession."
01:04:35,900;01:04:39,020;"Because that's won the toss."
01:04:39,020;01:04:40,820;"They take it down."
01:04:40,820;01:04:42,900;"There's a sick move by David Patton."
01:04:42,900;01:04:44,420;"Like they thought he was going out of bounds"
01:04:44,420;01:04:45,620;"and he cut it back inside."
01:04:45,620;01:04:47,820;"It got another like 15 yards."
01:04:47,820;01:04:48,780;"- Yeah, I think it was one of those plays"
01:04:48,780;01:04:50,580;"where it was supposed to be a run play."
01:04:50,580;01:04:52,220;"But Brady saw the Pat was uncovered."
01:04:52,220;01:04:54,540;"So he just like pulled the ball and chucked it to him quick."
01:04:54,540;01:04:56,780;"And Pat and took it for like 20 yards."
01:04:56,780;01:04:58,100;"- Yeah, that was a great play."
01:04:58,100;01:04:59,700;"- Yeah, it was fantastic."
01:04:59,700;01:05:04,460;"- And he gave him the old, hey, how are you too to that DB?"
01:05:04,460;01:05:05,300;"- Yeah, he did."
01:05:05,300;01:05:07,620;"look like he's gonna step out of bounds and cut it back in front of his face."
01:05:07,620;01:05:11,140;"Uh-huh. And he's like, ""Hey, you dropped, you dropped, you dropped strap, buddy."""
01:05:11,140;01:05:14,980;"Yeah. I'm sure he said that."
01:05:14,980;01:05:21,300;"Day in Doodor did have some thoughts about, um, about one more time."
01:05:21,300;01:05:24,500;"And we actually talked about this, uh, in the..."
01:05:24,500;01:05:26,340;"We got an audio. We got an audio."
01:05:26,340;01:05:27,700;"...it was called, ""Last Week."" Yeah."
01:05:27,700;01:05:29,700;"But this is, this is what he had to say in this game too."
01:05:29,700;01:05:31,460;"Six."
01:05:32,260;01:05:38,260;"Well this is a situation where maybe some people think well maybe we go ahead and try to kick the field goal on third down."
01:05:38,260;01:05:40,260;"I think you try to keep going."
01:05:40,260;01:05:43,260;"Even Adam Vennitary, it's not a certainty."
01:05:43,260;01:05:45,260;"I know that he hasn't missed this year."
01:05:45,260;01:05:47,260;"The guy is money in the bank."
01:05:47,260;01:05:51,260;"But a touchdown is better."
01:05:51,260;01:05:54,260;"A touchdown leaves no doubt."
01:05:54,260;01:06:00,260;"I actually get his point."
01:06:00,260;01:06:04,700;"So yeah, like the 25."
01:06:04,700;01:06:09,180;"He's talking about like avoiding a missed field goal or like a botched snap, right?"
01:06:09,180;01:06:11,780;"Cause that's why something would say go for kicking on third."
01:06:11,780;01:06:13,340;"But it's third and seven."
01:06:13,340;01:06:15,620;"Like I understand that aspect of it."
01:06:15,620;01:06:20,260;"It's third and seven from the chief's 20 odd line without a military."
01:06:20,260;01:06:21,620;"Oh, yeah."
01:06:21,620;01:06:24,940;"I mean, I don't agree with this statement, but I see what he's trying to say."
01:06:24,940;01:06:28,180;"Like when I first started, I thought he was just like, didn't understand that a"
01:06:28,180;01:06:29,060;"field goal wins it."
01:06:29,420;01:06:30,420;"You might not."
01:06:30,420;01:06:36,080;"I'm still not sure because as as they as he's talking, they're showing the stat on the screen"
01:06:36,080;01:06:40,360;"that says like they're showing at him in the terraces has 12 game winning field goals,"
01:06:40,360;01:06:42,320;"six of them in overtime."
01:06:42,320;01:06:45,760;"Like this is more automatic than scoring a touchdown."
01:06:45,760;01:06:47,160;"Yeah, but I touched down."
01:06:47,160;01:06:48,160;"There's no doubt."
01:06:48,160;01:06:51,200;"I'm like a field goal to have."
01:06:51,200;01:06:56,880;"Which have you considered that Andy?"
01:06:56,880;01:07:02,380;"the doubt factor failed to think of the doubt."
01:07:02,380;01:07:05,860;"Well, that's like is in the hall."
01:07:05,860;01:07:09,120;"Fuck you."
01:07:09,120;01:07:14,920;"Adam's field goal is a no doubt her."
01:07:14,920;01:07:16,520;"Oh, yeah."
01:07:16,520;01:07:17,500;"That was true."
01:07:17,500;01:07:19,780;"It would have been good in arena football."
01:07:19,780;01:07:20,820;"You split it right."
01:07:20,820;01:07:21,940;"Right down Broadway."
01:07:21,940;01:07:23,340;"Yeah."
01:07:23,340;01:07:24,980;"And that was all she wrote."
01:07:25,900;01:07:30,740;"Another big win and like you got to think that spirit is sore and high right now in New England."
01:07:30,740;01:07:38,100;"Yeah, it's when a Super Bowl you come back next year and your quarterback is even better and you're just shit stomping teams like."
01:07:38,100;01:07:38,260;"Yeah."
01:07:38,260;01:07:44,380;"And you're undefeated on the season three and again, it's like some pretty good teams too."
01:07:44,380;01:07:45,540;"Yeah, right."
01:07:45,540;01:07:46,540;"Right."
01:07:46,540;01:07:52,020;"So I think it's a good stop time to do some best and worst."
01:07:52,020;01:07:54,340;"Greg."
01:07:54,340;01:07:55,340;"Oh, yeah."
01:07:55,340;01:07:57,140;"- Can you start with Steven?"
01:07:57,140;01:07:59,540;"- What did he got?"
01:07:59,540;01:08:02,440;"- Grog's supposed to go."
01:08:02,440;01:08:05,940;"- Starts watching the highlights now."
01:08:05,940;01:08:12,620;"The worst is like more commentating,"
01:08:12,620;01:08:14,500;"a pile on Andy."
01:08:14,500;01:08:16,620;"The only good part was their golf thing"
01:08:16,620;01:08:19,260;"where the announcements always get super stoked"
01:08:19,260;01:08:21,300;"when punters help kick their coverage."
01:08:21,300;01:08:23,620;"Like they, they like,"
01:08:23,620;01:08:25,620;"with a Casey Punter like Dick Enberg."
01:08:25,620;01:08:29,420;"Yeah, hit the fuck out of the ball, but like he did like kind of a low line"
01:08:29,420;01:08:32,020;"driver or not. You know, he's put it out."
01:08:32,020;01:08:34,540;"Yeah. He out kicked his coverage by like 20 yards."
01:08:34,540;01:08:37,780;"Yeah. And so Troy got like a sick return out of it."
01:08:37,780;01:08:40,380;"And just like just by running straight up the middle."
01:08:40,380;01:08:42,900;"Oh, it's a huge booby bun."
01:08:42,900;01:08:44,300;"Oh, so what a great leg."
01:08:44,300;01:08:48,260;"And it's like, that's what he's trying to do."
01:08:48,260;01:08:52,700;"Oops. And then my best is definitely that Troy Brown drive."
01:08:52,700;01:08:55,300;"I mean, I think I snap chatted it to like a billion people."
01:08:55,300;01:08:56,540;"Oh my God."
01:08:56,540;01:08:56,900;"Yeah."
01:08:56,900;01:09:01,420;"I, I, I, I, like, they had like a sweet highlight montage after it too,"
01:09:01,420;01:09:03,380;"of all of his catches and like, oh my God."
01:09:03,380;01:09:03,500;"Yeah."
01:09:03,500;01:09:04,580;"Nothing was easy."
01:09:04,580;01:09:08,220;"I think it's where like everybody learned to can't play zone against"
01:09:08,220;01:09:08,780;"Brady too."
01:09:08,780;01:09:11,540;"Cause like Troy was just too good against that zone."
01:09:11,540;01:09:15,540;"Bray is just going to go over and over and over and Troy is just making the"
01:09:15,540;01:09:18,500;"gutty, gritty plays and like just being awesome."
01:09:18,500;01:09:20,460;"And then that touchdown to cap it was just wow."
01:09:20,460;01:09:21,180;"Yeah."
01:09:21,180;01:09:22,580;"Brady wasn't even looking."
01:09:22,580;01:09:24,900;"He wasn't even pretending to look anywhere else."
01:09:24,900;01:09:27,660;"He's just staring Troy ran down until he got open"
01:09:27,660;01:09:28,500;"and just threw it at him."
01:09:28,500;01:09:29,340;"- I could do that."
01:09:29,340;01:09:30,180;"- He was even open to you."
01:09:30,180;01:09:31,260;"You just throw it in anyway."
01:09:31,260;01:09:32,100;"You still catch it."
01:09:32,100;01:09:32,940;"- All right, great."
01:09:32,940;01:09:34,180;"- I got mine now."
01:09:34,180;01:09:35,020;"- Okay, good."
01:09:35,020;01:09:38,980;"- My best, Shadow Daniel Graham,"
01:09:38,980;01:09:40,660;"first career touchdown reception."
01:09:40,660;01:09:42,300;"- Yeah, okay, good one."
01:09:42,300;01:09:44,220;"- I don't think we've talked about that."
01:09:44,220;01:09:46,020;"- Sure."
01:09:46,020;01:09:50,260;"- My worst was the commentators, you know?"
01:09:50,260;01:09:54,540;"like even that play where they got the name wrong on who caught the pass."
01:09:54,540;01:09:56,540;"Like, come on."
01:09:56,540;01:10:02,700;"Which time are we talking about the one where they are talking about how Troy Brown"
01:10:02,700;01:10:04,660;"is back from his injury when he, he, well, yeah."
01:10:04,660;01:10:08,060;"Well, we're talking about the one we got the name wrong three times."
01:10:08,060;01:10:09,180;"Oh, well, yeah."
01:10:09,180;01:10:10,500;"I mean, we can be confused."
01:10:10,500;01:10:13,860;"Our leading wide receiver, where we talk about when they talk about tickling for"
01:10:13,860;01:10:14,900;"five fucking minutes."
01:10:14,900;01:10:15,620;"Yeah."
01:10:15,620;01:10:17,420;"You guys know you got, you get it."
01:10:17,420;01:10:17,980;"You get it."
01:10:19,580;01:10:21,740;"Well, when they they call the script kick the onsides kick."
01:10:21,740;01:10:24,140;"Oh, that dude that one."
01:10:24,140;01:10:29,780;"Oh, when Dick Emberg says, uh, he says a six yard game."
01:10:29,780;01:10:31,300;"Oh, he gains maybe a yard."
01:10:31,300;01:10:33,060;"Actually, wait, no, make that six yards."
01:10:33,060;01:10:35,580;"Oh, dude, he was five yards off."
01:10:35,580;01:10:36,540;"Yeah."
01:10:36,540;01:10:37,980;"What in it?"
01:10:37,980;01:10:39,180;"What an 88."
01:10:39,180;01:10:42,500;"Pretty good."
01:10:42,500;01:10:43,260;"It's pretty."
01:10:43,260;01:10:43,980;"It's pretty brown."
01:10:43,980;01:10:47,140;"That's a hard negative for not watching the game there, Greg."
01:10:47,140;01:10:48,620;"That's true."
01:10:48,620;01:10:51,900;"I did it. That's the thing when I just watched the highlights."
01:10:51,900;01:10:53,620;"I don't get any of the commentator stuff."
01:10:53,620;01:10:55,140;"My negative is Greg."
01:10:55,140;01:10:56,740;"And I watch in the fucking football game."
01:10:56,740;01:11:00,100;"Well, my positive is you because you're such a good brother, Andy."
01:11:00,100;01:11:01,660;"And I love you so very much."
01:11:01,660;01:11:04,340;"So you know what I'm going to do?"
01:11:04,340;01:11:05,860;"Like I'm going to mix this up on you."
01:11:05,860;01:11:06,500;"Ready? You ready?"
01:11:06,500;01:11:07,580;"Do you do what do you do?"
01:11:07,580;01:11:11,500;"My best is the following Dick Enberg line."
01:11:11,500;01:11:13,420;"You go."
01:11:13,420;01:11:16,060;"Third and third and goal."
01:11:16,060;01:11:18,060;"At the end of the game here."
01:11:18,060;01:11:23,480;"And the Patriots know that the Chiefs are gonna run it and so you can see there's something in there"
01:11:23,480;01:11:30,720;"Beef cakes, you know, they're having package and Dick Ember goes they've just sent in a whole truckload of beef"
01:11:30,720;01:11:37,340;"See that's what I'm talking about. Yeah, that that's a redeeming one right there. Yeah a"
01:11:37,340;01:11:41,320;"Truckload of beef truckload of beef. Yeah"
01:11:41,320;01:11:44,060;"my"
01:11:45,000;01:11:52,200;"Let's see what else I have like visualizing that you know just a bunch of like fat dudes wedged wedged into like a Ford F-150"
01:11:52,200;01:12:03,400;"Back of a you all like they're like a set of pigs here. They're all grunting. Yeah"
01:12:03,400;01:12:08,960;"My worst is"
01:12:09,400;01:12:15,680;"One of the referees getting in the way in this game because they were taking as many shots as Troy Brown and"
01:12:15,680;01:12:20,880;"Tom Brady were in fact rad guys one of the rest"
01:12:20,880;01:12:28,920;"Managed to run into the the Chiefs fullback as he was running onto the field to go to the huddle and"
01:12:28,920;01:12:33,040;"It literally looked like it knocked him out cold. Yeah"
01:12:34,040;01:12:40,040;"Massive like like black eyes sort of like you know in boxing where like the bottom like just under their eyes swells up"
01:12:40,040;01:12:42,740;"And it all like they cut it to make it the swelling go down"
01:12:42,740;01:12:46,100;"It was that and that's what they did had to give him like eye drops and shit"
01:12:46,100;01:12:48,700;"They stopped the game for like ten minutes. Just"
01:12:48,700;01:12:54,440;"Oh, yeah, he stayed in the game. He stayed in. Yeah, good for him. Yeah"
01:12:54,440;01:13:00,520;"But there's a few plays where like the referees just they were in the middle player. It's got clobbered"
01:13:00,520;01:13:04,520;"Just got ragdolled. Yep. So Molly Wopte. Oh"
01:13:04,520;01:13:08,680;"I"
01:13:08,680;01:13:09,400;"Let's"
01:13:09,400;01:13:11,400;"All right the source"
01:13:11,400;01:13:13,400;"Oh dear"
01:13:13,400;01:13:19,040;"There I mean this is an ideal. I let's give a game ball out. All right, Craig"
01:13:19,040;01:13:23,240;"Urban to sources Molly whopping mine"
01:13:23,240;01:13:28,440;"I'm not gonna steal your Steve mine goes to Tom Brady 400 passing yards"
01:13:29,840;01:13:31,840;"Four touchdowns. He's really"
01:13:31,840;01:13:36,640;"Save it"
01:13:36,640;01:13:38,320;"Frank save it late. Oh"
01:13:38,320;01:13:43,760;"Okay, go ahead"
01:13:43,760;01:13:51,400;"Obviously obviously mines Troy Brown Patriots record and catches"
01:13:51,400;01:13:55,880;"In all three quarters mine is dick and Berg"
01:13:57,400;01:13:59,500;"For watching a different game than we were"
01:13:59,500;01:14:06,960;"You know what no I take it back mine is the Patriots offensive coordinator"
01:14:06,960;01:14:10,280;"Who was Charlie Weiss at this point?"
01:14:10,280;01:14:13,120;"Because he has decided"
01:14:13,120;01:14:16,040;"One that he wanted to play this game like I play Madden"
01:14:16,040;01:14:20,540;"Which was really just throw at every fucking play Brady had like what 50 something times?"
01:14:20,540;01:14:26,480;"52 times something stupid like that and they just came out doing that he came out five wide and said you know what fucking we're just"
01:14:26,480;01:14:31,440;"not gonna run the ball and then no huddle too that's their first drive no huddle five wide just"
01:14:31,440;01:14:37,600;"like all right let's go yeah back in 2002 that was crazy yeah and then just the the amount of"
01:14:37,600;01:14:43,680;"trickery they had on this day on their first touchdown they tried to go for two on the extra"
01:14:43,680;01:14:50,640;"point by having the holder yeah and Walter tried to do a dive off of left tackle and he didn't make it"
01:14:51,440;01:14:54,500;"And then they did another one where they pitched a fall,"
01:14:54,500;01:14:58,240;"who threw back to Brady, who fumbled it and hadn't throw it away."
01:14:58,240;01:15:01,740;"And then they had another one where they pitched a fall and fall,"
01:15:01,740;01:15:04,820;"fall through deep to Troy Brown, who missed it."
01:15:04,820;01:15:09,320;"And our old friend Dick Enberg missed the fact that Brady had pitched a fall."
01:15:09,320;01:15:10,440;"Yes."
01:15:10,440;01:15:14,420;"And commentated it that it was Brady going deep and he was deriding,"
01:15:14,420;01:15:16,460;"Brady from missing fault for missing Troy Brown."
01:15:16,460;01:15:18,460;"So badly."
01:15:18,460;01:15:20,700;"Until two, I think it was like the next play."
01:15:20,700;01:15:25,400;"They somebody like told him in his ear that actually that and he correct himself eventually"
01:15:25,400;01:15:32,660;"So the offensive play calling I thought was it was it felt very"
01:15:32,660;01:15:37,740;"We're execution shit. I felt like Chip Kelly ask, you know"
01:15:37,740;01:15:42,720;"Yeah, just put on all the stops and just having a good time with it. The UNH is finest. That's right"
01:15:42,720;01:15:45,900;"All right, Greg less less on the Molly Wapping"
01:15:46,500;01:15:50,240;"Well, so I put in ragdolled into urban"
01:15:50,240;01:15:57,620;"And it sounds like I'm getting two separate like paths here. I'm getting what what looks like a"
01:15:57,620;01:16:00,660;"semen rag"
01:16:00,660;01:16:07,360;"Synonyms and I'm also getting a lot of like when women are on their period sentiment. So I'll just read a couple of you guys"
01:16:07,360;01:16:09,360;"make the call"
01:16:09,360;01:16:12,340;"Cotton pony"
01:16:12,340;01:16:14,980;"Cock rag"
01:16:15,420;01:16:22,440;"Butchers apron west of these are a synonym for ragdoll. I'm still I'm still stuck on cotton pony"
01:16:22,440;01:16:24,440;"I don't know which side that goes on"
01:16:24,440;01:16:27,200;"West Virginia tiki torch"
01:16:27,200;01:16:37,040;"Rusty work boot"
01:16:41,040;01:16:43,040;"Ragging a bag"
01:16:43,040;01:16:48,000;"See semen farm. I think you can get what that one is that one I got yep"
01:16:48,000;01:16:55,600;"Dude there's like literally like 700 options here"
01:16:55,600;01:17:00,640;"This is awesome. Sorry mom"
01:17:00,640;01:17:08,200;"This is making it into this episode. Oh sphincter slap. That's a good for you Andy"
01:17:08,920;01:17:13,760;"Is slapping in you endo in this case I'm gonna say probably"
01:17:13,760;01:17:19,320;"All right, well on that note"
01:17:19,320;01:17:24,960;"If we have any listeners left, what are we looking at next week boy? I have no idea"
01:17:24,960;01:17:30,120;"No, no page traveling to Qualcomm Stadium"
01:17:30,120;01:17:34,040;"The party the San Diego"
01:17:34,040;01:17:37,160;"Supercharges San Diego"
01:17:37,880;01:17:42,740;"charges. That's the one. So we'll see you next week if we"
01:17:42,740;01:17:47,960;"haven't been canceled by then. On the next. Yeah, we can't"
01:17:47,960;01:17:51,560;"what? This is going to cancel us. You are the reason we'd be"
01:17:51,560;01:17:58,400;"canceled. Can I cancel like us? All you. I'm what I came in"
01:17:58,400;01:18:02,360;"mom. My old pencils. When I came when I came into this"
01:18:02,360;01:18:05,240;"recording, I was like, I'm intentionally gonna make this"
01:18:05,240;01:18:08,700;"go off the rails. I set out to do that."
01:18:08,700;01:18:11,740;"It doesn't feel intentional. Oh, it was."
01:18:11,740;01:18:14,140;"It feels just naturally who you are."
01:18:14,140;01:18:16,660;"You did an okay job at it, but like, I don't know."
01:18:16,660;01:18:19,380;"We did. I got us. I got us to some weird places. No."
01:18:19,380;01:18:21,980;"Sure. Yeah, we did. We just kind of dip our toes."
01:18:21,980;01:18:23,860;"We kind of tickled the line. Yeah."
01:18:23,860;01:18:27,220;"We did. I mean, we were on"
01:18:27,220;01:18:31,020;"wicked diff between talking about"
01:18:31,020;01:18:33,460;"bank and smacking smacking. Yeah."
01:18:33,460;01:18:40,460;"Yeah. And I think you're wrong there, Andy. And I think we proved that unequivocally."
01:18:40,460;01:18:48,460;"I disagree. I think you unproved it with your list. I don't even remember what it's called."
01:18:48,460;01:18:50,460;"The something smack."
01:18:50,460;01:18:55,460;"We can save this for a later episode, but I have, you know, like the,"
01:18:55,460;01:19:00,460;"Um, when you have sex and then you leave."
01:19:00,460;01:19:07,360;"And like, there's like, there's a term for that, you know, like the way I'm"
01:19:07,360;01:19:07,560;"damn."
01:19:07,560;01:19:08,220;"Thank you, ma'am."
01:19:08,220;01:19:09,160;"Yes, exactly."
01:19:09,160;01:19:15,640;"So the synonyms of that I've got like 15 that are so fucking funny."
01:19:15,640;01:19:20,680;"Oh, I had a note that I should have brought up on what's Tom Brady's"
01:19:20,680;01:19:21,560;"completion streak."
01:19:21,560;01:19:21,980;"I don't know."
01:19:21,980;01:19:22,900;"What do you mean?"
01:19:23,120;01:19:25,380;"He had like 11 or 12 in a row in this game."
01:19:25,380;01:19:28,500;"Yeah, it was in that range."
01:19:28,500;01:19:30,560;"I'm not going to stat check that."
01:19:30,560;01:19:32,240;"Well, stat check."
01:19:32,240;01:19:33,380;"Cause I'm going to ask it later."
01:19:33,380;01:19:34,380;"Okay."
01:19:34,380;01:19:35,540;"I'll stack it."
01:19:35,540;01:19:37,180;"Check it before the next episode."
01:19:37,180;01:19:41,960;"All right."
01:19:41,960;01:19:45,400;"And on that note, we will see you next week in San Diego."
01:19:45,400;01:19:48,260;"I guess we're still recording."
01:19:48,260;01:19:51,140;"Oh, I thought we were done like."
01:19:51,140;01:19:57,940;"and five minutes let me finish before oh well you just edited you're just you're"
01:19:57,940;01:20:05,500;"figure out fucking hell well excuse me"

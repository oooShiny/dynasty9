00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,920;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,920;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:24,480;"I am not your mother."
00:24,480;00:28,760;"Welcome back, and I'm sure you've all been listening all the way through to the Pages"
00:28,760;00:38,660;"Dynasty podcast. This week is 2001 week nine with the Buffalo Bills coming to Foxboro"
00:38,660;00:43,860;"Stadium, not Gillette Stadium. Although the gratuitous shots of Gillette Stadium in the"
00:43,860;00:44,860;"background."
00:44,860;00:45,860;"CMGI."
00:45,860;00:51,820;"Yes, thank you. CMGI field as we've already talked about. What were they? They were the"
00:51,820;00:56,460;"S. Gives of the early 2000s, isn't that what we discovered? Something like that?"
00:56,460;00:57,460;"Yes, sir."
00:57,460;01:02,820;"Something like that. Yeah, so just for some context why we might sound a little dower"
01:02,820;01:10,420;"This week we are recording this the week after the ending of the 2019 Patriots season"
01:10,420;01:19,540;"Some would say that well a lot of media would say that I'm not ready to call it quite yet"
01:19,540;01:22,660;"Because they've been saying that for the past"
01:23,540;01:27,540;"Would you say ten years at the dynasty is ended it's over. I"
01:27,540;01:31,300;"Like that a a playoff appearance"
01:31,300;01:34,480;"After three Super Bowls is the end"
01:34,480;01:38,260;"Four season while battling through a"
01:38,260;01:41,300;"Platicoot of injuries"
01:41,300;01:46,220;"That's true he sold his house"
01:46,220;01:52,060;"Garera sold his two didn't he and he's a free agent he'll never"
01:52,060;01:54,300;"- It's pretty improved to Connecticut."
01:54,300;01:56,140;"- Belichick hates him."
01:56,140;01:58,060;"It's physically impossible for him to come back."
01:58,060;01:59,660;"I'm pretty sure. - Oh, fuck."
01:59,660;02:04,060;"- Yeah, but now, you know,"
02:04,060;02:05,620;"play devil's advocate here."
02:05,620;02:09,420;"Isn't it, it would be a little bit interesting to see Brady"
02:09,420;02:13,020;"go somewhere else just to kind of add to that bar"
02:13,020;02:14,980;"conversation of like, who's better?"
02:14,980;02:17,060;"Belichick Brady, who needed who more?"
02:17,060;02:18,780;"I mean, obviously it's a different conversation"
02:18,780;02:21,100;"'cause he's older, the teams are different, whatever."
02:21,100;02:24,060;"kind of stupid, but could be fun to talk about."
02:24,060;02:26,300;"It'd be interesting."
02:26,300;02:28,400;"Yeah, I had you"
02:28,400;02:32,140;"like Brady wins one and then Bella check number one's another one."
02:32,140;02:33,740;"That's pretty embarrassing for me."
02:33,740;02:37,140;"My money would be on the other way around."
02:37,140;02:38,460;"I know that's what I mean."
02:38,460;02:42,620;"It's more likely for the coach to coach until he's 85 and sneak one in there."
02:42,620;02:43,780;"Oh, at least. Yeah."
02:43,780;02:49,420;"But if Brady brings the fucking Titans to the Super Bowl, it's not bad."
02:49,820;02:51,580;"You put them on the Colts or something."
02:51,580;02:52,420;"Yeah."
02:52,420;02:56,060;"Isn't the Chargers the, the lead spot."
02:56,060;02:57,180;"I don't get that man."
02:57,180;02:58,140;"They're terrible."
02:58,140;02:59,380;"Yeah."
02:59,380;03:01,660;"And the Raiders give me a break."
03:01,660;03:02,460;"Right."
03:02,460;03:04,460;"Yeah."
03:04,460;03:06,020;"I'm sure Bell check."
03:06,020;03:11,580;"I'll see eye to eye with his name, not Al Davis, his son with a bowl cut."
03:11,580;03:13,460;"Fucks his name."
03:13,460;03:15,780;"Oh, that guy."
03:15,780;03:16,980;"Al Davis, Jr."
03:16,980;03:18,100;"Yes."
03:18,100;03:18,620;"Is it sure?"
03:18,620;03:20,620;"He's such a weirdo."
03:20,620;03:22,620;"He's a real weird dude."
03:22,620;03:33,620;"All I know is the chances of the Patriots letting Brady go is minuscule because I don't know if you guys know but there's a $13 million cap hit if he leaves."
03:33,620;03:37,620;"And that's always huge amount of money to be sitting around for nothing."
03:37,620;03:38,620;"So yep."
03:38,620;03:40,620;"But we don't talk about that."
03:40,620;03:42,620;"Nope."
03:42,620;03:43,620;"Nope."
03:43,620;03:46,620;"We're here to talk about 2001 week nine."
03:46,620;03:49,880;"nine. The one in five."
03:49,880;03:52,840;"You get the introductions before getting sidetracked. Nice."
03:52,840;03:55,860;"Yep. I may this point."
03:55,860;03:58,320;"Do we even need introductions? Everybody's here."
03:58,320;03:59,720;"The whole damn crew."
03:59,720;04:03,420;"You know who we are by now. You can Google it."
04:03,420;04:08,160;"If you Google Google Steve Brown, it's hilarious."
04:08,160;04:11,080;"It's like a yo-yo champion."
04:11,080;04:13,240;"All right. I'm going to do that right now."
04:13,240;04:14,680;"That guy is legit."
04:14,680;04:18,680;"I'm actually looking that up right now."
04:18,680;04:19,680;"So I think I-"
04:19,680;04:21,680;"It's like a Yo Yo master."
04:21,680;04:24,680;"Yo Yo guys, he's like an OG Yo Yo."
04:24,680;04:28,680;"I'm not seeing this Yo Yo guy, but it's types of Yo Yo guys."
04:28,680;04:29,680;"Stay tuned."
04:29,680;04:33,680;"I set a Google alert for Andrew Brown."
04:33,680;04:39,680;"So every time my name comes up in like a new Google story, I get notified."
04:39,680;04:43,680;"There is a defensive lineman for the Cincinnati Bengals."
04:43,680;04:49,920;"name on your brown and there's also a whole lot of guys who've done a whole bunch of"
04:49,920;04:55,040;"yeah I would say a lot of victims and murderers and all kinds of weird things out there you"
04:55,040;05:04,400;"know what this yo-yo guy looks fucking awesome yeah it's bearded sex forget the yo-yo's I"
05:04,400;05:05,400;"I don't know."
05:05,400;05:07,400;"His dad's are on point."
05:07,400;05:09,760;"He thinks walking the dog look cool."
05:09,760;05:12,360;"Shoot the moon."
05:12,360;05:18,800;"Speaking of great beards, I guess."
05:18,800;05:23,480;"Is this like a Buffalo Bell's head coach Greg Williams?"
05:23,480;05:25,240;"Does he have a beard?"
05:25,240;05:27,240;"That was a stretchy."
05:27,240;05:28,240;"Yeah, that one."
05:28,240;05:29,240;"I don't think so."
05:29,240;05:30,240;"All right, fuck it."
05:30,240;05:32,480;"He doesn't have like a cool throw though."
05:32,480;05:34,080;"Yeah, something like that."
05:34,080;05:35,680;"He's got 2G."
05:35,680;05:38,380;"Oh, yeah, this is Greg with 2G."
05:38,380;05:38,780;"He's off."
05:38,780;05:41,080;"I was a very square head, I feel like."
05:41,080;05:44,380;"I will say about Greg Williams."
05:44,380;05:49,080;"Because this popped up in the broadcast and I thought it was very cool."
05:49,080;05:53,480;"He was talking to his team or talking about his team."
05:53,480;05:57,780;"But he says his team is too young and not talented enough to overcome penalties in the state."
05:57,780;06:01,380;"I thought that was pretty neat."
06:01,880;06:08,040;"Well, this is the same Greg Williams who was the interim Browns head coach in 2018 after Hugh"
06:08,040;06:12,280;"Jackson was fired because he was he's more of a defensive coordinator, I think."
06:12,280;06:13,160;"Right. Yeah."
06:13,160;06:18,040;"Yeah, that's that's that's usually what he is. He's been in the league since '97."
06:18,040;06:23,240;"Most of his defensive coordinator, but he got a couple of shots at head coach."
06:23,240;06:31,400;"This, of course, was the 01-03 with the Bills, where he went the 17 and 31."
06:31,400;06:38,560;"And then the year with Cleveland, he had eight games doing what five and three, but they didn't bring him back as a coach."
06:38,560;06:43,840;"Because I think he seems like a bit of a loose cannon in the way that he talks about."
06:43,840;06:44,800;"He's a bouncy gay guy."
06:44,800;06:45,800;"Yeah."
06:45,800;06:46,600;"Yeah, right."
06:46,600;06:46,680;"Right."
06:46,680;06:46,960;"Yeah."
06:46,960;06:50,120;"So he's a."
06:50,120;06:52,560;"Yeah, did you watch the hard knocks with him in it?"
06:52,560;06:55,440;"No, which one was that?"
06:55,440;06:57,880;"Oh, oh, the one last year with the Browns."
06:57,880;06:58,280;"Yeah."
06:58,280;07:00,040;"No, I didn't actually see it."
07:00,440;07:04,760;"He's a hard up HP. He's like an old school, you know, grumpy con kind of guy."
07:04,760;07:07,360;"How do you feel about the about a gate?"
07:07,360;07:11,040;"Yeah, I don't know. I mean, I think it's it's like whatever."
07:11,040;07:12,240;"Dude, they're trying to hurt each other."
07:12,240;07:13,360;"Anyway, it's a football."
07:13,360;07:14,160;"That's what I thought."
07:14,160;07:17,280;"I mean, it's kind of weird to put a dollar a mile down somebody's head,"
07:17,280;07:19,680;"but at the same time, they're all trying to kill each other."
07:19,680;07:20,640;"So right."
07:20,640;07:23,800;"I mean, like saying go hurt him and go hit him as hard as you can."
07:23,800;07:24,960;"Right. Right."
07:24,960;07:28,920;"And I think like even the money thing was just like them, you know, again,"
07:28,920;07:34,680;"not write the optics. It doesn't pass the optics test, but they're just, you know, it wasn't like"
07:34,680;07:41,800;"this whole infrastructure to like, decimate people out on this. Right. It's full. Yeah, it felt like"
07:41,800;07:47,960;"the actual punishments that came down, like Sean Payton being suspended for a year in a"
07:47,960;07:54,200;"like crap like that. It just seemed so over the top. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it was definitely like"
07:54,200;07:58,760;"an optics thing and you don't want a brutal sport to be like, you know, mired by things"
07:58,760;08:07,240;"like that. But, uh, you know, he, like Greg said, he's an old school guy. Yeah. It doesn't"
08:07,240;08:11,720;"excuse his actions though. On a record."
08:11,720;08:20,880;"We're going to save that. Uh, so in his head coaching career, he has faced ballot check"
08:20,880;08:28,400;"six times all while coaching the Buffalo Bills. He lost five of them. Can any of you name the one win?"
08:28,400;08:32,400;"I can, but I cheated and I looked."
08:32,400;08:42,000;"Was it the 31 nothing? It was. Yeah. It was. Game week one. That was his only win against the"
08:42,000;08:48,240;"New England Patriots and Bill Bell check. Yeah, but what a win, huh? Yeah."
08:49,920;08:55,920;"And then they finished that season pretty strong too, I believe, by coming back to..."
08:55,920;09:02,240;"I don't remember which one was where, but playing the Patriots again last week of the season"
09:02,240;09:05,680;"and in the perfect book end, the losing 31-0."
09:05,680;09:10,240;"The first game was in Buffalo, the last game was in New England."
09:10,240;09:13,760;"Yeah, okay, that's what I thought. Yeah, that seems right."
09:13,760;09:17,600;"From the visuals that have been burned into my memorized pick."
09:17,600;09:18,480;"That pick ends on."
09:18,480;09:24,440;"Yeah, yeah, because they had the second string in until the, the bill started driving right"
09:24,440;09:28,720;"at the end and then they put the first string defense back in and held them to keep it 31."
09:28,720;09:29,960;"Nothing. It's beautiful."
09:29,960;09:34,040;"I want to know, Mr. Brown."
09:34,040;09:35,040;"Yeah."
09:35,040;09:40,480;"Is Greg Williams got in trouble for the bond to get thing?"
09:40,480;09:45,840;"How come Sean Pete doesn't get in trouble for bringing like he's carrying around $100,000"
09:45,840;09:48,600;"dollars or something like cash and enticing as players to win a game."
09:48,600;09:49,640;"Doesn't that promote betting?"
09:49,640;09:50,120;"Yeah."
09:50,120;09:52,200;"I'm in New Jersey."
09:52,200;09:52,600;"Yeah."
09:52,600;09:57,480;"But you can't can you bet like if you're on an NFL team or against or for whatever."
09:57,480;09:58,480;"Probably."
09:58,480;09:59,560;"I mean, he rose."
09:59,560;10:01,080;"That's exactly."
10:01,080;10:02,440;"You know, something to say about it."
10:02,440;10:03,720;"Exactly."
10:03,720;10:05,480;"So, you know, what is it?"
10:05,480;10:06,440;"Sean, you know what?"
10:06,440;10:08,080;"Sean, you should just get suspended every year."
10:08,080;10:08,560;"How about that?"
10:08,560;10:13,840;"That sounds great."
10:14,360;10:15,680;"I think you're on the side."
10:15,680;10:17,680;"Go off, King."
10:17,680;10:20,920;"All right."
10:20,920;10:23,880;"Speaking of terrible, though, the bills this year"
10:23,880;10:26,640;"would finish the season 3 and 13."
10:26,640;10:30,560;"After coming into this at 1 and 6,"
10:30,560;10:34,600;"that would qualify for a fifth in the IC East out of five teams,"
10:34,600;10:36,880;"back when that was still a thing."
10:36,880;10:41,120;"They wouldn't actually win more than one game in a row this season."
10:41,120;10:43,720;"They had losing streaks of four, which to start season,"
10:43,720;10:48,040;"And then another six after winning coming out of there by."
10:48,040;10:51,000;"And this is a game that we're catching them now"
10:51,000;10:53,000;"is part of that six game losing streak."
10:53,000;10:57,160;"Let's see, other notable coaches, literally nobody."
10:57,160;11:01,680;"This team was so bad that nobody else ever got a job."
11:01,680;11:03,680;"Me and the fellow afterwards."
11:03,680;11:06,040;"As a head coach anyway, I don't know if they--"
11:06,040;11:10,400;"- They replaced, do you know who you replaced on the bills?"
11:10,400;11:11,760;"- Who replaced?"
11:11,760;11:15,240;"who uh... williams replaced"
11:15,240;11:17,680;"he's and he's famous guy"
11:17,680;11:18,960;"the uh..."

11:38,320;11:39,320;"I can see that."
11:39,320;11:44,060;"But way Phillips is is that like defensive coordinator who"
11:44,060;11:45,760;"ever once wan get to shot to, isn't he?"

11:54,800;11:56,560;"Son of bum."
11:56,560;11:58,520;"Well, it's not a bomb."
11:58,520;11:59,560;"They did."
11:59,560;12:00,040;"Yeah."
12:00,040;12:00,040;"Yeah."
12:00,040;12:06,040;"I actually read some excerpts out of it in preparation for this podcast."
12:06,040;12:07,240;"Oh, really?"
12:07,240;12:08,240;"I hope you tell."
12:08,240;12:15,240;"I felt deep into the flutey Rob Johnson rabbit hole. It was it was quite a rabbit hole. It was"
12:15,240;12:21,960;"There's a whole bunch of shit that went on. It was ridiculous. Yeah, I mean I was it went that deep"
12:21,960;12:28,160;"Yeah, so I let we can get into that now if you want because I mean the next thing is the starting quarterback as we've"
12:28,160;12:30,760;"Made aware is Rob Johnson and he"
12:30,760;12:34,280;"Was the replacement for Doug flutey really right?"
12:34,960;12:40,680;"Yeah, yeah, now I remember the San Diego game. We touched on this like did anything go deeper than that"
12:40,680;12:43,200;"You want me to get into it. I got time. Yeah"
12:43,200;12:50,280;"He's a fourth round draft at Johnson for the expansion Jacksonville Jaguars"
12:50,280;12:54,700;"Right he plays three years there. He starts one game"
12:54,700;13:00,200;"He like played his ass off in that one game if you remember this this came up with"
13:00,200;13:03,280;"Like the Met Castle"
13:03,840;13:08,840;"conversation. They gave up a first and a fourth round pick to trade."
13:08,840;13:22,340;"Wow. So they brought him and Flutee in in 1998, I believe. Yeah. And he sucks. He starts"
13:22,340;13:27,760;"the season one and three and then Flutee takes over when he gets hurt. He turns the season"
13:27,760;13:33,160;"around, they make the playoffs, foodie goes to the Pro Bowl, everything's dandy."
13:33,160;13:35,000;"Right."
13:35,000;13:39,880;"The next year they go 11 and 5."
13:39,880;13:43,120;"This is where it all blew up."
13:43,120;13:45,760;"So, Flute started 15 games that year."
13:45,760;13:46,760;"Right, right."
13:46,760;13:51,160;"Making the playoffs, he sits out week 17 because they couldn't change their playoff"
13:51,160;13:52,160;"seating."
13:52,160;13:58,720;"seating. Johnson comes in, slings all over the field, plays his ass off, and then they"
13:58,720;14:03,440;"fill up Starts Johnson. Oh my God. The music city miracle game, right?"
14:03,440;14:08,520;"Yeah, I forgot that's how that went down. Yeah, which turned out to be the music city"
14:08,520;14:18,120;"miracle. Yes, yeah. So then they lost, obviously, to the tight"
14:18,120;14:21,020;"Knacking and then the next year"
14:21,020;14:24,820;"They split time flute went for one"
14:24,820;14:33,380;"Rob Johnson went four and seven and at the end of that year their decision to wait Phillips said I think we'll say"
14:33,380;14:35,820;"Rob Johnson"
14:35,820;14:41,420;"Wow that flute go. Yeah, cuz I don't I don't I think it was just me and Mike that did the"
14:41,420;14:47,420;"Chargers game, but because they traded him to the Chargers yelp dog flute and at the time"
14:47,420;14:52,780;"I think the charges were undefeated and the bills were winless. Yeah, so"
14:52,780;14:59,620;"flute went like a bit. They were one in 15 the year before and then he actually"
14:59,620;15:05,780;"played they played each other that year and flute was foreign to and had like"
15:05,780;15:09,580;"turned around the charters and then there was like a dramatic like game"
15:09,580;15:14,620;"ending scramble touchdown that flute had to win it."
15:14,620;15:20,460;"the targets. And I remember that play happening because everyone was like, dude, fuck Rob Johnson."
15:20,460;15:25,020;"I guess that's what happens when you trade a first round pick for them."
15:25,020;15:29,500;"Yeah. So that was actually two weeks before this game, I think."
15:29,500;15:31,820;"Yeah. I thought it was one."
15:31,820;15:34,940;"Yeah. It was. Yeah. It was their week seven."
15:34,940;15:40,860;"And then Rob Johnson breaks his collarbone in this game, spoiler alert."
15:42,060;15:44,300;"And he basically was never the same."
15:44,300;15:47,060;"Oh, he kind of was though."
15:47,060;15:48,740;"Well, yeah."
15:48,740;15:50,060;"He just had the one."
15:50,060;15:51,500;"He never got that off."
15:51,500;15:52,420;"Right. Right. Yeah."
15:52,420;15:53,740;"That was it."
15:53,740;15:56,260;"Wow. Well, thank you for that."
15:56,260;15:57,700;"I forgot about all that."
15:57,700;15:58,180;"Yeah."
15:58,180;15:58,940;"Yeah."
15:58,940;16:01,860;"And like there were so many like instances"
16:01,860;16:05,940;"throughout this whole thing of like, oh, yeah, Rob Johnson started the game."
16:05,940;16:06,780;"They were losing."
16:06,780;16:08,500;"He, you know, gets a concussion."
16:08,500;16:11,660;"Fluid comes in, scores 24 unanswered points and they win."
16:11,660;16:14,260;"Like I read that like four different times."
16:14,260;16:17,820;"So similar to the Tom Brady drew, hence,"
16:17,820;16:19,460;"I was thinking the exact same thing."
16:19,460;16:20,180;"It's true."
16:20,180;16:23,740;"Actually, Michigan, like they just want Rob Johnson to be good."
16:23,740;16:27,780;"When he is, they just put in the backup to clean things up again."
16:27,780;16:28,500;"Yeah."
16:28,500;16:31,060;"See, I thought he was like a high draft pick."
16:31,060;16:32,180;"Yeah."
16:32,180;16:36,860;"So did I first and fourth, like that's where that like reputation came from."
16:36,860;16:38,140;"Yeah."
16:38,140;16:41,460;"Like we've got to use them because we've got technically was a high draft."
16:41,460;16:49,460;"pictures not by the Jax. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. And so they're they"
16:49,460;16:52,780;"they rolled with Rob Johnson and Alex van Pelt of all people this"
16:52,780;16:58,660;"season. Great name. Yeah, had to finish this game. And then"
16:58,660;17:01,780;"the rest of season because Rob Johnson. Oh, I think that was"
17:01,780;17:04,580;"also another knock on Rob Johnson's. You can never say"
17:04,580;17:08,860;"healthy too. Oh, yeah, he was injured. And then so after that"
17:08,860;17:14,240;"music city miracle. I think it took them 20 years to get back to the playoffs."
17:14,240;17:16,740;"Yeah, the curse of flute."
17:16,740;17:21,180;"Yeah. And I went did flute make the playoffs in those 20 years."
17:21,180;17:24,140;"He was on the Patriots team, so he must have. Yeah."
17:24,140;17:27,140;"So not as a starter, but right. Yeah."
17:27,140;17:31,140;"Curse of Doug flute. I love it."
17:31,140;17:34,540;"And they still haven't won a playoff game since then, right?"
17:34,540;17:36,900;"Because they lost this year too."
17:37,500;17:41,740;"And so tough."
17:41,740;17:46,380;"He's the, the baby Ruth of Buffalo. I mean, I think they've won for"
17:46,380;17:50,140;"since the year they lost that four Super Bowl in a row."
17:50,140;17:53,100;"Yeah, I think you're right."
17:53,100;17:57,700;"Cause they lost in the first round in both those years I was looking at the 90"
17:57,700;17:59,740;"eight and 99. Yep."
17:59,740;18:03,460;"Does it compare to the Antonio Brown curse?"
18:06,740;18:10,300;"Because he got them. The Raiders, Steelers and Patriots."
18:10,300;18:12,900;"And he included Buffalo in that as well."
18:12,900;18:22,100;"I don't know. He was proud of, you know, every team being out in the same week."
18:22,100;18:23,500;"So we got to sign that man."
18:23,500;18:27,180;"We should at least bring one to podcast."
18:27,180;18:29,540;"I think he'd be down."
18:29,540;18:32,900;"Dude, we could like we could watch his music video."
18:32,900;18:34,820;"Yeah, we could hype it for him."
18:34,820;18:35,660;"I like it."
18:35,660;18:38,240;"already. I think once was a whole lot of money."
18:38,240;18:42,280;"Oh, that's not auto tuned enough."
18:42,280;18:45,200;"I'll auto tune it in post."
18:45,200;18:47,460;"Thank you. I appreciate that. I hope you do."
18:47,460;18:55,320;"I think I will. So actually the the last Buffalo playoff win was the year after"
18:55,320;18:56,960;"they lost their last Super Bowl."
18:56,960;19:00,720;"They won in the wild card against the Dolphins before learning to the Steelers"
19:00,720;19:02,040;"and the usual round."
19:02,040;19:03,600;"1995, maybe."
19:04,400;19:07,200;"It's been a couple years."
19:07,200;19:11,880;"Hey, there are other teams that are worse off, so they should be happy."
19:11,880;19:13,520;"Yeah."
19:13,520;19:15,200;"Sure."
19:15,200;19:17,800;"Barely, but yes."
19:17,800;19:22,800;"You know, what are we going to do with ourselves until next year?"
19:22,800;19:31,160;"Um, speaking of dynasties, the bills wide receivers, Eric Moles and"
19:31,160;19:32,280;"Peerless price."
19:32,280;19:33,680;"Talk about a great game."
19:33,680;19:36,080;"Duo both of them, really."
19:36,080;19:37,080;"Eric holds."
19:37,080;19:39,080;"Well, peerless, though."
19:39,080;19:40,320;"I mean, what a great name."
19:40,320;19:41,560;"Yeah, that's yeah."
19:41,560;19:42,200;"That's great."
19:42,200;19:45,960;"Uh, I think if we're if we're going with great names, uh, running back, starting"
19:45,960;19:49,520;"running back Travis Henry was always my favorite because I remember playing him"
19:49,520;19:55,440;"in Madden and calling him Big Hen and my college roommate at the time."
19:55,440;20:01,040;"So I use Travis Henry to, to such great Travis Henry and, and"
20:01,040;20:04,420;"Drew blood so to such a great effect that he couldn't beat me and"

20:09,980;20:16,280;"I don't know man. Yeah, did anyone else go into the Travis Henry rabbit hole. I"

26:26,300;26:28,300;"I'm laughing sometimes."
26:28,300;26:30,300;"You're on the roof."
26:30,300;26:34,300;"I don't have to build paths in 04."
26:34,300;26:38,100;"I have in my hand a game day program from that game."
26:38,100;26:39,100;"Nice."
26:39,100;26:40,100;"Well, sweet."
26:40,100;26:42,660;"We'll get there in probably five and a half years."
26:42,660;26:43,860;"So hang on to that."
26:43,860;26:47,140;"Well, since he doesn't force on, no worries."
26:47,140;26:48,020;"Yeah."
26:48,020;26:51,660;"Wait a minute, Andy, did we go to a Brady blood toe game?"
26:51,660;26:53,460;"Was it us in Buffalo?"
26:53,460;26:54,820;"Yes, that's right."
26:54,820;26:55,460;"I can't."
26:55,460;26:56,420;"We'll have to."
26:56,420;26:58,340;"We'll have to talk about that when that pops up."
26:58,340;26:58,900;"Yeah."
26:58,900;26:59,260;"Yeah."
26:59,260;26:59,940;"That'll be good."
26:59,940;27:00,660;"Yeah."
27:00,660;27:06,780;"Um, speaking of fat bastards, the last name on defense was Pat Williams."
27:06,780;27:08,580;"I got his legit."
27:08,580;27:09,300;"Yeah."
27:09,740;27:11,100;"That wasn't part roast was it?"
27:11,100;27:13,220;"That was a different Williams that was called part roast."
27:13,220;27:14,460;"Who is he?"
27:14,460;27:15,740;"He's getting the Broncos."
27:15,740;27:17,100;"Yeah."
27:17,100;27:17,780;"Oh, yes."
27:17,780;27:19,140;"I thought his name was Williams too."
27:19,140;27:19,620;"That wasn't it?"
27:19,620;27:22,220;"What about Keith, the tractor trailer?"
27:22,220;27:24,980;"I don't think he was on this team at this point."
27:24,980;27:27,460;"I think, uh, just left."
27:27,460;27:29,740;"They're like, Oh, he's the last is buddy."
27:29,740;27:30,620;"Yes."
27:30,620;27:30,900;"Yeah."
27:30,900;27:31,300;"Yeah."
27:31,300;27:32,780;"Um, I don't know."
27:32,780;27:33,260;"That's he."
27:33,260;27:35,420;"Yeah."
27:35,420;27:36,380;"He's like, Oh, his buddy."
27:36,380;27:39,340;"And once was like, no, no, it's the big"
27:39,340;27:42,520;"fact on defense that he used to play it right next to Ted Washington."
27:42,520;27:44,940;"Oh, I remember Teddy."
27:44,940;27:45,780;"Yeah."
27:45,780;27:49,500;"What are your thoughts on the commentators, Andy?"
27:49,500;27:52,220;"Uh, do you want to get to that now?"
27:52,220;27:58,300;"I mean, we can't because I got to look guys, I try not to bring this up because"
27:58,300;28:03,500;"I feel stupid in that I don't know so much, but Brad Jones started football or"
28:03,500;28:04,180;"not football."
28:04,180;28:06,620;"And every time this guy pops up, I can't escape it."
28:06,620;28:09,060;"I have to write three or four things because he could use the hell out of me."
28:09,060;28:16,540;"Yeah, we can get into it if you guys want to help me out on this. But again, I don't,"
28:16,540;28:20,420;"I feel dumb bringing this up, but this guy just brings it out of me, I think."
28:20,420;28:26,260;"I mean, we can, we can dive right over here, even though we haven't talked about the game at all yet."
28:26,260;28:32,100;"Well, I mean, this can help the listeners and understanding the game a little bit better as we unravel."
28:32,100;28:35,140;"All right. I mean, it is what we're talking about, Colin. Let's do it."
28:35,140;28:37,900;"All right. Yeah. Brent Jones goes, Johnson's all right."
28:37,900;28:40,900;"He chose the line, but Brett Jones is something else."
28:40,900;28:46,820;"And so the first one would be sometimes that ball is slippery"
28:46,820;28:48,140;"when you get that pump going."
28:48,140;28:53,020;"And I'm like, you didn't kind of can."
28:53,020;28:57,020;"I definitely did and I don't understand it."
28:57,020;28:58,060;"So could you feel me?"
28:58,060;28:59,740;"Is it is a football or not football?"
28:59,740;29:01,220;"It was like a sunny game too."
29:01,220;29:02,900;"Why would it be slippery?"
29:02,900;29:03,900;"I guess."
29:03,900;29:04,900;"No idea."
29:04,900;29:07,100;"I guess if you pump it up enough."
29:07,100;29:13,020;"Oh, it'll get like super. Yeah, it's like the opposite of deflate gate."
29:13,020;29:18,380;"And the ball gets super. Yeah, you can't grip it as well. So it kind of"
29:18,380;29:23,900;"so it's like an Aaron Rodgers gate. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So that's what you guys think."
29:23,900;29:28,780;"It's like a air thing. It might be being completely honest. I don't actually know"
29:28,780;29:33,820;"what the fuck he's talking about. He said it. I swear. Oh, I'm sure he did. I don't know"
29:33,820;29:35,540;"I don't know if he knew what he was talking about."
29:35,540;29:38,420;"- All right, so if anybody out there is still listening"
29:38,420;29:41,580;"to this, you can fill us in on what that means."
29:41,580;29:43,260;"- Yeah, that'd be a deal."
29:43,260;29:48,260;"- Next one is Tom Brady able to step up into the pocket"
29:48,260;29:50,220;"and put some juice on it."
29:50,220;29:52,100;"Is that football or not football?"
29:52,100;29:55,580;"- I think that's football."
29:55,580;29:58,420;"'Cause the pocket, I think we may have talked about"
29:58,420;30:00,500;"before is what the offense is."
30:00,500;30:01,620;"- I don't think we have."
30:01,620;30:02,460;"- No? All right."
30:02,460;30:07,740;"what the offensive line tries to create around Tom Brady to keep the defenders off of him."
30:07,740;30:09,820;"Like a little wall shaped. Yeah."
30:09,820;30:14,940;"No, no, that's why they call it a wall. That's called the pocket because it's curved."
30:14,940;30:15,900;"So they have to call it a pocket."
30:15,900;30:17,660;"Because he's in it. Yeah."
30:17,660;30:19,500;"You don't put things in walls, right?"
30:19,500;30:21,660;"So what is putting juice on the pocket, man?"
30:21,660;30:27,660;"I think the juice was about the football and how hard he threw it because I got to say Tom"
30:27,660;30:30,060;"Or you can fucking hook a football back in 2001."
30:30,060;30:31,860;"Oh, okay."
30:31,860;30:34,940;"There's kind of like the high cheese in baseball."
30:34,940;30:36,740;"I don't know."
30:36,740;30:37,060;"Yeah."
30:37,060;30:37,740;"So it's like, yeah."
30:37,740;30:38,340;"How I get it."
30:38,340;30:39,820;"I come to Red Joe's and say that."
30:39,820;30:40,300;"Yeah."
30:40,300;30:40,820;"I don't know."
30:40,820;30:42,380;"Put some juice in the baby."
30:42,380;30:43,740;"OK, so that makes sense."
30:43,740;30:45,700;"So step up in the pocket and put some juice on it."
30:45,700;30:46,100;"OK."
30:46,100;30:46,580;"Yeah."
30:46,580;30:50,940;"Um, maybe this one he was talking about Rob Johnson."
30:50,940;30:52,860;"I don't know anything about Rob Johnson."
30:52,860;30:56,540;"And I don't know if it pertains to this, but he said he needed about six"
30:56,540;30:57,800;"inches and he has it."
30:57,800;31:02,180;"Is that football or football?"
31:02,180;31:03,400;"I don't know what you think about him."
31:03,400;31:06,220;"Dick's inches hard."
31:06,220;31:09,180;"Well, I don't think it was the"
31:09,180;31:10,880;"I don't know where it's right."
31:10,880;31:12,980;"Well, guys, I don't know what we're"
31:12,980;31:13,820;"talking about."
31:13,820;31:15,620;"Well, I mean, it makes a big"
31:15,620;31:16,620;"difference."
31:16,620;31:17,460;"Six inches."
31:17,460;31:18,820;"Well, it's a game of inches, right?"
31:18,820;31:19,820;"So I figure."
31:19,820;31:20,820;"Yeah."
31:20,820;31:23,460;"Six inches is a big man on that field."
31:23,460;31:24,100;"Right."
31:24,100;31:26,060;"If one inch is important and like how"
31:26,060;31:29,660;"you use that one inch in the game of inches and six inches has got to be pretty good."
31:29,660;31:31,540;"Above average."
31:31,540;31:34,180;"Yeah, I would think so."
31:34,180;31:35,980;"So that's a football thing."
31:35,980;31:37,460;"Yep."
31:37,460;31:37,780;"Yeah."
31:37,780;31:38,420;"Okay."
31:38,420;31:38,780;"Cool."
31:38,780;31:43,180;"I think the last one, and this was the most confusing for me."
31:43,180;31:45,740;"He was under pressure and had to get it off."
31:45,740;31:49,380;"Well, you've never been under pressure."
31:49,380;31:50,660;"They had to get it off, Mike."
31:50,660;31:53,300;"Uh, I've never played football like this."
31:53,300;31:53,940;"I've never been."
31:53,940;31:59,520;"Not in front of 50,000 people. I don't think you hear the garage door opening. You're like, oh no"
31:59,520;32:08,860;"gross"
32:08,860;32:15,140;"I believe it"
32:15,140;32:23,320;"Never I did have that scenario though, but I was watching I think it was MTV programming in my room and I heard footsteps"
32:23,320;32:30,480;"up. So yeah. All right. Well, thanks guys. I'm gonna, I'm gonna try to understand these"
32:30,480;32:36,120;"things a little bit better. But, uh, Brent Jones, he, he, he's a man of words. Now, is"
32:36,120;32:42,920;"this just a Brent Jones thing or Gus Johnson would never say these things? How dare you?"
32:42,920;32:51,400;"I mean, it hasn't just been Gus, uh, hasn't just been. But no, but he seems to bring out"
32:51,400;32:53,320;"the best in these questions."
32:53,320;32:58,960;"He did start this whole thing because it seems like everything he says is multi layered"
32:58,960;33:00,600;"and he's a little bit more intelligent than I am."
33:00,600;33:01,600;"So yeah."
33:01,600;33:02,600;"Yeah."
33:02,600;33:03,600;"Yeah."
33:03,600;33:04,600;"Yeah."
33:04,600;33:10,840;"He also got super excited when they were showing CMGI Stadium."
33:10,840;33:13,280;"I miss that."
33:13,280;33:16,800;"He was like, you know what my favorite part of that stadium is?"
33:16,800;33:18,720;"Canadian Blue Steel."
33:18,720;33:20,000;"Oh, right."
33:20,000;33:21,160;"Yeah."
33:21,160;33:23,480;"I'm guessing Brent Jones is Canadian."
33:23,480;33:25,600;"Stat check."
33:25,600;33:26,920;"I got it."
33:26,920;33:29,000;"You got it, Greg."
33:29,000;33:30,000;"Yeah, I got it."
33:30,000;33:36,360;"Yeah, how come Gus Johnson doesn't say anything like this?"
33:36,360;33:39,040;"He's from Santa Clara, California."
33:39,040;33:42,680;"Maybe a stock in Canadian steel."
33:42,680;33:47,600;"Hey, can we write Brent Jones an email about this?"
33:47,600;33:49,360;"Because maybe we should."
33:49,360;33:51,080;"I wonder if we can have Brent Jones on."
33:51,080;33:52,960;"Dude, let's do it."
33:52,960;33:58,000;"And I'm going to try to understand everything that he says when he's on the podcast,"
33:58,000;34:00,960;"because I might have to go back, listen to it decipher it and ask you guys."
34:00,960;34:06,160;"Oh, he has some political possible political aspirations."
34:06,160;34:08,560;"Well, he shouldn't."
34:08,560;34:09,640;"He shouldn't do that."
34:09,640;34:14,480;"Not listening back in 2010."
34:14,480;34:16,280;"I see."
34:16,280;34:17,440;"Interesting."
34:17,960;34:20,160;"There's a lot of tape on what this man has said."
34:20,160;34:21,160;"And I don't know."
34:21,160;34:22,480;"Hey, he was a tight end."
34:22,480;34:25,400;"Mike, what does that make you think?"
34:25,400;34:29,480;"That he played a position on offense."
34:29,480;34:31,400;"OK."
34:31,400;34:33,280;"Yeah, you get confused easily."
34:33,280;34:34,000;"So I don't know."
34:34,000;34:34,560;"Oh, yeah."
34:34,560;34:36,080;"No, oh, that's fair."
34:36,080;34:37,800;"That's fair."
34:37,800;34:40,480;"I'm not going to go against that."
34:40,480;34:42,440;"Sometimes we've got to dumb it down for you."
34:42,440;34:43,360;"Yeah, that's right."
34:43,360;34:44,480;"Yeah, no."
34:44,480;34:45,000;"All right."
34:45,000;34:47,000;"Speaking of speaking of tight ends"
34:47,000;34:52,580;"I don't think the Patriots have any because do they?"
34:52,580;34:55,920;"Then I haven't seen the complete a pass with tight ends"
34:55,920;34:57,820;"We get this oh"
34:57,820;35:02,440;"Yeah, that's right Wiggins had one catch because I remember it because he tried to juke a guy"
35:02,440;35:08,560;"And he jumped and got his feet caught and landed square on his face and had to come off immediately"
35:09,560;35:10,400;"Oh, that's right."
35:10,400;35:12,180;"It was one of those hits where the whole,"
35:12,180;35:13,200;"like when he hit the ground,"
35:13,200;35:15,600;"like everybody in the crowd went, oh."
35:15,600;35:18,960;"And you're wondering if he's gonna get up"
35:18,960;35:23,200;"'cause he's not an agile fella, that one."
35:23,200;35:24,920;"Wasn't there like a Rutledge?"
35:24,920;35:25,920;"Was it on the team?"
35:25,920;35:30,960;"I think that was, I think that may have been 2000."
35:30,960;35:32,080;"Oh, okay."
35:32,080;35:32,920;"I wanna say."
35:32,920;35:34,520;"Well done, yeah, Wiggins."
35:34,520;35:35,360;"Yeah."
35:37,640;35:40,640;"Yeah, he didn't do enough for me to put any notes in."
35:40,640;35:42,980;"The only tight end in this game that got notes from me"
35:42,980;35:46,920;"where it was Jay Reamerzma, 652."
35:46,920;35:48,040;"Big fucker."
35:48,040;35:49,840;"Doesn't wear gloves."
35:49,840;35:51,840;"He was definitely a hard O."
35:51,840;35:54,960;"And he was also the holder on the Buffalo Bills field goal"
35:54,960;35:56,320;"attempts."
35:56,320;35:58,520;"So if you caught that."
35:58,520;36:00,680;"So fuck yeah."
36:00,680;36:01,960;"That's pretty awesome."
36:01,960;36:04,040;"Yeah."
36:04,040;36:06,800;"What are your thoughts on the tight end progression"
36:06,800;36:12,400;"for the Patriots because it went interesting like it was like nothing."
36:12,400;36:16,920;"And then they went to that two tight ends with Hernandez and Gronk."
36:16,920;36:21,760;"And it now looks like they're coming back out with like the no theory again."
36:21,760;36:26,760;"Well, I think, well, Bell check's always consistently drafted tight ends."
36:26,760;36:31,160;"He just hasn't, he didn't have any success until the, he just managed as Gronk"
36:31,160;36:31,680;"Kowski. Yeah."
36:31,680;36:36,320;"Cause I mean, he drafted Watts and he drafted Daniel Graham."
36:36,520;36:40,720;"you know, for a like he's he's been drafting tight ends for his whole career."
36:40,720;36:42,440;"Wait, I thought for you it was a trade."
36:42,440;36:44,640;"I may have been."
36:44,640;36:46,880;"But yeah, he likes to believe."
36:46,880;36:47,440;"Sorry."
36:47,440;36:49,880;"I got a few some wiggans for whatever reason."
36:49,880;36:53,760;"That was such a weapon when they had Hernandez and grogg together."
36:53,760;36:54,880;"Oh, God, yeah."
36:54,880;36:58,280;"That's the one time when I remember thinking like, there's there's nothing"
36:58,280;36:59,800;"people can do to stop this."
36:59,800;37:01,560;"You can't because they can do whatever they want."
37:01,560;37:03,080;"Now he's in the lead."
37:03,080;37:05,600;"Well, that hasn't really been replicated since."
37:05,800;37:10,360;"So you'd think that somebody would give it a shot, but."
37:10,360;37:12,240;"I think finding"
37:12,240;37:13,240;"no pun intended."
37:13,240;37:13,640;"That's right."
37:13,640;37:14,800;"And positions hard to do."
37:14,800;37:18,160;"Sorry."
37:18,160;37:20,160;"Got our own Brent Jones up in here."
37:20,160;37:21,000;"Yeah."
37:21,000;37:24,760;"But yeah, no, that was pretty great."
37:24,760;37:28,440;"I mean, Gronkowski is like his own thing, right?"
37:28,440;37:31,000;"So I mean, that was what it was."
37:31,000;37:32,080;"I don't know, man."
37:32,080;37:34,440;"I think that the game's changing too."
37:34,440;37:38,680;"We're like now in the game. I think there's like three dominant tight ends. They're all super fast"
37:38,680;37:44,640;"Agile and then like you don't really hear about it with like anybody else and with teams like"
37:44,640;37:47,720;"Baltimore, you know, they got like a whole different system"
37:47,720;37:52,280;"So yeah, I don't know. I mean obviously the Chiefs have a good one"
37:52,280;37:58,400;"Bengals, you know off and on but you don't really hear about it too much anymore for some reason"
37:58,400;38:04,420;"Yeah, the Ravens are kind of doing it this year where they're like tight ends have more catches than their waters"
38:04,420;38:08,420;"receivers. Oh, really? I don't know that. And they're rotating like three of them in there."
38:08,420;38:14,580;"Yeah. Yeah. I think it's, I mean, the NFL is all cyclical anyway. So it's a matter of time."
38:14,580;38:19,540;"You're actually starting to see the resurgence of fullbacks come back too, you know, with the 49ers"
38:19,540;38:24,180;"as well as the true Ravens and things like that. Yeah, it'd be like just a personnel thing too,"
38:24,180;38:30,020;"right? Yeah. Yeah. But I think that those, all those sorts of positions are now being asked to do"
38:30,020;38:34,180;"more. So you have to have a full back who can catch now. Although I suppose if you're looking at"
38:34,180;38:41,140;"2001, you've got Mark Edwards, who is like, at least through the first three or four weeks was like"
38:41,140;38:46,660;"the weapon that they kept going to. What about Sam Gash? You remember him? Yeah, he was kind of"
38:46,660;38:51,780;"a one trick pony though. He was. Yeah, I thought he was good for a pass here. Yeah, but so was Brian"
38:51,780;38:58,660;"Cox. So I mean, true. What did the guy on the Patriots say? Say, I see motherfuckers and I hit"
38:58,660;39:02,020;"getting me or something. I run through a motherfucker. Yeah."
39:02,020;39:05,180;"Offense defensive special teams."
39:05,180;39:07,900;"Too bad he couldn't run for one yard."
39:07,900;39:10,220;"Hey, yeah."
39:10,220;39:12,660;"I'm sorry."
39:12,660;39:15,140;"Speaking of two players, they hear it."
39:15,140;39:19,140;"Speaking of two way players though,"
39:19,140;39:23,340;"did anybody else see that Terrell Buckley was playing wide receiver again this"
39:23,340;39:26,420;"game? That really that silly. Yeah."
39:27,140;39:31,540;"And they keep chucking bombs to him because that was Brady's interception in this game was"
39:31,540;39:36,820;"they decide to take a shot and then he threw a pick."
39:36,820;39:40,780;"But that shot was too Terrell Buckley again, which is very strange."
39:40,780;39:44,060;"I was like watching in and out and then I came back to that play."
39:44,060;39:44,900;"Yeah."
39:44,900;39:47,740;"I just saw the two of them like jumping up for a jump ball."
39:47,740;39:49,100;"And I'm like, what the hell is going on here?"
39:49,100;39:51,180;"Why is he number 27?"
39:51,180;39:51,980;"Let me see."
39:51,980;39:54,740;"It seemed like a bad ball to or bad decision, obviously."
39:56,060;39:59,600;"Yeah, I mean, I think it was one of those design because I want to say the"
39:59,600;40:03,260;"pages had just got the ball back."
40:03,260;40:08,640;"But I think they just gotten like, uh, I can't find it."
40:08,640;40:11,040;"My, yeah, they got it back the next play."
40:11,040;40:12,040;"Yeah."
40:12,040;40:12,380;"Yeah."
40:12,380;40:14,200;"So yeah, bills, yeah, the bills went through."
40:14,200;40:18,440;"Oh, the, the Patriots scored the touchdown to fall, the brave to fall off"
40:18,440;40:19,980;"of Troy Brown's nice punt return."
40:19,980;40:22,320;"Wait, are we getting ahead of ourselves here?"
40:22,320;40:24,560;"No, so this is first quarter."
40:24,560;40:25,200;"Okay."
40:25,680;40:27,000;"And then the bills went three and out."
40:27,000;40:31,200;"And so then like the first play off of the next"
40:31,200;40:34,320;"punt return phrase, he took that shot on the first play."
40:34,320;40:37,080;"Yeah, I think they were just trying to like put the game away, you know."
40:37,080;40:39,320;"Didn't work."
40:39,320;40:40,320;"No, but."
40:40,320;40:47,360;"I thought Troy, I thought the Patriots special team in general had a pretty good game."
40:47,360;40:50,560;"Well, actually, I don't think anybody really had a good game in this."
40:50,560;40:53,320;"No, I mean, I had a 30 yard like punt rates."
40:53,320;40:54,160;"Turned to the first quarter though."
40:54,160;40:54,880;"It was pretty awesome."
40:54,880;40:56,680;"right on a 28 yard punt."
40:56,680;41:02,520;"Yeah, which will get it to the punting because that was pretty cool."
41:02,520;41:03,280;"Let's do it."
41:03,280;41:03,760;"Let's do it."
41:03,760;41:05,320;"We go to the pun thing."
41:05,320;41:05,920;"Yeah."
41:05,920;41:09,760;"Brian, give it to me."
41:09,760;41:10,880;"Give me some Brian Mormon."
41:10,880;41:11,800;"Yeah, man."
41:11,800;41:16,200;"I'm going to say this was almost like the best moment of the game for me."
41:16,200;41:21,200;"Um, but I would say the best play of the game is Brian Mormon, Bill's"
41:21,200;41:29,960;"he had a 20 yard punt from the 20 yard line to the 40. And on that play, which is pretty"
41:29,960;41:35,680;"sweet, a keen acbar actually touches the ball accidentally and the refs miss it. So the"
41:35,680;41:40,080;"Patriots should have lost that ball and they kind of break. So that play in general was"
41:40,080;41:44,240;"amazing. A 20 yard punt. It made it to like midfield."
41:44,240;41:48,800;"Yeah, that that bounce backwards like it hit the four like it hit like the 45 and bounce"
41:48,800;41:55,680;"backwards to the 40. Yeah. And it was that that would be topped by another punt from Brian"
41:55,680;42:01,680;"Mormon from his from the 50 yard line and made it to the 35. That's a 50 yard part."
42:01,680;42:13,200;"It was pretty awesome. He averaged his yards per punt. On the day he averaged 27.2 yards per"
42:14,800;42:20,200;"average that is amazing. I mean, what was wrong with them?"
42:20,200;42:29,440;"Most of the puns were into the way like it was a super windy game. And so it seemed like all of"
42:29,440;42:36,960;"his puns were towards the open end of the stadium. And like they were all really, really bad."
42:36,960;42:41,840;"Because because the first one he did, he did a line drive one. And it went 28 yards in Troy"
42:41,840;42:44,840;"Brown returned it for 32 or something like that."
42:44,840;42:48,840;"So we didn't try that again, but he kicked them straight up and they just hung."
42:48,840;42:50,840;"Oh, Brian."
42:50,840;42:51,840;"Yeah."
42:51,840;42:53,840;"Not great."
42:53,840;42:57,840;"Five puns, 136 yards average, 27.2."
42:57,840;43:00,840;"You know, that's what happens in six seasons, you know?"
43:00,840;43:02,840;"Yeah."
43:02,840;43:05,840;"I mean, they're hunting into the wind as they say."
43:05,840;43:06,840;"Yep."
43:06,840;43:09,840;"You think like that they would try some kind of different technique."
43:09,840;43:15,240;"something it was pretty rough every time but they just kept going for it."
43:15,240;43:23,920;"Yeah, it wasn't great. But I mean the kicking game in general was awful. They showed some"
43:23,920;43:30,840;"stat about Adam Minnitary kicking against the Bills and how bad he is. He was like a"
43:30,840;43:37,320;"70 or 80 percent kicker normally but in this game against the Bills he was like 50 something"
43:37,320;43:42,180;"percent field goal percentage, which is kind of strange."
43:42,180;43:43,800;"Oh, here it is."
43:43,800;43:47,800;"Vititary is 43 for 54 for 79.6%."
43:47,800;43:52,000;"So almost 80% on field goal attempts, which I love you is like a lot better at"
43:52,000;43:57,420;"this point than that, but yeah, that says his one week has been the bills against"
43:57,420;44:01,400;"whom he's managed only 58.3% field goal percentage."
44:01,400;44:03,000;"And he missed another one in this game."
44:03,000;44:04,120;"He missed two."
44:04,120;44:05,520;"He missed both of his field goals."
44:06,560;44:09,440;"So over to a field goals hit all three of his extra points."
44:09,440;44:11,720;"I think you just blame the wind in general."
44:11,720;44:15,940;"It looked like a bite like a couple of deep balls hung to and did some weird shit."
44:15,940;44:21,120;"So this was one of those old Foxboro games where the wind actually"
44:21,120;44:24,200;"mattered as opposed to here."
44:24,200;44:27,040;"Now where they say it matters, but you never really see it actually."
44:27,040;44:27,880;"Take it back."
44:27,880;44:29,240;"You're absolutely right though."
44:29,240;44:34,360;"That like most everyone had a crap game."
44:34,720;44:41,400;"I'm looking at Brady's numbers and he was 15 for 21, which isn't bad for a hundred seven yards. Yeah, to touch down interception."
44:41,400;44:45,160;"Kevin Falk was the leading receiver with 29 yards."
44:45,160;44:55,360;"He did good. Yeah, the run game was solid, you know, 24 102 touchdowns. That's what you want."
44:55,360;45:02,680;"It is. But I think that was also skewed by the run at the end. The big was it 40 something yard run."
45:03,040;45:04,040;"That's true."
45:04,040;45:05,040;"He's left."
45:05,040;45:06,040;"He's left."
45:06,040;45:08,040;"He was breaking tackles."
45:08,040;45:09,040;"Oh, yeah."
45:09,040;45:11,280;"Well, because that's the thing."
45:11,280;45:17,760;"Let's talk about Antoine Smith too, because he was a former Buffalo Bill and in '98, he'd"
45:17,760;45:23,320;"actually run for 1,100 yards and eight touchdowns."
45:23,320;45:27,360;"And then they got a new, I think offensive coordinator head coach or something like that"
45:27,360;45:29,040;"whole new system."
45:29,040;45:37,440;"And basically they said, like the common taste, we're saying that the new, yeah, he ran for"
45:37,440;45:42,560;"it. The new coach just basically didn't like him. So it just stopped playing him. So then"
45:42,560;45:48,040;"he ran for 600 yards in 99 and 300 yards in 2000."
45:48,040;45:55,480;"Who was Rob Johnson blowing in that front office? And we got in front of both studs."
45:55,480;45:58,600;"Yeah, is that a football question or not football question?"
45:58,600;46:01,000;"Both."
46:01,000;46:01,840;"Yeah."
46:01,840;46:08,040;"Yeah, I mean, he spent, I didn't want to spend it like the entire week before and"
46:08,040;46:12,120;"all the post games and how this wasn't like a revenge game."
46:12,120;46:15,800;"He's not angry at anybody because the people that gave up on him weren't even"
46:15,800;46:17,760;"there anymore, like coach wise and stuff."
46:17,760;46:22,040;"But he still was running like he was pissed off."
46:22,080;46:26,120;"Well, I think this is the hardest I've seen him run so far this season."
46:26,120;46:29,640;"And he's still got like clearly got a ton left in the tank too."
46:29,640;46:31,000;"I mean, oh, yeah."
46:31,000;46:35,080;"I can say we know that now, but why would you give up on a guy like that?"
46:35,080;46:37,920;"The same reason you give up on a guy like Doug Flute."
46:37,920;46:39,840;"Yeah."
46:39,840;46:40,280;"Yeah."
46:40,280;46:45,280;"I mean, I was in the soul and imagine like you're you're taking over a team."
46:45,280;46:47,160;"You kind of want you to put your stamp on it."
46:47,160;46:50,040;"Like I know a lot of guys want to distance themselves from like anybody"
46:50,040;46:52,360;"that the DM put in place beforehand."
46:52,360;46:55,160;"So it's probably a situation where you just want to do"
46:55,160;46:57,680;"his own guys and to prove a point, whatever."
46:57,680;46:59,800;"- Yeah, that's a good point."
46:59,800;47:01,280;"- Yeah."
47:01,280;47:02,640;"You gotta agree with that."
47:02,640;47:04,400;"- Bullshit though, you know?"
47:04,400;47:05,240;"- Yeah."
47:05,240;47:06,560;"- It is, I mean, yeah."
47:06,560;47:07,640;"- Yeah, I'll be,"
47:07,640;47:09,320;"play to the talent that you have."
47:09,320;47:12,640;"I mean, look at what they've done with the Ravens this year."
47:12,640;47:13,480;"It's like,"
47:13,480;47:14,640;"- Right."
47:14,640;47:16,400;"- You have a running quarterback that can do things"
47:16,400;47:18,640;"like that, build the system around them."
47:18,640;47:19,680;"- Right, yeah."
47:19,680;47:25,040;"much ego. Yeah. Like these numbers, like even riding the bench, like they weren't horrible."
47:25,040;47:31,840;"So I mean, to your point, they probably should have trusted them with the football a little"
47:31,840;47:39,880;"bit more. We should be coaches. I think so. I mean, I'm in line for the Belichick position"
47:39,880;47:41,960;"whenever he wants to give that up."
47:41,960;47:47,040;"Well, you know, positional coach type of guy might, you know, well, I don't know. I mean,"
47:47,040;47:51,280;"I'm low and they give it a shot, but I'm not freaking waiting around 20 more years to accept the job."
47:51,280;47:51,840;"Believe me."
47:51,840;47:53,840;"He's you strike me as a punters coach."
47:53,840;47:55,160;"Yeah, man."
47:55,160;47:58,200;"Joe judge special teams guy."
47:58,200;47:59,680;"Head coach of the giant."
47:59,680;48:02,480;"See, so there is an avenue there, guys."
48:02,480;48:05,960;"Mike, Mike, how are you going to be a coach when you don't even know what's football and not?"
48:05,960;48:09,760;"That's a damn it."
48:09,760;48:10,320;"You're right."
48:10,320;48:15,120;"Speaking of not knowing their football."
48:16,520;48:21,380;"Uh, I thought like we were talking about everybody not having a great game."
48:21,380;48:23,600;"Uh, Brady's play at the end."
48:23,600;48:26,440;"Well, we're talking about the end already."
48:26,440;48:31,760;"Cause man, I mean, there's just like a lot of shit football every quarter."
48:31,760;48:35,120;"I don't know if you've noticed, but we are all over the fucking place this week."
48:35,120;48:37,640;"So yeah, I'm going to jump to the end and we can jump back later."
48:37,640;48:38,000;"Don't worry."
48:38,000;48:38,440;"All right."
48:38,440;48:39,200;"Fair enough."
48:39,200;48:39,840;"Fair enough."
48:39,840;48:44,860;"Cause I wanted to point out Brady's, uh, kind of very unbrady, like rookie"
48:44,860;48:46,460;"mistake at the end there."
48:46,460;48:52,220;"Pats up by two scores and they're running the ball with"
48:52,220;48:53,220;"relative ease."
48:53,220;48:56,180;"And for some reason the paths start calling like play action"
48:56,180;48:58,340;"passes when they have no reason to."
48:58,340;49:03,620;"And so Brady fixed play action rolls to his right."
49:03,620;49:06,300;"And there's a defender like in his face."
49:06,300;49:11,300;"He tries to like I want to say he was trying to juke."
49:12,940;49:16,020;"But if you've seen Tom Brady run, you can kind of imagine what that looks like."
49:16,020;49:17,860;"And so he does it."
49:17,860;49:23,140;"And the, the, the defensive end just kind of slaps the ball out of his hand and then"
49:23,140;49:29,280;"kicks it 20 yards backwards and the bills end up recovering it and scoring a"
49:29,280;49:33,820;"touchdown like two plays later to make the game uncomfortably close."
49:33,820;49:34,740;"Yeah."
49:34,740;49:38,820;"Let's say it was a learning experience for Brady this game because it was pretty"
49:38,820;49:39,820;"awful throughout."
49:40,780;49:44,520;"But I don't know if it's entirely his fault because"
49:44,520;49:50,860;"they there was I think six sacks on them by the time the fourth quarter started."
49:50,860;49:51,520;"Yep."
49:51,520;49:57,260;"So and I think in the by half he was sacked like four or five times."
49:57,260;50:01,100;"So I don't think he's been pressured like that this season."
50:01,100;50:01,540;"Yeah."
50:01,540;50:04,500;"He was well other than the Miami Dolphins game."
50:04,500;50:05,180;"Oh, sure."
50:05,180;50:05,700;"Yeah."
50:05,700;50:09,500;"Had that almost exact play where Brady Fumble the snap."
50:09,500;50:15,460;"And then the, the, was a, the right guard did a beautiful back heel to kick it back 20"
50:15,460;50:17,860;"yards at the, the dolphins are covered for a touchdown."
50:17,860;50:18,260;"Yeah."
50:18,260;50:20,060;"He was sacked seven times in this game."
50:20,060;50:21,100;"Seven man."
50:21,100;50:22,500;"And yeah, he fumbled twice."
50:22,500;50:23,500;"He had the pick."
50:23,500;50:25,340;"Yeah."
50:25,340;50:28,940;"And the bills, the bill for the backs were sacked five times."
50:28,940;50:34,060;"So this was not an offensive display by any stretch of the imagination."
50:34,060;50:35,100;"Well, right."
50:35,100;50:39,180;"And I believe, I believe every year in sack to drop back ratio."
50:39,300;50:42,140;"I guess who did Rob Johnson."
50:42,140;50:43,500;"Yeah, I can see it."
50:43,500;50:44,000;"Yeah."
50:44,000;50:47,540;"I don't know the Brady's decisions at the end, though,"
50:47,540;50:52,140;"like you were saying, I wouldn't say that this game was a blowout"
50:52,140;50:54,220;"because they were up by it."
50:54,220;50:58,220;"Whoa, was it like 14, whatever it was like less than two touchdowns?"
50:58,220;50:59,340;"Fourteen three."
50:59,340;51:00,660;"Fourteen three."
51:00,660;51:05,740;"And then after that play, yeah, Pulitzer's price got the touchdown."
51:05,740;51:08,580;"So it's 14 11 after a two point conversion."
51:08,580;51:13,480;"And so yeah, that one decision made it a close game, even though it shouldn't have been to"
51:13,480;51:16,720;"your point, they should they could have just run the timeout and I don't know why they"
51:16,720;51:21,240;"were getting all cute and fancy, but yeah, that's what I was wondering is like, I mean,"
51:21,240;51:25,160;"you still on a rookie quarterback who's been sacked seven times."
51:25,160;51:31,200;"Well, probably six times, I suppose that probably counted as a sack, the fumble."
51:31,200;51:34,760;"Why are you having him roll out on a bootleg?"
51:34,760;51:39,760;"And the bills, they went for an on-side kicking, almost got it."
51:39,760;51:45,320;"It was recovered by our very own, unlike Vrayble."
51:45,320;51:46,160;"- Yes."
51:46,160;51:50,640;"- You know, sore spot right there, but yeah,"
51:50,640;51:51,720;"they almost got the on-side kick."
51:51,720;51:53,280;"So if they got it, this would have been"
51:53,280;51:55,000;"potentially a different game."
51:55,000;51:58,600;"And yeah, we're not, even at this point,"
51:58,600;52:01,920;"I don't think we were used to seeing Brady make,"
52:01,920;52:04,040;"you know, these decisions."
52:04,040;52:09,040;"So it was interesting to, I'm sure you saw some of this,"
52:09,040;52:11,200;"but in reading some of the articles,"
52:11,200;52:14,880;"'cause now there's about 50,000 articles written every game"
52:14,880;52:17,480;"that we have to sift through during this time."
52:17,480;52:20,760;"But they were talking to him about it."
52:20,760;52:22,360;"And he did say that it was a learning experience."
52:22,360;52:25,200;"And it was, I think the first time where he was coming off"
52:25,200;52:27,400;"a little bit more humble than like confident,"
52:27,400;52:32,640;"which was, I think probably good for this moment in the season."
52:32,640;52:34,880;"- Yeah, the quote that I wrote down was,"
52:34,880;52:37,120;"you'd like to play great every,"
52:37,120;52:38,120;"this is Tom Bray talking,"
52:38,120;52:39,440;"you'd like to play great every week,"
52:39,440;52:42,800;"but I'm finding out that's not always the case in this league."
52:42,800;52:44,160;"- Yeah, so that was a little different"
52:44,160;52:45,840;"than what we've heard before."
52:45,840;52:48,080;"- Yeah, oh yeah."
52:48,080;52:50,360;"And then in that same article was the quote,"
52:50,360;52:52,120;"yesterday certainly was an education"
52:52,120;52:54,400;"in adversity for the second year novice."
52:54,400;52:57,040;"He learned he could overcome a rash of misadventures."
52:57,040;52:58,760;"He completed 15 of 21 passes,"
52:58,760;53:01,120;"but they travel only 107 yards."
53:01,120;53:05,760;"as long as connection was a 38 yard to Anne Juan Winfield of Buffalo."
53:05,760;53:08,160;"Yeah, that's pretty rough."
53:08,160;53:16,040;"And again, it's pretty amazing though that Dollar Check stuck with him because I don't know."
53:16,040;53:19,960;"I mean, we saw what stid him, you know, he throws one pick six and, you know, he, you know,"
53:19,960;53:20,760;"replays again."
53:20,760;53:26,720;"So, you know, and this is right around the time that Bledso was starting to come back."
53:26,720;53:30,560;"Um, I think we were expecting him to be ready the next week."
53:30,560;53:35,560;"So the fact that Brady won that amazes me looking back on it."
53:35,560;53:37,760;"Yeah, I'm a little sub..."
53:37,760;53:40,960;"It almost makes you feel like the situation is different."
53:40,960;53:46,160;"I mean, I don't know if things would have been different"
53:46,160;53:50,080;"if say Jimmy Garoppolo had stayed healthy"
53:50,080;53:53,600;"for those first four games a few years ago."
53:53,600;53:55,600;"And if he had won all four of those games,"
53:55,600;53:57,680;"if you would have seen something similar."
53:58,720;54:00,720;"I don't know."
54:00,720;54:01,720;"Wow."
54:01,720;54:06,720;"Because it feels like a similar situation where you knew that the start is coming back."
54:06,720;54:12,720;"But if the guy that plays those first four games gets you to this point, I mean, obviously,"
54:12,720;54:14,720;"these are more than four games."
54:14,720;54:18,720;"But if he gets you to this point, and I think at that point,"
54:18,720;54:24,720;"Garoppolo was playing better than before he got hurt than Brady was playing here."
54:24,720;54:29,720;"playing here. So I'm not quite sure how that would work out. But yeah, you're right."
54:29,720;54:39,040;"Blood. So it was announced that he was cleared by the medical staff to play this the following"
54:39,040;54:44,240;"week here against the Rams coming up. So yeah, I'm assuming that's gonna be the whole next"
54:44,240;54:45,240;"week of."
54:45,240;54:46,240;"Bloods articles."
54:46,240;54:48,240;"articles"
54:48,240;54:50,400;"Terrible year. Yeah"
54:50,400;54:54,600;"Yeah, that's true. I mean and it was it wasn't it was a guy. I"
54:54,600;54:57,600;"Mean he had a lot of pics as usual"
54:57,600;55:02,560;"You know, I think I think the whole thing was that"
55:02,560;55:08,520;"Like the only thing that team had offensive would you bled so and he dragged them to five and eleven"
55:08,520;55:11,840;"Right I"
55:11,840;55:14,880;"Mean Belichick though. He's a decision-making"
55:15,360;55:23,300;"You know guy right so Brady Brady makes sound decisions for the most part great game manager at this point didn't make a lot of mistakes"
55:23,300;55:29,000;"but I mean obviously, you know he references Brady now is iconic in in"
55:29,000;55:34,160;"Boston and for the Patriots well Bledo was pretty iconic as well at the time"
55:34,160;55:37,520;"Oh, yes, so I don't know if it was the easiest decision"
55:37,520;55:42,400;"I mean again, it obviously helps because it was Parcel's guy not his own right"
55:43,320;55:48,120;"But yeah, it's your point. I mean, I wonder what would have happened with the Garoppolo thing"
55:48,120;55:53,400;"I mean obviously luckily it happened the way that it happened. They made another three Super Bowls, but"
55:53,400;55:56,480;"That's a good point. I don't know how it would have played out if"
55:56,480;55:58,640;"Bursett didn't"
55:58,640;56:05,280;"Jump in there. Mmm. All right. So anything anybody else have anything they want to touch on in this game"
56:05,280;56:12,400;"Other than that it was absolute crap. Yeah, it was a bit of a slog to get through"
56:12,400;56:14,560;"Oh, good thing I didn't watch it then."
56:14,560;56:18,760;"Way to break the fourth wall, Steve."
56:18,760;56:19,360;"I know."
56:19,360;56:20,120;"Thanks a lot."
56:20,120;56:20,120;"All right."
56:20,120;56:21,560;"And that case, that's the worst."
56:21,560;56:22,480;"Steve, did you?"
56:22,480;56:24,240;"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
56:24,240;56:26,840;"Did you end up watching the highlights at least?"
56:26,840;56:28,560;"No, nothing."
56:28,560;56:29,240;"Not even did."
56:29,240;56:29,560;"All right."
56:29,560;56:30,520;"Good for you."
56:30,520;56:31,480;"OK, you know what?"
56:31,480;56:35,800;"The I actually found highlights because, well, I assume Greg wouldn't watch a game."
56:35,800;56:38,600;"So he proved me wrong."
56:38,600;56:39,240;"So thanks, Greg."
56:39,240;56:41,200;"I watched the first half."
56:41,200;56:42,200;"There you go."
56:42,200;56:46,760;"But the highlights I found were actually NFL prime time highlights."
56:46,760;56:48,280;"Yeah, I watch those too."
56:48,280;56:50,040;"Yeah, just in case."
56:50,040;56:51,160;"I love those."
56:51,160;56:59,360;"Dude, I will say on top of the bad play, obviously, there were so many flags on the"
56:59,360;57:01,680;"bills and Patriots."
57:01,680;57:04,160;"It was almost painful to sit through."
57:04,160;57:10,480;"I think the announcers were getting a little antsy too, but obviously not the Belichick"
57:10,480;57:17,480;"type of team and whatnot that we're used to, but so many on both sides."
57:17,480;57:20,920;"Like, so I obviously the the referees were shit or something."
57:20,920;57:22,480;"Yeah, they weren't great."
57:22,480;57:24,480;"I don't know, that was rough."
57:24,480;57:29,280;"I think like it'd be interesting to touch on some of the stuff that was going on around"
57:29,280;57:30,440;"this game as well."
57:30,440;57:35,480;"Some of the notes that he had Andy on Terry Glenn, I thought were pretty interesting."
57:35,480;57:36,480;"Yeah."
57:36,480;57:39,480;"Yeah, we're here we go."
57:39,480;57:47,160;"So this is still kind of in the peak Terry Glenn saga of will he ever play for the Patriots"
57:47,160;57:49,160;"again?"
57:49,160;57:57,960;"And the story that came out in kind of the aftermath of last week's game on Tuesday in"
57:57,960;58:03,120;"the Boston Globe was that Terry Glenn has depression."
58:03,120;58:08,500;"And it was, as a quote, ""is Glenn confirmed that chronic depression is the physical disability"
58:08,500;58:13,380;"cited as the reason the receiver was unable to take his mandated drug test at the appointed"
58:13,380;58:17,300;"time during the off season that tardiness earned glenna four game suspension at the"
58:17,300;58:21,580;"start of the season. That is not to be confused with the season long banishment bellow trek"
58:21,580;58:25,820;"jai twin pose when glam bolted from training camp because he felt the team wasn't being"
58:25,820;58:29,700;"supportive enough in his protest of the league sentence."
58:29,700;58:30,700;"Right."
58:30,700;58:35,140;"So now we get into like the whole like housewives of Orange County."
58:35,140;58:38,140;"Hey, I don't necessarily agree with that."
58:38,140;58:39,140;"You said it a bit."
58:39,140;58:41,140;"I could tell it in your voice."
58:41,140;58:43,140;"All right, give it to me then."
58:43,140;58:44,140;"Give me your side of this."
58:44,140;58:45,140;"Well, I don't know."
58:45,140;58:57,140;"It's tough because I feel like for them to be talking about depression, that was like almost like ahead of its time because you I didn't really hear this kind of stuff being talked about a sort of taboo back then."
58:57,140;59:03,140;"And for us to hear this, I mean, obviously he's putting it out there at the time, but"
59:03,140;59:08,580;"for us to hear this without like social media, there's definitely a stigma attached to it."
59:08,580;59:12,500;"Now, does he advance that, you know, lessening of the stigma?"
59:12,500;59:19,420;"I don't know because I don't know if he was using it to justify his, you know, his actions"
59:19,420;59:22,060;"to provide an excuse or if he was actually dealing with this."
59:22,060;59:25,820;"But we do know that he had, you know, substance issues."
59:25,820;59:29,060;"We see a little bit of that with Josh Gordon."
59:29,060;59:31,900;"And he hasn't necessarily described depression,"
59:31,900;59:35,260;"but I know that there's a lot of things"
59:35,260;59:39,380;"that go into addiction, depression, anxiety."
59:39,380;59:42,300;"And we're finding out a little bit more about that now."
59:42,300;59:45,340;"Even guys like Antonio Brown, where we're not quite"
59:45,340;59:47,540;"sure what's going on, he seems like he's just kind of show"
59:47,540;59:48,260;"boating."
59:48,260;59:50,340;"There could be something a little bit deeper,"
59:50,340;59:51,420;"a little bit of depression."
59:51,420;59:53,300;"Who knows?"
59:53,300;59:57,500;"But we do know that with Terry Glenn, it manifested in substance abuse."
59:57,500;01:00:02,380;"So maybe the way that he went about doing it wasn't the right way,"
01:00:02,380;01:00:08,340;"but I feel like the infrastructure wasn't in place for sure back then to help a"
01:00:08,340;01:00:10,060;"guy who's dealing with like problems."
01:00:10,060;01:00:15,220;"And like maybe I'm off base and maybe he was sort of like using that as a"
01:00:15,220;01:00:20,140;"crutch or like a reason to get because there was also a dispute where the"
01:00:20,140;01:00:22,580;"Patriots had paid them, I think $11 million,"
01:00:22,580;01:00:25,500;"and they were holding $8 million of a signing bonus"
01:00:25,500;01:00:27,060;"because of all this."
01:00:27,060;01:00:29,980;"And that was sort of his reasoning"
01:00:29,980;01:00:31,060;"for trying to combat that."
01:00:31,060;01:00:34,860;"So again, is it the Antonio Brown thing where it's like,"
01:00:34,860;01:00:36,100;"hey, I'm gonna blame everybody else."
01:00:36,100;01:00:38,300;"I'm gonna put my blames on this or that."
01:00:38,300;01:00:39,620;"I'm gonna want my money back."
01:00:39,620;01:00:41,980;"Or is it that he was actually dealing with that?"
01:00:41,980;01:00:44,620;"And it just seems like an excuse"
01:00:44,620;01:00:46,460;"because we didn't really like hear"
01:00:46,460;01:00:47,860;"that kind of stuff back then."
01:00:47,860;01:00:49,300;"- Right. And I think that's a criticism."
01:00:49,300;01:00:55,620;"not that whether or not he has chronic depression or anything like that, which I mean looking"
01:00:55,620;01:01:02,620;"back on it now and kind of the tragic way that he ended, it's probably pretty obvious"
01:01:02,620;01:01:06,680;"that yeah, he had at least something, whether it was chronic depression or something even"
01:01:06,680;01:01:07,680;"more than that."
01:01:07,680;01:01:13,660;"I think it was pretty obvious that there was something going on with him."
01:01:13,660;01:01:21,020;"But yeah, the criticism was that this came out however many months after the fact."
01:01:21,020;01:01:25,660;"And now why is this coming out all of a sudden when there's this protracted legal battle?"
01:01:25,660;01:01:26,660;"Right."
01:01:26,660;01:01:29,660;"Like at the time, like why didn't it come out at the time?"
01:01:29,660;01:01:34,980;"And I think like my whole the reason for my comment about like, you know, housewives of"
01:01:34,980;01:01:39,980;"of Orange County was just the whole reason why of Glenn,"
01:01:39,980;01:01:43,020;"like basically leaving training camp"
01:01:43,020;01:01:45,100;"because the team wasn't being supported"
01:01:45,100;01:01:46,660;"enough of him sort of thing."
01:01:46,660;01:01:47,500;"- Right."
01:01:47,500;01:01:49,980;"I mean, and, you know, obviously I'm giving you shit,"
01:01:49,980;01:01:54,980;"but to your point, it's just tough to assess that situation,"
01:01:54,980;01:01:58,100;"especially without knowing what was going on"
01:01:58,100;01:01:59,500;"without social media."
01:01:59,500;01:02:02,940;"So it's just what we know based on what Terry Glenn told us"
01:02:02,940;01:02:04,580;"and the timing of it."
01:02:04,580;01:02:05,580;"I got to go guys."
01:02:05,580;01:02:06,580;"All right."
01:02:06,580;01:02:07,580;"Is that it?"
01:02:07,580;01:02:10,580;"Is he just going to say that leave?"
01:02:10,580;01:02:11,580;"Yep."
01:02:11,580;01:02:12,580;"Thanks."
01:02:12,580;01:02:13,580;"All right."
01:02:13,580;01:02:15,580;"Who do we have left?"
01:02:15,580;01:02:17,580;"Is Greg still here?"
01:02:17,580;01:02:18,580;"No, he left here."
01:02:18,580;01:02:20,580;"Just me and you."
01:02:20,580;01:02:21,580;"Awesome."
01:02:21,580;01:02:22,580;"Way to go guys."
01:02:22,580;01:02:25,580;"Way to, you know, well, we knew Greg was even."
01:02:25,580;01:02:26,580;"Right."
01:02:26,580;01:02:28,580;"Way to let them, uh, viewers now."
01:02:28,580;01:02:30,580;"But anyways, too, to wrap that up."
01:02:30,580;01:02:33,580;"I mean, I don't have to go."
01:02:33,580;01:02:35,580;"I'm really excited."
01:02:35,580;01:02:36,580;"I'm not just there."
01:02:36,580;01:02:37,580;"You have to go."
01:02:37,580;01:02:39,580;"Fuck out of here."
01:02:39,580;01:02:40,580;"Bye."
01:02:40,580;01:02:41,580;"Diddy."
01:02:41,580;01:02:42,580;"Where?"
01:02:42,580;01:02:44,580;"Oh, there's a chat here."
01:02:44,580;01:02:47,580;"He's got to say bye to the viewers, man."
01:02:47,580;01:02:48,580;"Oh, he's saying by them."
01:02:48,580;01:02:52,580;"And then I interrupted you twice, which is also going to fit the viewers."
01:02:52,580;01:02:53,580;"Yeah."
01:02:53,580;01:02:54,580;"I'm cutting this whole thing out."
01:02:54,580;01:02:56,580;"We're just going to play it off like you were."
01:02:56,580;01:02:57,580;"No, no, this is."
01:02:57,580;01:02:59,580;"We've been in there, man."
01:02:59,580;01:03:00,580;"Let it be messy."
01:03:00,580;01:03:01,580;"We'll see."
01:03:01,580;01:03:02,860;"I had to be messy."
01:03:02,860;01:03:03,860;"I don't even know."
01:03:03,860;01:03:04,860;"I gotta go fucking save."
01:03:04,860;01:03:05,860;"All right, then."
01:03:05,860;01:03:06,860;"Good chatting."
01:03:06,860;01:03:07,860;"Right."
01:03:07,860;01:03:08,860;"Later."
01:03:08,860;01:03:14,300;"I think you should leave that all in there because this is life and whoever's listening"
01:03:14,300;01:03:16,740;"at this point, yes it is."
01:03:16,740;01:03:21,700;"And speaking on that, the messiness of the Terry Glenn situation."
01:03:21,700;01:03:22,700;"Yeah."
01:03:22,700;01:03:29,700;"So yeah, to your point, he, it did seem like he, you know, he did some things like he"
01:03:29,700;01:03:34,540;"miss him drug test for whatever reason at the time. And then yeah, months later, he said"
01:03:34,540;01:03:38,340;"that it was because of that. Now, it doesn't, it doesn't mean that he's not dealing with"
01:03:38,340;01:03:43,180;"that. Maybe he is using that to justify it later as a like legal way. But I just thought"
01:03:43,180;01:03:46,940;"it was interesting because I didn't, I didn't really remember this going on. Maybe I was"
01:03:46,940;01:03:53,060;"a little bit too young to, you know, understand. But I think it is an interesting thing because"
01:03:53,060;01:03:59,340;"a lot of the articles that you had put up that I was looking over, it was like about,"
01:03:59,340;01:04:05,340;"they were interviewing doctors and trying to figure out from psychiatrists of how this manifests itself."
01:04:05,340;01:04:11,580;"And people didn't really know how to deal with the mental health aspect of athletics,"
01:04:11,580;01:04:17,900;"back then. I don't think we're at the point where we know how to handle that now."
01:04:17,900;01:04:26,380;"But yeah, this was before CTE was even a thought, a possibility."
01:04:27,180;01:04:33,100;"But yeah, I think you're even in the articles, all the even"
01:04:33,100;01:04:36,980;"explanations from these doctors felt really almost simplistic."
01:04:36,980;01:04:38,180;"Yeah, I agree."
01:04:38,180;01:04:39,060;"Yep."
01:04:39,060;01:04:42,180;"You could you could almost tell that there hadn't really been a lot"
01:04:42,180;01:04:45,140;"of emphasis on that side of things."
01:04:45,140;01:04:49,980;"But it wasn't even just the depression and stuff because it was"
01:04:49,980;01:04:53,500;"there was another article to focus like specifically focusing on"
01:04:54,140;01:04:58,780;"Terry Glenn's mental health and the quote that I pull from that was"
01:04:58,780;01:05:03,680;"The Norfolk County District Attorney's Office dismissed the felony"
01:05:03,680;01:05:08,540;"Intimidation of a witness charge against Glenn stemming from a May 16 incident"
01:05:08,540;01:05:13,100;"Which he allegedly assaulted Kimberly Combs the mother of Glenn's six-year-old son"
01:05:13,100;01:05:17,540;"Right, and I saw that and I didn't remember that happening either"
01:05:17,540;01:05:20,620;"So again, I don't know if this was like public knowledge"
01:05:21,300;01:05:27,140;"Or maybe I was paying attention to it because I doubt I was reading newspapers and like you know around this time, but right yeah"
01:05:27,140;01:05:35,040;"I mean obviously we would hear about it more with the social media aspect of today, but I just thought it was interesting. I mean and"
01:05:35,040;01:05:39,980;"It's also I don't know it"
01:05:39,980;01:05:43,980;"It's a tough thing to talk about because it is a very real thing"
01:05:43,980;01:05:45,980;"I think that now a lot of more people"
01:05:46,260;01:05:51,340;"understand what it is, or at least experience it a little bit more and I'm willing to talk about it."
01:05:51,340;01:05:58,140;"Is it fair that Terry Glenn was using it the way that he did? Again, probably not because it doesn't necessarily advance"
01:05:58,140;01:06:06,500;"the study and understanding of depression and anxiety and all these things that, you know, I think is very much in play today."
01:06:06,500;01:06:08,300;"But"
01:06:08,300;01:06:14,420;"it was very interesting to hear that. And obviously, you know, if you're dealing with depression and anxiety,"
01:06:14,500;01:06:19,500;"You're trying to get help that also doesn't excuse behavior like what he was accused of and"
01:06:19,500;01:06:26,860;"You know it doesn't help that situation either in getting that discussion going but I do think it's uh"
01:06:26,860;01:06:31,700;"It's interesting because now it is and I think social media has a lot to do with it"
01:06:31,700;01:06:35,060;"But we see a lot of athletes dealing with this and just people in their everyday life"
01:06:35,060;01:06:43,220;"and now we're just starting to talk about those things and try to figure out as a society how to deal with it"
01:06:43,220;01:06:47,060;"But right. Can you imagine like 20 years ago dealing with it?"
01:06:47,060;01:06:48,820;"If he in fact was, I don't know."
01:06:48,820;01:06:53,780;"Yeah, I mean, I mean, he's he was definitely dealing with something, whether"
01:06:53,780;01:06:59,540;"whatever it is, were turned out to be. Right."
01:06:59,540;01:07:06,260;"Just yeah, it feels like, you know, shades of even like an air in Hernandez or like you"
01:07:06,260;01:07:11,060;"talking about Antonio Brown, like this, there's just things going on."
01:07:11,060;01:07:14,060;"Like this does feel very similar."
01:07:14,060;01:07:18,260;"Like the more that we get into it, it feels very similar to an Antonio Brown situation."
01:07:18,260;01:07:19,260;"Right."
01:07:19,260;01:07:23,420;"Which hopefully the ending is a little bit different because I don't, I'm not seeing"
01:07:23,420;01:07:28,780;"anything substance wise with him at the moment, but there is like, you know, a lot of the"
01:07:28,780;01:07:34,180;"illegal stuff up in the air and, you know, hopefully, I mean, he said he's talking to"
01:07:34,180;01:07:35,180;"a therapist."
01:07:35,180;01:07:37,940;"I don't know if Terry Leno is at the time."
01:07:37,940;01:07:41,780;"But then again, I don't know if this is interesting"
01:07:41,780;01:07:43,540;"for anybody who's listening or not."
01:07:43,540;01:07:46,140;"But I'm fascinated by this stuff because also"
01:07:46,140;01:07:48,740;"if you're a football player, let's say you're Terry Glenn,"
01:07:48,740;01:07:53,540;"and Parcels was already on a little bit"
01:07:53,540;01:07:55,420;"for being soft in this and that."
01:07:55,420;01:07:57,260;"That's not necessarily the environment"
01:07:57,260;01:08:00,220;"that promotes you to share your feelings"
01:08:00,220;01:08:03,780;"or at least explain that things don't feel right."
01:08:03,780;01:08:06,420;"And I don't know, it must have been tough."
01:08:06,420;01:08:08,780;"And like you said, for Aaron Hernandez,"
01:08:08,780;01:08:10,180;"there's a documentary that's coming out."
01:08:10,180;01:08:11,420;"I don't know what it's about."
01:08:11,420;01:08:13,940;"I mean, by the time this is released,"
01:08:13,940;01:08:15,220;"it will have been out."
01:08:15,220;01:08:18,180;"But based on what I've read on him,"
01:08:18,180;01:08:20,920;"I mean, he lived a sort of life that,"
01:08:20,920;01:08:23,100;"as a football player and as a tough guy,"
01:08:23,100;01:08:25,260;"but then he had other feelings as well."
01:08:25,260;01:08:28,120;"And it's like, if you don't have an outlet for that,"
01:08:28,120;01:08:31,180;"then it's gotta be extremely tough."
01:08:31,180;01:08:33,540;"Again, it doesn't excuse his behavior"
01:08:33,540;01:08:37,280;"or how he acted dealing with certain situations,"
01:08:37,280;01:08:39,420;"but it's gotta be tough."
01:08:39,420;01:08:45,960;"- Yeah, and I think the fact that it's becoming more"
01:08:45,960;01:08:48,680;"talked about these days is probably"
01:08:48,680;01:08:52,940;"heading in the right direction,"
01:08:52,940;01:08:55,200;"opposed to just what it was then"
01:08:55,200;01:08:58,120;"and people just trying to deal with it on their own."
01:08:58,120;01:08:58,960;"- Right."
01:08:58,960;01:09:00,780;"- So as much as we give Terry Glenn shit"
01:09:00,780;01:09:03,080;"and talk about how much of a circus this is,"
01:09:03,080;01:09:11,240;"I think there's definitely some deep faines of some sad shit that runs through all of this."
01:09:11,240;01:09:12,080;"Sure."
01:09:12,080;01:09:17,040;"And if I'm being honest, I don't actually remember how this ends."
01:09:17,040;01:09:20,360;"The whole terrible ending, because I don't remember him ever playing again, but"
01:09:20,360;01:09:21,320;"Me neither, man."
01:09:21,320;01:09:22,440;"I don't remember."
01:09:22,440;01:09:27,720;"I mean, he obviously went to the Cowboys with the blood zone and Parceles reunion, but I"
01:09:27,720;01:09:32,000;"It's not like he played any of these playoff games or like Super Bowls that I"
01:09:32,000;01:09:35,760;"that I remember because I remember those those games pretty vividly."
01:09:35,760;01:09:38,320;"And he was in a par on so I don't know."
01:09:38,320;01:09:42,840;"What happens with Terry Glenn this year, so I think we're gonna have to."
01:09:42,840;01:09:45,840;"I think we'll probably stumble across that together as we go here."
01:09:45,840;01:09:49,320;"Right. I mean, that is the interesting thing about looking back at these things"
01:09:49,320;01:09:51,840;"are just kind of like understanding what was going on behind the scenes"
01:09:51,840;01:09:54,240;"that we didn't quite have an understanding for."
01:09:54,240;01:09:57,680;"Yeah, because I think especially with with these, you know,"
01:09:57,680;01:10:04,400;"positive football seasons. The things you remember are all the good things, you know?"
01:10:04,400;01:10:10,320;"Right. Well, for the postpart. Yeah. Well, I mean, what negative stuff did you remember about the"
01:10:10,320;01:10:16,400;"2001 season before we started doing it? Oh, the 2001, now much. That's what I mean. It was all pretty"
01:10:16,400;01:10:22,080;"exciting. Yeah. I mean, when it comes to sports, I think you remember the good bits. And then,"
01:10:23,440;01:10:28,400;"for the most part unless there's some really heart-wrenching thing like the helmet catch or something"
01:10:28,400;01:10:30,960;"You don't really remember the bad stuff"
01:10:30,960;01:10:32,400;"Yeah, that's true"
01:10:32,400;01:10:35,680;"I mean, I'm also wondering around this time because obviously"
01:10:35,680;01:10:41,680;"Dollar check was establishing this like culture, right and it might not be the easiest thing to deal with when"
01:10:41,680;01:10:48,000;"A player is sort of acting up or acting differently. Don't you know, he's not towing the line for whatever reason"
01:10:48,000;01:10:50,480;"And you know as a coach"
01:10:50,560;01:10:54,080;"He obviously was like, you know, we're going to do it this way and I don't want to be distraction."
01:10:54,080;01:10:58,000;"So it's not necessarily the most encouraging environment anyway, but I also understand that"
01:10:58,000;01:11:02,080;"because you're trying to implement this sort of structure in this like, you know, what this team"
01:11:02,080;01:11:09,200;"is going to become and what it became. But we also see like, because outside of like mental health or,"
01:11:09,200;01:11:14,000;"you know, you know, sitting, tearing land and making those decisions maybe doesn't play the"
01:11:14,000;01:11:18,880;"rest of the year, I don't know. Or like you said, you don't see them show up in any game. So,"
01:11:19,520;01:11:22,720;"I mean, maybe that was a Belichick thing to just try to make a point."
01:11:22,720;01:11:26,240;"I mean, there were articles about how he was already screwing around with the injury report."
01:11:26,240;01:11:28,800;"It was at 1.18 players on it or something like that."
01:11:28,800;01:11:29,360;"- Yeah."
01:11:29,360;01:11:30,720;"- So I mean--"
01:11:30,720;01:11:34,080;"- Because he got reprimanded as on the, yeah,"
01:11:34,080;01:11:36,080;"here, the Belichick was asked if he had issues."
01:11:36,080;01:11:41,280;"If he had issued such a lengthy injury report at the behest of the league office,"
01:11:41,280;01:11:44,240;"which sometimes questions such reports when a few injuries were listed."
01:11:44,880;01:11:49,760;"Four times, Belichick was asked if the 18 men list was a result of such a reprimand."
01:11:49,760;01:11:54,880;"His replies were as follows, ""No, nope, no, not that I'm aware of."""
01:11:54,880;01:11:59,040;"But yeah, right. He was definitely like playing games with that whole"
01:11:59,040;01:12:03,360;"injury report thing, even back in 2001."
01:12:03,360;01:12:11,120;"Right. So, I mean, I think all these things come into play. Obviously, I think he's softened"
01:12:11,120;01:12:15,040;"over the years because with the Josh Gordon situation, I think they were a little bit more"
01:12:15,040;01:12:23,520;"well, a lot more accommodating. Yeah, I feel like the Corey Dills and the Randy Moss has kind of"
01:12:23,520;01:12:29,360;"softened him to bring it in those way because he sees that it can work as long as the"
01:12:29,360;01:12:34,080;"the player has the right mindset. Right, right. But yeah, I agree."
01:12:34,080;01:12:40,640;"Yeah, so anyways, I mean, it'll be interesting to see how it plays out and, you know, I'm just"
01:12:40,640;01:12:46,160;"interested as I get older as well and as society progresses in whatever way it's going. It's"
01:12:46,160;01:12:51,120;"interesting to look back and I'm sure there's going to be other situations where we get a little"
01:12:51,120;01:12:56,800;"bit more insight. We're like, ""Oh, okay."" Maybe there's something more going on."
01:12:56,800;01:12:58,400;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:12:58,400;01:13:02,800;"Yeah, I don't know if anybody wants to listen to this stuff. There you go."
01:13:03,520;01:13:05,040;"- No, that was great stuff."
01:13:05,040;01:13:09,680;"So let's, I think we should wrap this up."
01:13:09,680;01:13:13,920;"I think we've talked for quite a bit about all sorts today."
01:13:13,920;01:13:17,360;"Maybe even some builds game."
01:13:17,360;01:13:20,400;"You wanna start your best and worst?"
01:13:20,400;01:13:24,960;"- Yeah, I mean, the obvious best,"
01:13:24,960;01:13:27,600;"which I wanted to avoid picking this,"
01:13:27,600;01:13:31,640;"but it was the best, was the Antoine Smith"
01:13:31,640;01:13:35,240;"sort of touchdown that sealed the game."
01:13:35,240;01:13:39,740;"I think it was 157 left on the clock."
01:13:39,740;01:13:40,840;"They're trying to kill time."
01:13:40,840;01:13:44,940;"And then Antoine Smith blows through pretty much everybody"
01:13:44,940;01:13:46,200;"that was trying to tackle them."
01:13:46,200;01:13:49,740;"It's a monster 42 yard run, makes a score 21-11"
01:13:49,740;01:13:51,640;"and that pretty much seals the deal."
01:13:51,640;01:13:58,080;"Before that to show how bad this game was,"
01:13:58,080;01:14:01,540;"my best play was a Patrick Pass kickoff return"
01:14:01,540;01:14:03,460;"that was fumbled, picked up."
01:14:03,460;01:14:05,860;"He runs across the field, bounces off a few guys"
01:14:05,860;01:14:08,980;"for 19 return, a 19-year return."
01:14:08,980;01:14:10,940;"That was my best play before that."
01:14:10,940;01:14:13,580;"- I mean, it was exciting."
01:14:13,580;01:14:15,260;"- Sure."
01:14:15,260;01:14:19,620;"- Wait, you like the Troy Brown end-around"
01:14:19,620;01:14:21,100;"that got called back for holding?"
01:14:21,100;01:14:22,020;"- The reverse?"
01:14:22,020;01:14:22,860;"- Yeah."
01:14:22,860;01:14:23,700;"- Yeah."
01:14:23,700;01:14:27,300;"- No, that was one of my notes about"
01:14:27,300;01:14:28,500;"Gus Johnson and Brett Jones."
01:14:28,500;01:14:30,100;"That's not a fucking reverse."
01:14:30,100;01:14:30,940;"- Right."
01:14:30,940;01:14:38,220;"Right and I did the right a note on that though. I love Brady's hand off because he timed it perfectly to him. Oh, yeah"
01:14:38,220;01:14:41,420;"He held it long enough"
01:14:41,420;01:14:45,600;"To make the play work obviously didn't but no yeah"
01:14:45,600;01:14:48,500;"All right, so then what was your worst?"
01:14:48,500;01:14:50,860;"Something game"
01:14:50,860;01:14:55,520;"Well the worst I would say is just any offensive line"
01:14:56,140;01:15:00,420;"Play that allowed a sack. I mean any even like the hurries. I'd say"
01:15:00,420;01:15:04,100;"Yeah, the offensive line was terrible"
01:15:04,100;01:15:10,460;"Which again, I saw another article that they were talking about oh well, maybe"
01:15:10,460;01:15:12,900;"Bledsoe was better"
01:15:12,900;01:15:19,420;"You know because he would have been better if he had a better offensive line or whatever they were talking about the offensive line play"
01:15:19,420;01:15:24,340;"Was a little bit better in you know Brady's tenure in 2001"
01:15:24,340;01:15:26,460;"And I'm like, I think they were the same."
01:15:26,460;01:15:30,300;"It's just sort of the decision making and whatever that comes with it."
01:15:30,300;01:15:31,820;"No, you're right."
01:15:31,820;01:15:33,940;"But I did like the quote from that article."
01:15:33,940;01:15:40,460;"Here in 1999, let's go play behind a line from which only one player remains."
01:15:40,460;01:15:43,780;"When I say that, I don't mean still remains in New England."
01:15:43,780;01:15:45,500;"I mean, still remains in pro football."
01:15:45,500;01:15:47,220;"All right."
01:15:47,220;01:15:50,260;"Well, that's a major point right there."
01:15:50,260;01:15:51,940;"But yeah, so, so not great."
01:15:51,940;01:15:58,740;"So I mean, I don't think this is head and shoulders better than the 1999, but it was"
01:15:58,740;01:16:03,180;"99 was was this is what I'm talking about when I'm talking about"
01:16:03,180;01:16:08,220;"Drew Blitzer like dragging this team to victories is that's what he was dealing with."
01:16:08,220;01:16:09,180;"Right."
01:16:09,180;01:16:15,660;"And I will say that I also wanted to touch on this game was so bad."
01:16:15,660;01:16:18,020;"I wanted to get the other guys on here and see what they thought."
01:16:18,020;01:16:23,960;"But when they put up, so you know, they put up like all kinds of posts, like there's the NFL"
01:16:23,960;01:16:28,360;"dot com one, where this time the Patriots were finally mentioned."
01:16:28,360;01:16:33,680;"So first time all year, the the the the poll, front of all dot com actually referenced the"
01:16:33,680;01:16:34,680;"Patriots."
01:16:34,680;01:16:40,540;"Yeah, I have it here was what has been the most surprising aspect of the 2001 season thus far"
01:16:40,540;01:16:45,580;"and the first option is emergence of Tom Brady, which Jones picked."
01:16:45,580;01:16:50,020;"out exactly. So I thought it was because he's in New England. But actually it was just because"
01:16:50,020;01:16:55,180;"he's in New England. Right. If you know, if anybody has listened to some of these, they'll"
01:16:55,180;01:16:59,420;"know that there's been a bunch of these kind of all the temples and they have nothing to"
01:16:59,420;01:17:04,300;"do with the Patriots, even though they're during the Patriots game. But then the best"
01:17:04,300;01:17:08,260;"thing that I thought they put up there was they were talking about Ted Johnson's favorite"
01:17:08,260;01:17:13,740;"book. You can steal the reader. No, go for it. Go for it. Go. All right. That's a great"
01:17:13,740;01:17:15,660;"- I said, ""Yeah, no, my best."""
01:17:15,660;01:17:17,060;"I actually had two."
01:17:17,060;01:17:18,780;"They're talking about Ted Johnson being an avid reader."
01:17:18,780;01:17:22,060;"Like you said, turns out his favorite book"
01:17:22,060;01:17:24,340;"is the notebook by Nicholas Sparks, apparently."
01:17:24,340;01:17:25,460;"- That's so good."
01:17:25,460;01:17:30,460;"- Which those of you who have or are currently dating somebody,"
01:17:30,460;01:17:33,540;"you know that got turned into a movie with Ryan Gosling."
01:17:33,540;01:17:34,740;"- And it was fantastic."
01:17:34,740;01:17:37,940;"- Yes, and we'll make your significant other very mad at you"
01:17:37,940;01:17:40,620;"after watching it, 'cause you're not"
01:17:40,620;01:17:42,380;"a Nicholas Sparks character."
01:17:42,380;01:17:49,340;"Well, I will admit that I watched that movie on my own at like 3 a.m. by myself."
01:17:49,340;01:17:50,540;"That's not that right."
01:17:50,540;01:17:52,100;"You know, I needed to know what it was about."
01:17:52,100;01:17:56,900;"And by the end, because I think it's a horror film and nobody wants to talk about that,"
01:17:56,900;01:17:58,780;"but it is a horror film."
01:17:58,780;01:18:05,660;"And by the end, I think I cried by myself for at least 35 minutes, not out of like the love story,"
01:18:05,660;01:18:09,020;"but out of sheer fear because of like the possibility."
01:18:11,100;01:18:12,900;"I mean, yeah, that's fair."
01:18:12,900;01:18:15,400;"But yeah, that graphic that you're talking about."
01:18:15,400;01:18:17,220;"They actually list like go on."
01:18:17,220;01:18:17,940;"So they put up the graphic."
01:18:17,940;01:18:19,020;"I have it here."
01:18:19,020;01:18:22,220;"I took a screenshot of it so I wouldn't forget it."
01:18:22,220;01:18:25,820;"Ted Johnson's favorite authors, Deepak Chopra."
01:18:25,820;01:18:29,860;"Nelson DeMille, I believe is pronounced."
01:18:29,860;01:18:31,820;"John Grisham, which OK, great."
01:18:31,820;01:18:33,740;"Robert Ludlam, of course."
01:18:33,740;01:18:35,820;"M. Scott Peck, who I don't actually know."
01:18:35,820;01:18:38,940;"And then the aforementioned Nicholas Sparks."
01:18:38,940;01:18:40,540;"That is so funny, though, that they--"
01:18:40,540;01:18:49,100;"avid reader for especially for a run stopping linebacker who from the the picture that they"
01:18:49,100;01:18:56,540;"showed next to this these names of authors his neck is actually wider than his head. Oh yeah."
01:18:56,540;01:19:02,860;"Not shaped man. I don't remember that about. Yeah. And so yeah just not something you expect"
01:19:02,860;01:19:08,540;"and my actually had another favorite and this is just a small thing but the page is"
01:19:08,540;01:19:11,620;"ran a direct snap to Kevin Falk on like third and 12."
01:19:11,620;01:19:13,340;"You see that play?"
01:19:13,340;01:19:14,620;"I don't remember that one."
01:19:14,620;01:19:18,340;"Yeah, it was halfway through like the second or third quarter."
01:19:18,340;01:19:20,500;"And like they didn't convert it or anything."
01:19:20,500;01:19:21,900;"So it didn't really work."
01:19:21,900;01:19:24,420;"But I think it got like eight yards."
01:19:24,420;01:19:33,500;"But on the direct snap to Falk, Tom Brady's play fake was amazing."
01:19:33,500;01:19:37,540;"He literally acted like he caught the ball and like was doing his whole"
01:19:37,540;01:19:42,060;"drop back and like looking looking across the field. Oh, yeah. Now to remember the,"
01:19:42,060;01:19:46,980;"the announcers were talking about that too. Yeah. It was amazing. It was so like rookie,"
01:19:46,980;01:19:52,220;"Tom Brady, like making sure everything is, is exactly how it should be."
01:19:52,220;01:19:57,940;"Are you calling him a hardo? Oh, yeah. I don't even call him a hardo all day. Well,"
01:19:57,940;01:20:04,420;"all all season, I guess. I didn't know that. I know, I know, J.J. Watt is a hardo."
01:20:04,420;01:20:07,660;"So I know no rookie Tom Bray is a super hard."
01:20:07,660;01:20:09,220;"Amazing."
01:20:09,220;01:20:14,020;"And then my worst a lot to pick from."
01:20:14,020;01:20:21,460;"I think we'll go back to the kicking game kicker in this game is Jake Arians."
01:20:21,460;01:20:24,100;"He would not last the entire season with the Buffalo Bills."
01:20:24,100;01:20:28,180;"They would eventually replace him with Patriot legend Shane Graham."
01:20:29,780;01:20:34,780;"But they mentioned in his first field goal attempt."
01:20:34,780;01:20:37,540;"I think I was in the second quarter."
01:20:37,540;01:20:41,140;"They talked about how this was the first,"
01:20:41,140;01:20:44,280;"or the fact that his last two field goal attempts"
01:20:44,280;01:20:46,820;"have been blocked before kicking this one."
01:20:46,820;01:20:48,700;"So this was the first time in three kicks"
01:20:48,700;01:20:50,340;"that he didn't have one blocked."
01:20:50,340;01:20:51,180;"And he made it."
01:20:51,180;01:20:52,100;"- That's pretty good."
01:20:52,100;01:20:52,940;"- Yeah."
01:20:52,940;01:20:53,780;"So that was,"
01:20:53,780;01:20:58,100;"that was what kind of game this was."
01:20:59,580;01:21:03,780;"It was one of those. So I think that does it for for this week."
01:21:03,780;01:21:07,540;"What do we have to look forward to, Mr. Mello?"
01:21:07,540;01:21:10,460;"I don't know, but don't ruin it for me either."
01:21:10,460;01:21:13,980;"Because again, I'm experiencing the season as if I don't."
01:21:13,980;01:21:17,580;"But you I think you will know this one. Oh, don't you dare."
01:21:17,580;01:21:20,660;"The greatest show on turf is coming to town next week."
01:21:20,660;01:21:24,100;"OK. One of the games you remember, I'm sure."
01:21:24,100;01:21:27,820;"I remember all of them. OK, I'm just trying not to."
01:21:27,820;01:21:33,980;"I don't think you do remember any of these games, don't you lie to me, but everybody remembers the first Rams game"
01:21:33,980;01:21:36,300;"Because that's when shit got serious"
01:21:36,300;01:21:39,620;"So join us next episode"
01:21:39,620;01:21:42,820;"The St. Louis Rams come to town"
01:21:42,820;01:21:45,780;"Facing New England Patriots the the currently"
01:21:45,780;01:21:51,480;"Five and four New England Patriots, and we will see you then bye. Ta-ta"

00:50,600;00:54,640;"There wasn't much respect in the game we're gonna cover"
00:55,440;00:57,440;"This this evening"
00:57,440;00:59,540;"evening in"

01:05,960;01:11,160;"2003 the Patriots are any Houston, Texas at Reliant Stadium"
01:11,160;01:14,320;"pretty brand-new and"
01:14,320;01:21,000;"This would be where the Super Bowl is being held this year. So getting a bit of a sneak preview spoiler alert"
01:22,520;01:28,360;"But the commentators in this game could not stop gushing about this. I think they said something about how"
01:28,360;01:33,920;"This was the largest like non playoff crowd to watch a football game"
01:33,920;01:41,500;"Yeah, not super bowl crowd. That's what yeah, and they tendence apparently according to a pro football reference was 70,719"
01:41,500;01:48,980;"Yeah, I mean it's not like college football big. We'll say it's like a hundred thousand, but that's I mean"
01:49,640;01:52,520;"I wonder where that ranks nowadays. I don't care"
01:52,520;01:56,920;"I actually don't wonder"
01:56,920;02:05,500;"Granks on here today baby brother Greg Brown not here again. He's a bit with work or something like adult bullshit like that"
02:05,500;02:13,960;"But unlike the adults that we are who are also busy with work and still doing shit. He's decided he can't join us"
02:13,960;02:18,280;"That's not true. I'm not busy with work. I play working golf. So I don't do shit"
02:18,800;02:21,900;"That's true, and I build the internet so I really don't you should either I"
02:21,900;02:28,680;"Thanks Al Gore Jesus Christ any he invented it. I just"
02:28,680;02:32,720;"Get it right Steve. That's my fault"
02:32,720;02:41,160;"So the Patriots coming into this game at 8 and 2 we're facing the Texans at 4 and 6 and"
02:41,160;02:44,500;"Just to point out"
02:44,500;02:50,500;"The Patriots would not lose another game this season the Texans would not win no the game this season they would finish"
02:50,500;02:53,040;"4 and 12"
02:53,040;02:58,740;"I like broke them. No, I like they will finish 5 and 11. They'll win one more game"
02:58,740;03:03,780;"Last year though there this is their second year in existence near before they went for in 12"
03:03,780;03:07,060;"not great"
03:07,060;03:10,940;"but you know there's still there's still an expansion team so"
03:11,740;03:14,740;"Even though the the other two expansion teams that came before them and"
03:14,740;03:21,460;"Jack was in the Panthers had that early success remember they both kind of like made the playoffs the first year in existence. Yeah"
03:21,460;03:25,020;"That didn't happen to Texans"
03:25,020;03:28,940;"Finish 5 and 11 before fourth the last in the AFC South"
03:28,940;03:31,580;"Didn't make the playoffs"
03:31,580;03:36,220;"And they weren't great they actually win next week. Let's lift it up"
03:36,220;03:39,140;"Yeah, well, that's the thing is"
03:40,220;03:46,960;"Their wins came against like the Falcons decent teams. Yeah, they beat the Falcons who were"
03:46,960;03:52,460;"eventual Super Bowl champion or a Super Bowl runner up Carolina Panthers. Well, thanks for ruining that for me"
03:52,460;03:54,460;"That was gonna be my big big reveal"
03:54,460;03:58,420;"But they also beat the Bills with Drew blood so and"
03:58,420;04:03,180;"One of the other AFC teams I can't remember what was do you have it there?"
04:03,180;04:06,940;"Falcons bills Panthers"
04:07,660;04:13,420;"And the Jaguars and the Dolphins. Yes. Okay. So it's a dolphins we won in the bills"
04:13,420;04:20,580;"Yeah, they'd actually beat the bills the week before they came to New England that this New England game and they took New England"
04:20,580;04:27,680;"Well, we'll say it at the beginning hey, they took me to New England to overtime and end up losing 20"
04:27,680;04:33,300;"It was only like four minutes left five minutes left some of that"
04:33,780;04:36,260;"Uh, I don't even think it was that long left."
04:36,260;04:37,340;"Maybe two minutes."
04:37,340;04:37,860;"It was a."
04:37,860;04:41,820;"It wasn't really close to me in time, but it was deep."
04:41,820;04:43,300;"Um, so."
04:43,300;04:45,140;"The."
04:45,140;04:46,060;"All right, fuck it."
04:46,060;04:46,860;"Well, we'll start."
04:46,860;04:48,140;"We'll start from the end today."
04:48,140;04:49,980;"The Patriots won this game on the Adam"
04:49,980;04:53,260;"Vinditary 20, our field goal with 45 seconds left in overtime."
04:53,260;04:54,340;"45 45."
04:54,340;04:55,340;"45."
04:55,340;04:56,340;"Yeah."
04:56,340;04:59,060;"Is this the longest game they've ever played?"
04:59,060;05:01,820;"Uh, without being a tie, maybe."
05:01,820;05:03,380;"I'm sure there's probably been games that."
05:03,580;05:04,940;"How many ties does Tom Brady have?"
05:04,940;05:07,580;"You tell me, I know."
05:07,580;05:08,860;"He doesn't have any."
05:08,860;05:09,180;"Yeah."
05:09,180;05:09,620;"Yeah."
05:09,620;05:11,340;"Bill Bellattrack has never tied a football game."
05:11,340;05:14,900;"So if this is this has got to be the time wise, the longest, I don't remember"
05:14,900;05:19,340;"them ever kicking a game winning field goal with 40 seconds and OT, you know,"
05:19,340;05:20,860;"you've had a bunch of OT wins."
05:20,860;05:21,700;"That's true."
05:21,700;05:22,940;"And they even sat on this broadcast."
05:22,940;05:24,340;"They had won eight straight."
05:24,340;05:26,460;"Yes."
05:26,460;05:26,980;"Yeah."
05:26,980;05:30,340;"But for Tom Brady's, this might be his longest ever game."
05:30,340;05:30,820;"Yeah."
05:30,820;05:34,260;"I mean, if it is, then it's only by seconds, right?"
05:34,260;05:37,060;"Yeah, I mean, a max like 43 seconds."
05:37,060;05:38,540;"Yeah."
05:38,540;05:42,700;"So yeah, I'm pretty comfortable putting this in longest game"
05:42,700;05:44,700;"territory."
05:44,700;05:45,200;"45 seconds."
05:45,200;05:49,260;"I mean, maybe not in like probably an actual time, right?"
05:49,260;05:49,900;"That's true."
05:49,900;05:50,400;"That's true."
05:50,400;05:52,900;"One maybe is the time longest game, right?"
05:52,900;05:57,900;"From like 6 p.m. Eastern to 9.30 or whatever, but this."
05:57,900;06:00,820;"And as far as game time is probably the longest."
06:00,820;06:02,340;"- Well, they have that on Pro Football Reference."
06:02,340;06:04,880;"This took three hours and 44 minutes."
06:04,880;06:08,140;"- And how much should the Super Bowl take?"
06:08,140;06:09,940;"- I don't know, I don't have that."
06:09,940;06:11,460;"(laughs)"
06:11,460;06:13,340;"Let's see if we can look it up, stat check."
06:13,340;06:17,060;"Let's actually look up longest."
06:17,060;06:18,540;"- No, I feel a game."
06:18,540;06:21,700;"- Well, here is that Super Bowl 2018?"
06:21,700;06:23,860;"- Yeah."
06:23,860;06:27,540;"2016."
06:27,540;06:34,740;"was it no sorry you're in 2018 you just win so many it's hard no it wasn't 28"
06:34,740;06:43,380;"god damn no it's so many of them no it was 26 and I was right the first time"
06:43,380;06:47,140;"Jesus all right the length of that game was"
06:47,140;06:49,940;"is three hours and 47 minutes."
06:49,940;06:51,380;"- And this is three 44."
06:51,380;06:52,660;"- This is three 44."
06:52,660;06:53,500;"- Wow."
06:53,500;06:56,660;"- And it went to 45 seconds left in overtime."
06:56,660;06:59,940;"Whereas the Falcon Super Bowl went to,"
06:59,940;07:01,300;"it was the first drive of overtime, wasn't it?"
07:01,300;07:03,900;"Yeah, Paige got the bomb, never looked back."
07:03,900;07:06,100;"- Tell you what listeners will save you"
07:06,100;07:09,060;"of an hour of this and just don't watch the first half."
07:09,060;07:12,500;"- Oh yeah, oh yeah, don't watch the first half."
07:12,500;07:13,340;"In fact,"
07:15,940;07:17,060;"Let's give this a score."
07:17,060;07:20,660;"I want to hear what you have for a watchability score"
07:20,660;07:22,140;"out of six Lombardes."
07:22,140;07:24,380;"- So I didn't know the score."
07:24,380;07:26,580;"I didn't remember this game before I watched it."
07:26,580;07:29,140;"And I watched your first half."
07:29,140;07:34,820;"And I was like, ""Seltic's on, near you'll watch that."""
07:34,820;07:36,900;"And then I looked at the score."
07:36,900;07:39,620;"I was like, ""I'll see if there's even touchdown"
07:39,620;07:40,460;"""swear to watch it."""
07:40,460;07:41,860;"And I saw it was an overtime solid guard."
07:41,860;07:42,700;"I watched the other half."
07:42,700;07:47,100;"And then I started playing it and I saw it as like another,"
07:47,100;07:49,220;"you know, as an extra first half as an hour,"
07:49,220;07:51,260;"a second half as an hour and a half."
07:51,260;07:52,660;"I was like, ""Jesus."""
07:52,660;07:54,900;"- Yeah, this is a big commitment this week"
07:54,900;07:56,420;"to forge this game."
07:56,420;07:58,340;"- Yeah, more you can guess me going out and out"
07:58,340;08:00,180;"and just cut out the other shit."
08:00,180;08:01,260;"- I mean, you could probably start"
08:01,260;08:02,900;"in the fourth quarter, if you want to be honest."
08:02,900;08:04,060;"- Sure, yeah."
08:04,060;08:07,820;"- I mean, so I mean, first quarter, nothing happens."
08:07,820;08:11,940;"The Texas score field goal off of like,"
08:11,940;08:19,600;"An actual legit drive was the only legit drive of the whole thing for Tony Banks and the Texans. Yeah, Tony. Yeah"
08:19,600;08:23,780;"So actually yeah before we dive right in I actually want to talk about the Texans"
08:23,780;08:26,820;"because this was the"
08:26,820;08:29,980;"David car era"
08:29,980;08:31,980;"the David car King of Saxe"
08:31,980;08:38,500;"because in the one two three four five years he was with"
08:38,500;08:41,220;"the"
08:41,220;08:46,740;"Texans he had. Yeah, it's not David cars fault. Okay, I"
08:46,740;08:50,220;"ever think everyone. No, I'm not I'm not saying it is. But with"
08:50,220;08:56,860;"the Texans, he was sacked. Well, I mean, the King. He's the"
08:56,860;09:00,940;"poor sap of sacks. Well, the fact that he was able to rack up"
09:00,940;09:02,300;"so many so quickly."
09:02,300;09:07,140;"There are lines trash, there was no names on the online I'd"
09:07,140;09:16,340;"never heard of. In the five years he's with Houston, he had 249 sacks. He was sacked that"
09:16,340;09:20,900;"many times. He didn't have them. He was he was the victim of 249 sacks."
09:20,900;09:29,300;"Yeah, of course. Savvy sack. And this was the only year he didn't get sacked. Actually,"
09:29,300;09:34,260;"let's say this, out of those, this is the only year he didn't get sacked more than 40 times."
09:34,260;09:39,300;"Well, he wasn't even playing and he's injured in this game. Right. He's the only God damn much"
09:39,300;09:46,900;"he only lasted 11 games, but in those 11 games, he was only sacked 15 times where in 2002,"
09:46,900;09:54,420;"he was sacked 76 times in one season, which let's do the math real quick 76 divided by 16."
09:54,420;10:01,460;"He was sacked 4.4 and 3/4 sacks per game. He was sacked almost five times a game."
10:02,740;10:08,660;"And then this year was 15 because he didn't last the season. And then 49 year after that,"
10:08,660;10:15,860;"68 to the year after that, and then 41 before he finally left Houston. After he left Houston,"
10:15,860;10:24,340;"he never started a full season, but he also never got sacked more than 13 times in the season."
10:25,060;10:27,900;"That being true, Tom Brady took four sacks in this game."
10:27,900;10:32,340;"Um, thanks took three."
10:32,340;10:34,780;"Yeah, Dave, a car was exact once."
10:34,780;10:37,500;"Yeah, it's in the car to zero."
10:37,500;10:39,420;"Yeah, because he'd been hurt the week before."
10:39,420;10:42,940;"Tom Brady, he was getting beaten up."
10:42,940;10:44,260;"He was."
10:44,260;10:46,940;"Yeah, this Tom capers defense, I think, was legit."
10:46,940;10:48,780;"It was the Steve Martin revenge game."
10:48,780;10:50,220;"Is that the same Steve Martin?"
10:50,220;10:51,820;"Yes, it is the same."
10:51,820;10:53,340;"He played out of his mind."
10:53,340;10:54,100;"He was crushing it."
10:54,300;10:55,660;"Yeah, so mad at bell check."
10:55,660;10:57,580;"He's he had like to the sacks or something."
10:57,580;11:00,700;"Something like yeah, he a bunch of disruptive blazer."
11:00,700;11:01,700;"He was all over the field."
11:01,700;11:02,700;"He showed up in this game."
11:02,700;11:06,860;"Yeah, because there was another banks on there in their defense and both of them."
11:06,860;11:08,700;"Oh, Martin's rather both of them."
11:08,700;11:10,980;"He didn't recognize some guys on the enemy."
11:10,980;11:14,660;"Aaron Glenn, I guess the cornerback is the only one that I had actually heard of."
11:14,660;11:15,300;"True."
11:15,300;11:20,180;"Marlon McCree was on this this team who I will recognize."
11:20,180;11:22,660;"But like this is like backside, right?"
11:22,660;11:26,980;"because didn't they form the expansion teams by just picking a bunch of players off the rosters?"
11:26,980;11:29,540;"Because the announcements kept like, ""Hey, I'm formally up this team and"
11:29,540;11:32,660;"formally up that team and formally up this team."" Yeah, so basically it was,"
11:32,660;11:40,820;"I think you could protect a certain amount of players, but then the new team would get to choose"
11:40,820;11:49,220;"a certain amount of players off of your team. But yeah, no real names on this defense."
11:50,820;11:55,740;"their leaders on defense. A cornerback Marcus Coleman had seven interceptions and 22 pass"
11:55,740;12:03,940;"defense, which pretty good. Jamie Sharper, who I don't think I recognize, had four sacks"
12:03,940;12:10,600;"on the team. But listen to four sacks. This is a linebacker. Four sacks, 166 combined"
12:10,600;12:18,300;"tackles, 107 solo. That's a lot of tackles. Yeah. They're other linebacker, 136 combined"
12:18,300;12:19,940;"tackles 101 solo."
12:19,940;12:21,620;"The offense can stand the field."
12:21,620;12:22,540;"That's what it is."
12:22,540;12:25,380;"They just end and a defense couldn't get off the field."
12:25,380;12:28,060;"Because I think I had some sick receivers though."
12:28,060;12:30,620;"They did, but they didn't."
12:30,620;12:34,020;"I guess they didn't have an offensive line or time to throw"
12:34,020;12:35,300;"because they finished."
12:35,300;12:41,940;"28th in the league in points four and 27th in the league in points against."
12:41,940;12:45,260;"I mean, Andre Johnson's rookie year."
12:45,260;12:46,500;"Yeah."
12:46,500;12:51,100;"And I mean, Jabar Gaffney's, I feel, not that old at this point."
12:51,100;12:51,720;"Right."
12:51,720;12:53,280;"This is a second year."
12:53,280;12:54,420;"This is a second year."
12:54,420;12:55,680;"So yeah, we'll see."
12:55,680;12:57,620;"Johnson Gaffney, those receivers are legit."
12:57,620;12:58,020;"Yeah."
12:58,020;13:02,940;"Andre Johnson was rookie this year, picked third overall from Miami."
13:02,940;13:06,300;"I mean, you can't at least fall their first picks."
13:06,300;13:10,740;"I mean, David Carr, I think was the consensus number one overall quarterback."
13:10,740;13:11,660;"That's something like that."
13:11,660;13:11,820;"Yeah."
13:11,820;13:13,820;"And then second year, I mean,"
13:14,860;13:18,040;"hundred Johnson is VC is probably the best player in Texans history."
13:18,040;13:20,560;"Yeah, if he's not, he's up there."
13:20,560;13:21,640;"I think he's got to be."
13:21,640;13:24,800;"I mean, you would think Watson, maybe"
13:24,800;13:27,020;"but when Watson's done, he definitely will be."
13:27,020;13:29,760;"He doesn't get traded and Hopkins too."
13:29,760;13:30,560;"For the, yeah."
13:30,560;13:30,760;"Yeah."
13:30,760;13:30,760;"Yeah."
13:30,760;13:33,320;"Well, Hopkins had a chance that now he got traded."
13:33,320;13:36,640;"Well, I think on, on Johnson's biggest claim to fame is beating the"
13:36,640;13:38,120;"shit out of, uh, what's his name?"
13:38,120;13:39,680;"The cornerback from Tennessee."
13:39,680;13:43,440;"No, maybe it should be being really good and then not getting traded."
13:43,440;13:52,560;"I'm Trell roll. I think that's who that big beef was. I was it. I feel like it was. I"
13:52,560;13:58,020;"know someone like that. I remember that though. Yeah. Stat check."
13:58,020;13:58,560;"Stealing."
13:58,560;14:04,800;"Courtland Finnegan. That's who it was. The man with two Irish first names. Who's talking"
14:04,800;14:11,560;"about Irish savers in this game though? Wait, we had some? Dude, yeah, we had some. It's the one that"
14:11,560;14:16,200;"I'd never even thought I had one of them."
14:16,200;14:17,820;"I had to take a snapchat of some of my friends"
14:17,820;14:19,480;"was like, is this for real?"
14:19,480;14:20,840;"Is this real life?"
14:20,840;14:21,680;"- So we've talked about that."
14:21,680;14:24,320;"Yeah, the injuries on this season"
14:24,320;14:26,360;"are fucking out of control."
14:26,360;14:28,200;"The Patriots they said in this game have now"
14:28,200;14:31,800;"had 42 different starters on offensive defense."
14:31,800;14:37,480;"The last teams to have led the league in starters,"
14:37,480;14:40,560;"like overall, none of them finished over 500."
14:40,560;14:42,760;"most of them finish with like two or three wins."
14:42,760;14:44,000;"- Yeah, and it was all in the defense"
14:44,000;14:46,360;"and actually they're all back now pretty much."
14:46,360;14:48,880;"- Yeah, but now the offense is barren."
14:48,880;14:51,880;"- Now the wide of seniors just getting worked."
14:51,880;14:54,840;"- David Patton is on IR, which did we know that?"
14:54,840;14:56,040;"Did we know he was out for the season?"
14:56,040;14:57,960;"- No, I didn't think that, I mean,"
14:57,960;14:59,640;"they dropped a real casual."
14:59,640;15:03,080;"- They did, yeah, but I think that's a more recent development."
15:03,080;15:05,860;"I don't remember hearing that up until this game."
15:05,860;15:09,720;"David Givens is out, Troy Brown is out."
15:09,720;15:11,720;"which left."
15:11,720;15:14,720;"Bethel Johnson."
15:14,720;15:17,720;"Who had a bird head best game as a pro."
15:17,720;15:20,720;"Had his first career touchdown in this game."
15:20,720;15:22,720;"He's a game."
15:22,720;15:27,720;"And Daniel Graham who started the game with three consecutive dropped passes."
15:27,720;15:28,720;"I felt like more."
15:28,720;15:29,720;"Sure did."
15:29,720;15:32,720;"But Brady kept going back him because he had nobody else."
15:32,720;15:34,720;"Did Dion out there."
15:34,720;15:40,000;"So Tom Brady, I wrote this down too, was throwing to guys like Dietrich Ward."
15:40,000;15:43,800;"Yeah, the Dietrich Ward was the first one that I was like, ""Hmm?"""
15:43,800;15:44,560;"Yeah."
15:44,560;15:49,200;"And the comment is what we're even like, like, ""No, this isn't pre-seasoned,"
15:49,200;15:53,200;"but yes, you are seeing a wide receiver with number 17 out there is Dietrich Ward."""
15:53,200;15:57,360;"Yeah, I mean, you had some decent seasons with the Jets."
15:57,360;15:58,280;"Yeah."
15:58,280;16:01,480;"Long time before this, I think."
16:01,480;16:03,040;"No, not even 2,000."
16:03,040;16:09,120;"Three years before you 54 catches 800 yards. Yeah, and then what? Nobody doing 2001 2002"
16:09,120;16:12,800;"200 yards 172"
16:12,800;16:19,120;"Right, but the other name was even better 106 yards. Oh"
16:19,120;16:22,400;"and a t.d."
16:22,400;16:29,120;"On the Patriots what yes, t-t-t-word you get the touchdown later this is a hell yeah. All right"
16:32,400;16:38,800;"All right, and then the other big name the biggest name the biggest name. This is the one you snapchat"
16:38,800;16:41,200;"Isn't it yes was JJ Stokes"
16:41,200;16:46,720;"former first round pick of the 49ers who even ran out"
16:46,720;16:54,480;"But yeah, so both of those those guys caught passes from Tom Brady in this game and"
16:54,480;16:57,360;"It was as bad as it sounds really"
16:57,360;16:58,960;"offense"
16:58,960;17:00,400;"but"
17:00,400;17:07,920;"This is the perfect point for me to point out that early Dynasty MVP Troy Brown."
17:07,920;17:13,360;"I thought it was Kevin Falk. That's what he meant. I just have Troy Brown in the mind because he's"
17:13,360;17:20,880;"injured and I miss him. But Kevin Falk, early Dynasty MVP, Kevin Falk, leading rusher and"
17:20,880;17:27,120;"receiver in this game. Yeah, he was just like similar though to Graham, like early. He was just a"
17:27,120;17:29,420;"of beneficiary of ain't nobody else out there."
17:29,420;17:29,920;"Yeah."
17:29,920;17:30,920;"I'm just a limited."
17:30,920;17:37,120;"But he ran for 80 of their 128 total rushing yards."
17:37,120;17:40,280;"So almost 60, almost two thirds."
17:40,280;17:41,480;"So done at this point."
17:41,480;17:42,720;"It's hard to watch."
17:42,720;17:43,720;"Oh, yeah."
17:43,720;17:44,720;"Yeah."
17:44,720;17:47,120;"And they even have Mike Cloud in here running a couple times and he just."
17:47,120;17:48,120;"He's not bad."
17:48,120;17:49,520;"He didn't do anything though."
17:49,520;17:53,920;"He's not like his buddy first debuted, which I was all about Mike Cloud."
17:53,920;17:54,920;"Yeah."
17:54,920;17:56,640;"And he touched on his own though."
17:56,640;18:01,040;"cloud, uh, two carries eight yards, you know, whatever, long as"
18:01,040;18:03,600;"the five, and then one catch for a"
18:03,600;18:07,000;"three. Didn't any jobs use five? Yeah."
18:07,000;18:09,200;"And Antoine, because I need to"
18:09,200;18:13,760;"spread an Antoine. Yeah. But then then, uh, K fog also had 108"
18:13,760;18:15,680;"receiving errors as well, which was a"
18:15,680;18:20,160;"third of the teams. And he had a, uh, crucial like penalty on"
18:20,160;18:22,800;"third down on the wheel route, maybe the linebacker and he had"
18:22,800;18:25,560;"to hold him at the line. Mm hmm. Yep. And he actually had"
18:25,560;18:28,680;"another big screen call back to that went for like 20. Oh, yeah."
18:28,680;18:32,640;"So he had himself a day. And that's because, like you said, there was"
18:32,640;18:39,920;"literally nobody left. But the defense is starting to come into"
18:39,920;18:44,480;"form that you remember from this, this era that 2003 2004 defense"
18:44,480;18:48,880;"that was basically impenetrable. And it started kind of early, didn't"
18:48,880;18:56,480;"it because they said Tony Banks had like seven yards passing or something."
18:56,480;18:57,440;"It wasn't great."
18:57,440;18:58,680;"Yeah, but"
18:58,680;18:59,760;"Nicholas and low stat."
18:59,760;19:00,640;"Yeah."
19:00,640;19:07,200;"I mean, what is Tony Banks finished 10 of 25 for 93 yards, two touchdowns"
19:07,200;19:08,400;"and interception and three sacks."
19:08,400;19:11,840;"He that's a rough day."
19:11,840;19:13,800;"The rating of 60.9."
19:13,800;19:18,000;"So as bad as Brady's day was it Brady had a bad day too."
19:18,040;19:24,360;"their offense didn't even gain 170 yards total. They have 169."
19:24,360;19:29,720;"Yeah, then the Patriots on the other hand had 472 total offensive yards."
19:29,720;19:35,800;"And only put up 20 points like that. The numbers were stacked on the page's favor."
19:35,800;19:40,360;"They had like offensive plays was something they showed that to."
19:40,360;19:46,280;"And it felt similar to the Falcon Super Bowl where they had like 85 offensive plays,"
19:46,280;19:50,200;"but just like kept turning the ball over and shit three times. Yeah."
19:50,200;19:53,880;"I think all of them were Brady's fault. Oh, yeah."
19:53,880;19:58,520;"Because they had the two interceptions. Every single one. And then Brady got hit"
19:58,520;20:01,640;"as he threw and like, oh, he was getting dragged to the ground, tried to throw it."
20:01,640;20:07,480;"And he like, it fell out backwards out of his hand. Now's return. But again,"
20:07,480;20:09,240;"I had ourselves here. Yeah. So lucky to"
20:09,240;20:13,880;"honest turnovers. But yeah, we'll get there. Yeah."
20:14,840;20:20,480;"But yeah, so the, the, basically the first quarter was just one drive,"
20:20,480;20:26,120;"a surrounded by some three and outs and it was a Texans try like there."
20:26,120;20:28,000;"They're starting to pull out all the stops in the first quarter."
20:28,000;20:30,440;"They tried to flee flicker that didn't work because the page,"
20:30,440;20:32,080;"it's defensive back didn't bite on it."
20:32,080;20:36,880;"Um, but then they get that path interference that brings them to New England 15."
20:36,880;20:41,320;"And then they tried another trick play where they did like a."
20:42,520;20:47,520;"They toss it to Gaffney, but it was technically like a throw behind."
20:47,520;20:49,000;"Growing and he went to the back of the house."
20:49,000;20:49,320;"Yeah."
20:49,320;20:50,520;"And they covered it."
20:50,520;20:53,880;"Yeah. And so he rear back, he was going to throw and there was nothing."
20:53,880;20:58,960;"So he talked it down and ran for a 15 yard down to like inside the one thing."
20:58,960;21:02,120;"Gaffney that ends up playing in 2017. Correct."
21:02,120;21:03,640;"This is that same Gaffney."
21:03,640;21:06,040;"No, I mean, he has six."
21:06,040;21:09,520;"I think it was even better if you remember from 2007, it was like that,"
21:09,520;21:11,360;"but like faster and more shifty."
21:11,360;21:12,720;"he had a signal on there."
21:12,720;21:13,160;"Yeah."
21:13,160;21:13,520;"Oh, yeah."
21:13,520;21:14,920;"No, he was a--"
21:14,920;21:16,400;"he was an elusive fellow."
21:16,400;21:21,480;"But so he takes it down to the 1."
21:21,480;21:25,920;"And so they have first in goal from-- even inside the 1,"
21:25,920;21:26,640;"I'd say."
21:26,640;21:29,760;"And from there, they go 3 and out,"
21:29,760;21:32,640;"doing the defense in Ted Washington."
21:32,640;21:36,240;"There was a quote here, Randy Cross and Kevin Harlan"
21:36,240;21:38,920;"in this one, his commentators, which--"
21:38,920;21:41,360;"Definitely not the A team, but that's fine."
21:41,360;21:51,160;"I think it was Rainey crosses the color guy and he was talking about Richard Seymour and how big of a man he was and Ted Washington's back at this point."
21:51,160;21:55,400;"So he said, talk about Seymour as a man."
21:55,400;21:58,200;"Ted Washington is a man and a half."
21:58,200;22:00,200;"Just ridiculous."
22:00,200;22:02,920;"They were pretty on on this game."
22:02,920;22:05,440;"I was not a fan of."
22:05,440;22:07,280;"I did not."
22:08,200;22:11,940;"But yeah, just like and they were they were wrong like Ted Washington"
22:11,940;22:14,840;"Anybody that can make"
22:14,840;22:17,000;"Richard Seymour look small"
22:17,000;22:23,480;"Is a fucking huge human being and Ted Washington's that team him being back their run defense short right the fuck up"
22:23,480;22:25,240;"Yeah, oh yeah immediately"
22:25,240;22:31,080;"Especially on especially on this this goal line stand where they basically the the text go three and out from the goal line running at three"
22:31,080;22:33,560;"Times no, they ran it twice up the middle"
22:34,200;22:38,960;"the Greg's favorite route on third. Yeah, through the fade route to Andre Johnson and"
22:38,960;22:41,760;"tie law covered it and then basically T bags."
22:41,760;22:44,960;"Andre Johnson, he should have got a taunting pound."
22:44,960;22:49,000;"You definitely know, check very mad about that. Yeah, not happy."
22:49,000;22:52,280;"I believe no Jack was like, you're so fucking lucky because I would have given the first"
22:52,280;22:55,480;"that would have given me four downs because that was on third down to that."
22:55,480;22:57,840;"You were getting off the field and you felt the had to be such a dickhead."
22:57,840;23:01,600;"You had to fucking stand over with your balls and he's waggling your finger at him."
23:01,600;23:04,560;"He did legit did that in the commentary like that should have been a"
23:04,560;23:04,960;"topic."
23:04,960;23:07,040;"And I thought, yeah, sure."
23:07,040;23:08,680;"Yeah, it should have, but it wasn't."
23:08,680;23:09,520;"So, um,"
23:09,520;23:10,280;"big Texans."
23:10,280;23:11,320;"Huh?"
23:11,320;23:12,840;"I just played that perfect."
23:12,840;23:13,840;"Yeah."
23:13,840;23:13,880;"Yeah."
23:13,880;23:14,720;"It was, yeah."
23:14,720;23:17,080;"It was the perfect throw too, but yeah, great ball."
23:17,080;23:17,520;"Yep."
23:17,520;23:22,360;"Tyloges knocked the hands down right the last second as Andrew Johnson got his hands on the football."
23:22,360;23:24,440;"So they start off a field goal."
23:24,440;23:26,480;"That's the first quarter."
23:26,480;23:30,640;"Um, second quarter, Brady says, fuck it."
23:30,800;23:35,800;"and just drives the team down the field immediately."
23:35,800;23:39,120;"And then hits Bethel Johnson for 27 year touchdown."
23:39,120;23:41,560;"Bethel Johnson's first ever as a..."
23:41,560;23:42,760;"- Dude, he looks for you."
23:42,760;23:45,040;"But Bethel Johnson never really could do is break tackles."
23:45,040;23:47,440;"And he was breaking tackles left and right in this game."
23:47,440;23:48,880;"- He wasn't bad, yeah, he was running routes"
23:48,880;23:49,720;"and everything too."
23:49,720;23:51,640;"- Yeah, he ran like a nice corner route,"
23:51,640;23:54,440;"broke the tackle and then he's gone."
23:54,440;23:55,960;"- Yeah, you can see that on now."
23:55,960;23:58,080;"- I'd say Brady was too, they on the replay."
23:58,080;24:00,720;"- Oh yeah, he was the first one down there to congratulate."
24:00,720;24:02,720;"I think it goes four yards and jumped right."
24:02,720;24:03,220;"Yeah."
24:03,220;24:04,720;"And do that."
24:04,720;24:06,220;"Yeah."
24:06,220;24:07,720;"You don't do that no more."
24:07,720;24:08,720;"He does."
24:08,720;24:10,220;"Just not for us."
24:10,220;24:13,720;"No, I'm going to see him getting like, I don't know."
24:13,720;24:15,720;"Like I haven't even watched all the bucks game."
24:15,720;24:16,720;"So I don't know if you like."
24:16,720;24:18,220;"Well, I'm working on new projects."
24:18,220;24:21,720;"So I had to grab all of the touch sounds he's thrown as a buck in the air."
24:21,720;24:23,720;"And he does that."
24:23,720;24:24,720;"Why are you grabbing?"
24:24,720;24:26,720;"You know, I don't know."
24:26,720;24:27,720;"Yeah."
24:27,720;24:29,720;"When it's done, I'll not count it."
24:29,720;24:36,040;"down to, but yeah, he still does it. I'm not whatever, whatever is done, I'm not gonna watch it."
24:36,040;24:45,160;"Well, we'll see. We'll see. Yeah. So Brady, so we throw this touchdown,"
24:45,160;24:51,480;"paths are up, seven, three, and then Texas go three and out, Brady immediately drives"
24:51,480;24:56,680;"them right back down the field again. They get inside the Texans 20, and then this is"
24:56,680;25:00,280;"This is fucking ridiculous. Brady gets picked off, throws an interception on, I think it"
25:00,280;25:05,760;"was on third down. Throws an inception basically on the goal line to one of their linebackers."
25:05,760;25:11,760;"I felt like it was even worse decision than that of him forcing it. He had like half tackle"
25:11,760;25:15,160;"these on the five yard line. Yeah, he's a, yeah. Everybody's packed in there. He just"
25:15,160;25:20,280;"tries to throw it in like three Texans converge in one piece of loss. And I guess picked off."
25:20,280;25:26,640;"But as he starts returning it, Bethel Johnson comes and punches the ball out. And then the"
25:26,640;25:28,560;"the page to recover. I think 4A jumped on it."
25:28,560;25:31,920;"So the page is actually advanced like 10 yards."
25:31,920;25:34,080;"So now they're on like the five yard line."
25:34,080;25:36,680;"But then you set it down."
25:36,680;25:38,000;"Exactly."
25:38,000;25:40,640;"Because that's what happens when you fumbled and then refundable it."
25:40,640;25:46,400;"And the only reason I knew I knew that rule was when we used to play like Madden"
25:46,400;25:48,920;"or whatever those games were and turn the fumbles all the way up."
25:48,920;25:50,600;"So every play had three fumbles in it."
25:50,600;25:54,040;"And every play was always the first down because you would fumble it."
25:54,040;25:56,040;"And the other team would pick it up return and they would fumble it."
25:56,040;25:56,880;"and they're just back and forth."
25:56,880;25:57,720;"- That makes sense, yep."
25:57,720;25:58,560;"- Yeah."
25:58,560;25:59,600;"So I remember that rule from--"
25:59,600;26:01,960;"- Oh no, there's a real roller coaster to play."
26:01,960;26:03,120;"- Yeah."
26:03,120;26:06,120;"So the Patriots have like first goal from the five."
26:06,120;26:10,240;"And I think it's like an immediate false start"
26:10,240;26:12,080;"'cause this is the season where they almost"
26:12,080;26:13,080;"lead the league in penalties."
26:13,080;26:14,240;"I think they're third at this point."
26:14,240;26:16,480;"- They're just like eight and a half per game"
26:16,480;26:17,320;"or something ridiculous."
26:17,320;26:20,560;"So on Patriot like, so I do that."
26:20,560;26:22,960;"And then Brady ends up like running it twice,"
26:22,960;26:25,800;"which is not good for your offense."
26:25,800;26:29,240;"Brady's trying to run it. He puts in the same situation again and he throws it away."
26:29,240;26:38,040;"Yeah. But then, so they settle for field goal. And at this point, the commentators are"
26:38,040;26:43,880;"on Vinotary's nuts, like dangling off with their lips."
26:43,880;26:50,680;"They actually had a trial. Stop blaming these commentators because every fucking single"
26:50,680;26:55,480;"commentator said this for about three years. Oh, out of Vinotary's never missed me. Don't"
26:55,480;26:57,240;"makes it a done the goddamn Super Bowl."
26:57,240;26:58,080;"I can kind of jinx them."
26:58,080;26:59,920;"So they finally fucking worked."
26:59,920;27:02,280;"Yeah, here it is."
27:02,280;27:04,880;"Go."
27:04,880;27:06,160;"Why the super position?"
27:06,160;27:09,840;"Is that a military who has never missed in his career in a"
27:09,840;27:11,800;"gone 21 year old?"
27:11,800;27:13,680;"And it is cool."
27:13,680;27:15,960;"Cool."
27:15,960;27:18,440;"So why why are we playing that, Steve?"
27:18,440;27:21,440;"Why are we sharing a fucking 21 year field goal in the"
27:21,440;27:22,680;"commentators and audit?"
27:23,840;27:25,840;"Because later he misses one"
27:25,840;27:30,640;"Okay, I mean, that's why I say it he misses one of you know half"
27:30,640;27:33,520;"So all right well"
27:33,520;27:39,040;"Yeah, we had a very the lead but cool so they so they talk about that about how he's never missed inside the dome"
27:39,040;27:43,600;"He hasn't he's made 11 of his last 12 field goals"
27:43,600;27:48,240;"They mentioned twice actually throw up another graphic on it and they're talking about you like like they were"
27:48,240;27:51,380;"Constantly talking about Adam in a terrible. He never fucking misses"
27:52,480;27:57,620;"My point is that happens all the time. Every time he kicks in the dome, but this was like"
27:57,620;28:01,300;"aggressive one of the Super Bowl kicking in a dome"
28:01,300;28:04,480;"They said I'm two years ago positive"
28:04,480;28:10,000;"They said that in the Super Bowl against the ramp. They had that same fucking stat. This is the same stat just updated"
28:10,000;28:12,000;"I don't I don't think it did because well"
28:12,000;28:14,200;"Maybe they did"
28:14,200;28:20,560;"So yeah, I'll be an answer to say that and now's and my note is finally they will stop talking about indoor field goals"
28:20,560;28:27,840;"And now you can just fuck up about it because everyone was saying and I was sick of hearing him. I already know that I watch every"
28:27,840;28:30,880;"Beat just came to that one, you know, we'll get some more of it too. But yes,"
28:30,880;28:34,960;"Yeah, a lot of inventory talking this"
28:34,960;28:42,200;"All right, I'm gonna get off that before I go on a rant"
28:42,200;28:48,600;"I thought the I thought they were great. So he kicks a field goal. Pats up 10 3 and then"
28:50,200;28:56,400;"Nothing else happens except the Patriots right at the end of the half end up driving to the Texans 20"
28:56,400;28:59,480;"And Vinotary who has never missed Steve"
28:59,480;29:05,000;"I don't know if you know this but he's never missed indoors ever and because they've closed the roof because it was raining and"
29:05,000;29:08,680;"Houston this is technically indoors, so he's never missed inside a dome"
29:08,680;29:12,280;"Doints it off the the right upright"
29:12,280;29:15,760;"Yeah"
29:15,760;29:18,560;"So I'm thinking I'm actually glad for him to miss that."
29:18,560;29:22,440;"So commentators were sneaky."
29:22,440;29:26,520;"They had great points and they said, you know, there's hidden points there where"
29:26,520;29:29,720;"the Texans had first and goal in the one and they got three points."
29:29,720;29:30,640;"I said, that's four points."
29:30,640;29:32,920;"You're going to miss and I missed it later and get the field goal."
29:32,920;29:34,320;"Misses that you're going to miss with points."
29:34,320;29:35,120;"So all right."
29:35,120;29:35,920;"Let's talk about these."
29:35,920;29:38,240;"These guys, Randy, Randy Cross and Kevin Harlan."
29:38,240;29:39,960;"So obviously not your, your A team, right?"
29:39,960;29:42,800;"But they."
29:44,720;29:48,380;"There's a couple of things that bother me as there tends to be."
29:48,380;29:54,580;"They were, I don't say like learn a new trick or they were like told to do this,"
29:54,580;29:59,720;"but they loved telling you what the defensive alignment was."
29:59,720;30:00,700;"I don't know."
30:00,700;30:02,020;"Patriots out in a three, four."
30:02,020;30:04,260;"Oh, oh, yeah."
30:04,260;30:07,500;"I mean, Patriots out in a four or six, but they said if they're the, they're,"
30:07,500;30:11,540;"they're playing dime or nickel, you know, they said five defensive backs for"
30:11,540;30:11,980;"Texans."
30:11,980;30:12,580;"So you know, yeah."
30:13,300;30:17,320;"But they didn't like use that information for anything useful."
30:17,320;30:18,440;"They just like told you."
30:18,440;30:19,160;"Yeah."
30:19,160;30:23,020;"Because if you're a good old, maybe that means the Texans are expecting past, you know,"
30:23,020;30:24,700;"but they didn't even do that though."
30:24,700;30:27,340;"They just they're like, oh, and the Texans come out in a three, four."
30:27,340;30:28,920;"I was like, well, but that was it."
30:28,920;30:31,880;"I guess some of us here, Andy are smart enough to know."
30:31,880;30:33,680;"I didn't know."
30:33,680;30:38,740;"But and like at times he was like, oh, that then they only have two down."
30:38,740;30:40,400;"The Texans only have two down linemen."
30:40,400;30:41,000;"Like that's cool."
30:41,000;30:42,000;"Like expand on it."
30:42,000;30:45,160;"Or these are the only two teams in the whole league playing the free for."
30:45,160;30:49,040;"So he's, you know, making a comment on how these two defenses are some of the"
30:49,040;30:52,160;"only two in the league and stroke a luck."
30:52,160;30:53,720;"Who's coaching this team?"
30:53,720;30:58,600;"Don capers who ends up, you know, playing a coach with the Patriots."
30:58,600;31:00,360;"Oh, yeah, it does."
31:00,360;31:01,120;"Yeah."
31:01,120;31:01,400;"That's right."
31:01,400;31:02,880;"Good."
31:02,880;31:03,240;"Cool."
31:03,240;31:08,480;"Unlike their defensive coordinator, Vic Fangio, who's a current"
31:08,480;31:09,320;"Broncos head coach."
31:09,320;31:10,760;"I did not use a DC."
31:11,240;31:17,000;"Yep. And he's not doing great as a head coach, whether or not it's the Bronco situation or him."
31:17,000;31:23,880;"Let's claim they're on our way. They're 12 and 20 in his two years there, which is a 375 wind"
31:23,880;31:30,680;"percentage for those of you keeping those. Do you better his first two years in? No. No."
31:30,680;31:36,360;"No. No. He's he's improving. It's from the Fence Aquina first in to head coach first in."
31:37,080;31:38,080;"It's about the same."
31:38,080;31:48,080;"Yeah, but they were also talking about how Givens out and he had scored an overtime touchdown against the Broncos or something."
31:48,080;31:50,720;"Which I don't."
31:50,720;31:52,680;"He just mixed up the games."
31:52,680;31:55,120;"He was talking about the Miami game, maybe."
31:55,120;31:59,280;"Well, that's like, oh, yeah, he caught a touchdown in over time against Miami."
31:59,280;32:00,200;"I'm like, well, no, I was trying to brag."
32:00,200;32:01,200;"He's like, no, actually no."
32:01,200;32:04,360;"Give us caught the overtime touchdown against the Broncos."
32:04,360;32:05,600;"I know."
32:06,200;32:10,800;"They haven't been in overtime against the Broncos since whatever he's that was game was intense."
32:10,800;32:14,840;"You know, it felt like an overtime game with the fake with the intentional, you know, safety and"
32:14,840;32:19,400;"yeah, I guess, but had the had the drama intensity of overtime."
32:19,400;32:19,840;"I don't know."
32:19,840;32:27,240;"But and lastly on commentate, shooting on the commentators section of the podcast by Andy Brown."
32:27,240;32:33,960;"I believe it was Randy Cross is talking about the the Patriots biggest problem was that they had"
32:33,960;32:39,520;"so many starters that they will dilute their own pro ball votes."
32:39,520;32:42,800;"So they won't have anybody go to the pro ball because they've had so many"
32:42,800;32:46,000;"starters, like the tie law probably gets a vote."
32:46,000;32:47,280;"So Rodney Harris all gets on."
32:47,280;32:48,040;"It's all stats."
32:48,040;32:50,040;"And he liked how they operated as a team."
32:50,040;32:52,360;"No, okay."
32:52,360;32:54,120;"That's which is true."
32:54,120;32:54,920;"Okay."
32:54,920;32:56,640;"Great little bit of commentating."
32:56,640;32:59,920;"He said this screen game, how many reception yards and give them fall cap?"
32:59,920;33:03,440;"He's like, it is the deodorant for this Patriots offense."
33:03,440;33:08,680;"You know, because they stunk out loud and the whole offense stunk out loud except for Kevin"
33:08,680;33:14,880;"Folk your early season MVP. Early dynasty MVP. They're rushing in receiving because he's"
33:14,880;33:20,720;"right. Did the rest of the offense did stink? Well, they did not deserve to win this game."
33:20,720;33:29,440;"I want to say that right now. Yeah. They had so many penalties. They're so shit. Yeah."
33:29,440;33:37,040;"And even like their typical score, both sides of the half, which they were kind of set up to do,"
33:37,040;33:42,320;"Vinditary hits the upright at the end of the half, and then they get the ball coming out of half time,"
33:42,320;33:49,280;"drive down to the Texas 35, and go for it on fourth, right?"
33:49,280;33:53,440;"Yeah, it's fourth and five. And I don't know if they just like didn't trust that,"
33:53,440;33:58,480;"like if there was something going on with them or what, but like, man, it's kind of out of his"
33:58,480;34:03,280;"rate it was longer like what 50 yard air. Yeah, it was 50 plus I think Adam hits those."
34:03,280;34:10,000;"And your commentators your boys there like oh Adam Benatari is like money from 50 plus"
34:10,000;34:14,400;"it's got as long as the 57 so there should be a chip shop for him. And then the page like now"
34:14,400;34:18,560;"when he's gonna go from fourth and five and then getting down. Nope."
34:18,560;34:21,280;"Grant should have had it. Why would you go in the offense kind of you know,"
34:21,280;34:27,600;"let's don't. There's no big plays really. There's the one that whole couple late late you know."
34:27,600;34:32,640;"Well, and even on that play, they took a deep shot too, which almost made me think of like,"
34:32,640;34:39,920;"they were fine with giving up that field position because their defense was so good."
34:39,920;34:45,280;"And the Texans had done literally nothing so far in the first half. And it worked out because"
34:45,280;34:53,040;"Texans only from the 34 got to about midfield before they had to punt. And they actually pointed"
34:53,040;34:58,400;"out. I'll give you this point. They pointed out that the Patriots were actually doing"
34:58,400;35:05,760;"a little bit of the zero blitz that we'd seen work more recently than what they call themselves."
35:05,760;35:09,680;"But it didn't work. Oh, in the Jets, the scene goes Donald. Yeah."
35:09,680;35:15,120;"Quite the same, but yeah. But it was that defense versus the zero blitz. They had no strong say,"
35:15,120;35:20,320;"but it was also the blitz that bit the Cowboys in the ass last week against the Patriots where"
35:20,320;35:24,640;"The only place the Patriots actually got yards off of where the Cowboys did that zero blitz."
35:24,640;35:27,600;"So I don't know if that was like Belichick."
35:27,600;35:30,960;"- Definitely. - Give it a big old middle finger to"
35:30,960;35:32,480;"Bill Piers. - Well, you can go, Bill."
35:32,480;35:49,520;"- And Blitz like inexperienced Tony Banks, which is an inexperienced"
35:49,520;35:53,280;"hundred for his career. So this would be the last time it'd be 500, right?"
35:53,280;35:58,320;"Oh, sure. Because he'll never, because he goes on his massive win streak and he'll never lose that"
35:58,320;36:09,280;"many in a row. So not only was he 500, but he was 69 and 69. Oh, nice. So yeah, I mean, you can"
36:09,280;36:14,640;"watch this game just for that if you want. Yeah. What was the timestamp when that stack comes up"
36:14,640;36:18,320;"in? Good question. Did I screenshot it? I don't think I did. I'll have to go back and find it."
36:18,320;36:21,800;"It's not the highlights on the website."
36:21,800;36:22,300;"That's true."
36:22,300;36:22,800;"It should be."
36:22,800;36:26,000;"It should definitely be."
36:26,000;36:29,000;"Right after that, the possession though, Tom Brady throws a stupid pick."
36:29,000;36:31,440;"Yeah, he does."
36:31,440;36:33,960;"It turned it to R29."
36:33,960;36:37,600;"So like if the Patriots added and just played like a bunch of assholes, it would have won"
36:37,600;36:41,240;"this game easily, but they just turned it over at terrible times."
36:41,240;36:42,240;"Yep."
36:42,240;36:43,240;"That's so lucky."
36:43,240;36:44,240;"Yeah."
36:44,240;36:48,200;"Don't pile these kill drives and just let the Texans hang around and actually take a"
36:48,200;36:49,200;"a pretty good lead."
36:49,200;36:55,000;"Right. So instead of like putting the game away there, like the each side of the half"
36:55,000;36:59,360;"scoring a couple points in the middle there and being up by a couple of scores because"
36:59,360;37:03,840;"they went into the halftime 10-3. It could have been 13-3 and then like score again on"
37:03,840;37:08,160;"the second half and now you're up by two scores. Instead, Brady gets picked off. Texan"
37:08,160;37:11,720;"start at the Patriots 11. I think it was like two plays later on to Johnson had to"
37:11,720;37:14,920;"touchdown. So now it's tie game 1010."
37:14,920;37:18,520;"And pretty good about themselves."
37:18,520;37:22,600;"Right. But then Brady in true Brady fashion gets the ball back and"
37:22,600;37:25,280;"meet his storms right down the field again in like fuck you mode."
37:25,280;37:29,400;"This is where he hits JJ Stokes to get it inside the 10 yard line."
37:29,400;37:31,400;"Everyone yard bomb. Yeah."
37:31,400;37:33,080;"That was your JJ Stokes."
37:33,080;37:36,320;"Snapchat sighting. Yeah. Of the game."
37:36,320;37:41,320;"And so going into like break it sack on third down the last play the third quarter."
37:41,320;37:45,240;"So fourth quarter starts with the Vinitary hitting a short field goal, which he actually makes"
37:45,240;37:48,880;"so off the Schneider again kind of"
37:48,880;37:53,440;"And now we're in the fourth quarter and this is where shit just kind of goes a little wild"
37:53,440;37:55,720;"because it's"
37:55,720;37:59,760;"It was 10 10 at the end of the third and this game ends 23 20"
37:59,760;38:04,260;"In overtime right in overtime right so and"
38:04,260;38:08,840;"Vinitary's just kick the field goal to make it 13 10 just get to this quarter"
38:08,840;38:14,140;"You know, you don't need to see that's what I'm saying. So skip to the fourth quarter. We've talked you through all of it"
38:14,140;38:20,280;"Yeah, just you should we should mark what time that starts so just get the video and start it in"
38:20,280;38:22,840;"Yeah, should I last like 45 minutes?"
38:22,840;38:26,140;"Probably is yeah just start at the second half"
38:26,140;38:31,340;"But yeah, and the game is on YouTube so you can find on the website"
38:31,340;38:36,740;"I'll post a link in the show notes to the website so you can find all this stuff"
38:36,740;38:41,740;"I thought it was Dynasty.info."
38:41,740;38:42,740;"- That's right."
38:42,740;38:44,480;"- Where I used to think it was,"
38:44,480;38:45,900;"I don't know why I thought this when you first started"
38:45,900;38:48,900;"this website, I thought it was Dynasty."
38:48,900;38:50,060;"- It is."
38:50,060;38:51,260;"- Like, nasty in all caps,"
38:51,260;38:53,060;"like you didn't say Dynasty,"
38:53,060;38:55,140;"it was like the Patriot Dynasty."
38:55,140;38:55,980;"It was nasty."
38:55,980;38:57,500;"- We put the nasty in the Dynasty."
38:57,500;38:58,340;"- Yeah."
38:58,340;38:59,340;"(laughs)"
38:59,340;39:01,460;"- I don't know why, I thought they were for a good year."
39:01,460;39:02,980;"- I bet you did."
39:02,980;39:06,380;"Well, I mean, it is because you can't read probably, so."
39:06,380;39:07,220;"- Yes, she's a science scientist."
39:07,220;39:08,300;"- You didn't read what you wanted, right?"
39:08,300;39:09,740;"- I was down in that out."
39:09,740;39:12,140;"(laughing)"
39:12,140;39:13,940;"- Oh boy, Steven."
39:13,940;39:16,900;"(sighing)"
39:16,900;39:18,540;"How long did it take you to learn how to spell your name?"
39:18,540;39:20,980;"'Cause it got the PH in there, it probably wasn't easy."
39:20,980;39:22,500;"- Mm, I don't know."
39:22,500;39:23,980;"They tried to hold me back in first grade,"
39:23,980;39:24,980;"and mom said no."
39:24,980;39:26,820;"(laughing)"
39:26,820;39:28,100;"- Scared you for life."
39:28,100;39:29,380;"- True story, yeah."
39:29,380;39:30,740;"'Cause you had to pop the teachers and say,"
39:30,740;39:32,060;"""You're not holding them back."""
39:32,060;39:33,980;"You can't even read."
39:33,980;39:35,980;"She's like"
39:35,980;39:41,640;"Back so and then I went on a second grade damn good. I'll be very convincing Andy. You know that"
39:41,640;39:45,140;"This is true. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I have nothing to add"
39:45,140;39:50,800;"British accent people are like oh, you're so charming and convincing mm-hmm"
39:50,800;39:55,480;"Yep, no, she convinced a lot of people do a lot of things. I won't give you a speeding ticket"
39:55,480;40:00,740;"Yeah, oh, you shoot well. That's because she used to cry or pretend to cry when she got pulled over"
40:01,060;40:06,300;"And being British you doing like 80 on the back roads and her for a little fucking z4"
40:06,300;40:09,420;"Jesus some people"
40:09,420;40:15,600;"I wonder what she's yelling at the radio right now cuz I know she's listening to this"
40:15,600;40:18,740;"She's probably quilting she's getting off fire not"
40:18,740;40:24,340;"She's go. Yeah, I'll get I'll get the text. Well, we'll we'll read it next next week"
40:24,340;40:30,580;"So let's get into the fake tuck rule cuz that's the next big play here. It is yeah"
40:30,580;40:36,260;"Yeah, because, yeah, the Patriots hit the field goal to start the quarter and then Texas"
40:36,260;40:38,340;"immediately go three and out and punt it."
40:38,340;40:42,740;"And so New England again drives straight down the field."
40:42,740;40:47,060;"Like David, like Brady tries a, he did this a couple times again, but he tried a QB sneak"
40:47,060;40:49,420;"on third and like five."
40:49,420;40:53,420;"And the last time you got picked up seven and this time he picked up four, so it's three."
40:53,420;40:57,460;"So it's fourth and two and then they'll just run it straight down the Texans throat with"
40:57,460;40:58,700;"Kevin Falk who picks up."
40:58,700;40:59,980;"- No, that's not just me."
40:59,980;41:02,740;"Like they're just getting big chunk places."
41:02,740;41:04,900;"Three yards, 12 yards, three yards, two yards,"
41:04,900;41:07,660;"three yards, four yards, seven again."
41:07,660;41:08,740;"- That's kind of what it is then."
41:08,740;41:11,020;"Like the penis conference is just like barely"
41:11,020;41:12,980;"springing it together, you know?"
41:12,980;41:14,860;"- But it kind of felt inevitable too."
41:14,860;41:16,340;"Like they're just picking up steam and just--"
41:16,340;41:18,180;"- Only because the Texans offense"
41:18,180;41:20,780;"was absolutely hot garbage."
41:20,780;41:21,620;"- Hot, it was a dozen--"
41:21,620;41:23,300;"- As it had to meant for art turnovers,"
41:23,300;41:24,860;"they would have like zero points."
41:24,860;41:26,260;"- Right, yeah, oh yeah."
41:26,260;41:27,940;"- They haven't been able to actually do anything,"
41:27,940;41:32,280;"maybe get a field goal, but because we've been keeping them in the game, they've been"
41:32,280;41:35,500;"just taking advantage of being capitalizing when they've been given some turnover."
41:35,500;41:40,220;"Which I think the commentators were kind of alluding to that's kind of how this team"
41:40,220;41:41,220;"was running."
41:41,220;41:43,180;"Yeah, on the top game, which is true."
41:43,180;41:44,180;"Yeah."
41:44,180;41:48,380;"And they were next week, we've got the Colts, who are also like 18-0, whatever."
41:48,380;41:49,380;"Yeah."
41:49,380;41:53,060;"But they were, yeah, because they were just like hanging with teams because they're good"
41:53,060;41:56,100;"defense and then try to capitalize on the mistakes. And the"
41:56,100;41:57,660;"Patriots made plenty of those."
41:57,660;42:02,100;"Which is kind of a Patriot strategy anyways. Yeah. And I"
42:02,100;42:06,180;"think what this past season, after one of these after one of"
42:06,180;42:08,780;"these touchdowns, or was one of his touchdowns passes every three"
42:08,780;42:13,580;"games and you win it. Yeah, yeah, exactly. But after one of"
42:13,580;42:16,180;"these touchdowns, they even said, come here like, I don't know"
42:16,180;42:19,180;"what that noise is, it's either fireworks or so sound of the"
42:19,180;42:22,300;"trap snapping shot on the Patriots leg."
42:22,300;42:23,780;"They talk about it."
42:23,780;42:24,380;"Oh, God."
42:24,380;42:25,340;"Well, I love that one."
42:25,340;42:26,660;"Good."
42:26,660;42:27,220;"You would."
42:27,220;42:30,580;"Which I know exactly when they say that it's coming up."
42:30,580;42:33,180;"Tom Brady fumbles it again."
42:33,180;42:34,060;"Yeah."
42:34,060;42:35,020;"Throws backwards."
42:35,020;42:37,220;"They were almost able to talk rule, but they weren't because the"
42:37,220;42:38,380;"tuck rule still in effect."
42:38,380;42:40,780;"Sure is, but instead he actually threw it backwards."
42:40,780;42:41,980;"Yeah."
42:41,980;42:45,580;"So it was actually a very similar looking play to the snowball."
42:45,580;42:48,620;"Unseen linebacker coming out the edge and just."
42:48,620;42:51,620;"Yeah, so this guy was from his blind side, but yes."
42:51,620;42:56,220;"And so yeah, they had just converted the fourth into"
42:56,220;42:59,320;"and they're like inside Texans territory."
42:59,320;43:01,160;"And Brady gets hit from behind,"
43:01,160;43:03,220;"literally fumbles the ball backwards"
43:03,220;43:05,300;"as if he's like threw it backwards."
43:05,300;43:07,700;"And one of the Texans linebackers picks it up"
43:07,700;43:11,420;"on the full sprint and gets down to--"
43:11,420;43:13,260;"- It's using 36."
43:13,260;43:15,980;"Humbles it on 35, they take it all the way."
43:15,980;43:17,500;"- To New England's 31."
43:17,500;43:24,740;"Yeah. And so starting there, they would eventually convert one of their few third downs because"
43:24,740;43:32,100;"Texans, this I did take a screenshot off. Houston Texans on the season were converting"
43:32,100;43:40,500;"third downs at 33.3%. Not great. Andre Johnson. I mean, and they were two. They were two of"
43:40,500;43:46,940;"nine on the game until this Andre Johnson third and nine conversion. He had a tough first"
43:46,940;43:53,340;"half, but he picked up in the second half, which is, I mean, this is game, what, 10 for him or whatever it is."
43:53,340;43:55,700;"Yeah, 12 or whatever. I think we're on week 12."
43:55,700;43:57,580;"As a pro, he's getting covered by Tai Law."
43:57,580;43:58,260;"Right."
43:58,260;44:00,700;"Something that shit out of him, he doesn't convert to the truth."
44:00,700;44:06,780;"But the actually even like before the game started, they were talking about, oh, we talked to Tai Law."
44:06,780;44:14,500;"And yeah, he's hurt, but usually he would cover the, like the leading wide receiver and just like follow him across the field wherever he goes."
44:15,220;44:19,780;"But they're so happy with Tyrone Poole in the way he's covering that"
44:19,780;44:21,820;"Tyla is just going to play one side of field."
44:21,820;44:25,260;"And if AJ goes the other side, he's just going to be covered by"
44:25,260;44:25,500;"Tyla."
44:25,500;44:28,180;"You try to go after him to Tyrone Poole played really well."
44:28,180;44:30,780;"Tyrone Poole had himself a game in this game."
44:30,780;44:36,020;"He similar to like the Steph Jacksonville, AFC Championship."
44:36,020;44:37,020;"Yeah, Gilmoury."
44:37,020;44:37,420;"Yeah."
44:37,420;44:40,060;"But it was kind of over his head more and not like a dive out."
44:40,060;44:41,820;"It was a very similar play."
44:41,820;44:42,580;"Yeah."
44:42,820;44:45,880;"And and he's been doing that for the past few weeks in a row now."
44:45,880;44:50,060;"Like they keep targeting him on the deep ball and he covers it textbook every time."
44:50,060;44:53,900;"He's in the receivers back pocket and as the ball gets there, tips it away."
44:53,900;44:54,780;"It doesn't go over your side."
44:54,780;44:56,180;"Just just tips it away."
44:56,180;44:57,980;"Well, I remember I'll say that."
44:57,980;45:01,780;"Tyrone Pooley, he's like, you could almost call him a shut down corner this year."
45:01,780;45:03,900;"He's not allowed anything."
45:03,900;45:07,820;"It was like the early Brandon Browner days, but he wasn't as physical, obviously."
45:07,820;45:08,300;"Yeah."
45:08,300;45:08,780;"Yeah. Yeah."
45:08,780;45:11,780;"But having that like solid number two"
45:12,300;45:13,900;"and one and two are both sweet."
45:13,900;45:14,820;"- Yep, exactly."
45:14,820;45:17,660;"And so he's better than, like he can easily cover"
45:17,660;45:22,180;"the number two wide receiver on any offense, basically."
45:22,180;45:25,340;"- Andre Johnson had 13 targets, four catches."
45:25,340;45:28,580;"37 yards and a touchdown."
45:28,580;45:30,180;"- Wait, how many targets?"
45:30,180;45:31,020;"- 13."
45:31,020;45:37,100;"- Yeah, that's the next tie us on their team was three"
45:37,100;45:39,140;"and then a couple of guys at two."
45:39,140;45:40,900;"- Holy shit, yeah, he had--"
45:40,900;45:42,660;"- I think we're gaffing only at one."
45:42,660;45:43,500;"- I love it."
45:43,500;45:45,900;"- I only throw in once the Jabar gaffing, that's it."
45:45,900;45:48,460;"- They threw it 13 times at Andre Johnson."
45:48,460;45:49,300;"- Yeah."
45:49,300;45:51,540;"- And threw it 12 times, not at Andre Johnson."
45:51,540;45:54,180;"(laughs)"
45:54,180;45:56,780;"And he had four catches for 37 yards in the touchdown."
45:56,780;45:59,820;"- Yeah, I mean, but like he got that big touchdown"
45:59,820;46:01,700;"in that big moment."
46:01,700;46:02,540;"- That's true."
46:02,540;46:05,060;"- You had a good second half and I even--"
46:05,060;46:08,460;"- Yeah, I mean, for what their anemic offense was,"
46:08,460;46:09,980;"he was the only one doing anything."
46:09,980;46:10,980;"He was there."
46:10,980;46:11,980;"Kevin fall basically."
46:11,980;46:14,980;"This was that touchdown after the Tom Brady Fumbler."
46:14,980;46:16,380;"They're tied in Miller."
46:16,380;46:21,140;"You don't know his first name."
46:21,140;46:22,140;"Billy Miller."
46:22,140;46:24,140;"Whoa, rough name."
46:24,140;46:25,580;"That was bad parenting."
46:25,580;46:28,380;"Rimming your kids names."
46:28,380;46:30,780;"Billy, Billy, Roshan Miller."
46:30,780;46:31,780;"What?"
46:31,780;46:32,780;"Okay."
46:32,780;46:33,780;"Yeah."
46:33,780;46:36,940;"A long time tight end."
46:36,940;46:37,940;"Played."
46:37,940;46:39,580;"Quite a few."
46:39,580;46:42,860;"much at this point doing everything because he was so wide open that that's the one where"
46:42,860;46:47,260;"Ronnie Ayers and slips and like dude had no defender within 10 yards of him."
46:47,260;46:51,260;"Oh yeah, it's super open because yeah like he said Ronnie Ayers and fell on this."
46:51,260;46:54,300;"And I wrote they're doing everything we can to lose this game."
46:54,300;47:03,580;"Well, every thing again. Yep. It was in 10 from 16. And not only that, yeah, not only that is,"
47:03,580;47:08,460;"they do that, right? They allow the touchdown off of Brady's fumble. Get the ball back,"
47:08,460;47:11,460;"immediately go three and out and then they had their punt blocked."
47:11,460;47:14,880;"So Texas started again on the New England 20 yard line."
47:14,880;47:16,040;"You're like, what the fuck?"
47:16,040;47:20,760;"Cause I just, I don't even think I've said this yet, but tried to have Ryan's"
47:20,760;47:24,980;"story on today because you know, if you listen every week, you remember, we had"
47:24,980;47:29,020;"a man for a loss because like we only watched shitty games together."
47:29,020;47:32,460;"And every game we watched together, the Patriots either lose in terrible fashion."
47:32,460;47:34,860;"And this was the one game we've watched where they won."
47:34,860;47:38,040;"And when I was talking to him, he's like, Oh, yeah, remember that."
47:38,040;47:40,280;"they lost that game, didn't they? And then he looked at it,"
47:40,280;47:42,720;"like, Oh, wait, they, they won that game. I don't even remember"
47:42,720;47:45,960;"feeling that good. Like it didn't because it sucked. They tried"
47:45,960;47:48,640;"their hardest to lose this game. Well, even on that three and"
47:48,640;47:51,840;"out with the punt block, Tom Brady fumbles and gets it back."
47:51,840;47:57,440;"Or down. No, I think he fumbled it on second down and got sacked"
47:57,440;48:02,560;"on third down. So something that it was it. The drive was an"
48:02,560;48:03,960;"absolute trap. Whatever it was."
48:03,960;48:06,960;"The third down and five and some fumbles of snap."
48:06,960;48:11,760;"Oh, okay. Yeah. Then they get the punt blocked and bell check, you cut the bell check and"
48:11,760;48:19,320;"he looks so fucking mad. He's slivered. Because it's first and 10 on our 20. Yeah. And after"
48:19,320;48:22,960;"they just go to touchdown. Right. And you're already down to touchdown. Yeah. A minute"
48:22,960;48:28,600;"later, two minutes later. Yeah. So it's, oh, no, you're down four because you're down 17,"
48:28,600;48:33,960;"13th at this point. So Texas, the Texans start there in the 20 and just immediately"
48:33,960;48:39,640;"three and out because the defense just fucking nuts up and says, no, we're just not having this."
48:39,640;48:44,120;"Really, really started looking taken over at this. Yeah. So that's that's their second like"
48:44,120;48:49,000;"huge red zone stop apart from the goal line one at the beginning of the game. And now this one,"
48:49,000;48:52,840;"and it's just like this defense like, you know what? No, we're going to drag you through this."
48:52,840;48:57,640;"We're going to make you going to give you one one last chance. The Texans settle for field goal."
48:59,000;49:01,520;"And there's a few minutes left."
49:01,520;49:05,200;"Page to get the ball."
49:05,200;49:09,880;"Like inside at the at their own 20, I want to say, because they had a good kick return,"
49:09,880;49:11,960;"but that got called back for holding because the fucking course it did."
49:11,960;49:18,280;"Unlike Dan Klekow of all people who three minutes, four seconds, first and 10 from your 20."
49:18,280;49:20,360;"Yeah, down by a touchdown, right."
49:20,360;49:21,560;"In time out."
49:21,560;49:23,240;"Yeah."
49:23,240;49:25,280;"So it gets so it gets to a."
49:26,320;49:29,880;"Third and 10 I think right. I'm doing this off top of my head and"
49:29,880;49:36,420;"They get a first down on their first plate and then oh, right. Yeah, good Brady's like"
49:36,420;49:38,980;"threads the needle to"
49:38,980;49:43,820;"The Deon branch for one of his like two catches on the entire game wasn't even targeted really and"
49:43,820;49:49,160;"Then yeah first down second down just completely complete third and 10"
49:49,160;49:55,160;"Like this is your drive you got a score here or else you gonna lose a game and Brady"
49:55,720;50:00,060;"Run around the pocket looking like fucking Michael Vick or someone. Yeah, it's some good"
50:00,060;50:07,000;"escape ability actually. Yeah, it's some great. He like spun out of a tackle because he kind of he was backing like to his left like"
50:07,000;50:11,720;"Backed into the the defensive and that came there and spun out of them"
50:11,720;50:15,100;"And then kind of like ran over to the right and then back to the middle"
50:15,100;50:19,720;"I think your highlights on this. Oh, I have it's good. It'll be up on the site once this goes"
50:19,720;50:24,840;"I grabbed that one. Yeah, the two touchdowns on here and there's a lot more great plays like that one"
50:25,080;50:28,380;"Pull that that's that's the only other good. He's a kind of hidden place"
50:28,380;50:33,400;"Touchdown, but he throws that awesome ball to Daniel Graham would be an absolute"
50:33,400;50:36,720;"Frap. Yeah, who actually hangs on to it great"
50:36,720;50:41,780;"Get for a great release is that one. That's the one yeah, 33 yards on third down"
50:41,780;50:46,680;"Tom Brady did everything to like make keep the play alive. Yeah, and he kept it alive"
50:46,680;50:49,160;"And that throw was like"
50:49,160;50:51,960;"Yeah, it was a missile"
50:51,960;50:54,880;"So it's grand for 33 and then"
50:54,880;50:58,920;"Come straight back and screen to fault for 21"
50:58,920;51:04,460;"Now the pages are in business. This is their this is where their deodorant quote was I was"
51:04,460;51:08,320;"Yeah, they're like dude that deodorant is the because like they're just catching them"
51:08,320;51:11,720;"They've been screening them the death they have and"
51:11,720;51:15,200;"Yeah, and the the Texans had no answer for it whatsoever"
51:15,200;51:19,400;"They're still just running straight up field and there was some good quality"
51:20,200;51:22,200;"like they were they were doing the"
51:22,200;51:27,280;"They did one screen where they faked like they faked the screen to the left to fall"
51:27,280;51:32,000;"And then very spun around into the screens the other side's a Patrick pass. He was playing full back"
51:32,000;51:39,080;"They've always had a great screen game now. Yeah, you haven't seen it as much of late. That's true. I feel like"
51:39,080;51:43,060;"But yeah back in the day their screen game was phenomenal"
51:43,060;51:47,340;"but so they get inside the"
51:49,440;51:51,440;"Inside the Texans 10 yard line, right?"
51:51,440;52:00,240;"And it's third and five and they do a quick draw to Kevin Falk who picks up like four and three quarters."
52:00,240;52:04,400;"Yeah, I think the spot was iffy, but it's fourth and one."
52:04,400;52:06,720;"From the four."
52:06,720;52:08,400;"Yeah, with under a minute left."
52:08,400;52:14,160;"And so they do play action Brady rolls out to his right and is like,"
52:14,880;52:18,680;"They called the boot leg because the naked boot it wasn't a naked"
52:18,680;52:25,720;"It was the it was the give going left any boots and the and the end guy doesn't fall for it does not fall"
52:25,720;52:28,360;"So Bray's like the corner back off to the corner"
52:28,360;52:32,640;"He doesn't fall for it. So his tight end is covered and Brady's like running there"
52:32,640;52:38,160;"Yeah, getting chased on fourth of one and like running like backwards diagonally away from the play"
52:38,160;52:43,480;"You're like oh fuck. I've seen this pressure. Yeah, it was against his body to Graham"
52:43,520;52:49,000;"Yeah, into double coverage and Graham just like plucks it out of the defensive backs hands as he's going to the ground"
52:49,000;52:52,480;"For the time touchdown with 40 seconds left like talk about redemption"
52:52,480;52:57,120;"Man dropped his first three balls to the point where the common day was talking about how"
52:57,120;53:02,340;"It's like oh have you seen little Giants where the kid who can't catch is like talking to his hands"
53:02,340;53:04,340;"It's like they all Graham's gonna get to that point"
53:04,340;53:09,080;"Ready I just looked it on the highlight right through the ball"
53:09,560;53:14,000;"From the 14 yard line on fourth and four running backwards. Yeah"
53:14,000;53:18,620;"Yeah, I'm from four yards on the goal and see 38 team probably he threw it all the way to the back of the end zone"
53:18,620;53:25,400;"So you probably threw that ball 30 yards on the run backwards. Yeah, and hit Graham in the hands who held onto this time"
53:25,400;53:32,180;"Probably Graham's best touchdown ready to do so you can take those highlights and just like slow him down"
53:32,180;53:38,140;"You can see him thread the needle. Yep between two defenders at the goal line and Graham just out jumps the corner back"
53:38,540;53:42,940;"Yeah, the throw is exactly where I needed to be like you couldn't really put anywhere else"
53:42,940;53:47,740;"Dude if rape was was in there. Yep, right. Yeah, I'm able as a first one to the"
53:47,740;53:49,420;"Congressional and"
53:49,420;53:54,260;"Klecko was the the fullback. I think cuz they were talking about that they did hard run"
53:54,260;53:57,140;"Yeah, making boot like booted it"
53:57,140;54:03,820;"Ballsy and it was covered and it still worked anyway. No, that one of those brave wasn't gonna let that not work"
54:03,820;54:07,940;"Yeah, which is yeah different than what we see nowadays awesome"
54:07,940;54:10,660;"one of the championship plays at a break right there."
54:10,660;54:11,500;"- Yep."
54:11,500;54:12,860;"- Oh, that's what he knew, right?"
54:12,860;54:15,020;"It was like when all the pressure was on."
54:15,020;54:15,860;"- Yeah."
54:15,860;54:16,700;"- That was best."
54:16,700;54:18,620;"It's that comparison."
54:18,620;54:21,300;"I mean, going back to watching Brady this week"
54:21,300;54:23,820;"as a buccaneer playing against the..."
54:23,820;54:24,660;"- Sure."
54:24,660;54:27,980;"- Aaron Rodgers' Packers and Aaron Rodgers,"
54:27,980;54:29,300;"he's kind of the opposite."
54:29,300;54:31,500;"Like he plays big until he gets to the big moment"
54:31,500;54:34,900;"and just doesn't seem to, I don't know,"
54:34,900;54:35,740;"it's not that he can't."
54:35,740;54:37,780;"He just doesn't seem to make the right decision, I guess."
54:37,780;54:39,300;"He just,"
54:39,300;54:40,180;"and Brady has that."
54:40,180;54:44,420;"And no one else really made the Montana as that same, just extra gear, you know?"
54:44,420;54:46,060;"Yeah, that killer instinct right."
54:46,060;54:46,420;"Yeah."
54:46,420;54:49,060;"Those big moments you like if you hadn't made that third and 10 play,"
54:49,060;54:51,700;"he wouldn't even have the opportunity to the fourth and one boot."
54:51,700;54:52,700;"Yeah."
54:52,700;54:57,060;"But when it's third and long and you've seen this, I mean, I can think of"
54:57,060;55:00,980;"that a bunch of plays off top of my head of like it's third and long and the"
55:00,980;55:01,940;"seasons on the line."
55:01,940;55:03,780;"So or the even the games online or whatever."
55:04,140;55:08,660;"And Brady completes it and like gets 17 on third and 16, you know,"
55:08,660;55:11,260;"against the Jaguars and their top ranked defense."
55:11,260;55:13,060;"He also gets incredibly lucky too."
55:13,060;55:14,300;"Sometimes."
55:14,300;55:16,100;"And he comes up in overtime."
55:16,100;55:17,100;"Let's get there."
55:17,100;55:23,780;"So speaking of luck, some bad luck on the page was part because the Texans win the toss."
55:23,780;55:25,180;"Did you hear the?"
55:25,180;55:26,980;"Did you hear the off mic?"
55:26,980;55:28,860;"Yeah, from Tom Brady."
55:28,860;55:30,180;"The Patriots, so they lost it."
55:30,180;55:31,100;"That was Tom Brady."
55:32,100;55:34,380;"Because because he called tails, he's like, we want tails."
55:34,380;55:35,100;"I want that one."
55:35,100;55:38,260;"And then I think somebody on his team was like, really?"
55:38,260;55:39,420;"He's like, absolutely."
55:39,420;55:40,580;"And then he flips it."
55:40,580;55:41,180;"It was heads."
55:41,180;55:42,060;"He's like, fuck."
55:42,060;55:45,460;"And they definitely didn't kind of wave her that quick enough."
55:45,460;55:46,620;"Yeah."
55:46,620;55:47,700;"Yeah, that was great."
55:47,700;55:53,700;"So Texans received the ball first play from scrimmage."
55:53,700;55:57,460;"Your boy, Tony Banks gets picked off by Mike"
55:57,460;56:26,460;"of all people and returns it to the Texans 23. This game's fucking over. Yeah, Patriots three runs up the middle. The third one is there. They're patented Tom Brady fall to the middle of the field. QB sneak to set up perfectly. So 23 yard field goal from dead smack dab in the middle of the field. And at this point, you know, I'm just talking about how the Texans has as a franchise have never blocked a field goal. Adam Vintitary has hasn't had a field goal blocks and is open to the field."
56:26,460;56:28,780;"Phil Golbloxen's opening day 1998."
56:28,780;56:30,200;"- So before we get there,"
56:30,200;56:33,700;"pretty sure this is Mike Vable's first INT."
56:33,700;56:36,580;"- No, he's had one,"
56:36,580;56:40,460;"- He has four this season."
56:40,460;56:44,020;"- He's had one against Miami,"
56:44,020;56:46,180;"I think it was Brady's second start."
56:46,180;56:47,620;"- It was two this season."
56:47,620;56:51,460;"- The game started with an interception by Mike Vable"
56:51,460;56:52,460;"and then went down from there."
56:52,460;56:56,340;"- No, he had two in 2001, I'm an idiot."
56:56,340;56:59,140;"Yeah, that's what I'm saying. I remember one of them."
56:59,140;57:03,140;"But yes, so"
57:03,140;57:09,660;"Inception over time first play game game over. Yes. Like oh, thank God. Let's get out of here"
57:09,660;57:13,980;"You try him out there. He's only missed one field goal in a double. Yeah at this point"
57:13,980;57:18,520;"Like I'm sitting at Ryan's stories after very heavy night of drinking. I'm super hungover"
57:18,520;57:21,000;"I'm like let's just end this so I can go back to sleep"
57:22,460;57:26,760;"Adam and Terry gets this field goal is field goal from the 23-yard line blocked"
57:26,760;57:31,640;"And you're like you gotta be fucking kidding me this game is never gonna end"
57:31,640;57:34,360;"I was about to turn it off. I actually didn't even know what time was left"
57:34,360;57:36,220;"And I was like I'll turn it off it right off his foot"
57:36,220;57:38,380;"But this helped it's on and then I blocked and I was like"
57:38,380;57:41,700;"Didn't see that coming. Nope"
57:41,700;57:45,660;"I should have because I saw how long the second half was I really should have like put two and two together"
57:45,660;57:48,900;"I'm like my is an extra 30 minutes on this and yet"
57:51,340;57:59,140;"And then from there the Texas drive like inside New England territory get to the 40 and this is like they have a good kicker -"
57:59,140;58:03,140;"Talk about the the announcer's jinxing them double jinxing the block. Oh"
58:03,140;58:06,300;"I did I"
58:06,300;58:12,140;"Yeah, the Texas have never blocked a field goal and adding Vinotary hasn't had a field goal block"
58:12,140;58:16,180;"Yes in their in their history as a team. Yes and"
58:16,900;58:21,360;"Adam and Terry last time he had a field goal block was opening day 1998"
58:21,360;58:28,320;"That's mean or 2003 so that's five years right now. They're gonna kick block in five years"
58:28,320;58:31,740;"So of course, you know what happens gets blocked of course"
58:31,740;58:38,160;"Because of fucking course it does and then the Texans drive to about New England 40 right and so they have a decision to make"
58:38,160;58:42,220;"They this is the best their offenses looked in a while. Yeah, this is the first drive"
58:42,220;58:46,120;"They put together outside the first quarter because they've done the sidelines the whole time right"
58:46,120;58:52,520;"So they drive to the New England 40-yard line and they have a decision to make and their decision apparently is to punt it."
58:52,520;58:54,520;"Yes, I thought this was the decision."
58:54,520;58:59,640;"I thought this was the worst decision everybody. I got punting, playing not to lose."
58:59,640;59:02,680;"Oh, so now I hate that. I hate that."
59:02,680;59:07,560;"Punting from the New England 40 is such a tough look."
59:07,560;59:09,720;"And we've seen that a lot against these patrons."
59:09,720;59:15,320;"But like just go for it, you know, like just try to win. If you hit that, you got the win."
59:15,320;59:21,740;"get over already had possessions to you know actually didn't even count didn't even matter that point right versus go wins"
59:21,740;59:28,040;"I mean they did pin New England's inside their own 10 right. Oh their strategy actually works"
59:28,040;59:33,320;"Yeah, because they yeah the page oh, this is where pretty good sack doesn't it they go three and out break"
59:33,320;59:37,020;"It's sacked on third down and they're putting out their own end zone. No"
59:37,020;59:40,000;"No, well whatever it's what it's around here"
59:40,520;59:45,720;"They go four yards. No. Yeah, four yards. No game nine yards, Zach. They're on their 13th. Yeah. Okay. Yeah."
59:45,720;59:51,040;"No on their four. Right. And so the page is basically pun from their own end zone and"
59:51,040;59:54,680;"Texans do nothing."
59:54,680;59:56,680;"They don't need to because like"
59:56,680;01:00:02,280;"They already started in field goal range. They get it on the Patriots 35. Oh, that's right. Yeah, cuz Kent Wald was"
01:00:02,280;01:00:04,920;"31-yard punt. Just"
01:00:04,920;01:00:09,840;"I actually looked away at that one. So I was glad I didn't see that such a bad game. I"
01:00:09,840;01:00:16,840;"and kid this is a bad season for general"
01:00:16,840;01:00:19,840;"not yeah oh yeah not at this point of the season"
01:00:19,840;01:00:22,840;"we're going to see they keep saying that"
01:00:22,840;01:00:24,840;"yeah yeah these I think is"
01:00:24,840;01:00:26,840;"maybe the second worst in the league"
01:00:26,840;01:00:29,840;"if not the worst at this point he's just not good"
01:00:29,840;01:00:34,840;"but yeah so"
01:00:34,840;01:00:37,840;"the drive chart for this next drive"
01:00:37,840;01:00:42,840;"right tackle no gain left and minus five yards."
01:00:42,840;01:00:45,720;"- They're back on the New England 40 again."
01:00:45,720;01:00:46,560;"And what do they do?"
01:00:46,560;01:00:50,200;"- They go out of pool and pool makes a great,"
01:00:50,200;01:00:52,720;"is Willie for tackle no gain,"
01:00:52,720;01:00:54,120;"Willie tackle five-yard loss."
01:00:54,120;01:00:54,960;"- Yeah."
01:00:54,960;01:00:57,120;"And then Tyrone Pool makes a fantastic play"
01:00:57,120;01:01:00,160;"on third down on Andre Johnson."
01:01:00,160;01:01:03,120;"But it wasn't even like they were going for the shot again."
01:01:03,120;01:01:05,360;"It was like a 20 yard route."
01:01:05,360;01:01:06,200;"- Yep."
01:01:06,200;01:01:10,400;"And like if they had picked up the five yards that they lost,"
01:01:10,400;01:01:12,560;"like that's, that's a, they're in field goal range."
01:01:12,560;01:01:13,400;"They can give a shot."
01:01:13,400;01:01:15,480;"And instead they're back on the pages 40 yard line"
01:01:15,480;01:01:18,120;"and we know from last time they didn't kick a field goal"
01:01:18,120;01:01:19,960;"from there as they put it again."
01:01:19,960;01:01:23,560;"And they got a fair catch at the 14 yard line"
01:01:23,560;01:01:24,400;"for Kevin Faulk."
01:01:24,400;01:01:25,400;"The pages started 14."
01:01:25,400;01:01:28,200;"- One thing there again, like, I don't know, go for it."
01:01:28,200;01:01:29,800;"- Just anything."
01:01:29,800;01:01:33,400;"Let's just try something and then what happens to you?"
01:01:34,440;01:01:36,000;"And then it's Tom Brady time again."
01:01:36,000;01:01:36,840;"Mm hmm."
01:01:36,840;01:01:41,400;"So 16 yards, Kevin Falk."
01:01:41,400;01:01:48,440;"Five yards to Dietrich Ward, 14 yards of Bethel Johnson, 13 yards"
01:01:48,440;01:01:50,560;"to the branch, 10 yards of Christian for you."
01:01:50,560;01:01:52,640;"And now they're just running because they're inside."
01:01:52,640;01:01:54,800;"This is also the best of Patriots offenses."
01:01:54,800;01:01:57,520;"Like I think because the Texas defense was so tired too at this point."
01:01:57,520;01:01:58,360;"They'd rent."
01:01:58,360;01:02:00,720;"Yeah, they've been on the field for so long that, you know,"
01:02:00,720;01:02:02,320;"it's the way to the Atlanta."
01:02:02,320;01:02:07,980;"this game has some similarities that land of Super Bowl in that eventually just they just couldn't stand to the"
01:02:07,980;01:02:12,680;"Onside of Conbury and they're just yeah, and so this this drive was especially inevitable"
01:02:12,680;01:02:16,880;"But the Brit it didn't end in a touchdown like it didn't as a role, but"
01:02:16,880;01:02:22,760;"They get inside the 20 Kevin Falk up the middle five yards Kevin Falk on middle three yards"
01:02:22,760;01:02:26,840;"And on third and two with 45 seconds left out of Vinotary"
01:02:26,840;01:02:29,800;"Finally man, just connect on a 28 year field goal"
01:02:30,680;01:02:33,680;"That's uh makes it through the uprights and"
01:02:33,680;01:02:40,000;"The Patriots escape with how many wins is a trap in a row?"
01:02:40,000;01:02:41,960;"Yeah"
01:02:41,960;01:02:44,440;"Snuck out of the trap managed to shed there"
01:02:44,440;01:02:52,080;"The the trap that closed on our leg one two three four five six. This is now. There's seventh win in a row"
01:02:52,080;01:02:59,080;"They're nine and two first place in the AFC East and they're showing the"
01:03:00,200;01:03:05,280;"Chiefs were 9-1 and we're playing again later in the day and"
01:03:05,280;01:03:09,640;"The Colts were also 9-2 after beating them"
01:03:09,640;01:03:15,360;"After beating the Buffalo Bills coming from behind in similar fashion"
01:03:15,360;01:03:19,040;"Which is great because next week"
01:03:19,040;01:03:22,400;"Spam was Indianapolis Colts. Let me touch on"
01:03:22,400;01:03:29,800;"My Brady is lucky and not Jessica and not saying it's not great. I'm saying it's great and lucky"
01:03:29,800;01:03:31,800;"Touch it Steve touch it"
01:03:31,800;01:03:36,180;"The second play of that overtime drive where you just said see you later"
01:03:36,180;01:03:40,640;"He throws that brutally bad pick the safety comes over intercepts it"
01:03:40,640;01:03:41,980;"and"
01:03:41,980;01:03:50,100;"It was just just way overthrown just an awful ball and he gets picked and there's like a no-daughter, you know, and there's that"
01:03:50,100;01:03:55,740;"Holding pouty on our seat when they showed the replay of the pretty a couple times and I saw nothing there"
01:03:55,740;01:03:58,340;"Yeah, it was like the softest call of all time."
01:03:58,340;01:03:59,540;"And you just got so big,"
01:03:59,540;01:04:02,100;"because he almost just three minutes left in overtime,"
01:04:02,100;01:04:03,100;"throws a pick."
01:04:03,100;01:04:06,500;"Yeah, there was, there was a few soft calls in this game."
01:04:06,500;01:04:10,100;"Like they, they called the Texans linebacker"
01:04:10,100;01:04:13,460;"from roughing the passer to on Brady's like game time touchdown."
01:04:13,460;01:04:14,740;"You're like, that's true."
01:04:14,740;01:04:16,660;"He pushed him as he threw the ball."
01:04:16,660;01:04:17,500;"Yeah."
01:04:17,500;01:04:18,340;"And today's dangerous."
01:04:18,340;01:04:19,180;"It wasn't that bad."
01:04:19,180;01:04:20,020;"I'm back."
01:04:20,020;01:04:22,540;"This is actually kind of when it starts though."
01:04:22,540;01:04:23,380;"It is. It is."
01:04:23,380;01:04:27,780;"season it's sort of when it really starts the call it's so much harder."
01:04:27,780;01:04:29,500;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:04:29,500;01:04:35,980;"Yeah, it was a yeah, I'll give you that he was he was lucky on that play."
01:04:35,980;01:04:38,660;"All right, let's do some best and worse."
01:04:38,660;01:04:39,340;"All right."
01:04:39,340;01:04:41,580;"You go first this time."
01:04:41,580;01:04:42,500;"I always go first."
01:04:42,500;01:04:43,580;"Hmm."
01:04:43,580;01:04:49,340;"I'm happy that they didn't jinx the overtime with their they won eight or seven"
01:04:49,340;01:04:50,140;"straight and overtime."
01:04:50,140;01:04:51,460;"They put that up a couple times."
01:04:51,460;01:04:52,900;"So I thought they were going to jinx that too."
01:04:53,020;01:04:56,740;"They also said that they had one 16 consecutive games on leading in halftime, too."
01:04:56,740;01:04:59,380;"Didn't manage to drink that."
01:04:59,380;01:05:01,380;"There was a Josh Beckett side."
01:05:01,380;01:05:05,260;"And the Marlins because he's yes."
01:05:05,260;01:05:07,500;"Yeah, he's a Texas boy."
01:05:07,500;01:05:09,220;"We'll see you again, Josh."
01:05:09,220;01:05:10,140;"We sure will."
01:05:10,140;01:05:10,500;"Lots of you."
01:05:10,500;01:05:11,220;"Very rich man."
01:05:11,220;01:05:13,660;"Very, very rich man."
01:05:13,660;01:05:20,700;"There was a air horn during a fair catch."
01:05:21,820;01:05:28,300;"Oh yeah, there's like a of pages player is catching a punt and they air horned it right as soon as about to catch it"
01:05:28,300;01:05:34,220;"I thought you know got to respect that that's some good hustle. No, it's fucked up lasers in the eyes"
01:05:34,220;01:05:41,900;"That's not legit, you know true, but an air horn. I don't know there's missiles there. You gotta be able to concentrate. Yeah"
01:05:41,900;01:05:47,100;"This is just like making noise. I don't even just hold an air horn down"
01:05:47,500;01:05:50,940;"That's just a fucking annoying, but if you blew it right with it, try to make a catch."
01:05:50,940;01:05:52,780;"I'm kind of in on that."
01:05:52,780;01:05:54,300;"Yeah, get it."
01:05:54,300;01:05:55,740;"And my best of the best."
01:05:55,740;01:05:59,100;"I don't know if you noticed this, but I certainly did."
01:05:59,100;01:06:04,060;"And the commentary is actually very briefly touched on it because I first noticed it and I was like,"
01:06:04,060;01:06:06,620;"""I wonder when they're going to comment on it."" And they did the first game."
01:06:06,620;01:06:07,340;"And I was like, ""Whoa."""
01:06:07,340;01:06:11,820;"The Belichick Cut-Off Sleeves hoodie game."
01:06:11,820;01:06:14,460;"This is the first Cut-Off Slee hoodie game."
01:06:14,460;01:06:15,740;"It was so bad."
01:06:15,740;01:06:21,020;"I was the first was the first time they talked to me. I'm telling you go back and watch it. I've been waiting for this thing."
01:06:21,020;01:06:23,020;"It's so bad and he has like"
01:06:23,020;01:06:27,660;"They're like something strapped around his chest. Yeah, someone lay out as close for them"
01:06:27,660;01:06:32,940;"And I'm thinking like no way just go check out someone laying his clothes out for him. Nope"
01:06:32,940;01:06:40,940;"No, that's because he wasn't a super bolt buddy. No, he grabbed that out of the dirty hamper. You fucking know it's like oh fuck it's uh that'll do"
01:06:40,940;01:06:45,340;"These sleeves roll along. Let's cut these off real quick. Where's my box cutter?"
01:06:45,340;01:06:51,400;"You probably does his own laundry too, you know, yeah, but badly he probably just like froze everything once a week"
01:06:51,400;01:06:57,340;"And it's like completely over stuff the things so nothing actually gets clean. Let's sit for a day"
01:06:57,340;01:07:00,540;"So I guess I'll moldy. Yeah, yeah, yeah"
01:07:00,540;01:07:08,320;"I'm not I I wash my shit at least twice because I forget the first time"
01:07:08,320;01:07:11,220;"And probably the worst"
01:07:12,300;01:07:17,460;"You can see Tyla super hurt. He was a limping everywhere. Yeah, they said something about you had like a"
01:07:17,460;01:07:23,020;"Peck strain or something like that or something. I was his his angle been hurt all year"
01:07:23,020;01:07:26,100;"He's missed a couple games. Yeah, but his answering is also tweaked"
01:07:26,100;01:07:32,380;"But they said something about like something to do with his like ribs or his his pex or like something like that too"
01:07:32,380;01:07:38,580;"Yeah, cuz he cuz the commentators like you know, that's the sort of shit that would like hurt me getting out of bed"
01:07:38,580;01:07:41,520;"Yeah, and he's out there playing a football game with this"
01:07:41,520;01:07:50,160;"they said. Yeah. So. Yeah. All right. Is that your? That was my best and worst. Love it. All right."
01:07:50,160;01:07:57,600;"Let's see. My best sneaky best was Tyrone Pool, not only playing great defense, but returning puns"
01:07:57,600;01:08:03,360;"today. I do a damn good job of it. And Patrick Pass was back on kick returns. And I liked that."
01:08:03,360;01:08:11,280;"I like Patrick Pass. I remember liking him returning kicks. Yeah. But Tyrone Pool four returns,"
01:08:11,280;01:08:14,580;"42 yards is everything over 10 yards of part retirement."
01:08:14,580;01:08:15,800;"Not too shabby."
01:08:15,800;01:08:17,440;"So not bad."
01:08:17,440;01:08:19,520;"He's yeah, he's concerning on special teams."
01:08:19,520;01:08:20,800;"He's like a number two corner."
01:08:20,800;01:08:22,480;"He's a great signing."
01:08:22,480;01:08:24,040;"And yeah, he's this good."
01:08:24,040;01:08:27,360;"And his fucking coverage is outstanding."
01:08:27,360;01:08:29,840;"Um, what?"
01:08:29,840;01:08:33,520;"Uh, I mean, the worst is the first three quarters."
01:08:33,520;01:08:37,120;"I'm the goddamn commentator is talking about Adam"
01:08:37,120;01:08:38,760;"and Terry never missing so that he would miss."
01:08:39,960;01:08:43,440;"They did talk a lot about how great the field was though."
01:08:43,440;01:08:46,800;"And I guess there was like trays of grass"
01:08:46,800;01:08:49,080;"that they move in and out."
01:08:49,080;01:08:51,460;"But they clipped together seamlessly."
01:08:51,460;01:08:54,760;"But then Adam and Terry couldn't kick a field goal"
01:08:54,760;01:08:57,760;"and Rodney Harrison fell over nothing."
01:08:57,760;01:08:59,000;"- That's nothing grasses fault."
01:08:59,000;01:09:00,040;"- Bethel Johnson."
01:09:00,040;01:09:00,880;"- Oh come on, please."
01:09:00,880;01:09:01,880;"- Out of touchdown."
01:09:01,880;01:09:03,160;"- You know what they do what they do"
01:09:03,160;01:09:04,960;"where they just roll it outside and grow it"
01:09:04,960;01:09:06,000;"and then roll it inside."
01:09:06,000;01:09:08,160;"But it's the same idea."
01:09:08,160;01:09:09,420;"- Grab it outside and then pull it in."
01:09:09,420;01:09:10,540;"So I'm sure it was in good shape,"
01:09:10,540;01:09:12,560;"better than the shape and the Patriots day in that shit."
01:09:12,560;01:09:13,960;"- You know what they should have done though?"
01:09:13,960;01:09:16,280;"If they wanted to grow grass outside,"
01:09:16,280;01:09:18,240;"not put a fucking roof on it."
01:09:18,240;01:09:19,480;"- We had a car. - We're in Texas."
01:09:19,480;01:09:20,320;"What?"
01:09:20,320;01:09:22,000;"Playing the fucking rain."
01:09:22,000;01:09:24,040;"How often is it raining in Texas?"
01:09:24,040;01:09:25,920;"- No, it's so hot."
01:09:25,920;01:09:27,240;"- Who cares?"
01:09:27,240;01:09:29,360;"- Dude, it's fucking ridiculous."
01:09:29,360;01:09:30,360;"- The sprinklers on it."
01:09:30,360;01:09:32,920;"- We went to Dallas, it was so fucking hot there."
01:09:32,920;01:09:33,920;"- I didn't go there."
01:09:33,920;01:09:34,920;"- Not put fucking-- - You're gone,"
01:09:34,920;01:09:36,360;"'cause it was so hot."
01:09:36,360;01:09:37,680;"- I didn't go 'cause it was too fucking hot."
01:09:37,680;01:09:42,340;"outside like man I couldn't even stay outside for more than 30 minutes we had a"
01:09:42,340;01:09:46,400;"pool too dolphins don't say I need to be sitting in the shade in this pool it's"
01:09:46,400;01:09:51,640;"so fucking hot well you're also like the whitest skin person I know with that"
01:09:51,640;01:09:59,240;"forehead like you know down here Virginia real hot look at that hot doesn't get"
01:09:59,240;01:10:05,480;"Texas hot apparently a difference fucking human"
01:10:05,480;01:10:16,980;"This is no humans New England. It's a dry heat in Texas. That's fine. But that's why they don't have that's why they play in the dome because it's so hot Florida is the same thing."
01:10:16,980;01:10:25,880;"I guess. I mean the dolphins don't but the Marlins do. Sounds like some great millennial snowflake bullshit to me."
01:10:25,880;01:10:30,940;"Sitting in the sun shit sucks. Oh, no. How do they handle it Miami? I"
01:10:30,940;01:10:34,360;"Guess they just do a bunch of drugs"
01:10:34,360;01:10:39,520;"Even though they're the fucks going on true so much cocaine"
01:10:39,520;01:10:43,480;"They just sweat it all out immediately"
01:10:43,480;01:10:48,000;"Am I worst I will do this is they show a graphic of"
01:10:48,000;01:10:55,000;"The Texans in games following a win so the week after they win a game"
01:10:55,000;01:11:02,640;"game. The title of it was one and done because they had never won two games in a row as a"
01:11:02,640;01:11:10,040;"franchise yet. They were 0 and 7. They averaged 12 points per game and allowed an average"
01:11:10,040;01:11:19,760;"of 30 points a game. And they were outgained 259 to 355. And their turnover ratio was negative"
01:11:19,760;01:11:27,240;"11. Yeah, so they don't this year, but because they only win one more game, right? Not the next game, right?"
01:11:27,240;01:11:33,200;"Right. Or maybe it was. Well, it doesn't."
01:11:33,200;01:11:39,400;"They don't win two in a row. Yeah, because they don't win two in a row. Right. So let's see, when's the first time in 2004?"
01:11:39,400;01:11:43,360;"Yeah, three. Yeah, 2004, three and four."
01:11:43,360;01:11:46,680;"They go 79 and then it goes again under Dom"
01:11:46,680;01:11:50,160;"Yeah, they win"
01:11:50,160;01:11:54,720;"Two games are road and lose they don't win more than two games in a row"
01:11:54,720;01:11:57,800;"What what when does that happen?"
01:11:57,800;01:12:03,080;"They didn't then they go to in 14 under capers and he gets fired. Yeah, okay, so that's not good and then so"
01:12:03,080;01:12:04,960;"2006"
01:12:04,960;01:12:11,120;"Still don't win. Oh, they they win their last two games of the season to go six and ten and get a shitty draft spot"
01:12:12,160;01:12:20,220;"Seven they win their first two games and then lose and then when two games back to back in week 14 and 15"
01:12:20,220;01:12:22,680;"and then"
01:12:22,680;01:12:29,120;"They start 2008 with four losses. Oh, they win three games in a row"
01:12:29,120;01:12:33,640;"They start off four losses and then win three in a row. It's the first time they win more than two games in a row"
01:12:33,640;01:12:38,160;"Oh boy. It's two thousand breeder to nine fucking sixteen and oh"
01:12:39,160;01:12:41,160;"2008"
01:12:41,160;01:12:46,280;"They can go for no easier to go 16 and oh so that's the first time they win more than two games in a row"
01:12:46,280;01:12:49,640;"And they still finish 8-8. They have a three-game win streak and a four-game win streak"
01:12:49,640;01:12:52,440;"They follow a four game up with a three-game lose streak"
01:12:52,440;01:12:56,800;"It's not great and then follow that up with another four-game win streak"
01:12:56,800;01:13:00,120;"2009 they have their first winning season"
01:13:00,120;01:13:04,240;"By winning the last four games of the season"
01:13:05,240;01:13:06,600;"Oh my goodness."
01:13:06,600;01:13:12,720;"I mean, there's some big Texan games to come when Andre is like even more of a beast, you know?"
01:13:12,720;01:13:13,240;"Right."
01:13:13,240;01:13:14,440;"It's really good in the match."
01:13:14,440;01:13:15,440;"Shob years."
01:13:15,440;01:13:16,280;"Yep."
01:13:16,280;01:13:18,120;"Yeah, we'll see that coming up."
01:13:18,120;01:13:31,920;"But before that, we have maybe the regular season game of the season, like the premiere."
01:13:31,920;01:13:32,920;"Most memoranda."
01:13:32,920;01:13:33,920;"Remember any of these?"
01:13:33,920;01:13:38,160;"brand new games. So I'm looking forward to it. I was like, I was watching this. I was like,"
01:13:38,160;01:13:41,800;"I don't even remember who we play in the playoffs. Steve,"
01:13:41,800;01:13:47,680;"I don't know. I gave her like the AC Jamie. I for a life. You don't tell me. I want to figure it out."
01:13:47,680;01:13:52,880;"They'll figure it out. Yeah. But yeah, so next week, it's the nine and two neural"
01:13:52,880;01:13:58,440;"Patriots facing the nine and two we need an apples Colts for battle for I think technically"
01:13:58,440;01:14:03,200;"second place in the AFC. Yeah, but at this point, maybe. Yeah. Depending on how the Chiefs"
01:14:03,200;01:14:05,120;"I don't actually know at this point."
01:14:05,120;01:14:09,800;"But yeah, so it's going to Peyton Manning's house."
01:14:09,800;01:14:13,600;"We haven't been there since the David Patton game, I think."
01:14:13,600;01:14:14,600;"You know, one?"
01:14:14,600;01:14:15,600;"Yes, for sure."
01:14:15,600;01:14:18,000;"So I was being a couple of years back there because they were..."
01:14:18,000;01:14:21,400;"Because they're recently out of the division once the Texans joined, that's when the Colts"
01:14:21,400;01:14:22,400;"left."
01:14:22,400;01:14:23,400;"Correct."
01:14:23,400;01:14:24,400;"2002 was when their realignment happened."
01:14:24,400;01:14:27,640;"So they're no longer in the division."
01:14:27,640;01:14:35,840;"Although I will say one of my favorite jets statistics is that the Indianapolis Colts have"
01:14:35,840;01:14:39,200;"more AFC East championships than the New York Jets do."
01:14:39,200;01:14:42,800;"And they haven't been the AFC East since 2002."
01:14:42,800;01:14:45,200;"That's great."
01:14:45,200;01:14:51,400;"The Houston Oilers also have as many AFC East champion chips and they haven't been in since"
01:14:51,400;01:14:55,040;"like, yeah, who the hell knows how long."
01:14:55,040;01:14:56,840;"So that's a good time."
01:14:56,840;01:15:01,840;"So yeah, next week, the battle wagons meet."
01:15:01,840;01:15:05,120;"- It sounds like Greg said he would be on that one."
01:15:05,120;01:15:07,880;"- Yeah, yeah, he said he may even watch the game."
01:15:07,880;01:15:08,880;"So that's how you know it's--"
01:15:08,880;01:15:09,720;"- Yeah, that's true."
01:15:09,720;01:15:11,280;"- Yes, I have big expectations."
01:15:11,280;01:15:14,040;"- So get ready for a five-limb party"
01:15:14,040;01:15:16,560;"watchability score or something."
01:15:16,560;01:15:19,600;"For next week on the Patriots,"
01:15:19,600;01:15:21,600;"oh wait, before we go out, don't forget,"
01:15:21,600;01:15:25,040;"if you would like to drop us a line, Steve,"
01:15:25,040;01:15:26,800;"people want to get a hold of us."
01:15:26,800;01:15:28,000;"Yeah, I can't remember it."
01:15:28,000;01:15:30,200;"If you're if your mom of Brown, what do you do?"
01:15:30,200;01:15:32,380;"You just you just fucking call up Steven"
01:15:32,380;01:15:36,720;"yelling them. Or you can text the"
01:15:36,720;01:15:40,080;"Dinesley Hotline 603. 505."
01:15:40,080;01:15:42,240;"Troy Brown for three."
01:15:42,240;01:15:46,040;"8043. That's right. Troy Brown for three."
01:15:46,040;01:15:47,360;"You can do that."
01:15:47,360;01:15:49,760;"Remember the 505. I'm so bad."
01:15:49,760;01:15:51,160;"That's all right. Give us a text."
01:15:51,160;01:15:51,840;"It's SOS."
01:15:53,520;01:15:56,640;"So save our souls."
01:15:56,640;01:16:00,440;"Save our season."
01:16:00,440;01:16:01,520;"Troy Brown for three."
01:16:01,520;01:16:03,360;"Oh, not bad."
01:16:03,360;01:16:07,160;"Um, so yeah, six, oh three, five, oh, five, eight, oh, four, three."
01:16:07,160;01:16:09,360;"If you choose the text, we'll probably shut out."
01:16:09,360;01:16:14,240;"Um, and, uh, if you're exciting enough, we may even have you on the podcast."
01:16:14,240;01:16:14,600;"We'll see."
01:16:14,600;01:16:18,720;"So, uh, until next week, we will see you then."

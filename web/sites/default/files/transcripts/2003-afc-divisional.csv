00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:20,840;"I am not your mother."

00:36,040;00:40,320;"right. Yeah, I missed it. Back in the playoffs. It's been so long since we've"
00:40,320;00:46,080;"done a playoff episode, the whole whole season. And also Greg Brown from"
00:46,080;00:53,880;"vacation land USA live from South Carolina. Yeah, pork country. Some"
00:53,880;01:00,800;"summerton. Went down to my local pigly wiggly picked up some, you"
01:00,800;01:06,960;"know, pork butts. Some fried giblets, some pig skins. Yeah,"
01:06,960;01:12,400;"they legit had a five pound bag of pork skin."
01:14,800;01:16,800;"That's a lot of pork skin."
01:16,800;01:20,800;"I think you think is what is this five pounds of pork skin?"
01:20,800;01:24,160;"That's just one big big big big."
01:24,160;01:27,120;"The thing was probably the size of my torso."
01:27,120;01:29,600;"The bag itself. Oh my God."
01:29,600;01:32,800;"I think a pig had probably more than five pounds of skin."
01:32,800;01:34,520;"I mean, they're heavy."
01:34,520;01:36,000;"Yeah. I don't know."
01:36,000;01:37,800;"Depends how fat, right?"
01:37,800;01:38,800;"Stat check."
01:38,800;01:41,160;"I don't know."
01:41,160;01:43,640;"I don't know if we do that."
01:43,640;01:51,280;"I don't know what to type in speaking of pigskin. We're here to talk about some football."
01:51,280;01:57,240;"Oh, I like that. That's really good. Yeah. Yeah. Not warm weather football though. This"
01:57,240;02:05,040;"is about as cold as it gets. This is the divisional round playoffs. 2003 AFC divisional"
02:05,040;02:12,280;"round Patriots hosting the Tennessee Titans and co MVP Steve McNair country strong. Steve"
02:12,280;02:17,320;"McNair, Air McNair, Air McNair, Nap McNair. So what did you"
02:17,320;02:20,520;"think of it? Well, actually, let's let's talk about the weather."
02:20,520;02:25,120;"That's the the all right. I sort of forgotten about this game"
02:25,120;02:29,200;"because the next game really overshadows it. And you said to me"
02:29,200;02:33,120;"as the coldest game in pages history. It's debatable. Yeah."
02:33,120;02:38,920;"Yeah, it's one of like, it's one of the coldest games ever."
02:38,920;02:42,240;"There's like a few games that are all within like a degree or"
02:42,240;02:46,240;"too. So I guess it depends on what your calibration on your thermometer is."
02:46,240;02:51,440;"Right. Which if you're going by the guy in the stands, who I think is probably one of the best"
02:51,440;02:57,600;"props I've seen in a football game, you had one of those, like, you know, the white thermometer,"
02:57,600;03:01,760;"like the circular ones with the red arrow, but the arrow had broken off. I'm just sitting at the"
03:01,760;03:07,280;"bottom of it. Which is perfect. It looks like it's a negative 60, but it's just like it fell off."
03:07,280;03:09,280;"It's so cold yeah, but uh"
03:09,280;03:13,720;"Even that cold though. No one seemed to be like hating life up there. I"
03:13,720;03:16,080;"Don't know"
03:16,080;03:20,800;"But like I don't know it seemed to be it didn't seem to affect the game as much because I mean there there were some drop passes"
03:20,800;03:22,400;"I think due to"
03:22,400;03:27,460;"Cold fingers, but I think the people it affected most were our commentators"
03:27,460;03:30,880;"Well, let's talk about the let's before we jump"
03:30,880;03:35,600;"And he couldn't"
03:35,600;03:43,600;"to talk about. Let's give him the historical context here. This game at kickoff is two degrees"
03:43,600;03:49,920;"Fahrenheit Fahrenheit. Not tell see is two degrees Fahrenheit Fahrenheit Fahrenheit. The negative"
03:49,920;03:57,680;"eleven with wind chill. Yeah. So this is like I've been to a couple super cold games. Yeah."
03:57,680;04:04,240;"Like I went to Patriots Broncos in 2013 that one where we came back on Manny. Oh yeah."
04:04,240;04:07,200;"I was so fucking cold during that game."
04:07,200;04:08,160;"So I looked it up and I was like,"
04:08,160;04:10,200;"it's gotta be like pretty comparable."
04:10,200;04:12,360;"It was 22 in that game."
04:12,360;04:13,640;"(laughing)"
04:13,640;04:15,760;"I'm like, I feel like a bitch."
04:15,760;04:16,920;"- Oh my God."
04:16,920;04:18,520;"- Yeah."
04:18,520;04:21,920;"- So then I went to 2017 New Year's Eve,"
04:21,920;04:23,800;"past Jets."
04:23,800;04:26,680;"It was a pretty forgettable game,"
04:26,680;04:28,520;"but it was 13 degrees Fahrenheit."
04:28,520;04:30,600;"And I remember I went into that game thinking,"
04:30,600;04:33,720;"there's no way I'm gonna end up like I did at that Broncos game."
04:33,720;04:38,960;"And I was like, I was like, I was just like a ball of jacket and sweater."
04:38,960;04:41,720;"I had like 15 layers on."
04:41,720;04:44,280;"I was like, ain't no way I'm getting called and it worked."
04:44,280;04:45,280;"All right."
04:45,280;04:46,280;"All right."
04:46,280;04:48,360;"But still, if you're a football player, you can't do that."
04:48,360;04:52,520;"So you playing in two degrees is like is unbearable."
04:52,520;04:53,520;"Yeah."
04:53,520;04:55,640;"And you could kind of see it too."
04:55,640;05:00,360;"Like there weren't a lot of like the in the running game."
05:00,360;05:02,200;"There weren't a lot of like big tackles."
05:02,200;05:05,700;"It was just kind of like grab the guy and kind of push him to the ground. There was no like"
05:05,700;05:11,320;"Heavy hitting in this I didn't think except for Rodney Harrison because he's he's an absolute psychopath"
05:11,320;05:17,760;"But other than that it the game felt like it was going a little bit more slow motion"
05:17,760;05:20,760;"Just because that the"
05:20,760;05:23,480;"style of the Titans and the Patriots"
05:23,480;05:29,200;"Was a tight game. It was like real close contested, you know, yeah run the ball a lot"
05:29,760;05:33,960;"Did you ever play football in the cold anything really run? Yeah"
05:33,960;05:39,220;"It sucked it sucks. Yeah, I was gonna say I played soccer in the cold and it blows"
05:39,220;05:42,080;"I can't even imagine what it feels like to play football"
05:42,080;05:47,560;"It's awful because your hands go first and so if you're a skills player you fucked"
05:47,560;05:52,640;"Like you're gonna drop everything because you just you can't move your fingers anymore and then"
05:52,640;05:56,400;"any like contact with open skin"
05:57,360;06:05,360;"It has that like stabbing feeling, you know, like all the tiny little needles and stuff,"
06:05,360;06:10,360;"just like shoot straight out from wherever you got hit and it's just, it's awful."
06:10,360;06:12,360;"Sounds just like you're like a little bitch though."
06:12,360;06:15,360;"I mean, yeah, that's why that's why I switched over to soccer."
06:15,360;06:16,360;"Yeah."
06:16,360;06:20,360;"And found other ways to injure myself instead."
06:20,360;06:21,360;"Fuck this."
06:21,360;06:22,360;"Yeah."
06:22,360;06:25,360;"So I don't have as many concussions, but my knees are garbage."
06:25,360;06:32,100;"I don't know. I was just saying I was expecting it to be like the ice bowl. We all see that highlight any other it didn't seem like that cold"
06:32,100;06:35,200;"Well, they put up a"
06:35,200;06:38,500;"graphic cold coldest games NFL history"
06:38,500;06:41,200;"the ice ball"
06:41,200;06:48,060;"Was negative 13 and I'm assuming I'm assuming these numbers are are not with wind chill"
06:48,800;06:57,040;"But negative 13 is fucking cold and then there's an 81 AFC Championship game was negative nine San Diego at Cincinnati"
06:57,040;07:02,400;"I don't know. I don't know anything about this game on God Olim and say San Diego did not win that"
07:02,400;07:11,960;"From Southern California coming to play negative nine and then the 93 AFC divisional playoff game Raiders at Buffalo was zero degrees"
07:11,960;07:16,600;"So those are I think the three colder games in this what's the temperature?"
07:16,880;07:18,880;"There isn't one nope"
07:18,880;07:25,160;"Every time every time we've told the story about me failing out of Penn State"
07:25,160;07:30,400;"So every time I get in the car and my car thermometers says it's zero degrees"
07:30,400;07:37,120;"I always text my wife and say what does the temperature today and my time at Penn State have in common no degrees"
07:37,120;07:43,840;"She didn't even think of funny the first time I'm glad people was last"
07:43,840;07:45,760;"- That's pretty good."
07:45,760;07:47,320;"- That's pretty good."
07:47,320;07:48,400;"- Oh yeah, I've been doing that for a few days."
07:48,400;07:49,720;"- I have no degrees."
07:49,720;07:51,360;"- Yeah, no degrees."
07:51,360;07:52,760;"It really is the wind chill though,"
07:52,760;07:54,920;"not to get all nerdy on ya,"
07:54,920;07:57,600;"but the wind chill is,"
07:57,600;07:58,440;"'cause that was the-"
07:58,440;08:00,200;"- That was the thing?"
08:00,200;08:01,200;"- It didn't look that cold,"
08:01,200;08:02,400;"'cause it wasn't that windy, I don't know."
08:02,400;08:04,520;"I think they were things that was gonna be windier."
08:04,520;08:05,360;"- I think it was,"
08:05,360;08:07,280;"they said it was windier the earlier in the day"
08:07,280;08:09,560;"or the day before, like when they were practicing."
08:09,560;08:11,200;"I think it was the day before when they were practicing,"
08:11,200;08:12,760;"'cause they were talking about Brady throwing in the wind"
08:12,760;08:16,460;"and not being affected, but that would have made it much,"
08:16,460;08:19,000;"much worse, yeah, because the wind takes the cold"
08:19,000;08:21,680;"and puts it places you can't protect."
08:21,680;08:23,780;"You know, like it gets up underneath your jacket"
08:23,780;08:27,380;"and up in your bits and..."
08:27,380;08:30,120;"- And it also like gives you like the,"
08:30,120;08:33,680;"when like the wind stops, you get that like,"
08:33,680;08:35,160;"""Ooh, this is what it could be,"""
08:35,160;08:37,080;"which is slightly more bearable."
08:37,080;08:38,360;"And then it kicks up again and you're like,"
08:38,360;08:39,600;"""Motherfucker!"""
08:39,600;08:42,520;"- I'm just getting used to that."
08:42,520;08:44,280;"Yeah, it's so true."
08:44,280;08:47,360;"Or you just like step around a building or something and it cuts off."
08:47,360;08:48,480;"Yeah."
08:48,480;08:49,960;"Yeah, I can just have it."
08:49,960;08:55,640;"But I did like you get the shots because it's so cool."
08:55,640;08:59,600;"The shots of literally everybody standing around those massive like jet engine"
08:59,600;09:02,600;"heaters, like trying to be the guy closest to it."
09:02,600;09:04,160;"Things are great."
09:04,160;09:10,800;"Although not a lot of sweating like steam off the headshots as I would have wanted."
09:11,000;09:13,600;"Yeah, but the breadth was actually incredible in this game."
09:13,600;09:14,440;"Like their breadth."
09:14,440;09:15,260;"Oh, yeah."
09:15,260;09:17,200;"One thing where they're like, the two lines are lined up."
09:17,200;09:18,040;"Yeah."
09:18,040;09:19,480;"You could see it from like, yeah,"
09:19,480;09:21,640;"like from the regular camera view,"
09:21,640;09:22,800;"like the studio camera view."
09:22,800;09:23,640;"It's cool."
09:23,640;09:26,200;"Yeah, you just need Steve Sable in the background."
09:26,200;09:27,040;"Yes."
09:27,040;09:28,320;"If it needs something,"
09:28,320;09:31,080;"like some orchestral music."
09:31,080;09:32,480;"Yeah."
09:32,480;09:33,320;"Yeah."
09:33,320;09:34,560;"So true."
09:34,560;09:36,400;"Battle of the trenches."
09:38,440;09:44,140;"But yeah, I think the other thing that was noticeable because of the weather was the kicking in this game."
09:44,140;09:47,340;"It looked like they were kicking lead balloons out there."
09:47,340;09:47,840;"Yeah."
09:47,840;09:51,040;"Like every kickoff, I think landed probably around the 20."
09:51,040;09:55,440;"Like it came out looking good and then just died."
09:55,440;09:57,240;"Like that ball just just died."
09:57,240;09:59,940;"And also the field goal attempts."
09:59,940;10:07,040;"I think on the day the both field goal kickers were one for two, one for three."
10:07,040;10:07,540;"Three."
10:07,940;10:09,320;"And block though."
10:09,320;10:09,580;"Right."
10:09,580;10:10,800;"It was one blocked."
10:10,800;10:13,700;"So not not a great Gary Anderson, right?"
10:13,700;10:14,700;"Yeah."
10:14,700;10:15,100;"Mr."
10:15,100;10:18,700;"Yeah, single bar."
10:18,700;10:20,020;"Yeah."
10:20,020;10:23,820;"And so Gary Anderson who kicked a game winning field goal"
10:23,820;10:26,540;"the week before to get to get the Titans here."
10:26,540;10:29,740;"I was going to ask, yeah, do we want to talk about how Tennessee"
10:29,740;10:33,220;"got here because they had a--"
10:33,220;10:36,540;"like this wasn't their first playoff game."
10:36,540;10:37,100;"Did you have--"
10:37,100;10:44,460;"They won their wild I have I have a bunch of notes on the other games from this week. Okay. Yeah"
10:44,460;10:50,900;"I've been not a wild card games. Well, it was the old those other games are fucking insanity, but they are but let's touch on the"
10:50,900;10:52,220;"Titans"
10:52,220;10:56,860;"Yeah, yeah to get here. Yeah, so they beat the Ravens last week in"
10:56,860;11:03,420;"Baltimore, I think they were actually had a better record than the Ravens going in but the Colts had won the division"
11:03,420;11:04,780;"And so they had to travel."
11:04,780;11:05,220;"Yeah."
11:05,220;11:07,060;"They had to travel to Baltimore."
11:07,060;11:07,660;"Cool MVP."
11:07,660;11:12,780;"And that was the Ray Lewis, Jamal Lewis, that squad."
11:12,780;11:15,580;"So they're like built on defense and running."
11:15,580;11:18,700;"Can you name the quarterback for the Ravens in that game?"
11:18,700;11:22,420;"Dude, I read it like a couple weeks ago."
11:22,420;11:23,060;"It's--"
11:23,060;11:23,900;"Nope."
11:23,900;11:24,400;"No."
11:24,400;11:26,940;"Or someone like Jackson or--"
11:26,940;11:28,380;"Anthony Wright."
11:28,380;11:30,820;"Anthony Wright."
11:30,820;11:32,260;"I couldn't even tell you what number was."
11:32,260;11:33,260;"I can't picture him at all."
11:33,260;11:34,160;"Yeah."
11:34,160;11:37,100;"Uh, you look like you had a good game."
11:37,100;11:39,300;"24 37 to 14 and touch."
11:39,300;11:39,620;"Yeah."
11:39,620;11:40,420;"Two interceptions."
11:40,420;11:41,660;"Not great."
11:41,660;11:42,180;"Never mind."
11:42,180;11:45,980;"But it looked like a AFC North like battle."
11:45,980;11:46,500;"Oh, yeah."
11:46,500;11:49,300;"Titans one 20 to 17."
11:49,300;11:51,060;"This looks like a bit of a slug fest."
11:51,060;11:53,780;"On an Anderson field goal."
11:53,780;11:59,300;"And I think that the Ravens had like a defensive touchdown from Ed Reed."
11:59,300;12:00,580;"You know, okay."
12:01,300;12:05,100;"It was one of those games actually will dumps."
12:05,100;12:11,020;"One important play that happened was Ed Reed did get a pick in that game and"
12:11,020;12:14,020;"Eddie George separated his shoulder trying to tackle."
12:14,020;12:15,340;"Is that how it happened?"
12:15,340;12:18,140;"He's they talked about separated shoulder and Eddie."
12:18,140;12:22,460;"Yeah, he's playing in this cold with a, they said his shoulder was in a sling"
12:22,460;12:26,780;"and he was playing separate last week in the cold tackling Ed Reed."
12:26,780;12:30,100;"But like and running with."
12:30,100;12:31,860;"They didn't like it to mention that."
12:31,860;12:38,020;"I believe the commoner said running with violence is how they talked about Eddie George running."
12:38,020;12:43,860;"Which yeah, he had like a ridiculous stiff arm on Ray Lewis too."
12:43,860;12:46,340;"When those ones where he kind of catches him off balance and like,"
12:46,340;12:47,940;"I would pick him up and throw him."
12:47,940;12:49,300;"It was bad ass."
12:49,300;12:50,180;"Yeah, those are the best."
12:50,180;12:51,540;"Yeah."
12:51,540;12:54,980;"That's like, what's the name for the Titans now?"
12:54,980;12:56,100;"Does that all the time?"
12:56,100;13:03,860;"there are kenri for sure. Yeah. Yeah. It's grown ass man. But yeah, Eddie George, just to touch on"
13:03,860;13:10,980;"him, they showed a couple of stats which I thought were kind of indicative of who he was as a running"
13:10,980;13:16,420;"back. He was one of two players in the NFL to rush for 10,000 yards without missing a start."
13:16,420;13:24,260;"The only other guy was Jim Brown. So that's pretty good company. He ranked first in like"
13:24,260;13:29,860;"since running back, among running back since 1996, he was first and starts, first and rushes,"
13:29,860;13:39,380;"second and yards, third and touchdowns. So he had 2700 rushes for just over 10,000"
13:39,380;13:45,300;"yards, which I think works out to be less than four yards a carry. So he is just an absolute"
13:45,300;13:50,980;"grinder. Ten thousand yards on 3.6 yards per carry. And in this game, in the first half,"
13:50,980;13:58,360;"saffi is averaging 2.3. He was he just grinds that shit out over and over again. Yeah."
13:58,360;14:03,080;"Like it's just kind of moving over the yard and then you lose two yards. He's just getting"
14:03,080;14:07,380;"three yards every time. Yeah. And that's what they were saying. Like, I think it's Phil"
14:07,380;14:12,620;"Sims in this game was talking about how like he's the perfect playoff running back because"
14:12,620;14:15,300;"that's what he'll do is he'll get you three yards every time. He's not going to get you"
14:15,300;14:18,740;"more. He's not going to break anything big, but he's never going to put you behind the"
14:18,740;14:24,540;"chains and like, you don't have to go catching up because he's lost a bunch of yards. So,"
14:24,540;14:33,680;"and I think in that game against the Ravens. Looks like as a team Tennessee ran for 165"
14:33,680;14:37,840;"yards on the ground. So they just ran it down. Oh, yeah, Eddie George and the other guy, Chris"
14:37,840;14:43,940;"Brown, Chris Brown, Shadow Brad on favorite player. Yeah, shut up, Mom. And also the abusive"
14:43,940;14:47,880;"singer. Oh, Chris Brown."
14:47,880;14:51,080;"Batter to batter this way into the end zone in the previous game for a"
14:51,080;14:52,720;"check. Also, look at that."
14:52,720;14:59,280;"Um, any of those guys had a hundred yards in the last game, they still ran"
14:59,280;15:04,040;"for like almost 200. So a typical."
15:04,040;15:06,920;"And you got air McNair, who is also a founder."
15:06,920;15:08,920;"Yeah, country strong."
15:10,760;15:12,480;"is the end easy to tackle."
15:12,480;15:13,160;"That's for sure."
15:13,160;15:17,280;"They kept showing highlights for that double overtime Rams game, though."
15:17,280;15:17,720;"Yeah."
15:17,720;15:18,160;"During this."
15:18,160;15:20,240;"Oh, I got notes on that, dude."
15:20,240;15:21,960;"It's fucking insanity."
15:21,960;15:23,000;"Yeah."
15:23,000;15:23,160;"Yeah."
15:23,160;15:23,600;"That's so do."
15:23,600;15:25,480;"I'm just saying because I always saw."
15:25,480;15:25,840;"I'm out."
15:25,840;15:27,080;"You want to talk about it now?"
15:27,080;15:30,360;"No, let's hold off on that until we can touch on this game first."
15:30,360;15:32,400;"OK, let's get through this."
15:32,400;15:34,520;"And then then we'll talk about the rest of the league."
15:34,520;15:36,440;"Because yeah, I mean, I'm excited."
15:36,440;15:38,440;"It's a little out of control."
15:40,080;15:45,080;"Yeah, so first half was kind of where a Lombardi score."
15:45,080;15:49,640;"Oh, Greg has his new rating system, but I think it sounds like he actually"
15:49,640;15:52,080;"watches. Yeah, we determined it was the same thing."
15:52,080;15:54,160;"Because there are six different tiers."
15:54,160;15:55,480;"They were going to give the name."
15:55,480;15:58,120;"Well, where are they, Greg?"
15:58,120;16:00,960;"It was a name was the top."
16:00,960;16:05,400;"Yeah, title game, thumbnail game, right."
16:06,480;16:12,160;"hidden gems business as usual and slog best and then losses and then we're like we should put a"
16:12,160;16:19,680;"sex then there which is losses so where would you put this one Greg I don't know I think this you"
16:19,680;16:25,520;"isn't as usual I don't know if like anything really jumped out at me I don't know I don't think"
16:25,520;16:31,200;"it was a hidden gem it's certainly not a thumbnail game I mean the cold ads a cool factor and it"
16:31,200;16:35,940;"this game, but I would put this as kind of like in the hidden gem range."
16:35,940;16:37,040;"I'll put this as a three."
16:37,040;16:38,280;"It was an exciting game."
16:38,280;16:38,840;"Yeah."
16:38,840;16:40,920;"I, because it was closed all the way through."
16:40,920;16:42,920;"You're playing the co MVP."
16:42,920;16:43,400;"Yeah."
16:43,400;16:44,120;"This is saying."
16:44,120;16:45,040;"And yeah."
16:45,040;16:49,000;"And I think the Titans came to play and they were both just like this was also"
16:49,000;16:49,840;"a bit of a slug fest."
16:49,840;16:53,600;"They were both given each other right left hooks all the way through."
16:53,600;16:54,160;"I shot."
16:54,160;16:55,120;"So it's one of those fucking just."
16:55,120;16:55,880;"Yeah."
16:55,880;16:56,760;"I'm shocking this week."
16:56,760;16:59,680;"And now as I was with Titans, I was had a soft spot for them."
16:59,680;17:00,560;"You did."
17:00,560;17:02,560;"You fucking traitor."
17:02,560;17:04,560;"You're like a drab."
17:04,560;17:06,560;"So easy."
17:06,560;17:07,560;"It's nice."
17:07,560;17:08,560;"Got flames."
17:08,560;17:09,560;"It's like that."
17:09,560;17:12,560;"And I remember dad calling Eddie George to the man with two first names."
17:12,560;17:14,560;"I thought it was hilarious."
17:14,560;17:15,560;"Yeah."
17:15,560;17:16,560;"And speaking of which Derek Henry."
17:16,560;17:17,560;"What the fuck?"
17:17,560;17:18,560;"Jeff George."
17:18,560;17:19,560;"Yeah."
17:19,560;17:20,560;"Oh dear."
17:20,560;17:25,560;"So I know they're not the same person."
17:25,560;17:28,560;"We know they're not the same person."
17:28,560;17:30,200;"Eric and Randy George."
17:30,200;17:31,200;"We don't."
17:31,200;17:34,040;"- I thought this as I saw this game"
17:34,040;17:36,480;"and they showed some closeups of Rodney Harrison as well."
17:36,480;17:39,000;"And I said, both those guys, they look the same now."
17:39,000;17:39,840;"- Ooh."
17:39,840;17:41,400;"- As I come in there like in 2003,"
17:41,400;17:43,080;"Rodney Harrison looks the exact same now as he did."
17:43,080;17:44,960;"- Has not aged at all."
17:44,960;17:46,440;"- And Eddie George, same way."
17:46,440;17:49,280;"- Didn't we talk about Eddie George being good looking?"
17:49,280;17:50,120;"- Yes, we did."
17:50,120;17:50,960;"- I think so."
17:50,960;17:52,320;"- Yeah, we did, yeah."
17:52,320;17:54,560;"- Yeah, I'm a big, I'm a big Eddie George"
17:54,560;17:56,400;"is a good looking guy."
17:56,400;17:57,240;"- Yeah, I can't."
17:57,240;17:59,200;"And Andy was not and Kelly."
17:59,200;18:02,440;"I was I wasn't at first because Andy's racist."
18:02,440;18:06,360;"I wasn't at first because his his little like headshot went like"
18:06,360;18:07,000;"during the game."
18:07,000;18:08,400;"I mean, yes, maybe Andy."
18:08,400;18:10,440;"It made it look like an alien."
18:10,440;18:10,800;"Why?"
18:10,800;18:15,600;"Because he doesn't fit into your like, uh, your normal cisgender"
18:15,600;18:17,080;"white male face."
18:17,080;18:20,120;"The top of his head was twice the size of the bottom of his head."
18:20,120;18:23,440;"It was not a good angle for his picture."
18:23,440;18:24,920;"Yeah, really."
18:24,920;18:26,040;"He's a beautiful man."
18:26,040;18:28,840;"Then you have me Google them and yeah, it looks great in a suit."
18:28,840;18:30,840;"So is Harrison."
18:30,840;18:32,760;"I think Harrison's pleasing to look at."
18:32,760;18:33,640;"He's very handsome."
18:33,640;18:33,840;"Yeah."
18:33,840;18:34,720;"Yeah."
18:34,720;18:35,440;"He like dresses."
18:35,440;18:36,200;"Nice to."
18:36,200;18:38,400;"He's very, he's one of Aaron's favorites, actually."
18:38,400;18:39,480;"He's one of my favorites."
18:39,480;18:40,040;"Yeah."
18:40,040;18:41,040;"Yeah."
18:41,040;18:45,120;"I think he, I think both of them are better than Garoppolo."
18:45,120;18:46,480;"Garoppolo doesn't do it for me."
18:46,480;18:47,720;"I agree."
18:47,720;18:52,280;"I think he seems to like, I don't know, this date."
18:52,280;18:53,920;"Cleafed."
18:54,960;19:01,920;"Yeah, or like, it almost feels like what a good person, a good looking person should look like,"
19:01,920;19:06,320;"rather than like, okay, that guy actually has like a charisma in his face. It's like, it's like a"
19:06,320;19:09,200;"stock photo. Yeah, what a good looking person, you know,"
19:09,200;19:12,560;"you're getting a good looking person. That sounds racist, Greg."
19:12,560;19:17,120;"Just because he's Italian."
19:18,800;19:21,520;"that one I almost just said is he Italian?"
19:21,520;19:25,680;"No, I was like that's a stupid is Jimmy Garoppolo Italian?"
19:25,680;19:33,280;"No, Holmes. Oh, yeah. All right."
19:33,280;19:36,800;"I'll admit. No idea."
19:36,800;19:42,000;"Oh, geez. Very naughty. Very naughty."
19:42,000;19:48,160;"Yeah, so I think so we laid on a three for this like a three long"
19:48,160;19:53,340;"I give it a four even I'm giving it a business as usual"
19:53,340;19:56,500;"Hidden gem"
19:56,500;19:58,500;"All right, okay. Yeah"
19:58,500;20:07,480;"All right, and there wasn't a whole lot of scoring to talk about which I think is probably why it's not a more memorable game"
20:07,480;20:13,340;"Because the one play that I actually remembered from this is Tom Brady's touchdown pass to"
20:13,340;20:16,740;"Breakout star Beth El Johnson"
20:17,420;20:20,140;"Our guy yeah the playmaker"
20:20,140;20:23,620;"Fucking killing it. So yeah, yeah"
20:23,620;20:31,940;"So we got deep behind between the the safeties and Brady hit him for 40 when you're touched down on the page's first drive of"
20:31,940;20:38,460;"The game yeah the game and it was sure I missed this play you did"
20:38,460;20:43,540;"Uh-huh. I remember turning on the game and it was very 7-0 and I was like what the shit"
20:44,580;20:47,800;"And then there was like no scoring after that and I was like damn it"
20:47,800;20:54,620;"Yeah, but this was also right off the back of"
20:54,620;21:01,740;"My MVP's probably play of the game Kevin Falk on third down converting a tough third down"
21:01,740;21:03,740;"Which you would be d33"
21:03,740;21:06,900;"WD 33 that's right. We need to make t-shirts of that"
21:06,900;21:08,900;"The grease monkey"
21:10,580;21:13,160;"- These three monkeys. - Oh boy."
21:13,160;21:15,080;"- Yeah. - Auto shop Greg?"
21:15,080;21:16,740;"- The human lubricant."
21:16,740;21:19,160;"- Yeah. (laughs)"
21:19,160;21:24,160;"- I'm telling you Andy, that was genius"
21:24,160;21:25,160;"that you thought that out."
21:25,160;21:26,900;"- Yeah, I think it's a great idea."
21:26,900;21:30,100;"- All right, so we'll make some t-shirts."
21:30,100;21:32,500;"We'll put them in the pot shop."
21:32,500;21:33,340;"- Those t-shirts you got out."
21:33,340;21:34,700;"- That sounds like another thing we say"
21:34,700;21:36,660;"we're gonna do that we don't do."
21:36,660;21:37,900;"- Yeah, well this is now the third time"
21:37,900;21:39,740;"I think I've said it, so I'm actually gonna do this time."
21:39,740;21:40,580;"wrote it down this time."
21:40,580;21:41,400;"- Thank you."
21:41,400;21:42,240;"- Yeah."
21:42,240;21:43,080;"- What do you say we're gonna do?"
21:43,080;21:44,260;"Andy does it all anyways, that's the real."
21:44,260;21:45,100;"- Yeah, this is true."
21:45,100;21:47,580;"- This is like the only thing, this podcast on the website,"
21:47,580;21:48,980;"literally the only things I follow through with"
21:48,980;21:49,980;"in my entire life."
21:49,980;21:50,820;"(laughs)"
21:50,820;21:52,300;"- That is very true too."
21:52,300;21:53,940;"That's why when we started this thing,"
21:53,940;21:55,700;"I was like, okay, I'll agree to do it"
21:55,700;21:56,540;"'cause it's not that last."
21:56,540;21:58,140;"- Six episodes, talk, yeah."
21:58,140;22:00,100;"(laughs)"
22:00,100;22:03,340;"- That's like Andy'll give up soon enough."
22:03,340;22:04,900;"- You can probably blame COVID for that"
22:04,900;22:06,460;"'cause, yeah, what are you gonna do?"
22:06,460;22:08,380;"- That's true. - That's true."
22:08,380;22:13,380;"So yeah, so back to the game scoring."
22:13,380;22:17,540;"We got the Bethel-Johnson touchdown and then Tennessee,"
22:17,540;22:20,060;"I thought kind of drove the ball up and down the field,"
22:20,060;22:21,860;"but just couldn't score at the end."
22:21,860;22:25,740;"I was surprised at how well they moved the ball."
22:25,740;22:26,580;"- Yeah."
22:26,580;22:27,700;"- But I probably shouldn't have been because"
22:27,700;22:30,060;"like at the beginning of the game,"
22:30,060;22:32,140;"the commentators were talking about Jeff Fisher,"
22:32,140;22:35,300;"about his offensive game plan and his responses."
22:35,300;22:36,780;"We've nailed it, we've got it."
22:37,740;22:39,940;"Yeah, it was like, it's hilarious."
22:39,940;22:40,540;"We got this."
22:40,540;22:42,060;"We're going to put up our shit ton of points."
22:42,060;22:45,300;"And they scored 14 just for the record."
22:45,300;22:49,740;"Oh, we have the fifth ranked offense in the NFL."
22:49,740;22:50,080;"Yeah."
22:50,080;22:51,580;"And so there were--"
22:51,580;22:52,580;"Nair was the only thing."
22:52,580;22:54,260;"But it was all Steve McNair."
22:54,260;22:56,500;"I mean, we've actually talked about these tight"
22:56,500;22:58,780;"into the beginning of this season, which I'd forgotten"
22:58,780;23:02,580;"that this is the second time they've seen each other."
23:02,580;23:05,460;"But even back then, they were talking about this entire offense"
23:05,460;23:12,720;"just runs through Steve McNair. And he's actually had to grow as a passer, because usually he"
23:12,720;23:17,060;"would kind of, if you got in trouble, he'd tuck it and run. And he'd like run for three"
23:17,060;23:23,540;"yards. But now he decides to chuck it up into coverage. And sometimes the guy comes down"
23:23,540;23:29,880;"with it for 25 yards instead of the three yards that he normally gets. But having said"
23:29,880;23:34,740;"that, Steve McNair did lead the league in quarterback rating with 100.4, which is pretty"
23:34,740;23:36,980;"good for 2003 anyway."
23:36,980;23:40,980;"Can we talk about him being co and V two with Peyton because this is like"
23:40,980;23:42,660;"the only time has ever happened, right?"
23:42,660;23:43,940;"I was going to ask that."
23:43,940;23:44,140;"Yeah."
23:44,140;23:46,060;"It is whatever that I can think of."
23:46,060;23:48,420;"Um, yeah, I don't know about him."
23:48,420;23:50,860;"I don't pay attention to other sports because fuck them."
23:50,860;23:52,980;"Um, no, that's not true."
23:52,980;23:55,700;"I won co MVP of my high school soccer team."
23:55,700;23:57,300;"That's right."
23:57,300;23:58,260;"And I haven't let you forget it."
23:58,260;23:59,700;"Yeah."
24:02,140;24:06,540;"And he's MVP, so he thinks he's some fucking big like."
24:06,540;24:07,500;"I never had to share."
24:07,500;24:10,300;"That's all I'm saying."
24:10,300;24:12,780;"Steve, because that's the only one skating mayor one too."
24:12,780;24:14,740;"Because Peyton was another one."
24:14,740;24:15,820;"Great question."
24:15,820;24:17,140;"Looking up now."
24:17,140;24:19,460;"So I don't think this is--"
24:19,460;24:22,100;"so I'm on Wikipedia now."
24:22,100;24:25,020;"The AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award,"
24:25,020;24:27,900;"I'm assuming is what we're looking for here."
24:27,900;24:31,860;"So this is 2003 Peyton Manning, Steve McNair."
24:31,860;24:35,660;"It has not been shared since."
24:35,660;24:38,780;"I don't think it's ever been shared in any of us where I can think."
24:38,780;24:42,300;"So they just, they just, it must be a voting system and they tied."
24:42,300;24:42,860;"Yeah."
24:42,860;24:43,180;"Right."
24:43,180;24:43,620;"Yeah."
24:43,620;24:48,420;"So I love how, how confident Steve is when I'm literally on this page and I said,"
24:48,420;24:49,820;"it hasn't happened since then."
24:49,820;24:54,820;"Uh, and I, I word of that way because it has happened before in the NFL."
24:54,820;24:56,420;"In 1997,"
24:58,420;25:00,340;"I need to let's guess. Let's guess."
25:00,340;25:01,140;"Let's go."
25:01,140;25:03,940;"NFL MVP or is this like NFL MVP?"
25:03,940;25:05,460;"Oh, NFL MVP."
25:05,460;25:07,460;"Ninety seven."
25:07,460;25:12,100;"No, you should be able to get one of these."
25:12,100;25:13,780;"Steve Young and Brett Favre."
25:13,780;25:15,540;"Brett Favre was one of them, correct."
25:15,540;25:16,580;"Okay."
25:16,580;25:17,700;"L.A.?"
25:17,700;25:20,260;"No, that's a good guess."
25:20,260;25:20,820;"Not a quarterback."
25:20,820;25:23,620;"Oh, what position?"
25:23,620;25:25,620;"Just running back."
25:25,620;25:27,060;"I mean, what other position you're going to get?"
25:27,620;25:30,420;"I don't think there's ever let's see the last time."
25:30,420;25:32,180;"- 97."
25:32,180;25:33,180;"- Running back."
25:33,180;25:34,020;"- John Ogleander."
25:34,020;25:35,100;"- Terrell Davis."
25:35,100;25:36,180;"- Oh."
25:36,180;25:37,020;"- TD."
25:37,020;25:38,340;"- No, not TD."
25:38,340;25:39,180;"- Shorter."
25:39,180;25:40,340;"- Shorter as in height."
25:40,340;25:41,180;"- Are you doing the standards?"
25:41,180;25:42,020;"- Yup, shorter."
25:42,020;25:42,860;"There you go."
25:42,860;25:43,780;"- Barry Sanders."
25:43,780;25:44,620;"- Barry Sanders."
25:44,620;25:45,460;"- Barry Sanders."
25:45,460;25:47,300;"- Split it with Brett Favre."
25:47,300;25:48,740;"I'm assuming Barry Sanders is 97."
25:48,740;25:50,100;"That may have been the--"
25:50,100;25:51,620;"- That's a good trivia."
25:51,620;25:52,820;"- It's not bad, right?"
25:52,820;25:53,660;"- Yeah."
25:53,660;25:54,500;"- Yeah."
25:55,620;26:01,620;"The last time somebody other than a quarterback or running back"
26:01,620;26:07,020;"won the NFL MVP was 1986."
26:07,020;26:10,140;"It was a defensive player."
26:10,140;26:12,300;"Any guesses?"
26:12,300;26:14,260;"I wasn't even born yet, dude."
26:14,260;26:15,860;"I don't know."
26:15,860;26:17,940;"One of those 86 bears guys."
26:17,940;26:19,820;"LT nicely done."
26:19,820;26:22,620;"And then two years before that."
26:23,060;26:27,020;"That's all right. Three years before 1982, Mark Mosley, the place kicker."
26:27,020;26:30,360;"What have you been?"
26:30,360;26:31,540;"82."
26:31,540;26:33,420;"Then it tears them."
26:33,420;26:35,100;"You believe what the fuck, right?"
26:35,100;26:37,300;"The only place kicker that ever went in."
26:37,300;26:38,620;"That's fucking ridiculous."
26:38,620;26:39,020;"Okay."
26:39,020;26:40,460;"Sure."
26:40,460;26:43,300;"I remember when Manti Teo had a fake girlfriend."
26:43,300;26:45,340;"Yeah."
26:45,340;26:47,700;"I don't know why I just came up now."
26:47,700;26:52,420;"But I just think of like highs and highs and the winners that are like candidates"
26:52,420;26:55,420;"that were non-offensive."
26:55,420;26:57,220;"And I was like, oh, Manti Teo."
26:57,220;26:59,020;"I remember that."
26:59,020;26:59,520;"I do."
26:59,520;27:00,020;"I do."
27:00,020;27:01,220;"He's going to be remembered forever"
27:01,220;27:03,220;"for having a fake girlfriend."
27:03,220;27:04,520;"He's like a little bit in the NFL."
27:04,520;27:05,420;"He's like, ""Laves and Alperns."""
27:05,420;27:06,520;"He is."
27:06,520;27:08,420;"Yeah, but what do you remember of him?"
27:08,420;27:09,020;"Fake girlfriend."
27:09,020;27:10,020;"Exactly that."
27:10,020;27:11,020;"Yeah."
27:11,020;27:12,020;"Yeah."
27:12,020;27:13,020;"Getting catfished."
27:13,020;27:14,020;"Yeah."
27:14,020;27:15,020;"He got catfished."
27:15,020;27:16,020;"He got gone."
27:16,020;27:17,020;"He got gone."
27:17,020;27:18,220;"He was like, he was like, he was the cutting edge"
27:18,220;27:20,220;"of the catfishing wave."
27:20,220;27:21,220;"Yeah."
27:21,220;27:22,220;"Everyone else was like, ""Boy, what the fuck?"""
27:22,220;27:26,460;"You can do this shit and then MTV had just come out with that show,"
27:26,460;27:29,660;"catfish, we're all like, whoa, this is like a,"
27:29,660;27:30,780;"wait, this is real?"
27:30,780;27:32,220;"Epidemic of catfish."
27:32,220;27:34,860;"You don't have to say who you are on the internet?"
27:34,860;27:36,140;"Yeah."
27:36,140;27:37,340;"God, and people fall for that?"
27:37,340;27:40,620;"It's a sex location."
27:40,620;27:41,420;"Remember that?"
27:41,420;27:42,300;"ASL, baby."
27:42,300;27:43,660;"ASL."
27:43,660;27:47,500;"I remember back in the AOL chat room days, me and Mike Mello used to"
27:49,100;27:53,940;"We used to buy a case of surge and we used to get on the chat rooms."
27:53,940;27:56,000;"The lesbian chat rooms are pretending to be lesbians."
27:56,000;27:57,980;"You guys are such bad boys."
27:57,980;27:59,340;"Super bad boys."
27:59,340;28:03,340;"I guess I'll maybe did."
28:03,340;28:05,940;"You guys are crazy."
28:05,940;28:08,940;"Whole case of surgery."
28:08,940;28:11,260;"No, lesbian."
28:11,260;28:13,220;"They're so much different than us."
28:13,220;28:14,260;"It's going to be sick."
28:14,260;28:18,380;"To be fair, this was middle school, but yes, it was crazy."
28:18,380;28:21,020;"Nobody knows who you are on the internet."
28:21,020;28:23,620;"I guarantee there was no lesbians in that room."
28:23,620;28:26,500;"- Yeah, there's a bunch of other search stuff"
28:26,500;28:29,460;"in quarantine, you're talking to each other."
28:29,460;28:32,860;"- I just got told off by Kelly."
28:32,860;28:36,900;"I was making fun of Andy, not lesbian people."
28:36,900;28:38,220;"I said lesbian people are normal."
28:38,220;28:39,660;"Andy was the weird one."
28:39,660;28:41,500;"- Yes, oh, 100% weird."
28:41,500;28:44,460;"- Don't worry, we can just isolate that one sound clip,"
28:44,460;28:46,460;"Greg, and play it over and over again."
28:46,460;28:48,980;"(laughing)"
28:48,980;28:49,860;"- Definitely me."
28:49,860;28:52,140;"Oh boy."
28:52,140;28:55,100;"(laughing)"
28:55,100;28:56,780;"I don't know how to transition from that one."
28:56,780;28:57,780;"- Yeah."
28:57,780;28:59,620;"- I was trying, but I couldn't get there."
28:59,620;29:02,980;"- Wasn't score it half time."
29:02,980;29:04,940;"- 14-7 Patriots."
29:04,940;29:06,100;"- 14-7 Patriots."
29:06,100;29:07,420;"- And 17-4."
29:07,420;29:09,180;"- Bethel Johnson has a big touchdown."
29:09,180;29:10,260;"They come right back,"
29:10,260;29:11,540;"that Titan Storm back,"
29:11,540;29:12,780;"and get a touchdown of their own."
29:12,780;29:13,620;"- Yeah."
29:13,620;29:14,460;"- Yeah."
29:14,460;29:15,300;"- Would you get them to see a lot?"
29:15,300;29:16,140;"- Adam did."
29:16,140;29:21,820;"feel goal on the next drive because and this is his 10th missed field goal of this season which"
29:21,820;29:28,060;"always, that's a lot. No gusts does that's a lot. You don't see what goes asking missing 10"
29:28,060;29:33,100;"field goals in a season. Do you? I think I think last time you started missing that money got cut."
29:33,100;29:40,220;"Or got shut excuse me shut down with an injury. Next play though, Rodney Harrison interception."
29:40,220;29:45,340;"Yeah. Yeah. The the Titans did the patented Patriots. As soon as you got to turn over,"
29:45,340;29:48,940;"You take the deep shot and Rodney Harris was not falling for it"
29:48,940;29:53,520;"They did that in the second half where the attempted double pass to yep, and really sniffed it out"
29:53,520;29:58,200;"Immediately and then tight end caught it. Why did you also?"
29:58,200;30:02,700;"Yeah, let's talk about that real quick because that was a"
30:02,700;30:10,880;"It was a pat it was what looked like a throwback pass like you it was kind of like"
30:11,700;30:15,620;"The Brady to Edelman to Amundola pass but on the other side of the field"
30:15,620;30:18,260;"It was supposed to be"
30:18,260;30:23,620;"Except they threw it to Frank Y check for the first one and he was like looking like he was"
30:23,620;30:27,740;"He's taking steps back as if he was gonna throw the ball was Frank Y check a"
30:27,740;30:34,500;"Like a quarterback in high school something like you don't often have your tight ends be the guy in the through the"
30:34,500;30:40,300;"He threw the moat. Oh the music city miracle remember that's true"
30:40,300;30:43,540;"- That's true. - That was a good throw."
30:43,540;30:45,380;"- No, we threw it absolutely perfectly."
30:45,380;30:46,380;"What do you mean badly?"
30:46,380;30:48,900;"- He threw it forward in a backwards lateral pass."
30:48,900;30:49,740;"That was bad."
30:49,740;30:51,780;"- That literally could not have been more perfect pass."
30:51,780;30:52,900;"- I like the sideline."
30:52,900;30:54,980;"- Sidelink decided on it a little bit to get it,"
30:54,980;30:56,020;"but he didn't have to move."
30:56,020;30:58,580;"He just stood there and just bent down and caught it."
30:58,580;31:00,780;"- I mean, for a tight end, it was a good throw."
31:00,780;31:04,060;"- Like across his shoulder, that throw was like one"
31:04,060;31:06,340;"of the best throws in NFL history, I would say."
31:06,340;31:07,260;"- Oh, easy."
31:07,260;31:08,260;"- Wow."
31:08,260;31:10,800;"I thought special teams didn't matter"
31:10,800;31:28,440;"When you're right you're right give you that one. I'm just saying considering the circumstances"
31:28,440;31:34,980;"Who is throwing it? Oh wow brutal"
31:34,980;31:41,700;"Yeah, but on every time that the path like turned it over, this game was close enough."
31:41,700;31:45,540;"He just made a couple mistakes and the Titans would take a shot and pass defense that come"
31:45,540;31:51,980;"up huge. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was kind of the game. Yeah, because the only other drive"
31:51,980;31:58,460;"the Patriots often put together was right at the end of the first quarter with again,"
31:58,460;32:03,340;"your boy Bethel Johnson coming on strong at the end of the season. He was like third and"
32:03,340;32:05,260;"long third and 13 or something like that."
32:05,260;32:07,700;"Got a quick pass over the middle."
32:07,700;32:11,860;"Got hemmed in and turned around and started reversing field"
32:11,860;32:12,660;"running back the other way."
32:12,660;32:18,420;"Tom Brady threw an absolute monster block to spring him for the"
32:18,420;32:19,220;"13 yards."
32:19,220;32:22,540;"You should definitely put this as a highlight on the website."
32:22,540;32:23,420;"It's going to be on there."
32:23,420;32:27,420;"I cut the sweet block from Brady like a nice clean cut block."
32:27,420;32:31,020;"Yeah, it was like he's had a couple of those."
32:31,020;32:34,900;"There was one recently, like his last season on the Patriots."
32:34,900;32:36,180;"When they're against the Bills, remember,"
32:36,180;32:40,300;"and you ran downfield and blocked whoever their top quarterback was?"
32:40,300;32:41,580;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
32:41,580;32:46,360;"For Davis White. Yep. And it was that similar, like, you know, like,"
32:46,360;32:49,500;"just throw himself with the guy's knees sort of thing. Yeah. Like quarterback"
32:49,500;32:54,420;"still, but in this one, he got him full on. I don't know who it was, but it was a,"
32:54,420;32:57,620;"it was a big guy and he went. You know, who else does that? Who else is that?"
32:58,660;32:59,660;"Brett far."
32:59,660;33:00,660;"Right."
33:00,660;33:01,660;"Like that."
33:01,660;33:07,260;"These are seven fun, but you don't like Brett far because you know, you don't like guys"
33:07,260;33:10,580;"that just have fun out there and put football in our gunslingers."
33:10,580;33:14,260;"But now Tom Brady does it and you're like, Oh my God, did you see that block?"
33:14,260;33:15,660;"I was so sick."
33:15,660;33:17,660;"Is this like a."
33:17,660;33:20,660;"I don't know where we're headed with."
33:20,660;33:24,500;"That's just I'm saying be consistent."
33:24,500;33:31,540;"You either like the guys that do stupid shit because they're football players and they have fun out there"
33:31,540;33:35,500;"Oh, you don't like them. I think it's remarkable because Bree doesn't really do a lot of that shit"
33:35,500;33:39,680;"He only doesn't want it absolutely necessary in the fact that he doesn't do it very often"
33:39,680;33:43,120;"Yeah, whereas I think yeah, it's only wasn't this game"
33:43,120;33:45,700;"or was it maybe last week where"
33:45,700;33:53,140;"They showed a highlight of Brett Favre running 20 yards downfield to throw that block for no fucking reason"
33:53,140;33:57,940;"Yeah, that was so sick. What do you mean? No reason it was awesome. It didn't do anything"
33:57,940;34:00,960;"Just want to show me the football player"
34:00,960;34:03,500;"Well, he just"
34:03,500;34:07,600;"I thought back or where I wear my Wrangler. I run down field and block my friends"
34:07,600;34:14,100;"Yeah, he just loves football and he was just so excited to complete that pass. He was like I just got to run"
34:14,100;34:21,800;"Hit and hit somebody and you know what his teammates probably love that shit and they got hyped up when it happened"
34:21,800;34:23,060;"Um, they definitely did."
34:23,060;34:27,080;"Yeah, I just think that Brady doesn't do that very often."
34:27,080;34:28,400;"He would do all that show of time."
34:28,400;34:29,900;"So it's notable in Brady does it."
34:29,900;34:32,980;"I wouldn't want Brady doing it all the time because he's going to get fucking beat up."
34:32,980;34:34,840;"Yeah, he's going to get addicted to painkillers."
34:34,840;34:36,840;"Like, I don't know, dude."
34:36,840;34:39,440;"He's got those long fucking tendons."
34:39,440;34:40,120;"Very pliable."
34:40,120;34:44,080;"Drinks a lot of water."
34:44,080;34:44,920;"He'll be fine."
34:44,920;34:49,000;"Not drink a lot of water in this game because the"
34:49,000;34:51,800;"- You can't get concussions when you got headaches."
34:51,800;34:52,640;"- Right."
34:52,640;34:53,920;"- When you're hydrated."
34:53,920;34:55,600;"- That's right, yeah, you're drinking a lot of water."
34:55,600;34:58,480;"You don't even get sunburns if you don't have water."
34:58,480;34:59,320;"That's right."
34:59,320;35:00,760;"But you couldn't drink any water in this game"
35:00,760;35:02,040;"because the commentators are talking about"
35:02,040;35:03,800;"how their water froze in the booth."
35:03,800;35:04,760;"- Okay, here we go."
35:04,760;35:05,840;"Let's hear it Andy."
35:05,840;35:06,680;"- No, I know."
35:06,680;35:07,520;"- No, it's in the commentators."
35:07,520;35:08,360;"I thought they were fine."
35:08,360;35:09,880;"- Oh no, it's on the commentators?"
35:09,880;35:11,960;"- I was hoping for some creepy"
35:11,960;35:14,520;"arming catean shit again, but I didn't see."
35:14,520;35:15,520;"- Yeah, I know that."
35:15,520;35:16,360;"- So yeah, nothing."
35:16,360;35:22,200;"typical Phil Sims like just like corny bullshit stuff like this what we talked"
35:22,200;35:29,240;"about like the stuff that bothers me is like those those like lazy like yeah just"
35:29,240;35:32,960;"like the corny shit like the there's I'm a oh if they played football at the"
35:32,960;35:37,680;"North Pole this is probably what it would be like come on man like you can"
35:37,680;35:42,520;"do better than that you're professional like take some I don't know and then"
35:42,520;35:48,520;"talking about Jeff Fisher. Jeff Fisher is the epitome of us against them. Like literally not."
35:48,520;35:54,680;"Like the entire Patriots build a dynasty on that. But Jeff Fisher of all fucking people."
35:54,680;36:00,040;"Is I know? Is that a thing he says in the locker room a lot? Well, hey, Greg, you want the whole"
36:00,040;36:05,240;"contest? I know you didn't watch it, Greg. Didn't obviously there's more context with Andy saying"
36:05,240;36:08,280;"here. They said we need to be bell check and he was just like, you know, got the guys ready to"
36:08,280;36:11,240;"play. They're going to go out there and play. And then the e-b-fisher and he's like, I'm a"
36:11,240;36:13,520;"a raw raw guy, I find a lot of speeches."
36:13,520;36:15,720;"I'll find anything to like find disrespect"
36:15,720;36:19,660;"and like use that to motivate and like get a raw raw speech."
36:19,660;36:22,520;"- Andy, comments?"
36:22,520;36:24,680;"- Corny bullshit, all of it."
36:24,680;36:25,520;"- Apparently that's corny bullshit."
36:25,520;36:27,480;"That's sort of the difference between two coaches"
36:27,480;36:29,360;"and the way they motivate their teams is cool."
36:29,360;36:31,360;"- In that case, I was directing it at Jeff Fisher,"
36:31,360;36:34,720;"but yes, Jeff Fisher's corny bullshit too."
36:34,720;36:36,960;"(laughing)"
36:36,960;36:40,400;"- Well yeah, they were talking about how,"
36:40,400;36:43,720;"Like at the end, the Titans were wasting their time outs"
36:43,720;36:48,200;"'cause they couldn't figure out how the play clock worked."
36:48,200;36:50,520;"So they're wasting their time outs at the end there."
36:50,520;36:53,920;"And there was one play where it wasn't a timeout,"
36:53,920;36:55,120;"it was just like an injury stoppage."
36:55,120;36:57,200;"So they stopped the clock and came back."
36:57,200;37:00,040;"And both of you can go fuck yourself."
37:00,040;37:02,480;"- Well, how dare they get this one off."
37:02,480;37:04,800;"- No, but they start talking about how like,"
37:04,800;37:06,280;"oh, well, you just wanted to be a timeout."
37:06,280;37:08,040;"So you can go stand behind the heater."
37:08,040;37:10,080;"I turned it off because I'm a fucking tough guy."
37:10,080;37:12,000;"I'm like, fuck you."
37:12,000;37:13,120;"Ugh."
37:13,120;37:13,960;"Stupid."
37:13,960;37:14,800;"Like all these people,"
37:14,800;37:15,640;"like you know what it is?"
37:15,640;37:16,800;"It's like this is your fucking job."
37:16,800;37:18,520;"So I'll bitch it out how cold it is."
37:18,520;37:19,360;"- All right."
37:19,360;37:20,200;"- I have a kiss."
37:20,200;37:21,040;"- You know what it is, Andy?"
37:21,040;37:22,680;"What is it?"
37:22,680;37:24,160;"It's workplace humor."
37:24,160;37:26,880;"You know what I'm saying?"
37:26,880;37:31,120;"Where you like say jokes that you don't want to take risks"
37:31,120;37:32,120;"so you can't offend anyone."
37:32,120;37:34,160;"So you just say the generic joke"
37:34,160;37:37,000;"and you don't even know what people know about things."
37:37,000;37:37,840;"So you're just like,"
37:37,840;37:42,640;"the fucking weather, huh? And you just make like the most generic joke you can make."
37:42,640;37:48,400;"Monday, so my rice. That shit sucks, dude. I have gone in front of them. They have to"
37:48,400;37:52,560;"like appeal to a broad audience. So they have to tell jokes that are like that. I don't think"
37:52,560;37:56,560;"I know that because I say jokes like that at work. And when I say them, like, come out of"
37:56,560;38:02,000;"my mouth, I'm like, I want to shoot myself for saying this. But it's like, it's just part of the gig."
38:02,560;38:06,120;"It's not though because I work too and I don't say that."
38:06,120;38:06,820;"I say them."
38:06,820;38:07,120;"Yeah."
38:07,120;38:08,640;"And that's why no one likes you, Andy."
38:08,640;38:11,760;"And you never get promoted because you don't do the stupid jokes."
38:11,760;38:12,400;"Wrong."
38:12,400;38:16,160;"Everybody loves them."
38:16,160;38:21,520;"I got kudos and he's like, do my deck is so small in this weather."
38:21,520;38:29,960;"Sometimes you got to say what you got to say."
38:29,960;38:30,960;"That's the thing, right?"
38:31,440;38:34,320;"Those are the jokes you would have made your body inside you."
38:34,320;38:36,360;"Yeah."
38:36,360;38:37,880;"No, I got any."
38:37,880;38:39,000;"It's so cold out."
38:39,000;38:40,960;"You know, you can't make that joke on air."
38:40,960;38:43,000;"No, but that's zero degrees one."
38:43,000;38:45,160;"That fucking kills the work."
38:45,160;38:46,720;"I have a plus in the car."
38:46,720;38:49,080;"I'm funny, but that's corny humor too."
38:49,080;38:51,360;"It's it's it's."
38:51,360;38:55,680;"It's a nice deep cut pro commentator."
38:55,680;38:57,040;"Or into the game."
38:57,040;38:59,480;"They're taking a knee and he's like, what do you think of the"
38:59,480;39:04,000;"to hand it off. You have a guy stand there and get tackled and then he fumbles it. And"
39:04,000;39:08,080;"he's like, Oh, come on, man. And they were talking about the miracle of the metallands"
39:08,080;39:12,000;"when the Eagles did that to the Giants. They ended up they didn't need to be fumbles and"
39:12,000;39:16,520;"it picks it up scoops and scores and they win. Who was it? Because Phil Sims is a big"
39:16,520;39:20,800;"giant sky. It was not. It was her mad words."
39:20,800;39:25,360;"It was the Eagles guy that picked it up and returned for a touchdown. Yeah. Yeah. Yes,"
39:25,360;39:27,460;"on his corner back herman Edwards."
39:27,460;39:28,540;"Exactly."
39:28,540;39:29,540;"1917."
39:29,540;39:30,140;"Yeah."
39:30,140;39:35,340;"Speaking of fumbles, I think the guy who had the worst game for the"
39:35,340;39:37,440;"Patriots in this was Daniel Graham."
39:37,440;39:39,220;"Oh, that's not even close."
39:39,220;39:43,980;"And he's, I understand, I remember now being like super frustrated with"
39:43,980;39:44,680;"him."
39:44,680;39:47,780;"Because when he gets it right, like he's unstoppable."
39:47,780;39:48,980;"He's an absolute monster."
39:48,980;39:49,860;"He's this huge dude."
39:49,860;39:55,180;"He's like, he's like the same size and like physicality as Gronk."
39:55,180;40:01,320;"And he seems like he has like the maneuverability and the same athleticism as him, but he just"
40:01,320;40:06,980;"like can't put it together. He dropped a couple of balls. Yeah. One that would have"
40:06,980;40:11,500;"been like setting up a touchdown. And I think that that one may have been when they missed"
40:11,500;40:18,460;"the field goal when Adam is still go. Pretty sure. So that's sucked. And then he also"
40:18,460;40:22,980;"they they're like, okay, we're not going to catch the ball down the field. So they're"
40:22,980;40:28,020;"the rain and screen to him, he caught it, got one yard, got stood up and then"
40:28,020;40:30,780;"a fumble in the ball there too, which the Titans recovered."
40:30,780;40:33,940;"And that was when we said that was halfway through the third."
40:33,940;40:34,740;"That's right."
40:34,740;40:36,860;"They tried that, that double pass that."
40:36,860;40:37,300;"Yeah."
40:37,300;40:42,740;"And this is, this is like a couple of plays later after Tennessee had scored"
40:42,740;40:44,100;"the tying touchdown."
40:44,100;40:46,060;"So it's, it's tie game 14 right now."
40:46,060;40:49,980;"Patrons like start moving the ball a little bit and then"
40:49,980;40:52,460;"Graham Fumbles tightens recover."
40:52,460;40:56,380;"And luckily the opposite of Kevin Falk."
40:56,380;40:58,460;"Yeah, he's the anti Kevin Falk."
40:58,460;41:03,800;"Yeah, there is something about players where you get like an immediate eye test of whether"
41:03,800;41:06,860;"they are that guy or not."
41:06,860;41:08,860;"Like Nikhil Harry is not that guy."
41:08,860;41:10,460;"He's a Daniel Graham category."
41:10,460;41:11,460;"Yeah."
41:11,460;41:15,820;"Yeah, I can see that James White is a Kevin Falk category."
41:15,820;41:20,980;"Yeah, Edelman even now what's the kid the rookie from NC State."
41:20,980;41:22,320;"- J.J. Taylor?"
41:22,320;41:26,060;"- No, the wide receiver."
41:26,060;41:27,780;"- I wanna say bird, but it's the other one."
41:27,780;41:28,620;"- Myers."
41:28,620;41:29,460;"- Myers."
41:29,460;41:30,300;"- Myers, yeah."
41:30,300;41:31,140;"- Myers."
41:31,140;41:34,260;"He has the Kevin Falk, like fall forward."
41:34,260;41:35,100;"- The green."
41:35,100;41:35,940;"- Yeah."
41:35,940;41:37,860;"- Get the yards, know where the stick is."
41:37,860;41:39,220;"- Get four yards when you need four."
41:39,220;41:40,020;"- Yeah."
41:40,020;41:42,260;"- That's like a distinct characteristic of a player"
41:42,260;41:44,940;"of like a yes or no, do they have that in Miami?"
41:44,940;41:46,420;"- Yes, on J.J."
41:46,420;41:48,700;"- He's had like four cards in his career."
41:48,700;41:50,020;"- How do you know that, dude?"
41:50,020;41:56,940;"Yeah, I'm playing third string Panthers players and did it fine. I'm gonna say yes on Gunnar Olszewski then"
41:56,940;42:01,060;"Yeah, that's how I would play it too. I was signing off on that. Yes"
42:01,060;42:07,580;"Well, she's got the shifty moves that you saw from Edelman. It's actually a great company. I think so"
42:07,580;42:10,260;"unlike yours"
42:10,260;42:11,700;"You'll see"
42:11,700;42:15,220;"Or maybe yeah, I'm not saying you're wrong. I'm just saying we have no idea"
42:16,860;42:23,940;"The worst is like when you like a guy that doesn't have that gene and you're rooting for him and like every time you're like"
42:23,940;42:27,460;"Oh, he's getting a screen. He's gonna get yards and then he gets like stood up and you're like"
42:27,460;42:32,660;"Just want to be proven right, but yeah"
42:32,660;42:40,360;"Yeah, yeah, yeah holding on fucking number 15 you're like fuck"
42:41,660;42:46,620;"Damn it Sony Michelle like just I just want to yeah, it's only shall one broken tackle"
42:46,620;42:52,220;"I'm a shell I've been standing you since the beginning and you just ah come on prove me right"
42:52,220;42:55,980;"I still think he's got it. He looked good. He looked good this past"
42:55,980;42:59,100;"He can catch the ball. He'll be awesome. Yeah"
42:59,100;43:05,900;"Um speaking of catching the ball though. We're gonna jump kind of towards the end of the game because not much happened in third quarter"
43:05,900;43:08,860;"um somebody who"
43:08,860;43:11,180;"went from having like"
43:11,340;43:14,620;"a great game to a terrible game. Drew Bennett."
43:14,620;43:23,100;"From the year to go. Yeah, because he made the Titans have their on their last drive. I think"
43:23,100;43:29,420;"they're yeah, they're in their two minute drill and they're driving down the field. They get to"
43:29,420;43:37,340;"about the New England 35 when it gets to the two minute warning and down a field goal because Adam"
43:37,340;43:41,340;"And finally, that was probably the closest field I've seen him kick."
43:41,340;43:42,700;"That was a pretty close one."
43:42,700;43:46,220;"That one died halfway and just barely sailed over the left corner."
43:46,220;43:47,220;"It's not going to get in there."
43:47,220;43:48,220;"Yeah, hooked it in."
43:48,220;43:51,860;"It would have been a great soccer goal, basically, kind of hook it in that top corner sort of"
43:51,860;43:53,700;"thing."
43:53,700;44:01,020;"But on this drive, Drew Bennett makes two outstanding catches on the sideline."
44:01,020;44:08,460;"I think get reviewed both get up held because he just keeps control gets both"
44:08,460;44:11,580;"there's tap both feet down one of them was in double coverage abolishing"
44:11,580;44:21,420;"even thrown to him but because the Titans I don't know they just seem to"
44:21,420;44:26,140;"make a lot of yeah they make a lot of mistakes but they made them at the worst"
44:26,140;44:30,860;"possible times it was two minutes warning they're on our 33 yeah"
44:30,860;44:39,860;"And we're up three. Yeah. And they're sitting pretty. And then it goes intentional grounding, which I hate the call, but it was the right."
44:39,860;44:49,860;"It was the pages just decided to bring big blitz every time there's like, yeah. Yeah. He actually had he got like hurt and he's hobbled like the play before. Yeah, because he ran for a bunch of years."
44:49,860;44:59,220;"McNair. Yeah. And then, uh, so they had the grounding and then a holding and then like a couple of"
44:59,220;45:05,860;"non-plays, it's third and 23. And then it makes an amazing catch on the sideline, but it's still"
45:05,860;45:13,220;"fourth and 12. Um, so the Titans are still like, so they basically start at the 35. And now they're"
45:14,740;45:18,140;"Further back than that because they have what's the name Gary Anderson"
45:18,140;45:25,980;"kicking mr. Face bar himself getting up there an age so he's not gonna be able to boot these long kicks in the cold because we've seen even Adam Minnitary"
45:25,980;45:29,860;"He he missed from 44 and then hit from"
45:29,860;45:35,800;"46 but that 46 when barely snuck over and this is about that range for an old guy"
45:35,800;45:38,220;"So like fuck we're gonna go for a fourth and 12"
45:38,220;45:40,740;"going for it, okay and"
45:41,220;45:45,920;"again, Paige just bring the blitz McNair hooks it up like that's because that's what he does now and"
45:45,920;45:52,020;"his true Bennett right in the hands like it was one of those things where Drew Bennett was like running past the"
45:52,020;45:58,520;"Defender and the ball hung up so he stopped and everybody ran past him and so we jumped up a catch it"
45:58,520;46:00,980;"hit him in both hands and"
46:00,980;46:03,540;"sprung straight out and then he got hit by"
46:03,540;46:09,540;"Three maybe four pages defenders. So they didn't have a chance to catch the rebound and that was basically the game"
46:10,620;46:13,300;"But from going from having those two amazing catches"
46:13,300;46:15,740;"To dropping"
46:15,740;46:19,660;"What was essentially an easier version of those catches like in the middle of fields?"
46:19,660;46:26,300;"It was it was a gaming yeah kind of uncontested really and just like hit him in both hands and he dropped it"
46:26,300;46:28,780;"It was a tough look. It's my nightmare"
46:28,780;46:31,460;"Yeah, oh god. Yeah"
46:31,460;46:36,220;"Because nobody remembers the other two catches and like catching a football is probably like a"
46:36,740;46:38,740;"me think about it, right?"
46:38,740;46:39,740;"- Nope."
46:39,740;46:41,740;"- And what's it doin' after that?"
46:41,740;46:43,740;"- It's a muscle memory thing."
46:43,740;46:47,740;"So like that's gonna be so hard to like mentally get over."
46:47,740;46:48,740;"- Yeah."
46:48,740;46:51,740;"- I know obviously I can make this catch."
46:51,740;46:53,740;"Why did I not make it there?"
46:53,740;46:55,740;"Is it 'cause I'm a beta and I can't handle pressure?"
46:55,740;46:56,740;"- Right."
46:56,740;46:58,740;"- Is it 'cause it was cold or am I making excuses"
46:58,740;46:59,740;"because it was cold?"
46:59,740;47:02,740;"You know, like I wonder what the mental gymnastics"
47:02,740;47:05,740;"that he goes through having to like work through that."
47:05,740;47:10,620;"that. Yeah. They showed us a shot of a steamer near like giving him a like a pep talk on the"
47:10,620;47:15,660;"sideline right after it. Oh, really? That's good leadership. That's that's great leadership. Yeah."
47:15,660;47:21,740;"Yeah. It's exactly what he's having. That's that's tough way to go out though. Yeah. Because he had"
47:21,740;47:26,140;"it and all he was there. And all he was there. He's over. Yeah. Like a fifth like goal from the 20"
47:26,140;47:32,700;"yard line with like, I don't mean it left. Yeah. Within field goal range now. You could take the"
47:32,700;47:38,340;"lead. So yeah, so the pages take over with about a minute and a half left. And because"
47:38,340;47:45,580;"the Titans had screwed up the clock so bad, I think they had to call, they called a timeout"
47:45,580;47:53,580;"early in the third, I think, because they kept like running up against the play clock."
47:53,580;47:58,580;"And so they had a game still, they had three total delay games. I think one was probably"
47:58,580;47:59,580;"on purpose because of the punter."
47:59,580;48:02,060;"That's because the paths were messing with the radios."
48:02,060;48:03,780;"Like they did at Pittsburgh was here."
48:03,780;48:04,380;"Oh, probably."
48:04,380;48:05,860;"No, they were they were messing with the play clocks."
48:05,860;48:06,620;"I would guess."
48:06,620;48:07,300;"Cheater."
48:07,300;48:09,140;"Cheaters."
48:09,140;48:12,300;"That's a Tennessee fans would say."
48:12,300;48:14,180;"But yeah, they just couldn't get the play often time."
48:14,180;48:15,540;"So they had to burn a time out there."
48:15,540;48:18,260;"And then they burned another one on like on defense, I think,"
48:18,260;48:22,060;"because the Patriots were driving when they held him to a field goal."
48:22,060;48:26,380;"And then so they only had the one time out left."
48:26,380;48:28,540;"So they could only stop the clock once."
48:28,540;48:31,180;"So the page ran it and then started to take a knee."
48:31,180;48:36,780;"But in true, like, it's Brady Belichick fashion."
48:36,780;48:41,880;"The first time Brady goes take a knee, he steps back as you can take a knee, but"
48:41,880;48:42,260;"doesn't."
48:42,260;48:44,660;"So we run a couple of extra seconds off the clock."
48:44,660;48:48,820;"So the Titans do like the, the kind of like step forward and then realize the"
48:48,820;48:49,460;"plays on over it."
48:49,460;48:52,780;"And then they actually rush them and then he takes the knee, but they hit him anyway."
48:52,780;48:55,260;"Because like, you know, I would do fuck you."
48:55,260;48:55,660;"Yeah."
48:55,660;48:56,140;"Yeah."
48:56,140;48:56,940;"It got to hit him."
48:56,940;48:57,500;"Yeah."
48:57,500;48:59,700;"If you're not going to go down, I'm going to make sure you make sure you do."
48:59,700;49:01,460;"So that starts a rock."
49:01,460;49:04,220;"Harrison, they cut to him and he was living."
49:04,220;49:06,860;"The other person had steam coming up his head and all the"
49:06,860;49:07,940;"game was around Harrison."
49:07,940;49:11,500;"They've been Teddy Bruce Keys where they were bounced up and down the sidelines."
49:11,500;49:12,020;"They were."
49:12,020;49:17,660;"And so a skirmish breaks out, which worked in the pages of range because that"
49:17,660;49:19,780;"kept the clock going during the whole thing."
49:19,780;49:24,980;"And so it actually killed a decent amount of time."
49:24,980;49:26,900;"But then so they took another knee."
49:26,900;49:30,700;"This time Brady actually takes it for real, like in one motion."
49:30,700;49:38,420;"And so there's now, I think they like let the clock run down to three seconds left,"
49:38,420;49:39,260;"but it's fourth down."
49:39,260;49:40,380;"So what do you do?"
49:40,380;49:47,860;"And I think this for me is another like just small example of Bill Belichick."
49:47,860;49:52,300;"Thinking of every single situation and probably had this dialed up."
49:52,300;49:53,500;"What do you do?"
49:53,500;49:54,260;"Because like you said,"
49:54,620;49:56,220;"You don't want to head in."
49:56,220;49:57,340;"You don't want to hand it off."
49:57,340;50:00,860;"You don't you don't you can't take a knee because fourth down."
50:00,860;50:01,300;"Yeah."
50:01,300;50:02,460;"So it's meeting a sub."
50:02,460;50:03,540;"So we are you second."
50:03,540;50:07,100;"Yeah, you can't you can't fumble it because you can't give the ball back."
50:07,100;50:09,220;"So what's the safest play?"
50:09,220;50:11,580;"And so the payer's come up Brady."
50:11,580;50:17,100;"Snaps the ball runs backwards and just throws it as far as he can."
50:17,100;50:20,940;"And they they said, I think it was David Gibbons down the sideline and Brady"
50:20,940;50:22,500;"overthrows him by about 20 yards."
50:23,180;50:24,980;"I think it probably should have been it wasn't quite that."
50:24,980;50:28,020;"It was a little close that you probably wanted to be, but just so it wouldn't be"
50:28,020;50:28,460;"grounding."
50:28,460;50:29,740;"So you wouldn't have the penalty."
50:29,740;50:32,500;"And that runs out the last three seconds of the game."
50:32,500;50:35,340;"And I can see by Greg's face, he doesn't agree with me."
50:35,340;50:37,900;"So first of all, fuck you second of all, why?"
50:37,900;50:41,300;"First of all, it's fucking common sense."
50:41,300;50:43,020;"Any coach in the NFL would have done that."
50:43,020;50:44,420;"What do you think people are going to punt there?"
50:44,420;50:48,420;"You think, little, you could, you could do one of 10 things you could do."
50:48,420;50:48,700;"Okay."
50:48,700;50:51,820;"I snap it and fucking walk backwards for three seconds."
50:51,820;50:55,720;"you could do a punt where they don't actually punt it. They just snap it and he stands there"
50:55,720;51:00,940;"for three seconds. Teams do that shit all the time, dude. But the play has to end. So"
51:00,940;51:05,620;"what happens if your pun or fumbles it? Like that's the what they took that time to take"
51:05,620;51:11,100;"a knee. Yeah. What if you get intentional grounding? You've seen it before. You've seen"
51:11,100;51:14,540;"a fair amount of football games end on just the air ball out of bounds where the guy to"
51:14,540;51:16,540;"run it on the sideline. Yeah."
51:16,540;51:19,320;"Did he get out of the pocket?"
51:19,320;51:21,080;"Did he get Brady out of the pocket?"
51:21,080;51:21,580;"Yeah."
51:21,580;51:24,060;"Oh, that's why they sent the guy down the sideline"
51:24,060;51:25,420;"because they didn't."
51:25,420;51:27,660;"Oh, because I've seen coaches direct the quarterback"
51:27,660;51:29,740;"to immediately sprint out of the pocket"
51:29,740;51:31,540;"and then throw it away so they make sure they don't get"
51:31,540;51:32,780;"intentional ground."
51:32,780;51:33,280;"What?"
51:33,280;51:34,140;"But you know, it's funny."
51:34,140;51:35,820;"Belichick didn't think of that."
51:35,820;51:36,620;"He didn't mean to."
51:36,620;51:39,100;"Tom Brady ran for two first downs this game."
51:39,100;51:40,060;"Yeah, he had Tom Brady."
51:40,060;51:41,980;"You're going to leave it in the hands of the rap sandes."
51:41,980;51:44,540;"I mean, you're leaving the hands of your franchise."
51:44,540;51:49,760;"Yeah, that's why they sent the wide receiver down there."
51:49,760;51:52,680;"And you throw it in that general direction, problem solved."
51:52,680;51:59,260;"Wait, if it's, if it's intentional grounding, a receiver has to be in the area."
51:59,260;51:59,780;"No receiver."
51:59,780;52:01,900;"I know, but I know, but it's a loss of downplay."
52:01,900;52:03,980;"Does the other team gets a play then?"
52:03,980;52:04,320;"Yeah."
52:04,320;52:05,680;"I don't know."
52:05,680;52:09,740;"So you can't have a defensive penalty, but that's an offensive penalty."
52:09,740;52:11,700;"I'm going to change it down."
52:11,700;52:12,380;"I think you're right."
52:12,380;52:14,520;"Because didn't the Ravens do something like that?"
52:14,520;52:19,960;"a few years ago where it was a they did something like it was supposed to be like a punt and"
52:19,960;52:26,760;"they did like a delay a game or something on like on the punt and that ran the clock because"
52:26,760;52:32,920;"they're on offense and so it ran the last five seconds off and that was the end of the game and"
52:32,920;52:37,800;"so I think they've actually since closed that loophole sounds like a loophole right yeah so"
52:37,800;52:39,560;"So Bellicherk doesn't figure it out."
52:39,560;52:41,640;"- Fucking, what's his name well?"
52:41,640;52:45,800;"- So the paths win on a Bellicherk Genius play."
52:45,800;52:46,640;"- Yep."
52:46,640;52:48,000;"- 2017-14."
52:48,000;52:49,360;"- 17-14, no."
52:49,360;52:54,360;"- 17-14 and we're on to the AFC Conference game."
52:54,360;52:56,960;"13 wins in a row?"
52:56,960;52:57,960;"- 13 wins in a row."
52:57,960;52:58,800;"- 13 wins in a row."
52:58,800;53:01,960;"- 13 wins in a row."
53:01,960;53:02,780;"- That's a lot."
53:02,780;53:05,960;"- Yeah, it's a wagon."
53:05,960;53:06,800;"- Yeah."
53:06,800;53:12,840;"a wagon and they've only got one blow in that which was yeah each 17 you just held"
53:12,840;53:19,840;"the fifth ranked offense to 14 points mm-hmm and not a lot of really either yeah"
53:19,840;53:27,800;"let's see they had 284 total yards which is not a bad page dad - not very many"
53:27,800;53:35,180;"no McNair played well I think still this is a good jumping point to the other"
53:35,180;53:43,060;"games to put it into context of what what yeah yeah because they they kept as good as"
53:43,060;53:54,460;"the Patriots are yeah talk to me the Colts no I was thought the Colts did all of these"
53:54,460;53:59,260;"three other divisional games going on there are ridiculous all of them so the cold the"
53:59,260;54:04,340;"Colts so as good as a patch have been defensive the Colts have been like even more impressive"
54:04,340;54:12,260;"of offensively in the playoffs. They are an absolute offensive wagon. They, they haven't"
54:12,260;54:17,020;"punted in two games. It's like general Sherman running through the day."
54:17,020;54:18,580;"They don't want to look for the Patriots. I remember that."
54:18,580;54:19,580;"Clearly."
54:19,580;54:21,940;"Just, just raising things to remember their first punt."
54:21,940;54:32,180;"Yeah. So they beat the Broncos beat the brakes off from 41 to 10 479 total yards. No puns."
54:32,180;54:34,520;"Manningman have a perfect pass."
54:34,520;54:37,180;"Perfect, pass are rating five touchdowns, no picks."
54:37,180;54:43,420;"This, this week against the Chiefs, they go into Arrowhead and beat the Chiefs."
54:43,420;54:47,980;"38 31, 434 total yards, no puns."
54:47,980;54:49,100;"Yeah."
54:49,100;54:51,220;"Game must have been very entertaining."
54:51,220;54:55,980;"I watched the highlights and they calls for just fucking unstoppable."
54:55,980;55:00,220;"Like they just kept every time the Chiefs was going to touchdown."
55:00,220;55:02,740;"and they get like, they got a Dante Hall kickoff"
55:02,740;55:03,780;"for Trevor to touchdown."
55:03,780;55:05,100;"Like, okay, we're back in this."
55:05,100;55:06,860;"And then Manning would just be like,"
55:06,860;55:09,220;"eight, play 75 yards touchdown."
55:09,220;55:10,060;"(laughing)"
55:10,060;55:11,700;"- Every single fucking time."
55:11,700;55:13,340;"- Well, this is unstoppable."
55:13,340;55:14,900;"- Didn't we talk about this is the season"
55:14,900;55:18,940;"that the Colts came back against, was it Tampa"
55:18,940;55:20,460;"or Chicago or someone?"
55:20,460;55:23,300;"And they scored like 30 points in the fourth quarter."
55:23,300;55:24,500;"Something stupid like that."
55:24,500;55:27,820;"- They came out against the Pats, almost beat the Pats."
55:27,820;55:28,660;"- Yeah."
55:28,660;55:35,380;"did pay Manning in these two games has thrown eight touchdowns, no picks, 680 yards and"
55:35,380;55:37,220;"only 12 incompletions."
55:37,220;55:40,900;"So he has always as many touchdowns as incompletions."
55:40,900;55:41,580;"Yeah."
55:41,580;55:44,300;"And he's at 79 points."
55:44,300;55:45,380;"Wow."
55:45,380;55:46,260;"Yeah."
55:46,260;55:52,420;"So he's coming into New England and he's a co-amp with the guy you just be."
55:52,420;55:52,940;"Right."
55:52,940;55:57,460;"So there, you know, this is literally like the, what is it?"
55:57,460;56:00,940;"the irresistible force versus the removal object."
56:00,940;56:01,780;"- Correct."
56:01,780;56:04,260;"- What's about to happen next week in New England?"
56:04,260;56:08,900;"So that's one of the AFC, the playoff games."
56:08,900;56:10,420;"You go to the NFC,"
56:10,420;56:14,280;"the Eagles beat the Packers"
56:14,280;56:15,740;"20 to 17 and overtime."
56:15,740;56:17,860;"This is the fourth and 26."
56:17,860;56:19,060;"- Oh my God."
56:19,060;56:20,580;"- Freddy Mitchell."
56:20,580;56:21,820;"- Yes."
56:21,820;56:23,040;"- So it's-- - Freddy Mitchell's"
56:23,040;56:25,540;"who fought the fourth and 26."
56:25,540;56:26,380;"- Oh yeah, dude."
56:26,380;56:27,860;"I did not know that was a front X."
56:27,860;56:28,860;"Front X."
56:28,860;56:29,860;"Yes."
56:29,860;56:30,860;"Got it."
56:30,860;56:31,860;"Okay."
56:31,860;56:32,860;"That's basically like his only calling guard."
56:32,860;56:33,860;"Yeah."
56:33,860;56:34,860;"Like that's too highlight."
56:34,860;56:35,860;"Yeah."
56:35,860;56:37,940;"He made a name out of that one player."
56:37,940;56:39,740;"Well, he milked that one good."
56:39,740;56:40,740;"Yeah."
56:40,740;56:42,700;"So it was there were down three."
56:42,700;56:44,620;"The Eagles are down three at home."
56:44,620;56:49,980;"It's a minute twelve left and it was fourth and twenty six and they convert it to Freddie"
56:49,980;56:50,980;"Mitchell."
56:50,980;56:55,660;"They tie it go to overtime and then you guys will love this."
56:55,660;57:00,080;"Brett Favre throws an absolutely horrendous overtime"
57:00,080;57:04,400;"intersection. Like he like he like punts it to Brian Dawkins who"
57:04,400;57:08,480;"returns it to like the Packers 40 are the kick a field goal"
57:08,480;57:10,380;"game over packer season."
57:10,380;57:16,840;"Oh, I remember that because remember, like NFL 2K came out"
57:16,840;57:20,360;"around this time. Remember those games for the Dreamcast?"
57:20,360;57:24,320;"Yeah. And they used to do like the situations. And this was one"
57:24,320;57:25,240;"that they put in the game."
57:25,240;57:26,600;"And it was like the hardest one to do"
57:26,600;57:28,480;"because it was fourth and 26."
57:28,480;57:30,880;"And you're playing with the fucking Eagles."
57:30,880;57:33,160;"And it's such a hard time completing that task."
57:33,160;57:36,160;"Not an easy one to do."
57:36,160;57:39,200;"- Yeah, so this is the Eagles third straight trip"
57:39,200;57:40,880;"to the NFC title game."
57:40,880;57:42,200;"- Yep, they would make fours."
57:42,200;57:43,320;"- And Andrew Donovan McNabb."
57:43,320;57:44,160;"- Yep, yeah."
57:44,160;57:49,040;"- And then meeting them there will be the Carolina Panthers"
57:49,040;57:50,600;"who beat the Rams."
57:50,600;57:51,440;"- Oh my God."
57:51,440;57:52,280;"- This was going on."
57:52,280;57:53,400;"- But they kept showing the highlights of it"
57:53,400;57:54,880;"this game had already happened."
57:54,880;57:57,380;"Yeah, this game was--"
57:57,380;58:02,800;"I watched like the condensed game."
58:02,800;58:03,800;"Yeah."
58:03,800;58:06,840;"It was absolute insanity."
58:06,840;58:08,380;"Yeah."
58:08,380;58:11,920;"This is the tail end of the Rams' greatest show on turf."
58:11,920;58:13,560;"So it's actually not Kurt Warner anymore."
58:13,560;58:15,360;"This is Mark Poldger."
58:15,360;58:18,480;"They still got Mike Marts."
58:18,480;58:20,880;"They got Bruce, Tori Holt,"
58:20,880;58:24,080;"led the NFL in receiving yards."
58:24,080;58:25,440;"They still have Marshall Falls."
58:25,440;58:29,080;"So this is still very much the greatest show on turf."
58:29,080;58:30,560;"- Yep."
58:30,560;58:32,720;"- They're the huge favorites at home."
58:32,720;58:34,760;"Yeah, against Jake D'Alone,"
58:34,760;58:38,840;"Mushin Muhammad and Steve Smith."
58:38,840;58:40,760;"- And who was there running back too?"
58:40,760;58:42,240;"'Cause it was a rookie running back,"
58:42,240;58:43,160;"'cause the other guy got hurt,"
58:43,160;58:45,160;"'cause it was Steven Davis, but he got hurt."
58:45,160;58:47,800;"- Steven Davis and then Deshawn Foster."
58:47,800;58:49,120;"Yeah, that's what it is."
58:49,120;58:50,120;"Yeah."
58:50,120;58:51,120;"Got from UCLA."
58:51,120;58:52,120;"Yeah."
58:52,120;58:56,880;"So the regular, like the most of the game was pretty cagey."
58:56,880;59:01,240;"There was like a shit ton of field goals, a lot of missed opportunities."
59:01,240;59:06,000;"But basically it gets to two and a half minutes left in the fourth quarter."
59:06,000;59:10,040;"The Rams have kicked five field goals."
59:10,040;59:13,080;"So they're down 11 with 239 left."
59:13,080;59:14,560;"Oh my God."
59:14,560;59:18,920;"they stormed down, they scored touchdown,"
59:18,920;59:21,520;"get the two-point conversion."
59:21,520;59:23,040;"- Two-point conversion, yeah."
59:23,040;59:25,120;"- Kickin' on-sized kick, Jeff Wilkins"
59:25,120;59:27,680;"recovers his own on-sized kick."
59:27,680;59:29,440;"- Hell yeah, Jeff Wilkins."
59:29,440;59:32,120;"After kicking five field goals, I already missed kick."
59:32,120;59:33,520;"- Yeah, yeah."
59:33,520;59:34,960;"- He kicks five field goals."
59:34,960;59:37,000;"Recover's his own on-sized kick."
59:37,000;59:40,200;"Oh yeah, he kicked four up to that point."
59:40,200;59:41,040;"- Oh, okay."
59:41,040;59:47,040;"Okay. So then they, um, they marched down with like, they have like, it's a two minute"
59:47,040;59:52,560;"warning. They're on like the 30 yard line and Mike Marks for some reason plays for overtime."
59:52,560;59:58,240;"They have like the number one and offense in the NFL and he's like, no, they like run it three"
59:58,240;01:00:03,840;"times. Just close the touchdown. Kick a field goal. They like burn a minute and a half off the"
01:00:03,840;01:00:05,280;"the clock on purpose."
01:00:05,280;01:00:06,120;"- Jeez."
01:00:06,120;01:00:08,240;"- Didn't make any sense."
01:00:08,240;01:00:11,200;"So they kicked the field goal, tied the game,"
01:00:11,200;01:00:12,520;"go to overtime."
01:00:12,520;01:00:17,000;"And both teams have like,"
01:00:17,000;01:00:20,420;"get it into the opponent's territory twice."
01:00:20,420;01:00:22,200;"(laughs)"
01:00:22,200;01:00:25,440;"Jeff Wilkins, after going five for five in regulation,"
01:00:25,440;01:00:27,680;"misses a 54 yard field goal."
01:00:27,680;01:00:30,120;"- I mean, that's a long one, but still."
01:00:30,120;01:00:31,200;"- Yeah, come on, man."
01:00:31,200;01:00:35,800;"the the the panthers marched down to like that"
01:00:35,800;01:00:41,680;"33 yard line. Kick a field goal. It's good. They had a delay a game."
01:00:41,680;01:00:43,880;"Oh, I get up five yards."
01:00:43,880;01:00:49,560;"The second one miss it. John Casey, who I think we'll see later."
01:00:49,560;01:00:55,400;"John Casey, who had you went three for three up and you missed one to when"
01:00:55,400;01:00:59,120;"they're up 11 to hit the upright when they're up 11."
01:00:59,120;01:01:00,720;"Oh, I would have had a 14."
01:01:00,720;01:01:06,720;"So, so then the Rams get the ball back and they're driving."
01:01:06,720;01:01:11,720;"They're like in Panthers territory late first overtime."
01:01:11,720;01:01:12,720;"They throw a pass."
01:01:12,720;01:01:17,720;"It gets picked off by Manning who like tears it away from Tory Hall."
01:01:17,720;01:01:21,720;"So they pick it off at their own 39."
01:01:21,720;01:01:24,720;"So they were like almost in field goal territory."
01:01:24,720;01:01:29,720;"And then the very first play of second overtime."
01:01:29,720;01:01:36,720;"like a deep slant to or post-rata Steve Smith and he just house call."
01:01:36,720;01:01:43,120;"See you later. Jason Seahorn just gets towards the last remaining white defensive back."
01:01:43,120;01:01:43,620;"[laughter]"
01:01:43,620;01:01:46,120;"And his career on that play."
01:01:46,120;01:01:46,120;"[laughter]"
01:01:46,120;01:01:49,120;"Jason Seahorn's 69 yards down the field."
01:01:49,120;01:01:49,920;"Yeah."
01:01:49,920;01:01:56,220;"And the Panthers walk off the 10 to 13 game home winning streak for the Rams."
01:01:56,220;01:01:57,220;"Wow."
01:01:57,220;01:02:09,220;"Rams are done this like no one team with Jake the Lomes starting a quarterback makes the NFC conference game end of the dynasty you would say for the the Rams."
01:02:09,220;01:02:15,220;"That's the end of the greatest show in turf. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think they were ever the same."
01:02:15,220;01:02:24,220;"Just an absolute crazy game like it could have been one on like six different plays that didn't go there. Yeah."
01:02:24,220;01:02:27,580;"It's not over time. No one scored. Like they put a whole overtime."
01:02:27,580;01:02:28,540;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:02:28,540;01:02:29,500;"The entire quarter."
01:02:29,500;01:02:30,540;"Yeah."
01:02:30,540;01:02:34,780;"Yeah. And then literally the first play of second overtime."
01:02:34,780;01:02:41,180;"And it wasn't even like a cagey, like defensive, like, yeah, no one scored because like the defensive"
01:02:41,180;01:02:46,300;"point, the defense were playing terrible. They just like got lucky on these like missed field goals"
01:02:46,300;01:02:51,740;"or like interceptions. Like it was just insanity. Absolutely brutal. Yeah."
01:02:52,700;01:02:59,500;"And I'll see if I can find a screenshot of Mike Martz's face when they missed that"
01:02:59,500;01:03:02,540;"field goal after the penalty where he just did this."
01:03:02,540;01:03:05,980;"Like he did like a little kid in a thing where he like puts his hands over his mouth."
01:03:05,980;01:03:07,500;"I was like, oh my God."
01:03:07,500;01:03:15,420;"It's just like a child like reaction of like, I'm so excited."
01:03:22,460;01:03:25,860;"But he was getting a ton of criticism after the game,"
01:03:25,860;01:03:29,420;"especially because he didn't try and go for it."
01:03:29,420;01:03:31,260;"He played to the end of regulation."
01:03:31,260;01:03:33,140;"Yeah, with the best offense in the NFL."
01:03:33,140;01:03:33,900;"Yeah."
01:03:33,900;01:03:35,260;"And now where is he right?"
01:03:35,260;01:03:35,980;"Yeah."
01:03:35,980;01:03:38,740;"Typical Mike Martz."
01:03:38,740;01:03:40,220;"More like Mike Farts."
01:03:40,220;01:03:41,940;"Oh, shit."
01:03:41,940;01:03:44,020;"Mike Farts in his fans."
01:03:44,020;01:03:45,420;"We all do best or worse?"
01:03:45,420;01:03:46,180;"Best and worse."
01:03:46,180;01:03:46,940;"Yeah, Steve."
01:03:46,940;01:03:50,140;"What do you got?"
01:03:50,140;01:03:52,260;"I was just going to start with the best of the best."
01:03:52,260;01:03:54,940;"Troy Brown fourth and three conversion."
01:03:54,940;01:03:57,700;"Yeah, Troy Brown for three."
01:03:57,700;01:04:02,500;"Oh, four, three."
01:04:02,500;01:04:03,260;"I got it."
01:04:03,260;01:04:04,260;"On fourth down."
01:04:04,260;01:04:05,700;"Got it."
01:04:05,700;01:04:06,020;"Mm."
01:04:06,020;01:04:07,060;"Troy Brown clutch."
01:04:07,060;01:04:10,340;"And you didn't, you didn't really have like any other."
01:04:10,340;01:04:14,020;"I think it was a second, but yeah, he had like one other."
01:04:14,020;01:04:15,820;"That was like a screenplay that didn't go anywhere."
01:04:17,460;01:04:21,220;"But I mean, that that was kind of this offense too."
01:04:21,220;01:04:25,180;"Like they showed the the stat of like the past distribution."
01:04:25,180;01:04:30,060;"And then they won two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight guys on this list."
01:04:30,060;01:04:32,540;"For a leads it with three catches."
01:04:32,540;01:04:34,900;"Johnson, Bethel Johnson has two catches."
01:04:34,900;01:04:36,100;"Everybody else has one."
01:04:36,100;01:04:38,180;"Teacher award is in there getting the next."
01:04:38,180;01:04:39,020;"Teacher award."
01:04:39,020;01:04:39,260;"Yeah."
01:04:39,260;01:04:42,260;"Kevin fall, Gibbons Brown, Larry centers."
01:04:42,260;01:04:43,860;"Dion branch, one catch."
01:04:43,860;01:04:45,860;"I had another sneaky best."
01:04:45,860;01:04:47,260;"All right."
01:04:47,260;01:04:51,220;"that tank Williams has his whole name on his jersey."
01:04:51,220;01:04:53,060;"That's pretty good."
01:04:53,060;01:04:57,180;"I mean, so she's tanked."
01:04:57,180;01:05:03,300;"Well, if my name was tank anything, you damn well better be sure that name."
01:05:03,300;01:05:07,820;"They had like two T Williams on the team and they're like, well, we have two T Williams."
01:05:07,820;01:05:11,260;"We'll just put like a tank's name is only four letters long anyways."
01:05:11,260;01:05:12,260;"Stat check."
01:05:12,260;01:05:13,260;"That's my gas."
01:05:13,260;01:05:14,260;"Tennessee Titans."
01:05:14,260;01:05:15,660;"I think he is the only one."
01:05:15,660;01:05:17,260;"I'm looking at the roster right now."
01:05:17,260;01:05:20,960;"And this is one on offense."
01:05:20,960;01:05:23,060;"You'll see."
01:05:23,060;01:05:24,660;"Albert Haynes or a shout out."
01:05:24,660;01:05:26,760;"Shadow Albert Haynes or when you're still trying."
01:05:26,760;01:05:27,060;"Yeah."
01:05:27,060;01:05:27,560;"Who knew?"
01:05:27,560;01:05:28,260;"A second year."
01:05:28,260;01:05:29,660;"I see no other."
01:05:29,660;01:05:32,060;"The worst was the."
01:05:32,060;01:05:35,960;"Pick six for Teddy Buski that was false start."
01:05:35,960;01:05:37,660;"That was rough."
01:05:37,660;01:05:41,460;"It was a quick like a throw on a hot throw from Macnav."
01:05:41,460;01:05:42,360;"It's catching throw it."
01:05:42,360;01:05:42,760;"Yeah."
01:05:42,760;01:05:43,360;"Buski had it."
01:05:43,360;01:05:45,940;"but they you couldn't hear the false start so loud."
01:05:45,940;01:05:48,900;"Brozier had it and with nobody near him,"
01:05:48,900;01:05:51,140;"just like yards of green in front of him."
01:05:51,140;01:05:53,140;"It would have been a big such that."
01:05:53,140;01:05:56,880;"And I think that ended up with."
01:05:56,880;01:06:01,380;"Yeah, that that was the the tying touchdown too."
01:06:01,380;01:06:03,680;"The tight is going to score here."
01:06:03,680;01:06:06,820;"Yeah, on that huge swing, 14 points swing."
01:06:06,820;01:06:07,580;"Yeah."
01:06:07,580;01:06:09,080;"Tough."
01:06:09,080;01:06:11,460;"Greg, that's some worst."
01:06:11,460;01:06:12,660;"What do you got?"
01:06:12,660;01:06:20,700;"Okay. The worst. I'm going to say the over"
01:06:20,700;01:06:23,660;"under negatives. Always looking for the negatives first."
01:06:23,660;01:06:29,420;"Such a pessimist. The over under on the skin was a 34."
01:06:29,420;01:06:34,180;"Like imagine that in the modern NFL."
01:06:34,180;01:06:36,500;"They don't know what they're going to be under."
01:06:36,500;01:06:41,380;"Yeah. No shit. Imagine hitting the under 34 over."
01:06:41,460;01:06:44,460;"It was like, I guess, yeah."
01:06:44,460;01:06:46,180;"So that's the worst."
01:06:46,180;01:06:52,420;"These teams are like past first teams, which is like kind of the new thing in the NFL at this point."
01:06:52,420;01:06:55,260;"Like the pages came out in five wide pretty much the whole game."
01:06:55,260;01:06:56,620;"Past."
01:06:56,620;01:06:57,420;"He was just so good."
01:06:57,420;01:06:57,780;"Packed on."
01:06:57,780;01:06:58,020;"No."
01:06:58,020;01:06:59,220;"Yeah, that's true."
01:06:59,220;01:07:01,100;"I'm Brady through it 41 times."
01:07:01,100;01:07:03,300;"So he wasn't particularly."
01:07:03,300;01:07:04,100;"Yeah, that's crazy."
01:07:04,100;01:07:05,740;"That's a lot of times though."
01:07:05,740;01:07:07,420;"Yeah, because they had no run game."
01:07:07,420;01:07:08,700;"It's true."
01:07:08,700;01:07:10,820;"I mean, I have a couple of good carries, but that's it."
01:07:11,020;01:07:15,220;"Antoine Renwell, I thought the Patriots had 27 carries for 90."
01:07:15,220;01:07:16,940;"He did run well."
01:07:16,940;01:07:18,020;"He was doing pretty good."
01:07:18,020;01:07:19,420;"Then he got hurt on that play."
01:07:19,420;01:07:25,500;"He did one more carry and that was a 16 carry 69 yards touchdown longest of 17."
01:07:25,500;01:07:26,100;"Not bad."
01:07:26,100;01:07:26,900;"All right."
01:07:26,900;01:07:30,620;"So for my best, I'm doing a preemptive vest."
01:07:30,620;01:07:39,460;"OK, for next week, because just giving one best to Tyler for next week."
01:07:39,460;01:07:42,220;"He's not nearly enough."
01:07:42,220;01:07:45,420;"He's at least two best."
01:07:45,420;01:07:47,660;"Maybe even a preemptive"
01:07:47,660;01:07:50,500;"dialogue best for a"
01:07:50,500;01:07:51,500;"C conference game."
01:07:51,500;01:07:53,980;"I can't fucking wait to"
01:07:53,980;01:07:55,580;"rewatch this game because I"
01:07:55,580;01:07:56,820;"fucking love Taiwan."
01:07:56,820;01:07:59,060;"It's true."
01:07:59,060;01:08:00,460;"This is definitely his best game."
01:08:00,460;01:08:01,540;"The event."
01:08:01,540;01:08:01,980;"Yeah."
01:08:01,980;01:08:02,980;"Legendary game."
01:08:02,980;01:08:03,980;"One of the all-time games."
01:08:03,980;01:08:04,420;"Very cool."
01:08:04,420;01:08:04,980;"Yeah."
01:08:04,980;01:08:05,500;"Yeah."
01:08:05,500;01:08:07,420;"All right."
01:08:07,420;01:08:08,420;"My best."
01:08:09,260;01:08:16,700;"see we in this house we do best first is Tom Brady still has not thrown an"
01:08:16,700;01:08:19,420;"interception at home. I mean through another touchdown saying he's eight"
01:08:19,420;01:08:23,020;"touchdowns zero interceptions at home which is crazy considering he's thrown"
01:08:23,020;01:08:30,460;"12 interceptions on the season. So every single"
01:08:30,460;01:08:35,100;"exception has come on the road all 12 he's unflappable at home. Yeah,"
01:08:35,100;01:08:41,260;"Unflappable. So luckily they're playing at home next week. Unflappable. Unflappable."
01:08:41,260;01:08:45,660;"Un... Well, I don't think he's unfappable. Well, unfappable. He's a good-looking man."
01:08:45,660;01:08:51,900;"Do you care to explain that to Mom? Who's listening? No, we'll just say..."
01:08:51,900;01:08:53,660;"Sometimes a naughty boy."
01:08:53,660;01:09:04,940;"What is it? Very naughty. I apologize, Mom. I'm sorry. Trust me, Mom. You don't want to know."
01:09:04,940;01:09:06,940;"Do not Google that."
01:09:06,940;01:09:12,220;"My words."
01:09:12,220;01:09:17,340;"I remember going up to mom and being like, ""Hey mom, what's a wanker?"""
01:09:17,340;01:09:23,300;"She's like, ""Someone who masturbates a lot and I never say that again."""
01:09:23,300;01:09:25,560;"(laughing)"
01:09:25,560;01:09:37,660;"- I did it on the silver, but it was,"
01:09:37,660;01:09:38,660;"what's the word for it?"
01:09:38,660;01:09:39,500;"- Yeah."
01:09:39,500;01:09:42,460;"- The one who fucks animals,"
01:09:42,460;01:09:44,700;"what's that word that the English use all the time?"
01:09:44,700;01:09:45,540;"- Bugger?"
01:09:45,540;01:09:46,980;"- Bugger, yeah."
01:09:46,980;01:09:48,820;"- I asked dad what bugger is."
01:09:48,820;01:09:49,860;"Like, why do you call everybody a bug?"
01:09:49,860;01:09:51,180;"What does that mean?"
01:09:51,180;01:09:56,860;"Well, technically it means somebody who has sex with animals, so don't say it."
01:09:56,860;01:10:03,100;"Oh, don't tell me that."
01:10:03,100;01:10:08,580;"That takes on a different meaning than the way you use it."
01:10:08,580;01:10:17,220;"My worst in this game was I think the way that the"
01:10:18,340;01:10:23,140;"commentating team built up Craig Hentrick, the Titans punters,"
01:10:23,140;01:10:25,620;"knuckleball punch that he does."
01:10:25,620;01:10:29,180;"Only sometimes, but it's impossible to catch."
01:10:29,180;01:10:31,780;"And so they were waiting from, do, waiting for him to do it."
01:10:31,780;01:10:32,620;"And then he finally did it."
01:10:32,620;01:10:36,060;"And I was a net punt of 14 yards."
01:10:36,060;01:10:40,180;"So a whole 14 year it knuckled when he kicked it."
01:10:40,180;01:10:42,660;"Yeah, he just kicked it and it didn't, it didn't rotate."
01:10:42,660;01:10:46,420;"So it was like hung in the air and the pages was like, they, they didn't return it,"
01:10:46,500;01:10:49,660;"but it hit in about 15 yards backwards towards them."
01:10:49,660;01:10:51,700;"So it was a net pun of 14 yards."
01:10:51,700;01:10:52,500;"Yeah."
01:10:52,500;01:10:53,700;"Knuckleball."
01:10:53,700;01:10:54,660;"I thought it was a good pun."
01:10:54,660;01:10:56,940;"The pun itself was great, but just the whole like..."
01:10:56,940;01:10:59,660;"You see a punt like a knuckleball just dropping."
01:10:59,660;01:11:00,500;"Like it was spinning."
01:11:00,500;01:11:01,300;"Yeah."
01:11:01,300;01:11:04,860;"But the whole build up of it, like, oh, he's gonna do his video."
01:11:04,860;01:11:05,940;"Knuckle. And then he does it."
01:11:05,940;01:11:07,580;"And it's like, it's a fun..."
01:11:07,580;01:11:08,060;"I thought it was good."
01:11:08,060;01:11:09,380;"It was a bounce, funky, you know?"
01:11:09,380;01:11:10,420;"It's got a bad bounce."
01:11:10,420;01:11:12,460;"Yeah, it's, I mean, asked him Wakefield."
01:11:12,460;01:11:13,060;"That's what happens."
01:11:13,060;01:11:14,580;"It's all about the weather when it's knuckleball."
01:11:14,580;01:11:16,260;"I have another worst Andy."
01:11:16,260;01:11:21,380;"Good when you told Greg in this house we do best first. Yeah damn right"
01:11:21,380;01:11:25,780;"You're the most negative person in the world"
01:11:25,780;01:11:31,820;"You hate everything and everybody except for the Patriots. Yeah, so when it comes to the Patriots. We do best first"
01:11:31,820;01:11:34,820;"In this house we're positive"
01:11:34,820;01:11:43,020;"Well on that note, what's next week Greg?"
01:11:44,220;01:11:48,260;"Next week the immovable object versus the"
01:11:48,260;01:11:51,520;"Unresistible force unstoppable force"
01:11:51,520;01:11:54,260;"Yeah, nailed it the the"
01:11:54,260;01:11:58,520;"Peyton Manning Marvin Harris and Edger and James Reggie Wayne"
01:11:58,520;01:12:01,260;"Colts"
01:12:01,260;01:12:05,180;"New England this game must have been so fucking hyped"
01:12:05,180;01:12:11,500;"Oh, yeah, it was just like this is just such a fucking cool matchup because they're like completely different teams"
01:12:11,500;01:12:15,960;"Yeah, and both like the best units in the NFL at their own"
01:12:15,960;01:12:18,300;"defense"
01:12:18,300;01:12:21,460;"Yeah, the game that they play in the regular season was an absolute classic"
01:12:21,460;01:12:29,200;"And now we get to do it again in New England. There's snow in the four gas"
01:12:29,200;01:12:34,980;"Dude, I'm hyped who was favored in this game. Do you think"
01:12:34,980;01:12:37,860;"Colts pop quiz"
01:12:40,300;01:12:43,620;"Pads by three. Pads by three and a half. Oh"
01:12:43,620;01:12:45,520;"surprising"
01:12:45,520;01:12:47,320;"Yeah, so"
01:12:47,320;01:12:51,720;"Toss up but give past three for home till advantage three and a half because of snow and"
01:12:51,720;01:12:56,280;"50% chance of snow 100% chance of a good football game"
01:12:56,280;01:12:58,840;"so"
01:12:58,840;01:13:04,260;"If you have any comments if if you're our mother and you want to talk about things that are very naughty"
01:13:04,260;01:13:07,400;"You can"

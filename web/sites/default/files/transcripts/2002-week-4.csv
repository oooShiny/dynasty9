00:00,000;00:06,840;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,840;00:08,280;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,280;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:13,920;"they're just being stupid."
00:13,920;00:15,560;"But you still want to listen?"
00:15,560;00:16,560;"Go right ahead."
00:16,560;00:18,400;"I am not your mother."
00:18,400;00:26,800;"Back to the Peach's Diesie Podcast."
00:26,800;00:31,400;"My self Andrew Brown and with me today is my brother who's doing his best."
00:31,400;00:33,640;"Um, Bill Coward impression."
00:33,640;00:35,480;"I'd say Steven."
00:35,480;00:39,040;"I don't know if we're going to post a video with this, but I could, I could maybe"
00:39,040;00:40,360;"post a screenshot of that face."
00:40,360;00:45,000;"No, no, it was all chin and all mustache."
00:45,000;00:48,600;"That was very Jesus and all teeth now."
00:48,600;00:49,840;"Great shot and high."
00:49,840;00:52,080;"That was a shot in high."
00:52,080;00:52,920;"Mm."
00:52,920;00:55,440;"No, no, who, who do we say did that face?"
00:55,560;00:57,880;"The other way. Right now."
00:57,880;00:58,680;"The Chiefs."
00:58,680;00:59,640;"The Chiefs."
00:59,640;01:04,080;"Oh, I have it in my notes."
01:04,080;01:07,320;"David Lee is talking about this last week."
01:07,320;01:09,560;"We did. Yeah, I've already forgotten because fuck it."
01:09,560;01:12,240;"Dick Vermeel."
01:12,240;01:14,200;"Yes, that's who it was."
01:14,200;01:15,760;"All guns."
01:15,760;01:16,560;"Squint city."
01:16,560;01:17,880;"Yeah, squint city."
01:17,880;01:18,720;"That's right."
01:18,720;01:22,240;"Go to the Lord."
01:22,240;01:24,080;"So it's just the two of us right now."
01:24,080;01:28,240;"Greg is dealing with storm issues. Apparently, North Carolina has never had a storm before,"
01:28,240;01:29,080;"so they lost power."
01:29,080;01:31,600;"No, it's hurricanes."
01:31,600;01:37,440;"Yeah, and Connor is apparently golfing, so he'll be here at some point."
01:37,440;01:42,000;"They have a special guest joining us later anyway, so we'll see who actually shows up for this"
01:42,000;01:46,120;"episode. But right now it's the two, the two work horses anyway."
01:46,120;01:51,600;"The ones who actually watched a game, me and Steve Brown. So Steve, when you're done playing"
01:51,600;01:55,320;"with your hair, you can let me know what you thought of this game."
01:55,320;01:58,000;"Well, we should probably pick like, you know, who's the real"
01:58,000;01:59,520;"workhorse is of the Patriots."
01:59,520;02:04,200;"I'm going to go for Mike Raibel because he catches his first touchdown in this game."
02:04,200;02:06,120;"Ooh, nicely done."
02:06,120;02:09,480;"Um, workhorse is the Patriots."
02:09,480;02:10,520;"I caught me off guard."
02:10,520;02:18,120;"I would say in this game, I would actually say kind of anybody on the offensive line"
02:19,040;02:27,760;"because this was the top ranked defense in the NFL this year in the charges coming to town."
02:27,760;02:30,280;"Yeah, they mentioned it a bunch of times."
02:30,280;02:37,600;"There was some stat where when the Patriots in the first quarter got into the red zone"
02:37,600;02:42,600;"and scored touchdown, it was the fourth time the opponent has actually entered the red"
02:42,600;02:48,160;"zone the entire season and the first touchdown given up in the red zone by the Chargers in"
02:48,160;02:50,720;"week four, which is pretty fucking impressive."
02:50,720;02:52,640;"- I don't know, just 'cause they didn't play crappy people"
02:52,640;02:53,480;"at that point."
02:53,480;02:56,480;"- I think that was probably part of this point."
02:56,480;02:57,920;"- You're saying charges were like untested,"
02:57,920;03:00,120;"you're three and all of a sudden."
03:00,120;03:01,640;"- Right, right, right, right, yeah."
03:01,640;03:05,320;"And the Patriots had been world beaters,"
03:05,320;03:08,400;"so this was a test for these chargers."
03:08,400;03:10,600;"But yeah, so I mean, speaking of these charges,"
03:10,600;03:13,440;"we're good for go back, and we look at them,"
03:13,440;03:17,880;"'cause usually we have Greg here to do the teams,"
03:17,880;03:21,540;"But this charge is actually kind of a loaded team"
03:21,540;03:23,200;"if you look at it."
03:23,200;03:25,020;"And having said all that,"
03:25,020;03:27,640;"they started three and oh beat the Patriots this week,"
03:27,640;03:28,540;"spoiler alert."
03:28,540;03:33,360;"And so they started the season four and oh,"
03:33,360;03:34,880;"how do you think they finished the round?"
03:34,880;03:35,720;"You think they made the playoffs?"
03:35,720;03:37,040;"- Four and 12."
03:37,040;03:39,080;"(laughs)"
03:39,080;03:41,120;"- I appreciate your optimism, but no."
03:41,120;03:45,000;"- Well, like that LT, say how Rodney."
03:45,000;03:46,840;"- Drew Brees, quarterback."
03:46,840;03:50,920;"young Drew Brees. It was a second year. I think so. Yeah."
03:50,920;03:53,440;"This is first year actually starting because Doug Fluge started last year."
03:53,440;03:57,160;"Seasonally when you're behind Brady. Yeah."
03:57,160;04:01,800;"The Chargers would go eight and eight this season. Really?"
04:01,800;04:05,040;"It was not a good season. It started off really well."
04:05,040;04:10,560;"They won these first four games and actually they were at the buy."
04:10,560;04:14,960;"They were six and one and they had their buy and then they lost."
04:15,360;04:18,000;"They won two more games the rest of the season."
04:18,000;04:20,360;"They had a two game losing streak."
04:20,360;04:21,200;"- What?"
04:21,200;04:22,040;"- And then, yeah."
04:22,040;04:25,440;"Yeah, they were six in one at the buy"
04:25,440;04:27,280;"and then they came back week nine"
04:27,280;04:28,840;"and just forgot how to win."
04:28,840;04:31,440;"Both their wins are just getting over."
04:31,440;04:33,800;"- So like, beepers or are they just getting like?"
04:33,800;04:36,000;"- So let's see, the first game after the buy,"
04:36,000;04:38,520;"they lost 44, 13 to the Jets."
04:38,520;04:40,280;"The same just, the game blew the fuck off."
04:40,280;04:41,280;"- Yeah, it's a small beep."
04:41,280;04:42,920;"- Yeah, she's."
04:42,920;04:45,040;"- Lost a close one to the Rams."
04:45,040;04:46,440;"Beat the Niners in overtime."
04:46,440;04:50,480;"Uh, got blown out by the dolphins 30 to three."
04:50,480;04:55,720;"Beat the Broncos in overtime and then lost to the Raiders,"
04:55,720;04:58,240;"bills, chiefs and Seahawks to end the season."
04:58,240;05:01,880;"Wait, wait, so they lost to the entire AFC East."
05:01,880;05:03,080;"Except the high."
05:03,080;05:03,920;"Yeah."
05:03,920;05:04,420;"What?"
05:04,420;05:09,080;"Which even more baffling, they, they announced a stat that, uh,"
05:09,080;05:13,360;"the Patriots had won the last 10 straight games against the Chargers."
05:13,360;05:14,080;"Yeah."
05:14,240;05:18,880;"up until this. And they had one and the pages of one 12 games in a row up until this. So"
05:18,880;05:26,720;"it was one of those things. But yeah, it was, uh, I'm not sure what happened. It don't see any"
05:26,720;05:33,520;"injuries anywhere or anything in terms of shot. I was coach, right? Yeah. Who's a really good."
05:33,520;05:39,440;"We did. Yeah. And shot and high is a really good, um,"
05:40,880;05:42,240;"You're really a regular season coach."
05:42,240;05:45,360;"He struggles in the playoffs, which I think is pretty well documented."
05:45,360;05:54,560;"Breeze had, let's see, 3,200 yards, 17 touchdowns, 16 interceptions went up."
05:54,560;05:56,720;"Bad. What kind of mediocre?"
05:56,720;05:58,720;"That was okay for back then, yeah."
05:58,720;06:02,800;"Yeah, LT ran for 1600 yards, which is pretty reasonable."
06:02,800;06:03,760;"Second year, yeah."
06:03,760;06:07,040;"So this is one of his, like, I mean, he did good as rookie years."
06:07,040;06:10,640;"I think this is his first year where he stabs himself as like an elite back."
06:10,640;06:16,560;"Yeah, this is his breakout year exactly super good in this game to I fucking hate LT, but we'll cover"
06:16,560;06:20,400;"Oh, we'll definitely get to that real quick"
06:20,400;06:22,960;"but yeah, no they were"
06:22,960;06:27,200;"Kind of mill a road in both offense and defense surprisingly"
06:27,200;06:33,000;"I don't know they gave up like a shit ton of points down down kind of the second half of the season"
06:33,000;06:36,640;"So I don't know what shifted because they were really good in the first half"
06:36,640;06:39,480;"Because in those first four games they gave up"
06:40,320;06:44,520;"six, three, 15 and 14 points and that 14 was CR and Patriots."
06:44,520;06:49,520;"But after that, it kind of the wheels fell off and they started giving up."
06:49,520;06:55,000;"But we'll say how and Harrison both got like hurt in this game, not like knocked"
06:55,000;06:56,320;"them out of the game hurt, but."
06:56,320;06:57,400;"Yeah."
06:57,400;06:59,440;"And I think they came in hurt too."
06:59,440;07:02,440;"Like they were talking about how I think it was Rodney Harrison."
07:02,440;07:07,960;"Like had struggled in practice the week before, but still decided to play and like did a"
07:07,960;07:08,760;"good job, I thought."
07:10,040;07:12,040;"But, uh, yeah, they're both really good."
07:12,040;07:15,840;"Yeah, but both both of them say, oh, and Harrison made the"
07:15,840;07:16,360;"pro bowl."
07:16,360;07:21,680;"Um, no, sorry, uh, say I did and Donnie Edwards, the linebacker as"
07:21,680;07:21,920;"well."
07:21,920;07:25,440;"Those two linebackers made the pro bowl, but Rodney also"
07:25,440;07:25,580;"L."
07:25,580;07:26,360;"T made the pro bowl."
07:26,360;07:31,960;"So they had a decent team going in and then Tim Dwight."
07:31,960;07:33,480;"Right."
07:33,480;07:38,740;"The original, well, maybe not the original white, gutty wide"
07:38,740;07:43,300;"see right that might go to um what's the name of the Jets winker bet winker bet I"
07:43,300;07:48,020;"did I hate the Jets but I do like winker bet I have a"
07:48,020;07:51,060;"but grudging respect for winker bet I think just like I do for a pit"
07:51,060;07:57,780;"and I love this thing yeah he was no good and he would take so many shots"
07:57,780;08:00,660;"going across the middle and he'd get like concussions all the time but he'd"
08:00,660;08:05,060;"still keep playing he was like yeah he was one of those guys you hate you"
08:05,060;08:09,860;"You didn't really hate you, but grudgingly accepted that he was good, but you weren't a huge fan of him."
08:09,860;08:10,660;"Life was on your team."
08:10,660;08:13,860;"Probably similar to like, Say-How and Ronnie Harrison."
08:13,860;08:15,860;"I don't know how you can hate Rodney. Come on."
08:15,860;08:21,140;"He would play kind of just outside the whistle."
08:21,140;08:24,020;"I know, I saw him with a ton of butt slaps to the Peach's players."
08:24,020;08:27,220;"Yeah, usually after trying to take their fucking heads off."
08:27,220;08:30,340;"Probably as soon as he's done, he's smacking ass."
08:30,340;08:31,220;"Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
08:31,220;08:34,660;"And that's how I like to think I play recreational soccer."
08:34,660;08:36,660;"just inside the lines."
08:36,660;08:40,660;"You play poorly, Andy. You just play poorly."
08:40,660;08:44,660;"No, I just, I just hacked people who try to go by me and then slap them on the butts"
08:44,660;08:46,660;"when they're picking themselves off the ground."
08:46,660;08:49,660;"What else would you get to be better than me?"
08:49,660;08:55,660;"For the San Diego Chargers quarterback room, I think this year,"
08:55,660;08:57,660;"Breeze, Rivers and Flutey."
08:57,660;08:59,660;"Breeze was there, Flutey was there."
08:59,660;09:00,660;"I was there too?"
09:00,660;09:03,660;"I'm pretty sure they mentioned it."
09:03,660;09:05,660;"Great question."
09:05,660;09:09,600;"I'll see his name on here."
09:09,600;09:12,120;"If he did, he never threw a pass."
09:12,120;09:15,360;"Let's check the Ross there real quick."
09:15,360;09:17,360;"That's true. We do need a stack guy."
09:17,360;09:20,760;"We do. Alright, so here we go."
09:20,760;09:25,160;"Position, quarterback, Drew Brees."
09:25,160;09:28,760;"Nice other guys have Doug Flute."
09:28,760;09:31,060;"Now he's 2004. How was your home?"
09:31,060;09:32,060;"I'm an idiot."
09:32,060;09:34,740;"Good effort though early two years off"
09:34,740;09:42,060;"I totally don't remember the whole I mean I remember the outcome of the Saints having both"
09:42,060;09:44,820;"Drew Brees and Philip Rivers and big which one do I want?"
09:44,820;09:52,300;"But I don't remember anything more than that. No, I thought what happened was Drew Brees got injured like severely and"
09:52,300;10:00,060;"So the Saints drafted not the Saints the charges drafted Philip Rivers and basically just cut Drew Brees loose"
10:00,260;10:03,480;"because you haven't been great and then I"
10:03,480;10:07,660;"Think it was the dolphins had their pick of Drew Brees or"
10:07,660;10:11,100;"Who is it on a quarterback?"
10:11,100;10:13,100;"I think Colpepper. Yes"
10:13,100;10:18,060;"Exhale, oh my goodness Ryan sir. What a great time to join"
10:18,060;10:21,140;"That is perfect"
10:21,140;10:26,580;"Nice to see you in your rock get on I'm gonna say homeless beard, but"
10:27,740;10:30,460;"This is an audio podcast so luckily for you"
10:30,460;10:45,460;"So this is the perfect time to introduce our special guest I thought that with the us getting to the longest"
10:45,460;10:47,620;"losing streak of the page's dynasty era"
10:47,620;10:51,200;"The perfect person to bring on was my friend"
10:51,200;10:57,160;"Ryan's story from my childhood friend our family friend the Ryan story"
10:57,160;10:59,160;"No did loser. Yeah"
10:59,160;11:04,860;"Well the reason I wanted to bring you on I think I told you this but I haven't told listeners yet is that"
11:04,860;11:08,880;"We have watched a handful of games together"
11:08,880;11:10,660;"and"
11:10,660;11:13,760;"The pages have not one that I think they've won one of them"
11:13,760;11:17,280;"And I was terrible bad fashion"
11:17,280;11:24,420;"I don't remember that what the outcome of that Texans game in like 2004. That was the one so let's see what we've watched"
11:25,320;11:29,060;"That was probably the oldest one and that was the one where the"
11:29,060;11:34,540;"The commentators kept talking about how Adam Minnateria has never missed indoors"
11:34,540;11:38,620;"And he has like four field goals and it went to overtime and then he finally hit one"
11:38,620;11:41,560;"But he was like one for five or something ridiculous"
11:41,560;11:49,220;"Yeah, first they ever watched and so that probably should have been a message and then we watched"
11:49,220;11:51,800;"a Cardinals game"
11:51,800;11:55,020;"Where the Cardinals came to you like earlier in the season?"
11:55,020;12:00,260;"And the the patients always is like a 30 yarder to win right?"
12:00,260;12:04,760;"Yeah, because the Cardinals had the ball and all they had to do was like run the clock out and they fumbled the"
12:04,760;12:09,360;"Patriots recovered it, but then we missed the field goal and they were down by two. Yeah, I was got a scout ski, right?"
12:09,360;12:14,540;"I think it might have been early got a skoski maybe yeah, or late winter. I don't remember"
12:14,540;12:17,780;"Yeah, it wasn't like 30 yards a short. Yeah"
12:17,780;12:22,780;"And then yeah, and then we watched the Jets playoff game. I"
12:23,780;12:26,680;"Came to your house without one that was exciting. Oh"
12:26,680;12:31,240;"The 2010 one I"
12:31,240;12:37,760;"Think yeah the one that they lost yeah, that was a horrible game. I didn't know you're here for that one"
12:37,760;12:41,800;"I don't remember a lot I came I"
12:41,800;12:46,320;"Knew people were here. I just didn't know"
12:46,320;12:51,340;"Yeah, I was one of those probably should have been I'm and I think our"
12:52,080;12:57,320;"Who to draw if you will was the last game we watched we actually both attended"
12:57,320;13:01,880;"You hold on hold on hold on you missed all the jets game that we watch at Feliches"
13:01,880;13:07,240;"Which are the jets game? We're Jerome Boga or whatever the hell his name is decided to make up that"
13:07,240;13:11,360;"Pushing the line rule. Oh, that's right in overtime"
13:11,360;13:16,080;"And so the Jets missed the winning field goal and they made up that bullshit call"
13:16,080;13:18,080;"And they hit it"
13:18,080;13:25,080;"No one in the world that heard of that call before that. That's true. And nobody's heard it since. Yeah, that was a special one. Yeah."
13:25,080;13:38,080;"And then, oh fuck Christ, there's even more games, even better. But then our crowning achievement, if you will, of loserdom."
13:38,080;13:40,080;"You actually follow the other."
13:40,080;13:48,480;"No, Ryan's story and I went to, we actually got tickets to and traveled to Gillette Stadium"
13:48,480;13:57,600;"and watched the Tennessee Titans beat the New England Patriots in Tom Brady's last game where his last throw was a pick six."
13:57,600;14:00,720;"Yeah, we saw history."
14:00,720;14:03,760;"We may have made history."
14:05,760;14:09,000;"I mean, that was definitely one of the worst games."
14:09,000;14:12,320;"I mean, we had fun, but definitely worst games."
14:12,320;14:13,120;"You could."
14:13,120;14:17,560;"I invented a game since '09 and that's the first one."
14:17,560;14:20,240;"And then, yeah, not great."
14:20,240;14:21,080;"But what are you going to do?"
14:21,080;14:24,720;"So yeah, and they don't lose when you watch the game or I watch the game."
14:24,720;14:26,160;"Just when we watch them together."
14:26,160;14:27,680;"No, that's why we don't do it."
14:27,680;14:31,600;"Although we figured maybe it'd be different live and in the playoffs with"
14:31,600;14:32,880;"everything on this line."
14:32,880;14:34,240;"But."
14:34,440;14:36,040;"This is a little hard."
14:36,040;14:37,440;"It wasn't."
14:37,440;14:42,440;"Yeah, that was a hot mess."
14:42,440;14:44,440;"So I was actually hoping to have it."
14:44,440;14:47,440;"We watch Ryan Tan to help throw for like 80 yards"
14:47,440;14:49,440;"and beat the Patriots in a playoff game."
14:49,440;14:50,440;"Yeah."
14:50,440;14:50,940;"Yeah."
14:50,940;14:52,440;"That's a kick in the dick."
14:52,440;14:55,440;"We've watched a lot of bad things happen to the Patriots together."
14:55,440;14:59,440;"So we literally just for probably since 2009,"
14:59,440;15:01,440;"we just stopped watching Patriots games together."
15:01,440;15:10,200;"And you're like the only pages fan within driving distance really that has invited me over and I've just said no"
15:10,200;15:17,120;"That's a thing we don't even try anymore. Oh, yeah"
15:17,120;15:22,500;"And so we gave it one last college try and we ruined the"
15:22,500;15:27,760;"So actually I want to ask you do you want to watch a real question together?"
15:29,840;15:34,500;"Well, that's what I wanted to ask you is was that game the end of the pages down?"
15:34,500;15:39,680;"Maybe"
15:39,680;15:47,680;"Good answer for podcast. Yeah, we're gonna live. No, it's I don't know maybe hot. I'm talking myself in this did them"
15:47,680;15:49,680;"I think if stid them can play"
15:49,680;15:56,560;"Okay, they'll be fine, and I think if they can build something I don't think they're gonna be great this year, but I"
15:57,320;16:02,840;"Don't think they're so far away and they still get a fella check which you know everyone says hot take watch out"
16:02,840;16:06,480;"So I don't think I'll check skull"
16:06,480;16:09,280;"Completely sucks so they must see something instead of"
16:09,280;16:15,720;"So I don't know if it's that end I guess it depends on how you define it"
16:15,720;16:18,160;"Is it the end of them winning championships?"
16:18,160;16:25,980;"It could be right and and so good and competitive. I don't think so. I think they'll still be decent. I mean they still get a good"
16:26,840;16:31,000;"But but does the dynasty like as a as a"
16:31,000;16:37,320;"As an idea and because Brady left because it's no longer Bill and Brady"
16:37,320;16:43,000;"That's hard. I'm really thought of that. I know because"
16:43,000;16:47,680;"And those two of the mainstays all the way through these 20 years"
16:47,680;16:50,480;"I don't I think it sticks with the team"
16:50,480;16:55,480;"I mean you look at some of the other like you look at like the Celtics or"
16:56,040;17:00,860;"Other teams players change. I mean, yeah, the core I guess was still there, but"
17:00,860;17:04,000;"You know you look at different teams"
17:04,000;17:08,600;"People come in and out. I mean granted. It's not always Brady and Bella Jack"
17:08,600;17:13,440;"I mean, that's kind of a big deal, but right? I don't know. I think it's a laundry, so"
17:13,440;17:16,640;"Right, you would make a terrible radio house"
17:16,640;17:20,240;"You just like middle of the rough."
17:20,240;17:21,240;"Maybe."
17:21,240;17:25,640;"I'm going to go away."
17:25,640;17:27,140;"What are you going to do?"
17:27,140;17:28,640;"So I think I'm going to talk about--"
17:28,640;17:29,640;"I'm going to talk about--"
17:29,640;17:32,640;"for an actual question."
17:32,640;17:35,340;"So I've been saying this since Brady left,"
17:35,340;17:37,140;"but here's what I think is going to happen."
17:37,140;17:41,140;"I think Brady and the Buccaneers are going"
17:41,140;17:44,240;"to be the next greatest show on turf, just not on turf."
17:44,240;17:47,760;"They're going to be on grass because they're Tampa and you can grow grass."
17:47,760;17:52,000;"And they're going to waltz into the playoffs."
17:52,000;17:53,420;"They're going to make it all the way to the Super Bowl."
17:53,420;17:57,200;"Patriots are going to scrape by on the strength of their defense."
17:57,200;17:59,720;"And Jared's didn't was just going to keep them in enough games."
17:59,720;18:03,400;"And they're going to get the seventh seed because there was a seventh seed this year, right?"
18:03,400;18:06,720;"And they're going to scrape in as a walker team."
18:06,720;18:10,160;"They're going to get hot right at the end and they're going to meet the"
18:11,040;18:16,080;"bucket years in the Super Bowl and then Bellatrix going to come up with one of his patented,"
18:16,080;18:23,840;"put it in the Hall of Fame defensive schemes to Stifle Brady like the Giants did back in"
18:23,840;18:29,920;"take your pick years. So you're gonna be that guy? That guy. I hope it's a drinks in there."
18:29,920;18:35,040;"That's how you get a rain hose. That's how you get listeners, Ryan. Come on."
18:36,960;18:38,960;"All or nothing, baby."
18:38,960;18:42,760;"And if Greg was here, he'd say, ""Pat, you're good at sock."""
18:42,760;18:43,680;"Yeah."
18:43,680;18:44,680;"And Steve's the middle."
18:44,680;18:47,280;"And I'm over here saying, ""We're not even going to play football this year."""
18:47,280;18:48,920;"You guys really are mad at me."
18:48,920;18:52,360;"That's great."
18:52,360;18:53,360;"That was my original thing."
18:53,360;18:55,760;"I don't think I'll suck."
18:55,760;19:00,000;"I think-- how do you really see them beating Kansas City?"
19:00,000;19:04,560;"I mean, I don't see how much you get to Kansas City."
19:04,560;19:08,840;"I think they can be Kansas City because now all they have on defense or safeties."
19:08,840;19:10,480;"Yeah, that's true."
19:10,480;19:14,000;"And that's basically custom built to be Kansas City and only Kansas City."
19:14,000;19:14,920;"Yeah."
19:14,920;19:17,560;"And maybe the Ravens."
19:17,560;19:17,920;"I don't know."
19:17,920;19:20,680;"We'll say I mean, they did get job last year."
19:20,680;19:22,800;"It's not like they haven't played good against Casey."
19:22,800;19:23,440;"Exactly."
19:23,440;19:23,680;"Yeah."
19:23,680;19:26,000;"So we'll see."
19:26,000;19:30,680;"But so not to put you on this one, but did you actually manage to watch any of this game?"
19:30,680;19:31,520;"I did."
19:31,520;19:32,400;"All right."
19:32,960;19:34,220;"Well, the 20-man version."
19:34,220;19:35,220;"But yeah, yeah."
19:35,220;19:37,460;"Hell of a quarter and a half."
19:37,460;19:39,780;"So that's the thing."
19:39,780;19:43,640;"So these Patriots, and I don't think we well, we've kind of talked about it"
19:43,640;19:48,860;"throughout, but they start off three and they're beating the piss out of teams."
19:48,860;19:50,900;"Like they blew the doors off the Steelers."
19:50,900;19:52,460;"That was like supposed to be a rematch."
19:52,460;19:57,860;"The AFC Championship came then they went to the Jets and embarrassed them."
19:57,860;19:58,460;"Yeah."
19:58,460;19:59,940;"Victor Green had a pick six."
19:59,940;20:00,240;"Yeah."
20:00,560;20:01,560;"against his old team."
20:01,560;20:02,760;"He was disrespected."
20:02,760;20:06,240;"And then yeah, then they had a barbering as a chief's where"
20:06,240;20:08,600;"not your model, who am I thinking of?"
20:08,600;20:09,960;"Priest Holmes."
20:09,960;20:10,840;"Literally last week."
20:10,840;20:11,200;"Thank you."
20:11,200;20:13,560;"Priest Holmes ran for like 200 yards."
20:13,560;20:17,080;"And so you're coming like, all right, well, you know, it's the"
20:17,080;20:17,440;"Patriots."
20:17,440;20:18,240;"They'll figure it out."
20:18,240;20:19,840;"Their strength is their defense."
20:19,840;20:21,560;"That was an anomaly."
20:21,560;20:22,280;"And then"
20:22,280;20:26,160;"Ladani and Tom Ligison comes in here and runs for"
20:26,160;20:28,160;"more than 200 yards."
20:28,560;20:30,520;"It was quite a lot of yards."
20:30,520;20:36,640;"I think it was probably the most he's ever run for up until then at this point."
20:36,640;20:38,240;"Yeah."
20:38,240;20:39,000;"Really?"
20:39,000;20:42,640;"Like, yeah, yeah, this is the second season fourth game."
20:42,640;20:48,920;"Yeah, but he had 217 yards, which is a lot on 27 carries."
20:48,920;20:51,920;"So it's not like he was running it 40 times."
20:51,920;20:52,720;"Yeah."
20:52,720;20:53,760;"Yeah, he was."
20:53,760;20:57,320;"I said last week I killed getting priest homes and LT confused."
20:57,320;21:02,720;"maybe because I watched these two games back to back back in the day and they both absolutely"
21:02,720;21:04,280;"burned us back."
21:04,280;21:05,360;"That's probably it."
21:05,360;21:08,680;"I couldn't remember who I hated, but now I know I hate LT."
21:08,680;21:10,800;"So and I saw."
21:10,800;21:20,280;"I also hate LT for similar reasons, but slightly different because I remember I didn't watch any"
21:20,280;21:20,760;"of these games."
21:20,760;21:22,800;"I've realized I may have watched the steals game."
21:23,560;21:29,920;"This was the only game this season I actually watched because we've talked about it before how I failed out of Penn State."
21:29,920;21:35,280;"And so at this point, Ryan, you know, you remember."
21:35,280;21:39,640;"But I was always I was on for that one."
21:39,640;21:43,760;"Oh, it was that was a shit on any Brown Week."
21:43,760;21:44,600;"You would have loved it."
21:44,600;21:46,960;"It was really was a good week."
21:51,280;22:02,580;"But at this point, I had traveled to England to spend time with family and I was living in a small town in England working at a convenience store, opening it up at 4am."
22:02,580;22:09,220;"But this was the only game so far that had been on TV in England because it was like prime time. It was the four o'clock game."
22:09,220;22:09,800;"Yeah."
22:09,800;22:16,680;"Over there, the game started like nine, 10 o'clock at night and went until midnight, one o'clock and I had to be at work at four."
22:16,840;22:18,180;"So I'm like, I'm going to stay for this game."
22:18,180;22:21,480;"The patients are undefeated and they're blowing the shit out of out of teams."
22:21,480;22:22,240;"This is going to be great."
22:22,240;22:27,140;"And it was one of those games where the pages lost, but they were always still"
22:27,140;22:27,400;"in it."
22:27,400;22:29,480;"So I had to stay up till the very fucking end of it."
22:29,480;22:31,560;"And then they lost anyway."
22:31,560;22:33,940;"And I mean, they had the ball."
22:33,940;22:35,880;"Yeah."
22:35,880;22:38,600;"In like a typical, pretty situation."
22:38,600;22:40,680;"It's entertaining."
22:40,680;22:46,380;"Frustrating in that they couldn't stop like the player I hate, but"
22:46,380;22:51,340;"entertaining. I mean, it was entertaining now watching it at four o'clock in the afternoon,"
22:51,340;22:57,980;"but not instead of sleep. I'm a big sleep guy, and this was not my favorite game."
22:57,980;23:03,580;"But I was, uh, I think the thing that stuck out to me most was"
23:03,580;23:11,260;"how much they actually missed Troy Brown, because the Patriots on third down sucked in this game."
23:11,260;23:14,780;"I don't know. I thought that, uh, the on branch was electric."
23:14,780;23:18,620;"I mean, Dion Branch went off. Yeah, he had like 100 and something yards, but"
23:18,620;23:22,780;"I thought he stepped in and filled in that Troy Brown. So like they're missing Dion Branch."
23:22,780;23:25,420;"Yeah. I don't think they were. I remember."
23:25,420;23:31,020;"But because Dion Branch was good on like first and second down, he had 13 catches 128 yards."
23:31,020;23:37,580;"But on those third downs, we absolutely have to have it. The Troy Brown was missing is what"
23:37,580;23:43,660;"it was. I thought. I actually watched it and was thinking kind of the opposite. I was like,"
23:43,660;23:47,140;"like, holy shit, there's open receivers. But that's coming off"
23:47,140;23:49,620;"the last year. So I'm kind of fresh in my mind."
23:49,620;23:52,660;"Yeah, sure. Because you haven't been watching the rest of"
23:52,660;23:54,620;"these early pages games."
23:54,620;23:58,740;"So not watching them in sequence. All I have to compare it to"
23:58,740;24:02,460;"is like, you know, last year when no one could get any"
24:02,460;24:05,220;"separation. And it's like, holy crap, that's what the offense"
24:05,220;24:09,020;"used to look like when it worked. Right. All their trick plays"
24:09,020;24:12,420;"were actually working. And I was working."
24:12,420;24:19,980;"Mark Edwards was an actual like a full back who was an integral part of the game."
24:19,980;24:21,100;"Yeah."
24:21,100;24:21,540;"Yeah."
24:21,540;24:25,340;"It was it was like, oh, yeah, that's how that's how it used to look."
24:25,340;24:26,060;"Yeah."
24:26,060;24:28,140;"And I still lost and like put up 14."
24:28,140;24:34,020;"But yeah, I mean, this was the season where and I kind of forgotten about this."
24:34,020;24:41,620;"Like the 2001 season, the Patriots had basically just been very run heavy, run for a"
24:41,620;24:45,620;"second down and try and make Brady convert the third down,"
24:45,620;24:48,160;"whatever, hopefully third and short, but like Brady was really"
24:48,160;24:49,920;"good on third downs and that's what kept him in games."
24:49,920;24:52,720;"But this year they came out and I say, basically you said, you"
24:52,720;24:54,880;"know what, fuck it, we're going five wide."
24:54,880;24:56,720;"And they actually talked about it in the comment he was talking"
24:56,720;25:01,400;"about in this game, where they wanted to go five wide to tire"
25:01,400;25:03,080;"out the Steelers defense."
25:03,080;25:06,480;"And so they did that basically entire game and did like hurry"
25:06,480;25:07,560;"up and all that sort of shit."
25:08,080;25:10,780;"And then it worked so well."
25:10,780;25:13,220;"Like they only had a few plays in the playbook,"
25:13,220;25:14,880;"but then they kind of added a few more"
25:14,880;25:16,660;"and they tried those against the Jets"
25:16,660;25:18,420;"and it worked even better."
25:18,420;25:19,840;"So they basically at this point,"
25:19,840;25:20,680;"they said, you know what, fuck,"
25:20,680;25:22,460;"we're going five wide all the time."
25:22,460;25:25,100;"And this, I thought, was the one game"
25:25,100;25:27,860;"where you kind of almost saw it come back to bite 'em."
25:27,860;25:31,260;"'Cause it worked really well in the first half"
25:31,260;25:32,260;"and they were moving up and down the field,"
25:32,260;25:35,480;"but they couldn't quite finish drives,"
25:35,480;25:39,040;"which I think we've seen in Patriots teams"
25:39,040;25:40,680;"when they put the ball in Brady's hands,"
25:40,680;25:44,040;"like, oh, six for instance, things like that."
25:44,040;25:46,960;"Or even like before they started"
25:46,960;25:50,080;"when these second round of Super Bowls,"
25:50,080;25:51,600;"they could always get into the red zone"
25:51,600;25:52,800;"but they couldn't quite finish"
25:52,800;25:54,600;"and they were never a great like red zone team"
25:54,600;25:55,680;"'cause they didn't have that running back"
25:55,680;25:56,840;"who could finish that off."
25:56,840;25:57,680;"But I don't know."
25:57,680;25:59,240;"- They've been able to wasted a ton of opportunities"
25:59,240;26:00,320;"in this."
26:00,320;26:01,160;"- Yeah."
26:01,160;26:02,560;"- We'll go like, we'll start the game."
26:02,560;26:08,660;"like they score touchdown on a baller play action from Brady."
26:08,660;26:14,260;"And then the charges immediately fumble the kickoff,"
26:14,260;26:19,860;"which I timed this because there's that 30 second skip on the game."
26:19,860;26:23,460;"30 second skips on the review."
26:23,460;26:25,460;"I have here."
26:25,460;26:25,960;"You're doing the math."
26:25,960;26:26,660;"That's four minutes."
26:26,660;26:27,260;"I did eight."
26:27,260;26:31,260;"I think the review, my God, the only thing I hate more than this is LT."
26:31,260;26:34,340;"(laughing)"
26:34,340;26:36,980;"And then they overturn it and then they immediately"
26:36,980;26:39,980;"like throw a swing pass to the fall back and he fumbles it."
26:39,980;26:41,220;"- Yeah, they're able to recover."
26:41,220;26:43,620;"- So like we had a touchdown, a fumble"
26:43,620;26:45,980;"and then he's kind of like pissed that."
26:45,980;26:48,580;"- The pass go three and out from the San Diego 39"
26:48,580;26:50,020;"and end up having a punt-able."
26:50,020;26:50,860;"- Yeah."
26:50,860;26:52,740;"- They missed a field goal too."
26:52,740;26:54,780;"- Yep, the sanitary missed it from the fucking,"
26:54,780;26:57,100;"that's so we do best of words on this show Ryan."
26:57,100;26:59,460;"Oh, if you actually listen, but at the end we do best of worse."
26:59,460;27:00,300;"I'm gonna do my right now."
27:00,300;27:05,300;"My worst is that fucking garbage baseball diamond on the field."
27:05,300;27:06,820;"I know people love it 'cause it's like,"
27:06,820;27:07,660;"oh, it's different."
27:07,660;27:08,820;"I fucking hate it."
27:08,820;27:09,660;"It looks stupid."
27:09,660;27:12,020;"Everybody gets just like dirty and everything"
27:12,020;27:13,460;"for no fucking reason."
27:13,460;27:15,980;"- That's actually my first note."
27:15,980;27:18,460;"Have the Chargers ever had a nice stadium?"
27:18,460;27:21,140;"(laughing)"
27:21,140;27:24,060;"- No, 'cause I've got from that to a soccer stadium, right?"
27:24,060;27:27,180;"- Yeah, and aren't they sharing the RAM stadium?"
27:27,180;27:29,140;"Like, they've never had their room."
27:29,140;27:30,140;"moving into this year."
27:30,140;27:32,140;"Yeah, until the Rams kick them out."
27:32,140;27:33,140;"Yeah."
27:33,140;27:39,260;"How could they never had a nice fucking like charger stadium because they don't deserve"
27:39,260;27:40,260;"it."
27:40,260;27:41,260;"They're a shit-stater."
27:41,260;27:43,260;"Nobody wants them."
27:43,260;27:44,260;"Yeah."
27:44,260;27:45,260;"Yeah."
27:45,260;27:49,260;"Oh, Rivers is going to a much better place than fucking Indianapolis."
27:49,260;27:50,260;"Yeah."
27:50,260;27:53,100;"Hey, they hang banners for anything there."
27:53,100;27:55,460;"They don't hang a banner for Seinfeld Rivers."
27:55,460;28:00,460;"- Is anyone else sick of all the run that the Colts are getting already?"
28:00,460;28:04,460;"Like people are talking them up, like they're gonna be like this great team."
28:04,460;28:05,460;"- Are they?"
28:05,460;28:09,460;"- I've heard a lot of people saying they're gonna be really good this year."
28:09,460;28:12,460;"And like Rivers is gonna like make a huge difference."
28:12,460;28:15,460;"- Have they not seen Phillip Rivers play?"
28:15,460;28:16,460;"- I don't see it."
28:16,460;28:21,460;"- He's like Tom Brady, but with interceptions instead of touchdowns."
28:21,460;28:24,460;"And also kids instead of touchdowns."
28:24,460;28:28,300;"Yeah, forget how bad he did last year already."
28:28,300;28:29,380;"You know, that's what I mean."
28:29,380;28:35,860;"Yeah, like he's not like he can still throw the ball, just not to who it needs to go to."
28:35,860;28:41,940;"I think two years ago was his like, that was his swan song when the Patriots beat the"
28:41,940;28:43,460;"pants off of them in the playoffs."
28:43,460;28:45,900;"Like that was, that was supposed to be their team of destiny."
28:45,900;28:48,740;"And then they got the playoffs and did charges playoffs things."
28:48,740;28:51,980;"Yeah, I thought the charges were going to win that game."
28:51,980;28:54,560;"I know people did I didn't I"
28:54,560;28:59,080;"Got exposed well of course you didn't I never do"
28:59,080;29:06,360;"That we roll on the page of time. I mean the reason I'm doing this podcast is because I don't think the pages ever lose so"
29:06,360;29:09,580;"You walk"
29:09,580;29:14,340;"Well, that's yeah, exactly which is why I don't watch with you anymore"
29:14,340;29:18,980;"Although now we could probably start we may just like have to rip off the band and watch out for us for"
29:20,820;29:26,540;"I was gonna say if you really want to screw stid on we can get together week one. That's true. Yeah, and"
29:26,540;29:29,460;"tank for Trevor, right?"
29:29,460;29:34,820;"We could probably make that happen so yeah, so if you're listening and"
29:34,820;29:38,060;"You want us to"
29:38,060;29:41,540;"To to submarine the Patriots season let us know and we will"
29:41,540;29:45,320;"Be a fine sort of watching nobody wants that oh"
29:45,320;29:50,580;"There's people out there wanted if you not been on Twitter ever nobody who's listening to this"
29:50,580;29:52,300;"This fucking podcast does."
29:52,300;29:54,400;"Well, I mean, that's, that's a"
29:54,400;29:55,400;"lot of it."
29:55,400;29:57,540;"Listen to all of this."
29:57,540;29:59,740;"Slogging through all of these episodes."
29:59,740;30:03,860;"So get to week four, two thousand two and like, Oh, yeah, got him."
30:03,860;30:08,780;"Well, that's because that's because they're suffering through the first four weeks of the"
30:08,780;30:13,180;"Patriots post Tom Brady, because me and Ryan Sawyer watch the games together and they're"
30:13,180;30:15,020;"losing him in a heartbreak fashion."
30:15,020;30:20,020;"You know, let's go back to the good times and listen to when they actually didn't suck."
30:20,020;30:23,500;"I bet they'll do it for some craft beers."
30:23,500;30:26,860;"We'll do it for shitty beers."
30:26,860;30:27,220;"You can."
30:27,220;30:31,100;"Ryan's story is not a fancy man."
30:31,100;30:33,380;"I'm a PBR guy."
30:33,380;30:40,180;"After that touchdown blown drive."
30:40,180;30:47,620;"That deep ball by Drew Brees was classic Drew Brees was excellent."
30:48,900;30:53,620;"Yeah, I still think that Drew Brees went to the the"
30:53,620;30:59,980;"Doug Flutey school of throwing a football where he has to put like 111%"
30:59,980;31:03,300;"into every single throw he makes or every movement he makes."
31:03,300;31:08,420;"Like I sort of remember like from last year, I would flutey Doug Flutey,"
31:08,420;31:12,100;"you know, when you kind of lift your foot when you're in shotgun to get the snap,"
31:12,100;31:15,060;"he would like he wouldn't just lift his foot and put it down."
31:15,060;31:17,780;"He would like stomp his fucking foot."
31:17,780;31:21,780;"He like every single moon was completely over exaggerated and I'm pretty sure"
31:21,780;31:23,260;"Drew Brees picked that up from him."
31:23,260;31:26,380;"And if not, I don't want to be corrected because it just feels right."
31:26,380;31:33,900;"I wish you had a stats guy because I had, uh, it was 53 yards and that was his."
31:33,900;31:37,180;"Oh, just looked it up on the own stats guy."
31:37,180;31:39,020;"That was his career long at a time."
31:39,020;31:41,660;"And I was like, Oh, no, it is career long as now."
31:41,660;31:44,580;"Like, you know, hundreds and hundreds of touchdowns later."
31:44,580;31:47,100;"Wasn't that like his fourth game?"
31:47,100;31:51,100;"Yeah, pretty much. So what is his career along?"
31:51,100;31:54,100;"Yards to Brandon cooks."
31:54,100;31:56,100;"Oh shit."
31:56,100;31:58,100;"Remember that? No."
31:58,100;32:01,100;"Remember this game? I remember this play at least."
32:01,100;32:03,100;"Yeah, who was it against?"
32:03,100;32:09,100;"They're like, it was kind of like that Brady to West Walker, the, I think that was 98 or 99 yards."
32:09,100;32:10,100;"99, baby."
32:10,100;32:14,100;"It was the same idea. It was just like one on one on the outside and cooks."
32:14,100;32:20,180;"obviously we can fast just beat his dude off the line and brace his same same kind of nice deep ball here"
32:20,180;32:22,660;"But to hear it awesome against the Raiders"
32:22,660;32:25,460;"Oh, well there you go"
32:25,460;32:28,580;"Yeah, it does, isn't it?"
32:28,580;32:30,660;"Um"
32:30,660;32:37,220;"But I don't want to take away from the fact that um this game was the first that we ever saw"
32:37,220;32:40,260;"of the"
32:40,260;32:43,380;"wonderful connection between Brady and his linebackers"
32:43,380;32:49,980;"It was Brady to Vrable for the first time ever and we mentioned it briefly earlier."
32:49,980;32:51,420;"Oh, was that the first one?"
32:51,420;32:52,660;"This was the first one ever."
32:52,660;32:53,660;"Yes."
32:53,660;32:54,660;"Okay."
32:54,660;32:55,660;"You look pretty excited."
32:55,660;32:56,660;"So I was wondering that actually."
32:56,660;32:57,660;"Yeah."
32:57,660;33:00,460;"Well, I mean, they're all excited to catch such as at this point."
33:00,460;33:01,460;"Yeah."
33:01,460;33:02,460;"Oh, Brady looked excited."
33:02,460;33:04,260;"Like, like, how many are you talking?"
33:04,260;33:05,260;"Yes."
33:05,260;33:06,260;"Yeah, that's true."
33:06,260;33:07,260;"Yeah."
33:07,260;33:08,260;"The fact that it fucking worked."
33:08,260;33:12,660;"The commentaries all they could talk about was how"
33:12,660;33:16,020;"Rebo must have been a really good blocker to be in there because of all the tight ends"
33:16,020;33:18,020;"that the Patriots had at this point."
33:18,020;33:24,020;"Now I was thinking to myself, ""Are you seeing Cam Cleland play football?"""
33:24,020;33:25,020;"They also had a note on there."
33:25,020;33:27,940;"It was like they're very briefly had deposit."
33:27,940;33:29,940;"This was, he had 11 TDs."
33:29,940;33:35,020;"I was his 11th touchdown of the year, which is pretty solid for a game and a quarter."
33:35,020;33:39,420;"are three games and a quarter and you had nine different receivers."
33:39,420;33:45,080;"Yeah, that's fucking crazy. This was the time when Brady's favorite receiver was the open"
33:45,080;33:50,020;"receiver. Who are the nine? They didn't say I was wondering if we could come up with them"
33:50,020;33:51,860;"because when we watched all the games."
33:51,860;33:57,300;"All right, Ryan story. Who's the nine? Why? Who's the nine people who caught touchdowns"
33:57,300;34:00,700;"from Bray in the first four weeks? Pretty sure you could probably do this."
34:00,700;34:04,460;"All right, so we got probably branch."
34:04,460;34:06,460;"Yeah, 48."
34:06,460;34:07,460;"Yeah."
34:07,460;34:12,860;"40 had the first touchdown in, uh, in Gillette stadium history, actually."
34:12,860;34:14,700;"You got another one."
34:14,700;34:15,700;"Yeah."
34:15,700;34:18,700;"So branch for you, a variable, of course, 20 Brown."
34:18,700;34:20,700;"Troy Brown's had a few."
34:20,700;34:23,700;"That's four patents must have had one."
34:23,700;34:24,700;"That's five."
34:24,700;34:25,700;"Good thing."
34:25,700;34:26,700;"Oh, Daniel Graham had one."
34:26,700;34:28,700;"He had his first ever touchdown."
34:28,700;34:31,780;"Are you going to do it for me, Andy?"
34:31,780;34:32,700;"We're all doing it."
34:32,700;34:33,940;"Oh, boy."
34:33,940;34:35,300;"Then Steve Brown."
34:35,300;34:38,460;"If you got anything to add."
34:38,460;34:40,860;"Antoine, do you have a touch at this point?"
34:40,860;34:41,940;"No, I don't think so."
34:41,940;34:43,900;"Not a receiving."
34:43,900;34:45,660;"Kevin Falk."
34:45,660;34:48,180;"Yeah, because I thought it was his first one."
34:48,180;34:48,980;"Yeah, that's right."
34:48,980;34:50,140;"You thought it was his first ever."
34:50,140;34:51,100;"And he's been around."
34:51,100;34:52,660;"Yeah, he's never even played like six."
34:52,660;34:53,900;"Yeah."
34:53,900;34:55,540;"Typical Steve Brown."
34:55,540;34:56,540;"So that's seven."
34:56,540;34:58,660;"I know one more."
34:58,660;35:00,660;"I'm not sure."
35:00,660;35:02,660;"Can't fluent."
35:02,660;35:03,660;"Can't be judged."
35:03,660;35:04,660;"Was it really?"
35:04,660;35:05,660;"Oh fuck."
35:05,660;35:06,660;"Alright, so that's eight."
35:06,660;35:07,660;"Nine."
35:07,660;35:09,660;"Oh, was it."
35:09,660;35:10,660;"Donald Hayes."
35:10,660;35:12,660;"Oh, yeah."
35:12,660;35:13,660;"That hook route."
35:13,660;35:14,660;"Yep."
35:14,660;35:15,660;"That wasn't."
35:15,660;35:16,660;"Yeah."
35:16,660;35:17,660;"Early in the in the steel games."
35:17,660;35:18,660;"That's nine."
35:18,660;35:19,660;"Goddamn."
35:19,660;35:20,660;"Remember,"
35:20,660;35:21,660;"Donald Hayes, right?"
35:21,660;35:24,660;"That was going to say that's a name I haven't heard in a long town."
35:24,660;35:25,660;"Exactly."
35:25,660;35:27,980;"- And Kim Cleveland was one too, but she's--"
35:27,980;35:29,220;"- Yeah, exactly, yeah."
35:29,220;35:34,220;"So we actually realized that the last game of 2001"
35:34,220;35:37,500;"was against the Panthers when they blew them out."
35:37,500;35:41,380;"And in that game, Donald Hayes had two balls bounce"
35:41,380;35:44,180;"off his hands that were intercepted"
35:44,180;35:46,580;"and both were actually returned for touchdowns,"
35:46,580;35:49,540;"but one was called back for holding on the return."
35:49,540;35:51,740;"- He's been decent this year so far though."
35:51,740;35:54,020;"- Yeah, and he's wearing 81, so you're looking at him"
35:54,020;35:55,220;"like, ""Oh, it's Randy Moss."""
35:55,220;35:58,300;"And you realize, no, you definitely are on your boss."
35:58,300;35:58,780;"Yeah."
35:58,780;36:00,140;"It's already a boss."
36:00,140;36:02,260;"He's he's ready."
36:02,260;36:04,500;"Moss who didn't run a four zero or something."
36:04,500;36:05,180;"Yeah."
36:05,180;36:05,580;"Ready."
36:05,580;36:07,500;"Moss are at a five like a five one."
36:07,500;36:10,940;"Okay."
36:10,940;36:17,060;"So right after Mike Frable scores that touchdown, he comes back with two"
36:17,060;36:18,780;"awesome plays of horses three now, right?"
36:18,780;36:19,820;"When they get the ball back."
36:19,820;36:20,900;"Yeah, he does."
36:20,900;36:24,100;"They were like weirdly talking about that rookie center getting a start."
36:24,100;36:30,900;"Ball who happened to be from London Dairy, which they say Jason Ball from London"
36:30,900;36:35,780;"Dairy New Hampshire played at UNH. Don't you worry about that. And then Mike"
36:35,780;36:42,020;"Raib's absolutely just like him blocking air on his rush. Just kind of threw"
36:42,020;36:46,100;"him out the way. Because if you're on second down and then on third down he"
36:46,100;36:50,580;"bets down the ball. It's pretty awesome. Like they give him a touchdown he"
36:50,580;36:54,140;"immediately comes out and makes like two, not like huge offensive players."
36:54,140;36:56,460;"So the second quarter, but still pretty awesome."
36:56,460;36:59,540;"Yeah, I think if you're going to give a game ball to anybody in this,"
36:59,540;37:03,160;"it's probably able because he's the only one that had any sort of like"
37:03,160;37:04,720;"positivity."
37:04,720;37:05,820;"There you crushed it."
37:05,820;37:11,020;"I mean, you could probably give it to Brady too, but we're talking about"
37:11,020;37:14,060;"right now, but we'll get into our game balls."
37:14,060;37:14,700;"All right."
37:14,700;37:14,940;"Yeah."
37:14,940;37:19,380;"But I think that one of the stats they show was that Tom Brady over the"
37:19,380;37:22,380;"past two games had thrown the ball over a hundred times."
37:22,380;37:27,260;"Yeah, which was fucking bananas to me, especially back then."
37:27,260;37:28,500;"Right. Exactly."
37:28,500;37:33,540;"Back in 2002 when they were converting slowly from a running team and all of a"
37:33,540;37:37,820;"sudden, throwing it literally 50 times a game, it's fucking ridiculous."
37:37,820;37:42,660;"Well, like you said, I mean, they started the season like completely"
37:42,660;37:44,380;"surprising everyone by throwing."
37:44,380;37:45,140;"Yeah."
37:45,140;37:49,540;"I mean, I remember now like, I forget how many 300 yard games"
37:49,540;37:53,940;"but he just started and was just piling up 300 yard games right off the bat."
37:53,940;37:55,540;"- Just over 300 yards. - Oh, and then over the course."
37:55,540;37:58,340;"Like Brady throwing 300 yards, that's not."
37:58,340;38:00,140;"- Oh, he didn't have a great game."
38:00,140;38:02,140;"He threw a bunch of bad picks."
38:02,140;38:05,140;"- He did actually. He threw a couple of them."
38:05,140;38:05,940;"- Like, I was just like, ""Whoa."""
38:05,940;38:07,740;"- It was just like another one. He was like, ""God damn it."""
38:07,740;38:11,340;"Like, in one of the third quarter, he had one in the second quarter"
38:11,340;38:14,540;"to like end drives that were like points, basically."
38:14,540;38:19,220;"Yeah. Yeah. You're not careful with the ball. I get there. Like you said, the"
38:19,220;38:22,900;"paths move the ball is it shouldn't have been as close as it was. We should have"
38:22,900;38:27,980;"been whipping them up a little bit more than we were. Yeah. Like I was surprised"
38:27,980;38:34,460;"at how well the offense performed for a game where they only scored 14 points."
38:34,460;38:39,100;"Yeah. It doesn't feel right. So look at the scores and I'm like, I remember them"
38:39,100;38:43,660;"losing this game. I remember it's so we're gonna stay in the score Andy. Score was"
38:43,660;38:45,060;"It ended."
38:45,060;38:53,500;"New England Patriots 14 San Diego Chargers 21 and the last score came three"
38:53,500;38:55,180;"plays into the second half."
38:55,180;38:59,900;"So if you do want to watch this game, that's one thing we've been doing."
38:59,900;39:04,340;"Well, that we've been trying to do and we haven't done very well is give a"
39:04,340;39:06,020;"watchability score in these games."
39:06,020;39:10,780;"So out of, we're doing it out of six lumbodies Ryan's story because where"
39:10,780;39:12,940;"assholes like that, that makes sense."
39:13,380;39:20,420;"Yeah. And so the last game was Patriots one 34 31 and over time with a barn burner."
39:20,420;39:24,580;"We gave that I think a solid five Lombardis because it was an exciting game and they won."
39:24,580;39:30,980;"This game. But I think we also said that only watch the second half of that game because the"
39:30,980;39:35,300;"first half was the Patriots had more penalty yards than they did actual yards."
39:35,300;39:41,540;"Yeah, they had like 10 penalties for 100 yards in that game. It was rough. But most of"
39:41,540;39:44,540;"those came in the first half and then they unload in the second half."
39:44,540;39:48,140;"But this game, I think, is probably opposite in both ways."
39:48,140;39:51,300;"You're going to watch a game, only watch the first half because that's when the"
39:51,300;39:53,300;"pages do anything."
39:53,300;39:58,540;"And I would give it, I'd probably give it a one and a half lemotties, maybe two."
39:58,540;40:02,540;"Or because it's Vrable's first touchdown."
40:02,540;40:05,980;"All right, I'll give it an eight because it wasn't like a blow out."
40:05,980;40:07,980;"It was like watchable to the end, you know?"
40:07,980;40:08,980;"That's true."
40:08,980;40:12,420;"Yeah, but when's the last time the page is actually gotten blown out?"
40:12,420;40:17,340;"Talked about this like it doesn't happen very often anyway. They lose they lose close, right?"
40:17,340;40:19,300;"No, this is this touch on that second half"
40:19,300;40:24,820;"They come out with the fucking three stuj's defense where everybody falls over each other trying to tackle LT"
40:24,820;40:31,060;"And he runs like 50 fucking yards for touchdown. That's that three plays into the zoonily like I saw like"
40:31,060;40:34,380;"two like it's six missed tackles because"
40:34,380;40:36,820;"Those people falling over in pairs"
40:36,820;40:43,180;"I'd say that's a quite a surprisingly accurate."
40:43,180;40:48,380;"Just a little pick like late third quarter in the red zone."
40:48,380;40:52,260;"You know, they're just like flirting outside field going around a lot and just kind of"
40:52,260;40:54,260;"Walter's hitting like 15 year punts."
40:54,260;40:55,260;"Yeah."
40:55,260;41:00,060;"And then the Chargers in the fourth quarter hit like an absolutely amazing punt."
41:00,060;41:01,060;"Yeah."
41:01,060;41:04,900;"Yeah, Kevin Paul's returning punts because Troy Brown is of course injured."
41:04,900;41:08,840;"And he lets one bounce at the five and it literally goes sideways and goes straight out of bounds"
41:08,840;41:11,820;"The pages have less than two minutes of no time outs left"
41:11,820;41:15,260;"May just can't make it happen. They still got down the field"
41:15,260;41:20,740;"They did they got into San Diego territory and got to like the 30s yard line 40 yard line"
41:20,740;41:27,660;"Watchable, so I'm gonna give it only a good three just because we didn't win doesn't mean it wasn't like an entertaining game"
41:27,660;41:31,140;"Disagree to disagree"
41:31,300;41:36,680;"I'm a homer. I only want to watch the wind like seeing say out and Rodney in chargers and"
41:36,680;41:41,940;"Tim Dwight in Dwight Drew Brees in a charge zenaphone, which looks weird, you know"
41:41,940;41:45,720;"Also the fact he looked like he was 16 years old was a little strange to me"
41:45,720;41:49,420;"Yeah, like his helmet comes off at one point is he to see like super young Drew Brees?"
41:49,420;41:56,960;"Like oh, it was he able to drive to the game or just as long as you can skip the replays because there is a bunch of those"
41:57,940;42:02,940;"Oh, this is eight, 30 seconds skip, a six, 30 seconds skip."
42:02,940;42:04,740;"30 seconds skip."
42:04,740;42:06,860;"All in the first half."
42:06,860;42:07,860;"Oh, yeah."
42:07,860;42:11,820;"And well, I remember because in 2001 when we were doing it,"
42:11,820;42:13,940;"I think replay was new."
42:13,940;42:15,060;"So they were literally timing it."
42:15,060;42:16,660;"And they had a little timer in the top corner of it."
42:16,660;42:18,740;"Like how long this replay was taken."
42:18,740;42:19,620;"I love that."
42:19,620;42:21,940;"And it would take like maybe two minutes tops"
42:21,940;42:24,300;"if it was borderline."
42:24,300;42:27,140;"And also what they were doing that they've scrapped this year"
42:27,140;42:32,140;"was that they were doing fan polls where you could text in"
42:32,140;42:36,340;"like you're part of American Idol"
42:36,340;42:39,260;"and you can vote either the place should stand"
42:39,260;42:40,260;"or it should be overturned."
42:40,260;42:42,460;"And they would show the percentages"
42:42,460;42:45,660;"like as the referee's coming out from underneath the hood,"
42:45,660;42:47,620;"which should still fucking happen."
42:47,620;42:49,420;"The fact that that doesn't is a travesty"
42:49,420;42:50,580;"and I blame the NFL."
42:50,580;42:53,620;"I blame, no, specifically I blame Roger Goodell."
42:53,620;42:54,620;"Mainly because I do--"
42:54,620;42:56,900;"- You should write him a strongly worded letter."
42:56,900;42:57,740;"I'm gonna do that."
42:57,740;42:59,540;"I'm gonna follow my mother's footsteps."
42:59,540;43:01,380;"And I'm going to write Roger Goodell."
43:01,380;43:03,640;"- Yeah. - A very strongly worded,"
43:03,640;43:04,480;"worded letter."
43:04,480;43:06,660;"- You let it go. - Hang on."
43:06,660;43:08,940;"The Hell's Angels is driving past me on us."
43:08,940;43:11,340;"Did you hear them?"
43:11,340;43:12,820;"- A little bit, not really."
43:12,820;43:13,660;"- They're not Hell's Angels."
43:13,660;43:15,580;"They're probably dentists on motorcycles, best schools."
43:15,580;43:19,980;"- I, I, I, I got a football or not football."
43:19,980;43:20,820;"I don't know if you-- - Well, hang on,"
43:20,820;43:22,100;"before we do that, I wanna, I wanna,"
43:22,100;43:24,820;"I wanna know how many Lombardi's Ryan gives this game."
43:25,860;43:27,180;"Yeah, I'm good with three."
43:27,180;43:31,020;"Right in the middle, what a fucking surprise."
43:31,020;43:34,100;"Well, it was an okay game."
43:34,100;43:36,980;"Just like Steve said, it was an okay game."
43:36,980;43:38,300;"The first half was really good."
43:38,300;43:40,780;"If you just watch the first half, it's a fun game."
43:40,780;43:42,940;"The second half is a fucking slog,"
43:42,940;43:44,500;"but they had their chances."
43:44,500;43:46,820;"They just keep fucking up and pissing you off."
43:46,820;43:47,980;"And then they have the ball at the end"
43:47,980;43:49,460;"with the chance to win."
43:49,460;43:50,300;"So that--"
43:50,300;43:51,140;"They don't."
43:51,140;43:52,340;"That was the heartbreaking thing is like,"
43:52,340;43:54,660;"Brady doesn't ever not convert those."
43:54,660;44:03,260;"At least up until this point, like, I mean, when he would get the ball and he needed a score at this point is great. He always got one."
44:03,260;44:08,420;"Like, I don't think there was one before this that you hadn't converted."
44:08,420;44:10,220;"Like, it's a chance."
44:10,220;44:11,420;"All right, I'll give you that."
44:11,420;44:15,380;"The fact that he played the first, like four plays against the Jets and that didn't work."
44:15,380;44:16,660;"But he almost still did it though."
44:16,660;44:23,380;"Yeah, I guess he was he was thrown past in the end zone that we're hitting people in the hands, but this just wasn't that."
44:23,580;44:27,140;"So and the way the game ended was Brady threw it."
44:27,140;44:31,460;"It was like 30, 40 seconds left Brady through it to Kevin"
44:31,460;44:35,220;"Falk across the middle and Kevin Falk tried to lateral it to"
44:35,220;44:36,600;"alignment."
44:36,600;44:37,540;"I'm alive."
44:37,540;44:39,460;"You said, no, not my fucking problem."
44:39,460;44:40,980;"And just let the ball go right past him."
44:40,980;44:44,620;"He looked like a super ball."
44:44,620;44:44,980;"Yeah."
44:44,980;44:48,300;"For Kevin's fall in trouble, he got lit the fuck up."
44:49,060;44:57,100;"like absolutely blown up by the linebacker Donnie Edwards just absolutely just"
44:57,100;44:59,380;"Oh, that looked so painful."
44:59,380;45:01,140;"And that was basically the last but the game."
45:01,140;45:03,140;"Plus."
45:03,140;45:04,900;"So let's let's talk about the commentating."
45:04,900;45:06,980;"And you've been actually very quiet about that."
45:06,980;45:09,940;"To this point, usually you're all riled up."
45:09,940;45:11,860;"So this is true."
45:11,860;45:16,100;"And I thought I'd be more riled up because it was Phil Sims and Phil Sims"
45:16,100;45:17,220;"hates him some Patriots."
45:17,220;45:18,060;"Am I right?"
45:18,060;45:20,060;"I don't know if I agree with that."
45:20,060;45:23,060;"Ryan, what do you think Phil says?"
45:23,060;45:26,060;"I don't think he hits him."
45:26,060;45:28,060;"You're kind of right in the middle."
45:28,060;45:31,060;"I think he's celebrating."
45:31,060;45:33,060;"So that's the thing."
45:33,060;45:40,060;"I think now his new thing is that he likes to root against pages because they're the evil empire."
45:40,060;45:44,060;"Well, and his son hates him and his son's a douche."
45:44,060;45:49,660;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. It's his son. Play. Well, I don't know if played is right word,"
45:49,660;45:55,380;"but was in the NFL at the same time, right? Yeah, he was for the box. Chris Sims, right?"
45:55,380;46:01,060;"Yeah. And he either tried catch out. He was a coach for the Pats for like a year. Was he"
46:01,060;46:07,100;"really? Yeah. No shit. All right. Well, that looks when they hate. So that's why he always"
46:07,100;46:10,540;"has, you know, for years, he's had the hot take of, you know, Brady's not as good as"
46:10,540;46:13,780;"he is and blah, blah, blah, right."
46:13,780;46:19,980;"So I think you can see Phil turning when his son decided he didn't like the"
46:19,980;46:23,020;"bads, but early on, like this game, I thought Sims was"
46:23,020;46:24,460;"pro Brady."
46:24,460;46:25,860;"And that's exactly what I was going to say."
46:25,860;46:26,540;"Yeah, he does."
46:26,540;46:30,700;"He really loves him some early Tom Brady back in these days, which was"
46:30,700;46:35,100;"kind of strange to hear because I get like I said, I missed this whole season."
46:35,100;46:39,900;"So we didn't have Phil Sims doing any Patriots games the season before"
46:39,900;46:43,620;"because the pages weren't good enough for that. We had Dan fucking dear."
46:43,620;46:49,660;"Did it? That's not right. Yeah. He did the Raiders game and he loved Tom Brady and that came to"
46:49,660;46:54,540;"did you catch his foreshadowing at the beginning of the game?"
46:54,540;47:00,060;"That sounds familiar. I don't know if I wrote down. What was it?"
47:00,060;47:04,980;"Like he's like Brady makes it look too easy. It's too easy for Brady."
47:04,980;47:09,380;"Yeah. This league is hard. He hasn't suffered yet. You got to suffer Tom Brady"
47:09,380;47:15,620;"haven't done that yet. I did not catch that, but that's pretty good. I did catch the fact"
47:15,620;47:21,380;"that he called Charlie Weiss an arrogant play caller, which was apparently a compliment."
47:21,380;47:28,580;"I don't quite understand how. Yeah, I got a little upset when they said it was in the"
47:28,580;47:33,460;"late second quarter. Like, oh, that's a really good block by Curtis Conway, and he's clearly"
47:33,460;47:40,180;"holding tie law. And then like the same play happens reverse like the Patriots was he was"
47:40,180;47:47,620;"doing a patent or branch. That's a easy call. There's exactly the same play. But at this point,"
47:47,620;47:54,580;"the first few games have been Dan Deodorf and Dick Enberg. And I think I was just so happy not"
47:54,580;47:59,940;"to hear them commentate this game that I just gave both of them a free pass. Like, you know what,"
47:59,940;48:01,200;"I ain't even writing nothing down."
48:01,200;48:02,740;"Like I'm fine with this."
48:02,740;48:06,020;"It's not Dan Deidorff, so I'm happy with it."
48:06,020;48:08,180;"- They did confuse me a little bit though."
48:08,180;48:10,340;"- Okay, let's hear you."
48:10,340;48:11,660;"Yeah, you've got a football and a football."
48:11,660;48:13,940;"Right, you know what this is?"
48:13,940;48:14,780;"- Nope."
48:14,780;48:17,060;"- So Mike started this back in the day"
48:17,060;48:21,660;"and he was confused about some of the terminology"
48:21,660;48:23,380;"that the commentators would use."
48:23,380;48:25,820;"And he wasn't sure if they were talking about football"
48:25,820;48:27,420;"or not football, so he would ask us"
48:27,420;48:28,580;"these questions that we would answer them."
48:28,580;48:31,100;"So it sounds like Steve is at fence found one of these."
48:31,100;48:34,260;"Hey, he said, uh, ball is on Bruce."
48:34,260;48:35,980;"He at the point of contact."
48:35,980;48:36,820;"Excuse me."
48:36,820;48:39,420;"Ball is on Bruce."
48:39,420;48:41,060;"He at the point of contact."
48:41,060;48:42,620;"Do you have any context for this?"
48:42,620;48:46,420;"Was there somebody rubbing up against Teddy Bruce?"
48:46,420;48:47,180;"He at this point?"
48:47,180;48:48,540;"I mean, it's a ball."
48:48,540;48:51,180;"I just see a lot of rubbing was going on in that game."
48:51,180;48:54,540;"There is a lot of contact in this game."
48:54,540;48:58,180;"Um, what the point of contact, you know, like,"
48:58,180;48:59,020;"Like the."
48:59,020;49:01,420;"Yeah, I mean,"
49:01,420;49:03,420;"the ball is the point of contact."
49:03,420;49:05,380;"Where is the is?"
49:05,380;49:07,500;"Why is the ball?"
49:07,500;49:08,900;"Um, risky at the point of contact"
49:08,900;49:11,100;"wouldn't be the balls too."
49:11,100;49:12,180;"You would think it would be the balls."
49:12,180;49:13,980;"Yeah, unless we're talking about."
49:13,980;49:14,740;"Um."
49:14,740;49:20,580;"A lant Armstrong and there was like some sort of situation with that."
49:20,580;49:22,780;"I didn't see any yellow jerseys out there though."
49:22,780;49:26,980;"That's true, but maybe somebody had had a similar situation, if you will."
49:26,980;49:34,340;"Oh, for instance, I don't want to put bad words on our friend Jason ball from London area Hampshire, but I mean,"
49:34,340;49:46,340;"well, how do they call them? Right exactly. Why are they call Jason balls? Yeah, why do they call them Jason balls? Really? I mean, just asking the questions here. A lot of people are saying Jason ball. Why just one?"
49:46,340;49:54,580;"And I was saying I looked him up and I couldn't find him online. Otherwise I was going to try to have him on because that'd be fun. Right."
49:54,580;49:58,180;"He doesn't exist on."
49:58,180;50:00,900;"You probably got the fuck out of London there a long time ago."
50:00,900;50:03,460;"Well, he went and played San Diego."
50:03,460;50:04,500;"Well, please, no more."
50:04,500;50:08,580;"Which did you catch one of the commentators talk about how"
50:08,580;50:14,660;"LT had said that concentrating on football in San Diego was very difficult to do?"
50:14,660;50:15,780;"No."
50:15,780;50:18,340;"And they're like, I bet it is."
50:18,340;50:20,340;"Like, all right, you horny basses."
50:20,340;50:20,980;"Keeping your pants."
50:20,980;50:23,380;"Yeah, he's not Travis Henry over here."
50:23,380;50:53,360;"Yeah, or uh, or Cramarti. Yeah. Forget how many kids he has as you do. He got the number right. He just kind of remember the names or the birthdays or something. There was. Yeah. I think it was the names. It was not great. Um, but the one last thing I want to talk about. Yeah, I thought Connor was going to be here to do this, but he's not. Um, this was in the 2002."
50:53,360;50:59,640;"draft the San Diego Chargers selected in the second round 48th overall a wider"
50:59,640;51:06,780;"receiver from Florida named Riche Caldwell. Oh really? They did so this was Riche"
51:06,780;51:13,440;"Caldwell's rookie season. He didn't play out. He did not I think he probably did"
51:13,440;51:20,440;"but he didn't do anything of note. Oh yeah I didn't see him. No I don't remember."
51:20,440;51:21,440;"He might have something called."
51:21,440;51:23,400;"He might have saw me, but I didn't see."
51:23,400;51:26,540;"He's probably seeing you right now."
51:26,540;51:29,100;"I was so big."
51:29,100;51:33,860;"The one that he doesn't see is the past coming his way when he's wide open on the two-yard line"
51:33,860;51:37,300;"against the Colts and playoffs, but that's another story."
51:37,300;51:42,140;"So I did the charge is digging."
51:42,140;51:46,660;"Oh, we're going to we're doing down the reshape called a little rabbit hole right now."
51:46,660;51:48,340;"I think probably should."
51:49,340;51:51,380;"No, we save reshind it."
51:51,380;51:53,540;"You think we should save or say calls?"
51:53,540;51:55,740;"Oh, yeah. Wait till he comes to us."
51:55,740;51:57,420;"All right."
51:57,420;52:00,780;"So now they're draft picked by the Chargers that hadn't even better name."
52:00,780;52:02,380;"Oh, give it to me."
52:02,380;52:05,060;"Best name of any defensive back ever."
52:05,060;52:06,980;"Really?"
52:06,980;52:08,380;"Quinten jammer."
52:08,380;52:10,060;"Oh, Quinten jammer."
52:10,060;52:11,140;"That's right."
52:11,140;52:12,180;"Pick first."
52:12,180;52:13,820;"Oh, well, fifth overall."
52:13,820;52:14,780;"First round, though."
52:14,780;52:18,020;"I mean, I mean, it is an amazing name."
52:18,380;52:24,020;"It's up there with Thai law because the I mean you don't have the I fought the law and the law one jokes"
52:24,020;52:28,380;"but I mean Quentin jammer as a I feel like he would have to play"
52:28,380;52:34,700;"Like bump and run man to man. All right, like you always zone defensive is not a zone guy"
52:34,700;52:37,940;"Not in a million years. He's got to be like a Brandon Browner type"
52:37,940;52:41,440;"We could probably talk about two because he's got some some interesting"
52:41,440;52:43,900;"post football stories"
52:43,900;52:46,540;"Yeah"
52:46,540;52:47,540;"Is it all right?"
52:47,540;52:49,900;"Uh, yes, he is."
52:49,900;52:50,640;"Okay."
52:50,640;52:51,640;"I thought so."
52:51,640;52:54,800;"Uh, I think violence and drug charges."
52:54,800;52:56,200;"Well, I know what you did."
52:56,200;52:57,520;"Should have landed him in jail."
52:57,520;52:59,180;"I just didn't know if he was there yet."
52:59,180;53:00,640;"I believe so."
53:00,640;53:02,820;"I don't be still in jail, but I know he went to jail for a little bit."
53:02,820;53:04,920;"I don't know if it's, it's still a thing."
53:04,920;53:06,300;"But we'll get to that."
53:06,300;53:07,420;"When, when was he on the team?"
53:07,420;53:11,260;"Was that like 2014 ish?"
53:11,260;53:11,660;"Brown."
53:11,660;53:11,940;"Yeah."
53:11,940;53:12,500;"Fourteen."
53:13,200;53:16,760;"So we'll get to that in 12 seasons."
53:16,760;53:20,920;"So we'll get there like six years, it'd be fine."
53:20,920;53:22,520;"Yeah, we should do."
53:22,520;53:25,000;"Reishi, calm down."
53:25,000;53:27,640;"This is what I mean."
53:27,640;53:28,920;"So."
53:28,920;53:32,840;"Rache Caldwell, if you if you Google him,"
53:32,840;53:37,520;"you know, since the normal stuff comes up, his picture, which"
53:37,520;53:39,240;"always looks like a mug shop."
53:39,240;53:41,760;"But I think that's just how he looks with the eyes."
53:41,760;53:51,600;"There's also a story from ESPN entitled, ""How Rache Called Well Googled His Way From"
53:51,600;53:52,600;"The Patriots to Prison."""
53:52,600;53:54,600;"I'll read that."
53:54,600;54:00,600;"I won't read you the whole thing because that seems like a lot of work and you can"
54:00,600;54:03,160;"read it yourself at www.espn.com."
54:03,160;54:06,960;"But basically, the gist of it is what happened."
54:06,960;54:15,640;"He got arrested for running a sports book out of a mechanic shop across the street from"
54:15,640;54:19,120;"like a middle school."
54:19,120;54:23,400;"Because there was so much traffic going in and out, it got the attention of the authorities"
54:23,400;54:25,160;"and they got arrested for it."
54:25,160;54:31,240;"He was on probation and decided he had heard about buying drugs online, so he Googled it"
54:31,240;54:32,800;"and tried to do it himself."
54:32,800;54:34,520;"He's like, ""There's no way this is a possibility."
54:34,520;54:36,160;"There's no way this is a real thing."""
54:36,160;54:41,660;"Google didn't try to do it while on probation and immediately got caught because all the shit is tracked and"
54:41,660;54:44,380;"ended up in jail for"
54:44,380;54:46,860;"for attempting to buy I"
54:46,860;54:49,220;"Don't even know what I was I was probably just weed"
54:49,220;54:53,740;"But I'm trying buy drugs on I think it was Silk Road"
54:53,740;54:57,240;"And how you really should have seen that coming to his house"
54:57,240;55:01,320;"I mean for"
55:02,640;55:06,340;"And the best part is that that's not it"
55:06,340;55:09,680;"All right"
55:09,680;55:14,240;"Yes as that shamal guy would say shamal guy no the ox queen guy"
55:14,240;55:18,640;"More yes"
55:18,640;55:20,960;"So just recently"
55:20,960;55:23,160;"This story is on Yahoo"
55:23,160;55:25,520;"Sports so sports site Yahoo calm"
55:25,520;55:29,280;"from January 28, 2020"
55:30,280;55:36,720;"So you do the math where we're actually recording this in May May 21st 2020. So not that long ago"
55:36,720;55:39,280;"and"
55:39,280;55:46,120;"It is Rachete Caldwell and Ettrick Prewitt. That is pleading guilty in health fund fraud case"
55:46,120;55:52,520;"And I think we had talked about this before Steve if you remember I may have been Greg that brought it up"
55:52,520;55:55,280;"but basically what happened is a"
55:56,400;56:03,180;"A group of NFL players were shake all well probably being the lookout you me I guess, but who else was on oh?"
56:03,180;56:07,560;"Joe horn was part of this as well. Yeah"
56:07,560;56:11,840;"This is where key on camera in that Saints game. Oh, yeah other plays involved Joe"
56:11,840;56:15,060;"So Joe horn Correll Buckhalter Clinton Portis"
56:15,060;56:18,400;"Tamarick van over from this game. He was the kick returner"
56:18,400;56:23,400;"They kept calling tomorrow, which I thought was weird. So I don't know if I'm saying it wrong or not"
56:23,400;56:25,960;"Those are the big names"
56:25,960;56:36,920;"They were basically defrauding the NFL by filing nearly $4 million worth of false insurance"
56:36,920;56:43,340;"claims in 18 months from the gene upshot NFL player health reimbursement account plan,"
56:43,340;56:44,340;"according to prosecutors."
56:44,340;56:51,280;"So what they would do is they would submit claims to be paid for medical equipment for"
56:51,280;56:56,280;"for players, but it was equipment that they didn't actually buy or receive."
56:56,280;56:57,600;"They just do it to get the money."
56:57,600;57:04,240;"And I think the reason I call it is because the medical equipment was things such as"
57:04,240;57:08,960;"hyperbaric chambers and cryotherapy machines and also have been alleged to have"
57:08,960;57:13,000;"fake prescriptions as well for support for those fraudulent claims."
57:13,000;57:14,040;"So."
57:14,040;57:19,280;"And they call well, how do I commit insurance fraud online?"
57:19,880;57:26,040;"Yeah, be the battery heard from Clinton Portis, you know, the the stellar mind that he is."
57:26,040;57:30,840;"Well, he's going from, you know, up to white collar crayons."
57:30,840;57:35,000;"That's true. Yeah, he's not he's not running a gambling ring out of a"
57:35,000;57:39,720;"out of a storefront across the street from middle school. So that's a step up."
57:39,720;57:42,040;"Yeah, I honestly didn't find that one that bad."
57:42,040;57:47,960;"I think it was the fact that there was so much traffic going in and out across the street from"
57:47,960;57:52,120;"that school was originally got caught. Yeah. If you'd done it literally anywhere else, it would have been fine."
57:52,120;58:00,360;"But yeah, I think the the googling of how to buy drugs online is probably,"
58:00,360;58:05,720;"I don't know if you can say it's a low point. I'm not sure we're there yet."
58:05,720;58:13,000;"Yeah, he's he's the kind of guy who keeps digging. Yeah, I mean, he's always looking forward,"
58:13,000;58:13,840;"it says for sure."
58:13,840;58:17,440;"- Someone's looking for the next opportunity."
58:17,440;58:20,200;"(laughing)"
58:20,200;58:24,320;"- But if you're having a bad day,"
58:24,320;58:27,160;"or you're feeling stressed from work,"
58:27,160;58:30,000;"or you've got some stuff going on at home,"
58:30,000;58:33,920;"just go to google.com and type in Rache Caldwell,"
58:33,920;58:36,000;"R-E-C-H-E, Caldwell."
58:36,000;58:38,860;"And just click on the images button."
58:39,880;58:43,360;"And you will feel a lot better about yourself"
58:43,360;58:46,120;"because these pictures are hysterical."
58:46,120;58:47,560;"- Like a good cat video."
58:47,560;58:52,200;"- Yeah, it's like the football version of a funny cat video."
58:52,200;58:54,320;"Just makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside."
58:54,320;58:58,080;"- Do you remember Chris Berman's nickname for him?"
58:58,080;59:00,360;"- He had a nickname for him?"
59:00,360;59:03,120;"- Yeah, which didn't include his eyes."
59:03,120;59:03,960;"- Really?"
59:03,960;59:05,040;"What was it?"
59:05,040;59:07,600;"- He was ricocheting Richey."
59:07,600;59:08,640;"- Oh really?"
59:08,640;59:10,120;"Ricochet Cola, huh?"
59:10,120;59:13,840;"- I feel like Chris Berman really dropped the ball now."
59:13,840;59:16,720;"- Yeah, I mean, Berman's usually dead all with these things."
59:16,720;59:18,960;"- Usually he's flat on, but maybe he doesn't know."
59:18,960;59:20,680;"- Yeah, Andre Badmoon rising."
59:20,680;59:22,800;"I mean, it's classic."
59:22,800;59:28,880;"I wonder if there's any urban thesaurus entries"
59:28,880;59:30,880;"for Ricochet Cola."
59:30,880;59:34,680;"- Let's not, let's get that and go to the best"
59:34,680;59:36,800;"and we're saying something."
59:37,800;59:38,300;"All right."
59:38,300;59:40,200;"I'll get to the urban day."
59:40,200;59:43,560;"Urban DSRs again."
59:43,560;59:45,280;"Yeah, that-- oh, wow."
59:45,280;59:47,760;"OK."
59:47,760;59:49,160;"Too late."
59:49,160;59:51,120;"Nothing good."
59:51,120;59:53,440;"Tom Brady is the first result."
59:53,440;59:53,740;"I like that."
59:53,740;59:54,840;"That's good."
59:54,840;59:57,120;"All right, so Steve, then, if you want to kick it off,"
59:57,120;59:59,120;"let's hear your best and worst in this game."
59:59,120;01:00:01,280;"[CHUCKLES]"
01:00:01,280;01:00:02,800;"Let's see."
01:00:02,800;01:00:04,920;"I really covered my worst in detail"
01:00:04,920;01:00:07,460;"about how much I hate LT and how"
01:00:07,460;01:00:09,960;"Yeah, you really didn't talk about that much."
01:00:09,960;01:00:12,060;"Give me a little bit of a..."
01:00:12,060;01:00:14,460;"Why do you hate LT?"
01:00:14,460;01:00:19,260;"I don't think because of this game, this is why I got him in Prius Holmes' confused,"
01:00:19,260;01:00:23,360;"but this is all of those crybaby stuff and when they were actually good and we beat him"
01:00:23,360;01:00:24,360;"in the playoffs."
01:00:24,360;01:00:30,060;"Oh yeah, when he called Bellacchica Cheater and says all stars from the top, it goes through"
01:00:30,060;01:00:31,060;"Dirty Team."
01:00:31,060;01:00:33,060;"And Chit and Chokenup and..."
01:00:33,060;01:00:35,060;"Because no Sean Barriman was..."
01:00:35,060;01:00:36,060;"Yeah, we didn't lights out."
01:00:36,060;01:00:38,060;"That's the day I said they were doing yes."
01:00:38,060;01:00:40,660;"He's one of the dirtiest defensive players ever."
01:00:40,660;01:00:42,660;"Okay."
01:00:42,660;01:00:44,660;"Understandable."
01:00:44,660;01:00:47,660;"Yeah, you play for the Jets if I'm not mistaken."
01:00:47,660;01:00:48,660;"Oh, he did, didn't he?"
01:00:48,660;01:00:48,660;"Yeah."
01:00:48,660;01:00:49,660;"Fuck that guy."
01:00:49,660;01:00:51,660;"Another reason they don't take."
01:00:51,660;01:00:56,660;"Steve Brown's a man of simple pleasures and simple haters."
01:00:56,660;01:00:58,660;"I love it."
01:00:58,660;01:01:04,260;"It was awesome to see you know, say out in Rodney Harrison"
01:01:04,260;01:01:08,580;"flying around their youth if they were flying around on our guys and watching"
01:01:08,580;01:01:12,980;"junior say out like mistime oblitz and then like like step on the snap."
01:01:12,980;01:01:17,540;"Yeah, like trying to dance his way back. Yeah, you like really"
01:01:17,540;01:01:22,260;"miss out on that a lot. And so he's just like stuck in no man's land and then"
01:01:22,260;01:01:26,100;"just like kind of dances around a little bit and steps on fucking football."
01:01:26,100;01:01:31,940;"The center is still holding it. Yep. Yeah, that was really funny. That was fantastic."
01:01:32,500;01:01:40,780;"And then I also liked the little game break where they showed Fred Jackson."
01:01:40,780;01:01:46,500;"I mean, yeah, I'll tee Taurus up, but Fred Jackson hung 237 yards on the jets that week."
01:01:46,500;01:01:46,900;"Thank you."
01:01:46,900;01:01:49,100;"I missed that one."
01:01:49,100;01:01:49,900;"That's fantastic."
01:01:49,900;01:01:51,220;"Now it's big on that."
01:01:51,220;01:01:52,100;"Good."
01:01:52,100;01:01:52,620;"Fuck them."
01:01:52,620;01:01:53,300;"Yeah."
01:01:53,300;01:01:54,060;"Fuck the jets, right?"
01:01:54,060;01:01:56,260;"All right, Ryan, let's put you on the spot."
01:01:56,260;01:01:58,940;"But do you have any best and or worse for this game?"
01:02:00,700;01:02:05,980;"I mean, obviously, Brave Bull's touchdown was kind of cool, especially when I was the first one."
01:02:05,980;01:02:08,940;"So now I know why they celebrated like they did."
01:02:08,940;01:02:17,020;"And the worst just that pathetic last drive was just unwatchable."
01:02:17,020;01:02:20,940;"Yeah, that last play was a shitty way to hit a football game."
01:02:20,940;01:02:27,180;"Yeah, and it was reminiscent of a lot of ending of games recently."
01:02:27,180;01:02:29,180;"So it was difficult to watch."
01:02:30,140;01:02:33,540;"Yeah, that makes me sad because it's true."
01:02:33,540;01:02:50,840;"All right, my, my best was Marty Schottenheimer describing the Patriots defensive motion pre snap where he said it looks like spaghetti on a plate."
01:02:50,840;01:02:52,940;"We go basically."
01:02:52,940;01:02:57,420;"He had literally no idea what the Patriots were doing and what they were bringing."
01:02:57,420;01:03:05,260;"And so they had just simplified everything to just basically like all the blocking everything"
01:03:05,260;01:03:06,260;"was completely simplified."
01:03:06,260;01:03:10,380;"They just like blocked the guy who's in front of you because they had no idea what was coming"
01:03:10,380;01:03:16,740;"and the first half you could tell because they had no idea what was going on."
01:03:16,740;01:03:21,780;"See my worst was, I had something here."
01:03:21,780;01:03:24,500;"I mean, other than Troy Brown made hope of this game"
01:03:24,500;01:03:27,740;"because Troy Brown's my friend."
01:03:27,740;01:03:32,220;"Actually, no, my other best was Jason Ball,"
01:03:32,220;01:03:35,100;"the starting center for the San Diego Chargers,"
01:03:35,100;01:03:36,940;"who was from London, Darian New Hampshire,"
01:03:36,940;01:03:38,500;"if you hadn't known that."
01:03:38,500;01:03:45,460;"And played a UNH, which were both Ryan and I went to,"
01:03:45,460;01:03:49,180;"and Greg also, he's just crisis."
01:03:49,180;01:03:51,780;"UNH before they were even relevant though."
01:03:51,780;01:03:52,460;"So yeah."
01:03:52,460;01:03:57,220;"Yeah, this was before the Chip Kelly days when they actually did anything."
01:03:57,220;01:04:01,460;"This was like when they were bad UNH and he still managed to make the NFL."
01:04:01,460;01:04:02,260;"So good for him."
01:04:02,260;01:04:05,220;"Now they're best like they were talking about the guy who"
01:04:05,220;01:04:06,940;"way too much for how crappy he was."
01:04:06,940;01:04:07,700;"Right."
01:04:07,700;01:04:08,940;"But he's from New Hampshire."
01:04:08,940;01:04:10,620;"So fuck it's my best, bro."
01:04:10,620;01:04:12,580;"He's from London."
01:04:12,580;01:04:13,660;"I've been there."
01:04:13,660;01:04:15,140;"I've been to London."
01:04:15,140;01:04:16,540;"I've before that's fucking cool."
01:04:16,540;01:04:17,140;"Yeah."
01:04:17,140;01:04:18,500;"I've been there and regretted it."
01:04:18,500;01:04:23,500;"Well, yeah, that's why he doesn't live anymore probably because it's what in their New Hampshire."
01:04:23,500;01:04:26,500;"Oh, I regret it being there."
01:04:26,500;01:04:31,500;"Oh, it's speaking of best."
01:04:31,500;01:04:35,500;"Another best is that Greg Brown is actually just joined us."
01:04:35,500;01:04:40,500;"As we're wrapping up the show, yes."
01:04:40,500;01:04:41,500;"Great."
01:04:41,500;01:04:43,500;"Just as I am in balls."
01:04:43,500;01:04:55,220;"Oh, my worst is the music during the stoppage in play in San Diego in 2002."
01:04:55,220;01:04:59,780;"I don't remember all the songs, but I definitely recognize one of them is Avril Lavigne."
01:04:59,780;01:05:02,500;"And I think that's just the worst regards to it."
01:05:02,500;01:05:03,500;"That's a good sign for me."
01:05:03,500;01:05:06,820;"Early for Avril Lavigne 2002."
01:05:06,820;01:05:07,820;"Look it up bro."
01:05:07,820;01:05:08,820;"That seems right."
01:05:08,820;01:05:09,820;"Yeah."
01:05:09,820;01:05:10,820;"That was in 2002."
01:05:10,820;01:05:12,540;"It wasn't a great era of music."
01:05:12,540;01:05:15,220;"No, no, it was like the 80s."
01:05:15,220;01:05:17,420;"I stick to that."
01:05:17,420;01:05:18,860;"No good music came out of the 80s."
01:05:18,860;01:05:21,180;"Set maybe Metallica."
01:05:21,180;01:05:23,180;"Yeah, 2000."
01:05:23,180;01:05:25,580;"Stat check."
01:05:25,580;01:05:27,620;"Doesn't do like her."
01:05:27,620;01:05:29,340;"Let's go and she took off."
01:05:29,340;01:05:30,660;"Say there you go."
01:05:30,660;01:05:32,580;"And they were playing it in stadiums."
01:05:32,580;01:05:35,140;"Yeah, across California, apparently."
01:05:35,140;01:05:39,900;"I haven't heard it in East Coast games that we've we've played, but."
01:05:41,980;01:05:45,940;"Definitely had it for this one and I was disappointed in the in the San Diego crowd"
01:05:45,940;01:05:53,580;"Yeah for a land in a Canadian - come on this is America. This is what I mean like this is this is American football"
01:05:53,580;01:05:57,860;"Why you playing Canadian Czech girl? Maybe at a hockey game?"
01:05:57,860;01:06:04,020;"Your figure skating"
01:06:04,020;01:06:07,100;"Hey, let's go see a game boss"
01:06:09,460;01:06:14,500;"All right, well Greg Brown has now joined twice and has failed both times"
01:06:14,500;01:06:23,460;"So it's not just you Ryan who sucks the technology. It's also our brother Greg"
01:06:23,460;01:06:29,460;"How much help did you have?"
01:06:29,460;01:06:35,460;"I rest my case"
01:06:35,460;01:06:37,460;"The fact that your name comes up as Alicia"
01:06:37,460;01:06:46,340;"All right, Steve give me give me some game balls"
01:06:46,340;01:06:49,900;"I'm going on the on branch"
01:06:49,900;01:06:52,700;"Okay"
01:06:52,700;01:06:54,700;"electric rookie start to"
01:06:54,700;01:07:01,020;"Yeah, actually pretty illustrious career all things. Yeah, this is definitely a breakout game for my degree"
01:07:01,660;01:07:06,940;"I'll take it. Yeah, I mean everyone says Tom Brady can't develop or work your receiver"
01:07:06,940;01:07:08,780;"And maybe that was true later in his career"
01:07:08,780;01:07:15,500;"But I'm like from the jump Dion was awesome and then this game especially this is his fourth ever career game"
01:07:15,500;01:07:20,140;"Yep, Troy Brown is out and it's like all right"
01:07:20,140;01:07:23,420;"Yeah, I know this is the game for but now you're Troy Brown"
01:07:23,420;01:07:29,660;"Yeah, and he was he was lighting it up especially the first half have he seemed to slow down a little bit in the second, but right"
01:07:29,660;01:07:31,500;"Well, I think a lot of us did"
01:07:31,500;01:07:36,140;"Yeah, his kick return ability that he didn't show much of this game, but still"
01:07:36,140;01:07:38,700;"I thought yeah, you had a couple though. Pretty good"
01:07:38,700;01:07:45,740;"You can't back out to like the 30-yard line every time this game and the beginning the season that they found they definitely found some awesome"
01:07:45,740;01:07:48,100;"Dion branch. Yeah, no, they definitely did I"
01:07:48,100;01:07:52,100;"Agree was he drafted right story. What was he drafted?"
01:07:52,100;01:07:57,660;"Where was he out?"
01:07:57,660;01:07:59,700;"Yeah, I"
01:07:59,700;01:08:03,380;"I remember. I don't think it was the first round was it?"
01:08:03,380;01:08:06,300;"Second round 65 overall."
01:08:06,300;01:08:09,140;"I have Louisville."
01:08:09,140;01:08:12,420;"Don't draft your series on the first round."
01:08:12,420;01:08:13,540;"This is Chad Jackson."
01:08:13,540;01:08:16,100;"They prefer to be called Lewisville."
01:08:16,100;01:08:19,300;"I don't know if they do, but OK."
01:08:19,300;01:08:22,860;"They do. I know many people from Lewisville, and that's how they actually"
01:08:22,860;01:08:24,020;"prefer to be."
01:08:24,020;01:08:25,340;"I don't know that you do."
01:08:25,340;01:08:27,980;"I know from Lewisville."
01:08:29,020;01:08:32,620;"But you also call it a Cabernet when you order wine."
01:08:32,620;01:08:34,660;"Peanut Grigiot."
01:08:34,660;01:08:36,620;"So French prefer that to Andy."
01:08:36,620;01:08:39,540;"Some fucking culture."
01:08:39,540;01:08:41,940;"Hard teased French love him."
01:08:41,940;01:08:44,980;"The letters are there."
01:08:44,980;01:08:46,180;"You might as well pronounce them."
01:08:46,180;01:08:50,540;"Oh, Jesus."
01:08:50,540;01:08:51,620;"All right."
01:08:51,620;01:08:52,700;"That's not his first name."
01:08:52,700;01:08:55,020;"No, it's Anthony."
01:08:55,020;01:08:57,340;"You knew that?"
01:08:57,820;01:09:03,820;"No, I'm just like at the same page you are. Anthony Dion Branch Jr."
01:09:03,820;01:09:12,940;"Sweet from Albany, Georgia. How about that? All right, Ryan, give us your game."
01:09:12,940;01:09:14,300;"Ball, who'd you give it to in this game?"
01:09:14,300;01:09:18,380;"Well, I was going to go with the on branch, but that's not fun. So"
01:09:18,380;01:09:24,060;"I guess I know of Raibel, like Greg pointed out, he had some good defensive"
01:09:24,060;01:09:28,180;"plays, you know, you bad the ball down, you seem to be a typical"
01:09:28,180;01:09:32,660;"able game really, he's always this from the first touchdown catch"
01:09:32,660;01:09:37,300;"out there for him. I mean, you know, the fence of guys. So I'm"
01:09:37,300;01:09:40,300;"told by the deardorfs of the world, etc. The fun to guys"
01:09:40,300;01:09:43,660;"love that kind of shit. So the game for him."
01:09:43,660;01:09:50,980;"Jesus. Fuck you and your dear North. Call him. Did you know"
01:09:50,980;01:09:52,300;"Oh, he's in the Hall of Fame."
01:09:52,300;01:09:53,800;"I did."
01:09:53,800;01:09:55,740;"Fuck you for knowing that."
01:09:55,740;01:09:58,020;"We're probably announcing, right?"
01:09:58,020;01:09:58,420;"Yes."
01:09:58,420;01:09:59,220;"Well, yeah."
01:09:59,220;01:10:01,420;"I mean, it could be for football."
01:10:01,420;01:10:03,020;"He's not good at either of them."
01:10:03,020;01:10:06,020;"I was going to say, I mean--"
01:10:06,020;01:10:10,580;"Even though he was like, I'm an on at this part of his career."
01:10:10,580;01:10:13,500;"Like, he didn't play that much last year."
01:10:13,500;01:10:14,660;"No, he didn't."
01:10:14,660;01:10:17,180;"This was-- yeah, this was like the beginning of my career."
01:10:17,180;01:10:19,220;"He looks like-- this is his best offensive game"
01:10:19,220;01:10:20,740;"I'd seen up to this point from him."
01:10:20,740;01:10:21,500;"Yeah."
01:10:21,500;01:10:21,940;"Yeah."
01:10:21,940;01:10:25,100;"I think it's probably the, the, the charges."
01:10:25,100;01:10:27,460;"Super ball, the, uh, uh, panther."
01:10:27,460;01:10:27,980;"Super ball."
01:10:27,980;01:10:28,820;"This probably is peak."
01:10:28,820;01:10:30,220;"That touchdown."
01:10:30,220;01:10:32,860;"He had seemed like energizing because he was a beast on the defense."
01:10:32,860;01:10:34,260;"Like immediately after it to."
01:10:34,260;01:10:34,980;"Yeah."
01:10:34,980;01:10:35,300;"Yeah."
01:10:35,300;01:10:35,620;"It was."
01:10:35,620;01:10:35,780;"Yeah."
01:10:35,780;01:10:36,860;"For the rest of that, that half."
01:10:36,860;01:10:37,680;"It's great."
01:10:37,680;01:10:39,820;"How many tt catches does he have on his career?"
01:10:39,820;01:10:42,220;"Uh, yes."
01:10:42,220;01:10:42,980;"12."
01:10:42,980;01:10:44,260;"I'm going to say,"
01:10:44,260;01:10:45,740;"Patre's Dye."
01:10:45,740;01:10:45,940;"See."
01:10:45,940;01:10:46,620;"Dot com."
01:10:47,660;01:10:51,340;"page.c.info/TomBradyTD passes."
01:10:51,340;01:10:57,620;"He has, he's actually a high up on the list, surprisingly."
01:10:57,620;01:11:00,420;"He has 10 touchdown passes."
01:11:00,420;01:11:04,700;"He is 16th on the list of touchdown passes from Tom Brady."
01:11:04,700;01:11:06,740;"Follow his career."
01:11:06,740;01:11:07,980;"So it must have caught some in KCC."
01:11:07,980;01:11:09,020;"I think you did."
01:11:09,020;01:11:10,060;"I think you got a couple of KCC."
01:11:10,060;01:11:16,220;"But he has more touchdown catches than Philip or set or Brandon"
01:11:16,220;01:11:17,220;"I felt it."
01:11:17,220;01:11:21,820;"Or branding cooks or your bar gaffy."
01:11:21,820;01:11:24,020;"More touchdowns and intersections."
01:11:24,020;01:11:26,620;"Yeah, fucking right."
01:11:26,620;01:11:31,480;"Yes, more than twice as many touchdowns as Aaron Dobson did or Malcolm Mitchell or Josh"
01:11:31,480;01:11:32,480;"Gordon."
01:11:32,480;01:11:33,480;"That's amazing."
01:11:33,480;01:11:36,940;"How does that make you feel?"
01:11:36,940;01:11:39,540;"All those players have four touchdowns."
01:11:39,540;01:11:41,540;"Oh, God."
01:11:41,540;01:11:45,780;"Can we talk about how Dor set sucks horribly real quick?"
01:11:45,780;01:11:48,820;"I feel like he had to get some off your chest."
01:11:48,820;01:11:49,820;"So let's see that."
01:11:49,820;01:11:50,820;"I hate that guy."
01:11:50,820;01:11:51,820;"He sucks."
01:11:51,820;01:11:52,820;"Wow."
01:11:52,820;01:11:55,780;"This is the first like bit of like hot take passionate bird out of you."
01:11:55,780;01:11:56,780;"But so he was horrible."
01:11:56,780;01:11:57,780;"Yeah."
01:11:57,780;01:11:58,780;"He was horrible."
01:11:58,780;01:11:59,780;"He couldn't."
01:11:59,780;01:12:00,780;"I thought he was okay."
01:12:00,780;01:12:01,780;"Got no separation."
01:12:01,780;01:12:02,780;"He was never in the right fucking spot."
01:12:02,780;01:12:05,620;"He couldn't be relied on and they fucking needed him."
01:12:05,620;01:12:06,620;"He was useless."
01:12:06,620;01:12:11,060;"And the only one to catch a touchdown in the Super Bowl against the Rams."
01:12:11,060;01:12:13,360;"So the second one, that whole playoff series."
01:12:13,360;01:12:15,020;"What?"
01:12:15,020;01:12:15,860;"I'm pretty sure."
01:12:15,860;01:12:17,480;"I want to catch a touchdown to playoffs."
01:12:17,480;01:12:17,780;"Yeah."
01:12:17,780;01:12:21,680;"You see the only touch sounds all playoffs that year."
01:12:21,680;01:12:23,940;"Yeah, that's true."
01:12:23,940;01:12:25,360;"Caught one against."
01:12:25,360;01:12:30,800;"When it gets to choose and when it gets the chargers."
01:12:30,800;01:12:33,900;"And when Sony cleaned up a lot near the goal line, but."
01:12:33,900;01:12:37,860;"Yeah, I thought he was like a good three receiver."
01:12:37,860;01:12:39,700;"He was never going to never awesome, but."
01:12:40,060;01:12:42,060;"Yeah, it's like him or, you know,"
01:12:42,060;01:12:43,620;"Sid Jacoby,"
01:12:43,620;01:12:45,580;"when he's looking at that guy,"
01:12:45,580;01:12:48,340;"like he's probably better than"
01:12:48,340;01:12:50,180;"Caldwell."
01:12:50,180;01:12:52,380;"Well, oh,"
01:12:52,380;01:12:53,380;"right. Sorry."
01:12:53,380;01:12:55,940;"Rache Caldwell or Phil Dorset."
01:12:55,940;01:12:57,340;"Yeah."
01:12:57,340;01:12:59,220;"I was thinking Caldwell."
01:12:59,220;01:13:01,300;"Oh, Jesus."
01:13:01,300;01:13:02,660;"You remember one play."
01:13:02,660;01:13:05,180;"It wasn't good, but he wasn't."
01:13:05,180;01:13:07,220;"I don't know. Dorset pissed me off, man."
01:13:07,220;01:13:09,180;"Okay."
01:13:09,180;01:13:15,500;"Never when you need it on, you know, it's like, even when they have actual receivers,"
01:13:15,500;01:13:21,000;"like obviously Edelman's gonna draw multiple guys, you know, back when they had Kroc, he's"
01:13:21,000;01:13:25,880;"gonna draw multiple guys. Even when Forsad had single coverage, you can never get open."
01:13:25,880;01:13:33,640;"You're supposed to be fast and all this shit. I don't like him."
01:13:33,640;01:13:36,400;"And then he leaves and he's like, oh, yeah, I need to get out of there."
01:13:36,400;01:13:37,240;"Blah, blah, blah."
01:13:37,240;01:13:40,520;"Yeah, because you just talked here."
01:13:40,520;01:13:41,800;"All right."
01:13:41,800;01:13:47,560;"Rather have him or the number three receiver on the O six Patriots."
01:13:47,560;01:13:49,760;"Was that gaffney?"
01:13:49,760;01:13:50,360;"Exactly."
01:13:50,360;01:13:51,280;"Yeah."
01:13:51,280;01:13:52,760;"Oh, definitely one gaffney."
01:13:52,760;01:13:53,560;"Gaffney was great."
01:13:53,560;01:13:56,000;"Doug Gabriel."
01:13:56,000;01:13:57,400;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:57,400;01:13:58,120;"All right."
01:13:58,120;01:13:59,680;"The Gabriel is not very good."
01:13:59,680;01:14:00,960;"Gabriel."
01:14:03,240;01:14:08,520;"Yeah, Drew Bargaffy, I think it was one, a Troy Brown at the end of his career."
01:14:08,520;01:14:10,680;"Doug Gabriel and Richey Caldwell."
01:14:10,680;01:14:21,200;"So for you ever talking about a reception yards in 2006, Richey Caldwell first, Ben Watson, second Troy Brown, third, Kevin Falk, fourth, Doug Gabriel fifth."
01:14:21,200;01:14:25,720;"Yeah, that was complaining about last year."
01:14:25,720;01:14:27,240;"You can always be worse, buddy."
01:14:27,240;01:14:30,320;"That was the reason the Patriots went out and got what?"
01:14:31,160;01:14:32,920;"door set in with Gabriel on that."
01:14:32,920;01:14:34,400;"I forgot how."
01:14:34,400;01:14:36,600;"No, door sets are better."
01:14:36,600;01:14:38,480;"There's a lot of good better than"
01:14:38,480;01:14:39,520;"Doug Gabriel."
01:14:39,520;01:14:41,400;"I'm saying like he would be in that"
01:14:41,400;01:14:42,160;"same spot."
01:14:42,160;01:14:46,120;"I really have like 2006 Watson and"
01:14:46,120;01:14:46,880;"what else do you say?"
01:14:46,880;01:14:47,760;"Fuck and"
01:14:47,760;01:14:49,280;"Troy Brown."
01:14:49,280;01:14:50,240;"Troy Brown."
01:14:50,240;01:14:51,080;"Yeah."
01:14:51,080;01:14:52,600;"End of his career Troy Brown."
01:14:52,600;01:14:53,520;"Yeah."
01:14:53,520;01:14:54,240;"Yeah."
01:14:54,240;01:14:56,920;"Greg, nice to see you."
01:14:56,920;01:14:57,880;"You want to give us your best and"
01:14:57,880;01:14:58,880;"worse?"
01:14:58,880;01:15:00,080;"Hey guys."
01:15:00,080;01:15:02,180;"(laughing)"
01:15:02,180;01:15:03,020;"- My late?"
01:15:03,020;01:15:06,460;"- Yeah, we're literally stopping now."
01:15:06,460;01:15:07,860;"(laughing)"
01:15:07,860;01:15:09,100;"- Perfect timing."
01:15:09,100;01:15:11,300;"What game are we talking about?"
01:15:11,300;01:15:13,180;"(laughing)"
01:15:13,180;01:15:17,180;"- 2002, week four against at San Diego Chargers."
01:15:17,180;01:15:18,020;"- Doesn't matter."
01:15:18,020;01:15:18,860;"- Watching any of us."
01:15:18,860;01:15:19,700;"- Yeah, he didn't watch it."
01:15:19,700;01:15:20,780;"- Did we win?"
01:15:20,780;01:15:22,020;"- No."
01:15:22,020;01:15:23,180;"- Goddamn it."
01:15:23,180;01:15:24,220;"- I was in England at the time"
01:15:24,220;01:15:26,900;"and I stayed up til 2 a.m. to watch it"
01:15:26,900;01:15:29,180;"and had to be a worker at 4 a.m."
01:15:29,180;01:15:30,180;"And they're lost."
01:15:30,180;01:15:31,180;"It sucked."
01:15:31,180;01:15:32,300;"What's your best and worst?"
01:15:32,300;01:15:33,860;"Sorry, I lost you there."
01:15:33,860;01:15:35,300;"What'd you say?"
01:15:35,300;01:15:38,500;"I'd say what's your best and worst?"
01:15:38,500;01:15:43,660;"Oh, well, my best was Ryan's story's performance today."
01:15:43,660;01:15:46,500;"You know, he really brings the levity."
01:15:46,500;01:15:48,100;"Yeah, I'm tired not hot pigs."
01:15:48,100;01:15:48,660;"Lashing right."
01:15:48,660;01:15:49,940;"I couldn't keep fuckers."
01:15:49,940;01:15:51,500;"I don't open heartaches."
01:15:51,500;01:15:55,820;"Just wasn't build road on anything at all."
01:15:55,820;01:15:59,140;"And my worst is that massive nosey."
01:15:59,140;01:16:01,220;"He's got plastered on his face."
01:16:01,220;01:16:03,260;"(laughing)"
01:16:03,260;01:16:04,980;"- The closest thing this podcast has"
01:16:04,980;01:16:06,620;"that Kent Walters showed you is careful."
01:16:06,620;01:16:09,260;"(laughing)"
01:16:09,260;01:16:12,420;"- Yeah, my best is Ryan's story, sense of smell."
01:16:12,420;01:16:14,660;"(laughing)"
01:16:14,660;01:16:19,740;"- He doesn't even need GPS, he just follows his nose."
01:16:19,740;01:16:22,260;"(laughing)"
01:16:22,260;01:16:24,500;"That's what I tell him every time he asks for direction."
01:16:24,500;01:16:26,340;"- Follow the smell of your musk."
01:16:26,340;01:16:28,020;"(laughing)"
01:16:28,020;01:16:36,500;"be fair, I do have a strong musk so it does well. Alright, well thanks for joining Greg,"
01:16:36,500;01:16:44,140;"but this has been a fantastic episode of the Page's Dynasty podcast. Do you know what's"

01:17:15,100;01:17:17,820;"Against the three and one doing on Patriots"

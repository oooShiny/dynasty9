00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:23,880;"I am not your mother."
00:23,880;00:27,120;"Welcome back to the Page of Dinesy podcast."
00:27,120;00:29,360;"- Manny Brown, I'm here today, my brothers,"
00:29,360;00:31,860;"both brothers, Steve Engreg, Steve, how you doing?"
00:31,860;00:34,520;"- Perrific."
00:34,520;00:35,520;"- Oh, God."
00:35,520;00:39,080;"- New dog dad, Steve Brown."
00:39,080;00:42,320;"- Yeah, but I said I was Perrific, Andy, not Barker-Rific."
00:42,320;00:47,480;"- Oh, we're gonna, one's punky on the other."
00:47,480;00:50,800;"- You got a woofer, a little baby woofer is part of family."
00:50,800;00:53,040;"He's a doggy gay, you know."
00:53,040;00:54,280;"- A little fur baby."
00:54,280;00:57,080;"- Do you have a bumper sticker where it's you?"
00:57,080;01:01,400;"your girlfriend and the dog now is stick figures? Wait, wait, Greg, you hate for a baby, don't"
01:01,400;01:07,800;"you? Of course. Oh, yeah, I'm definitely going to call the dog on my fur baby all. I expect"
01:07,800;01:13,800;"nothing less. In fact, while you were until now, because I hate you. While you were, but"
01:13,800;01:18,360;"while you were out of the room just now before we started recording me and Eddie were discussing"
01:18,360;01:23,160;"and we came to the agreement that it's very fitting that you got the runt of the litter"
01:23,160;01:26,160;"because you're the runt of mom and dad's litter."
01:26,160;01:28,760;"Yeah, I guess that's fair."
01:28,760;01:29,160;"I don't know."
01:29,160;01:31,960;"I don't use a smallest, but we were certainly the last."
01:31,960;01:35,160;"Well, just the dumbest and most uncouth."
01:35,160;01:38,160;"Yeah, I want to my dog to be like me, Greg."
01:38,160;01:39,440;"The runtiest."
01:39,440;01:39,960;"Yeah."
01:39,960;01:40,960;"Runtiest."
01:40,960;01:44,200;"The runtiest of the brown litter, Steven."
01:44,200;01:47,160;"Oh, God."
01:47,160;01:49,120;"Mom is now yelling at this podcast."
01:49,120;01:50,760;"Yeah, that's not true."
01:50,760;01:52,960;"And Greg's the prettiest of the brown brothers."
01:52,960;01:59,280;"Well played well played."
01:59,280;02:02,840;"Well, if you haven't figured out by now, this is a podcast where we talk about Patriots"
02:02,840;02:04,480;"games from 20 years ago."
02:04,480;02:10,840;"Well, first Steve, have you how many times have you picked up shit with your hands?"
02:10,840;02:11,840;"None."
02:11,840;02:12,840;"None."
02:12,840;02:14,840;"Is the dog shit yet?"
02:14,840;02:15,840;"Yeah."
02:15,840;02:16,840;"They do."
02:16,840;02:19,240;"- Griggers, stretching it, right?"
02:19,240;02:21,080;"- You're repeating your limits of his knowledge here."
02:21,080;02:22,720;"(laughing)"
02:22,720;02:24,240;"- Yeah, we have a yarn, just sheds in the yard"
02:24,240;02:25,480;"and then he's a pooper scooper."
02:25,480;02:26,800;"- All right, good."
02:26,800;02:29,880;"See, that's what I'd never be able to do with dogs"
02:29,880;02:31,000;"is the shitting."
02:31,000;02:32,120;"- Yeah."
02:32,120;02:33,360;"Good thing you want to get a baby"
02:33,360;02:35,400;"'cause then you can just have the shit all over your hands"
02:35,400;02:36,400;"and then it's bad."
02:36,400;02:38,040;"- But it's also, it's another human."
02:38,040;02:41,640;"Like us, the most evolved species on earth humans"
02:41,640;02:44,320;"are waiting for a dog to shit, following it around"
02:44,320;02:46,280;"and then picking it up with our hands"
02:46,280;02:48,680;"And they're like, I got this for you."
02:48,680;02:51,200;"Let me just take care of this."
02:51,200;02:53,920;"It's like, what have we come to that that's acceptable?"
02:53,920;02:57,480;"We should ask Kelly what she thinks about it."
02:57,480;02:58,720;"I bet she's still doing it."
02:58,720;03:02,480;"At least if I pick up a human shit, it's humans, you know?"
03:02,480;03:03,280;"I think it's worse."
03:03,280;03:04,440;"It feels worse to me."
03:04,440;03:05,200;"I don't know why."
03:05,200;03:10,480;"Speaking of human shit, this week we're"
03:10,480;03:12,960;"talking about the Jacksonville Jaguars."
03:12,960;03:14,480;"Good transition, Andy."
03:14,480;03:15,980;"I don't know what I said with this."
03:15,980;03:17,480;"As far as I got though."
03:17,480;03:18,960;"- You didn't know why there's that much, huh?"
03:18,960;03:20,960;"- Jack Del Rio, I guess, maybe."
03:20,960;03:21,800;"- I don't know, whatever."
03:21,800;03:24,560;"- Head coach, rookie head coach, Jack Del Rio."
03:24,560;03:25,800;"His first game."
03:25,800;03:26,800;"- ADR."
03:26,800;03:30,840;"- Yeah, his first attempt at the playing the Patriots."
03:30,840;03:32,840;"First of six times that he would play the Patriots."
03:32,840;03:35,200;"Wanna guess how many times he would beat them?"
03:35,200;03:37,080;"- Zero, none."
03:37,080;03:38,440;"None, you didn't mean to say this."
03:38,440;03:40,160;"- And it was never close."
03:40,160;03:43,560;"The average margin of victory against Jack Del Rio teams"
03:43,560;03:44,400;"almost three touchdowns."
03:44,400;03:45,260;"It's 18 points."
03:45,260;03:50,680;"And Brady averaged a 126 quarterback rating."
03:50,680;03:52,760;"That being said, I thought the Jaguars played pretty"
03:52,760;03:53,760;"competitively in this game."
03:53,760;03:56,880;"Yeah, because they came in at four and nine."
03:56,880;03:58,400;"So this was supposed to be like another trap game."
03:58,400;04:00,200;"Like the Texans was a few weeks ago."
04:00,200;04:04,520;"But it didn't feel that way."
04:04,520;04:06,080;"And Belichick wasn't talking about that way."
04:06,080;04:07,120;"Not that he would, but."
04:07,120;04:10,000;"Well, this is like a decent roster."
04:10,000;04:11,000;"Yeah."
04:11,000;04:14,000;"And I think the Jaguars were kind of hot at the time too."
04:14,000;04:14,800;"They came in."
04:14,800;04:17,560;"Yeah, they started one seven, right?"
04:17,560;04:19,600;"And then they'd started playing better."
04:19,600;04:21,900;"They beat the culture this season."
04:21,900;04:22,900;"They'd hung with the Titans."
04:22,900;04:25,900;"I guess they said they were on the two yard line with the"
04:25,900;04:27,900;"sides at the end of the game, but couldn't finish that."
04:27,900;04:32,200;"And last week, the week before this game, they beat the hell out of the Texans."
04:32,200;04:35,500;"27 nothing who gave the pages run for their money a few weeks ago."
04:35,500;04:40,600;"So speaking of Titans, I saw this when I was doing my research for this podcast."
04:40,800;04:46,200;"Yeah, we call the box."
04:46,200;04:48,280;"The buccaneers, the box."
04:48,280;04:51,400;"We call the jaguars, the jags."
04:51,400;04:53,440;"What do we call the titans?"
04:53,440;04:57,960;"The tithes, the tits."
04:57,960;05:02,400;"I'm going to see."
05:02,400;05:02,920;"I'm going to."
05:02,920;05:03,880;"That's my research."
05:03,880;05:05,040;"That's how I research."
05:05,040;05:07,840;"But sure is you don't want to."
05:07,840;05:10,440;"You want us to know what I want to know what I do is like."
05:10,640;05:11,640;"I Google search."
05:11,640;05:19,040;"I Google Jack simple Jaguar's funny and Jackson ball Jaguar is sad."
05:19,040;05:21,040;"What comes on?"
05:21,040;05:26,080;"I feel like you need a third Google search, which is Jack's little Jaguar is stupid."
05:26,080;05:27,080;"Stupid."
05:27,080;05:28,080;"Yes."
05:28,080;05:29,560;"I feel like that might kind of broad."
05:29,560;05:31,720;"Jackable Jaguars, Florida man."
05:31,720;05:35,280;"Ooh, they are very Florida man team."
05:35,280;05:36,280;"Right."
05:36,280;05:39,640;"So Greg, did you want to talk about these Jack's little Jaguars a bit?"
05:39,640;05:40,480;"- Sure, yeah."
05:40,480;05:42,040;"- All right, what do you got?"
05:42,040;05:46,000;"- Well, I figured like since they're like a relatively new team,"
05:46,000;05:48,800;"you can really kind of like quickly go over"
05:48,800;05:50,920;"like the history of the franchise."
05:50,920;05:52,000;"- Like the whole thing, yeah."
05:52,000;05:53,000;"- Yeah."
05:53,000;05:56,800;"So they're a 95 expansion team."
05:56,800;05:59,040;"'Cause I think, you know, we have this perception"
05:59,040;06:03,160;"that the Jags are like, like the Browns"
06:03,160;06:05,440;"in that category of like perennial losers."
06:05,440;06:07,120;"But I don't think that's their reputation"
06:07,120;06:08,400;"going into this game."
06:08,400;06:09,240;"- I agree."
06:09,240;06:11,960;"- Are we played them in an AFC Championship game?"
06:11,960;06:16,160;"- Yes, which I, we played them twice in the playoffs"
06:16,160;06:17,720;"before this, which I forgot."
06:17,720;06:18,960;"- I forgot the second one."
06:18,960;06:22,400;"- Yeah, so they're a 95 expansion team."
06:22,400;06:24,420;"They have like a decent record their first year,"
06:24,420;06:26,400;"which was like kind of out of the norm."
06:26,400;06:28,880;"They got Mark Brunel and Tom Coughlin,"
06:28,880;06:30,080;"which I think had a lot to do"
06:30,080;06:32,360;"with some of their early success."
06:32,360;06:33,920;"So their second year in the league,"
06:33,920;06:36,800;"they make the AFC Championship game,"
06:36,800;06:41,240;"- We lose to the Patriots, that's the year we go to the Super Bowl against the Packers."
06:41,240;06:43,240;"- Packers, right."
06:43,240;06:46,580;"- Because the Panthers were the other expansion team, I think they also made the"
06:46,580;06:47,580;"- Yeah. - the NFC Championship game."
06:47,580;06:49,380;"- I think you were right. - In the second season."
06:49,380;06:50,380;"- Mm-hmm. - Both captains."
06:50,380;06:51,380;"- In the second season, both captains."
06:51,380;06:52,380;"- In the second season, this year."
06:52,380;06:56,880;"- So then they have like a bunch of winning seasons within their first like six or seven"
06:56,880;06:57,880;"years."
06:57,880;07:05,320;"So 1998, they went 11 and five and they beat the Patriots in the wildcard game."
07:05,320;07:06,560;"Do you remember that?"
07:06,560;07:08,480;"I had no recollection of this."
07:08,480;07:09,920;"- What year was that?"
07:09,920;07:13,320;"- 1998, that was the Robert Edwards year."
07:13,320;07:15,320;"- Oh, right, right."
07:15,320;07:16,440;"- So I think the path's kind of like"
07:16,440;07:18,240;"back door into the playoffs anyways."
07:18,240;07:19,080;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
07:19,080;07:21,360;"- And they had to go to Jacksonville and they lost."
07:21,360;07:22,800;"- That was the Pete Carroll days."
07:22,800;07:24,200;"- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
07:24,200;07:25,040;"- Yeah."
07:25,040;07:29,880;"1992, or 1999, they went 14 and two."
07:29,880;07:30,880;"- Holy shit."
07:30,880;07:31,720;"- Yeah."
07:32,720;07:36,040;"And this was like, it's let me down a further rabbit hole,"
07:36,040;07:38,400;"but their divisional game,"
07:38,400;07:42,960;"they were playing the Dolphins in Marino's last game."
07:42,960;07:44,800;"- Oh, I remember this."
07:44,800;07:45,920;"- I don't remember this at all."
07:45,920;07:47,160;"- I remember this game."
07:47,160;07:48,960;"Not a great way to go out."
07:48,960;07:52,680;"- This Marino's last game was so ridiculous."
07:52,680;07:56,880;"The Jacksonville beat Miami 62 to seven."
07:56,880;07:57,720;"- Yeah."
07:57,720;07:58,720;"- In the playoffs."
07:58,720;08:00,200;"In the playoffs."
08:01,280;08:03,480;"It was, I got some notes here on this."
08:03,480;08:07,080;"It was 38 to nothing before Dammarino"
08:07,080;08:09,120;"through a completed pass."
08:09,120;08:10,040;"- Oh, wow."
08:10,040;08:11,240;"- To his own team though."
08:11,240;08:14,000;"He'd rate them two interceptions at that point."
08:14,000;08:16,600;"Before he had completed a pass to his own team."
08:16,600;08:18,440;"It was 38 to nothing."
08:18,440;08:21,320;"- Oh, what was the time left?"
08:21,320;08:22,640;"Was it like the second half or was it?"
08:22,640;08:24,080;"- Middle of the second quarter."
08:24,080;08:26,280;"- Oh, wait, I'm on to that."
08:26,280;08:27,120;"- Yeah."
08:27,960;08:33,760;"They had Jacksonville had their backup quarterback in the game in the first half."
08:33,760;08:36,560;"Oh my God."
08:36,560;08:37,080;"Which I did."
08:37,080;08:38,080;"Jay Fiedler."
08:38,080;08:38,440;"Yeah."
08:38,440;08:41,120;"I'd come in for Brunel in the first half."
08:41,120;08:45,880;"Um, the total yards at the end of the game."
08:45,880;08:52,240;"Miami had 131 and Jacksonville at 520 Jesus."
08:52,240;08:53,480;"Nevermind."
08:53,480;08:55,520;"Like the interception return for touchdown."
08:55,520;08:55,760;"Yeah."
08:55,760;08:56,160;"Yeah."
08:56,160;08:56,520;"Yeah."
08:56,520;08:57,520;"Yeah, with all that."
08:57,520;08:58,840;"That's just offensive yards."
08:58,840;09:00,080;"62 to 7."
09:00,080;09:03,640;"And that was the same week that Bill"
09:03,640;09:06,800;"Belichick was a head coach of the New"
09:06,800;09:07,800;"York Jets."
09:07,800;09:10,440;"He was only head coach for a day."
09:10,440;09:12,080;"Oh, no."
09:12,080;09:12,880;"Yeah."
09:12,880;09:14,360;"So as the end of that season when"
09:14,360;09:15,960;"Belichick did that whole, I'm going"
09:15,960;09:17,800;"with the Jets back door and back onto"
09:17,800;09:18,320;"the path."
09:18,320;09:20,040;"So that was the time frame."
09:20,040;09:21,320;"That's when that all went down."
09:21,320;09:23,400;"That's amazing."
09:23,400;09:25,320;"What a great week that was."
09:25,320;09:26,440;"Yeah."
09:26,440;09:30,120;"So yeah, that's kind of their history."
09:30,120;09:33,040;"So they went that that was their best season 14 and two."
09:33,040;09:37,460;"And then they've had like three straight subpar years"
09:37,460;09:40,200;"of like six wins, five wins."
09:40,200;09:42,880;"Coughlin gets fired at the end of last year."
09:42,880;09:44,080;"And then they come into this year"
09:44,080;09:45,320;"and they draft Byron left,"
09:45,320;09:48,000;"which with the seventh overall pick from"
09:48,000;09:50,920;"the thundering herd."
09:50,920;09:52,400;"- That's right from Marshall."
09:52,400;09:53,720;"- That's right."
09:53,720;09:55,320;"- Was no, he wasn't the quarterback"
09:55,320;09:56,920;"of Randy Moss house chap, Pennington."
09:56,920;09:58,040;"Also for Marshall."
09:58,040;10:03,120;"I have some interesting factoids on his Marshall career too."
10:03,120;10:03,720;"Yes."
10:03,720;10:07,080;"Didn't he have some like, was he the one with the broken leg game?"
10:07,080;10:08,080;"Yes."
10:08,080;10:09,080;"Yeah."
10:09,080;10:10,560;"That game is unreal."
10:10,560;10:15,280;"You watch like a 50 minute YouTube thing on it and watch this game."
10:15,280;10:19,280;"But watch 50 minutes fucking Marshall highlights."
10:19,280;10:21,680;"Love it."
10:22,600;10:26,200;"They were playing like Akron who was like one in seven."
10:26,200;10:29,280;"The only win was against like a non division 118."
10:29,280;10:29,920;"- You and H."
10:29,920;10:33,040;"- He broke his shin in the first quarter."
10:33,040;10:33,880;"- Yeah."
10:33,880;10:35,480;"- Because like still zero, zero."
10:35,480;10:38,720;"They, he's like, we don't, we can't lose this game."
10:38,720;10:39,960;"It's fucking Akron."
10:39,960;10:43,680;"So then they tell him to get X-rays."
10:43,680;10:45,680;"He has to go to like the hospital."
10:45,680;10:47,560;"He's like, no, not doing that."
10:47,560;10:50,880;"So hangs out, comes back in in the third quarter"
10:50,880;10:52,840;"and starts playing with a broken leg."
10:52,840;10:55,020;"And I'm sure some listeners are familiar with it"
10:55,020;10:58,600;"when the offensive lineman are putting them on their shoulders."
10:58,600;10:59,440;"- Yeah, after every play,"
10:59,440;11:01,520;"he's just like out of a shock at every play,"
11:01,520;11:03,840;"slinging the ball and then like two of his offensive line"
11:03,840;11:05,640;"would come back, grab him under each shoulder"
11:05,640;11:07,640;"and carry him to the next line of scrimmage."
11:07,640;11:09,040;"- He literally could not move."
11:09,040;11:10,040;"- No."
11:10,040;11:13,200;"- Like could not put any weight on his shin."
11:13,200;11:14,680;"- You call him Drew Bledsoe at that point."
11:14,680;11:15,520;"- Mm-hmm."
11:15,520;11:16,680;"- Sorry."
11:16,680;11:20,840;"- He's, one of the main reasons I think he got draft"
11:20,840;11:26,760;"so high is one because this was when Mac made the decision to start putting their games on Thursday."
11:26,760;11:31,160;"You know, they always have like shitty Thursday night Mac football games."
11:31,160;11:39,560;"Mac should. So this is the first year they were doing that. So there was a 2001 GMAC ball."
11:39,560;11:46,840;"Know what that stands for. Marshall versus East Carolina. This is a battle of the"
11:46,840;12:08,960;"Jacksonville quarterbacks. It was David Garard versus Byron Lef"
12:08,960;12:12,000;"- Down 38 to eight and half."
12:12,000;12:13,720;"It ended up at the time,"
12:13,720;12:16,440;"it was the highest scoring bowl game in history."
12:16,440;12:20,800;"- So they scored all but eight of their 60 something points"
12:20,800;12:22,080;"in the second half."
12:22,080;12:26,080;"This could like 50 some odd points in the one half."
12:26,080;12:26,920;"Holy shit."
12:26,920;12:27,760;"- Nick."
12:27,760;12:32,360;"- Yeah, left which went 41 of 70 for 576 yards,"
12:32,360;12:35,520;"four throwing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown."
12:35,520;12:37,720;"But that's not even the most impressive thing."
12:37,720;12:41,360;"The most impressive thing is that David Garard,"
12:41,360;12:44,640;"his team scored 61 points."
12:44,640;12:49,400;"He went 11 of 23 for 161 yards."
12:49,400;12:53,680;"- Whoa, they're like an option to two interceptions."
12:53,680;12:55,880;"How the fuck does that even have?"
12:55,880;12:57,800;"- How do you score 61 points?"
12:57,800;12:58,640;"- I don't know."
12:58,640;13:01,080;"They have to be like a run option team, right?"
13:01,080;13:03,960;"There was like three defensive touchdowns, I think."
13:03,960;13:06,760;"He ran for like two touchdowns or three touchdowns himself,"
13:06,760;13:07,760;"But God damn."
13:07,760;13:10,360;"Yeah."
13:10,360;13:11,160;"That's fascinating."
13:11,160;13:14,880;"So yeah, so Byron Leifrich got draft seventh overall in 2003."
13:14,880;13:16,200;"Damn, that's right."
13:16,200;13:18,720;"For a Mac quarterback and garage."
13:18,720;13:20,040;"Then I thought he was decent."
13:20,040;13:21,160;"Yeah."
13:21,160;13:21,760;"Until a point."
13:21,760;13:25,720;"Yeah, because this season started off with Bernal, but."
13:25,720;13:29,000;"You got bench, I guess, for injury, maybe."
13:29,000;13:29,520;"Yeah."
13:29,520;13:34,160;"And then they were saying because he by the time he was healthy, they were out"
13:34,160;13:35,040;"of playoff contention."
13:35,040;13:37,140;"So there's that fuck it. We'll just keep Byron left with Jen."
13:37,140;13:41,640;"But I wrote down that he was starting by on the flip,"
13:41,640;13:44,220;"which starting over Mark Bernal and I bet Bernal cried about it."
13:44,220;13:45,720;"Fucking."
13:45,720;13:50,320;"No, we don't like Mark Bernal, Steve."
13:50,320;13:51,520;"We don't know."
13:51,520;13:53,040;"He's kind of a bitch."
13:53,040;13:57,240;"Remember, we don't want to cry on TV because of the flake cake."
13:57,240;13:57,880;"Oh, that was him."
13:57,880;13:58,200;"Yeah."
13:58,200;13:59,280;"How could you lie to me?"
13:59,280;14:00,640;"Yeah."
14:00,640;14:01,000;"I don't know."
14:01,000;14:02,320;"It's pretty bad."
14:02,560;14:06,560;"I mean, I have no opinion in this play or that of Brunel, but that was embarrassing."
14:06,560;14:10,480;"Like he could be like a perfectly legit guy and I'll give him the benefit of the"
14:10,480;14:14,120;"doubt, but that was embarrassing that he cried on TV about the flaky."
14:14,120;14:16,160;"Yeah, I'm not going to give him the benefit of the doubt."
14:16,160;14:20,040;"Yeah, it's on the commentators, Andy."
14:20,040;14:20,960;"Huh?"
14:20,960;14:23,200;"You saving the benefit of that doubt for the commentators."
14:23,200;14:25,160;"Now, I'm not saying the benefit of the doubt for anybody."
14:25,160;14:27,640;"You boys better have you had on a swivel."
14:30,640;14:33,800;"All right. Do you think Byron Love, which is good?"
14:33,800;14:36,400;"Yeah. You guys okay?"
14:36,400;14:37,760;"Defying good."
14:37,760;14:43,920;"Yeah. It's interesting. Like if you look at his stats, he wasn't good."
14:43,920;14:47,560;"No. I mean, especially for our first round peg."
14:47,560;14:51,560;"If you also are factoring in his coaching as well."
14:51,560;14:55,000;"He's a coach now. That's true. He started 50 games."
14:55,000;14:58,120;"He started 50 games. He had like a decent record."
14:58,120;14:59,700;"That's also crazy."
14:59,700;15:01,000;"Give me was on Jacksonville."
15:01,000;15:04,720;"Yeah, it's two games under 500 competing against Tom Brady."
15:04,720;15:05,720;"Yeah."
15:05,720;15:10,800;"And Tom Brady's already got a Super Bowl ring and is about to get one more this year."
15:10,800;15:15,480;"And then now he's a coach coaching Tom Brady, which is another top Brady still."
15:15,480;15:16,480;"Yeah."
15:16,480;15:19,600;"Yeah, he's now Tom Brady's offensive coordinator, which is ridiculous."
15:19,600;15:20,600;"It's crazy."
15:20,600;15:22,760;"Six foot five, 250 pounds of fucking."
15:22,760;15:24,920;"He's a he's a quarterback."
15:24,920;15:25,920;"Yeah."
15:25,920;15:29,480;"Yeah, so do you have anything else on the jags you wanted to?"
15:29,480;15:31,440;"Because I had one thing that you haven't."
15:31,440;15:39,440;"I have a couple like some things that might fit better into the quiz, the trivia section."
15:39,440;15:41,200;"So we'll get to that later."
15:41,200;15:42,200;"Yeah."
15:42,200;15:45,960;"Jimmy Smith, that's the only other name I had highlighted."
15:45,960;15:48,880;"He had a pretty ridiculous career too."
15:48,880;15:49,880;"Yeah, he did."
15:49,880;15:54,080;"Yeah, he was kind of like their first real all-star, I felt like Jimmy Smith."
15:54,080;15:55,080;"Yeah."
15:55,080;15:58,780;"Fred Taylor, Jimmy Smith, Mark Bernal, Keena McCarled."
15:58,780;16:00,180;"Keena McCarled, right?"
16:00,180;16:02,040;"Yeah, they're kind of like household names."
16:02,040;16:02,640;"Yeah."
16:02,640;16:04,540;"Tony Brackens, Tony Bicelli."
16:04,540;16:05,880;"Selly."
16:05,880;16:07,320;"Yeah, if we have a Bicelli."
16:07,320;16:08,120;"Some great names."
16:08,120;16:08,480;"Yeah."
16:08,480;16:09,100;"Yeah."
16:09,100;16:13,480;"So these are vintage like early 2000s NFL names on this team."
16:13,480;16:15,760;"Oh, definitely."
16:15,760;16:16,200;"Yeah."
16:16,200;16:18,140;"This is the Jack was I remember."
16:18,140;16:20,540;"Will you say safe?"
16:20,540;16:21,700;"Which you got on the Jags."
16:21,700;16:24,040;"So there's just one thing was, um,"
16:24,040;16:34,440;"A lot has been made of the Miami miracle, the lateral touchdown pass that the Dolphins"
16:34,440;16:38,160;"won their game against Patriots a few years ago."
16:38,160;16:47,820;"The last time a last play lateral touchdown or a lateral was a touchdown the last play"
16:47,820;16:53,440;"the game was how the jags would win their game after this one."
16:53,440;17:00,320;"Except it happened in ridiculous fashion against them."
17:00,320;17:03,000;"So what happened was it was the same idea."
17:03,000;17:03,880;"They're playing the Saints."
17:03,880;17:05,220;"Jesus, hang on a second."
17:05,220;17:06,760;"Pay the same."
17:06,760;17:09,160;"Jesus."
17:09,160;17:10,460;"Been like this all day."
17:10,460;17:13,680;"Speaking of fucking weepy sports commentators."
17:13,680;17:17,060;"Oh, I can't get emotional."
17:17,060;17:24,700;"But yeah, so the jags were playing the Saints and the Saints were down by seven at the"
17:24,700;17:32,600;"With like one one last play left, you know, and so they tried the lateral thing and it ended up working and they scored a touchdown"
17:32,600;17:35,180;"but then I"
17:35,180;17:38,820;"Can't remember who their kicker was who was the old dude?"
17:38,820;17:42,580;"Carne one of the one of the Anderson's Gary or Morton Carney"
17:42,580;17:45,900;"Oh, yeah, you're right. John Carney John Carney"
17:46,780;17:50,780;"missed the extra point and the Jags 1 19 to 20."
17:50,780;17:53,780;"That is one of the craziest things ever."
17:53,780;17:54,780;"I've seen a highlight before."
17:54,780;17:55,780;"Now you bring it up."
17:55,780;17:57,780;"Yeah. And I think, yeah, I'll link it to you."
17:57,780;17:59,780;"I found the high. It's amazing."
17:59,780;18:02,780;"It's unbelievable how that happened."
18:02,780;18:05,780;"Oh, yeah. Because like, and the play was,"
18:05,780;18:08,780;"it wasn't nearly as clean as the Miami and America was either."
18:08,780;18:09,780;"Like it was."
18:09,780;18:10,780;"Oh, yeah. It was."
18:10,780;18:12,780;"Shout out Dante Stallworth on that play."
18:12,780;18:13,780;"Yeah. It was if you."
18:13,780;18:15,780;"But are former Patriots."
18:15,780;18:18,100;"- Future Patriot, I guess."
18:18,100;18:20,100;"- Future Patriot for us."
18:20,100;18:24,940;"But we'll put that link in there as well, as well as the--"
18:24,940;18:27,020;"- Yeah, if you haven't seen that play,"
18:27,020;18:28,420;"if you don't know what we're talking about,"
18:28,420;18:31,420;"that is an absolute must watch."
18:31,420;18:36,220;"Because it's like the Miami Miracle,"
18:36,220;18:38,500;"but then they, this is the old PAT too."
18:38,500;18:40,460;"This is from the two yard line, Shipshot."
18:40,460;18:45,460;"It's a Miami Miracle, followed by an equally as unlikely play."
18:45,460;18:50,660;"play. Yeah. Of like Adam Vinotary pushing an extra point right basically."
18:50,660;19:00,260;"Yeah. I'm looking up the numbers right now on 2003 PAT percentages. There's 15 teams,"
19:00,260;19:10,900;"so half the league didn't miss one the entire season. 100%. The lowest percentages 92.68%"
19:10,900;19:14,900;"And 30 out of the 32 teams were 95% or more."
19:14,900;19:17,020;"So it's almost a guarantee."
19:17,020;19:18,020;"Yeah."
19:18,020;19:22,580;"You're talking about like missing one to two a year per team."
19:22,580;19:24,020;"And that was the one."
19:24,020;19:25,660;"And that's the one name."
19:25,660;19:32,180;"And I don't know if it had playoff implications for the Saints or not."
19:32,180;19:38,220;"I think it kind of did because they were seven and seven going into the game."
19:38,220;19:43,460;"So I would have put them in eight and seven like in the hunt with one game left, but that"
19:43,460;19:45,020;"fuck their playoff chances."
19:45,020;19:46,900;"The loser city relay."
19:46,900;19:47,900;"Yes."
19:47,900;19:49,380;"That's what what do they call it?"
19:49,380;19:50,380;"River city."
19:50,380;19:51,380;"Relay."
19:51,380;19:52,380;"River city."
19:52,380;19:53,380;"Really."
19:53,380;19:54,380;"That's right."
19:54,380;19:55,380;"Yes."
19:55,380;19:56,380;"Wikipedia."
19:56,380;20:00,700;"I knew there was some silly name where but there's there's one like video out there with"
20:00,700;20:04,420;"the commentator that's like, how could you do that?"
20:04,420;20:05,820;"How could you miss that?"
20:05,820;20:08,060;"I think that's all I found that guy rules"
20:08,060;20:12,820;"The Saints like radio broadcast"
20:12,820;20:25,460;"Alright well speaking of football though this game"
20:25,460;20:28,340;"was"
20:28,340;20:33,220;"Defensive battle again, would you say not so much as last week with the dolphins?"
20:33,620;20:36,980;"Yeah. Because there was 12 total points scored in that."
20:36,980;20:40,820;"And six of them were a Teddy Bruceky pick six,"
20:40,820;20:43,060;"which I don't know if we mentioned last week, but"
20:43,060;20:46,100;"his last four interceptions, he's returned for touchdown so far."
20:46,100;20:48,980;"Yeah. Two this season and two this season before."
20:48,980;20:51,300;"Yeah, it's crazy. And then he doesn't have another one because"
20:51,300;20:54,020;"Justin has career, I believe. I think you're right. Yeah."
20:54,020;20:56,500;"I think we'll be the boy ever gets. Yeah. That's what they call him"
20:56,500;20:58,260;"T.D. Bruceky, right?"
20:58,260;21:01,700;"That's a good one. I like that."
21:01,700;21:03,340;"Joe picked that last time."
21:03,340;21:05,820;"Did Steve make that joke last week or so?"
21:05,820;21:06,980;"That sounds really, yeah."
21:06,980;21:08,620;"Sounds like something I would say."
21:08,620;21:09,860;"I can't have another one."
21:09,860;21:15,100;"Because I had Teddy won the Bruce key."
21:15,100;21:17,540;"I don't know."
21:17,540;21:19,140;"I didn't pull that off the top of my head."
21:19,140;21:21,100;"That's from Steve or something."
21:21,100;21:23,180;"Yeah, I think it was TD Bruce key."
21:23,180;21:23,540;"Yeah."
21:23,540;21:25,460;"Maybe what do you call someone who's"
21:25,460;21:27,740;"afraid of Santa Claus?"
21:27,740;21:28,900;"Oh, here we go."
21:28,900;21:29,300;"What?"
21:29,300;21:34,980;"claustrophobic. That came with myself in the middle of the night."
21:34,980;21:39,860;"All the dogs keep it up. Don't working."
21:39,860;21:45,700;"What's the difference between a car and a golf ball?"
21:45,700;21:50,860;"No case. What? Tiger Woods can drive a golf ball 400 yards."
21:50,860;21:52,180;"Oh, shit."
21:52,180;21:58,820;"Oh, man. This is fine."
21:58,820;22:01,980;"- No, he's fine."
22:01,980;22:05,820;"- Oh, if it wasn't, we'd probably have to cut that."
22:05,820;22:09,720;"- We're Tiger."
22:09,720;22:10,560;"- Not bad."
22:10,560;22:14,080;"- I have a hot take about Tiger."
22:14,080;22:16,820;"- Not bad, I don't know."
22:16,820;22:20,400;"Like I don't, everybody seems to have just like accepted"
22:20,400;22:22,120;"all the shitty days like, oh no, he's fine now."
22:22,120;22:23,680;"We're back to loving Tiger."
22:23,680;22:25,040;"- I'm not on that."
22:25,040;22:27,920;"Did you see the documentary, the HBO?"
22:27,920;22:29,160;"No, I don't think so."
22:29,160;22:29,840;"It's pretty good."
22:29,840;22:30,800;"It's worth watching."
22:30,800;22:32,480;"Like I'm not going to say it's--"
22:32,480;22:36,680;"he's not to blame, but his childhood was all fucked up."
22:36,680;22:38,560;"I'm not surprised at all."
22:38,560;22:40,280;"Same guy who wrote the Dynasty book"
22:40,280;22:42,160;"did one on Tiger Woods."
22:42,160;22:43,560;"Oh, that's right. He did, didn't he?"
22:43,560;22:44,060;"Yeah."
22:44,060;22:45,080;"I think he did that before."
22:45,080;22:48,720;"I have actually a hot take Patriots take on this."
22:48,720;22:49,800;"Oh, OK."
22:49,800;22:54,640;"You know how like Tiger is like nationally like beloved,"
22:54,640;22:54,980;"right?"
22:54,980;23:00,360;"Everyone loves Tiger no matter what they're all rooting for him the Tiger fanboys"
23:00,360;23:06,760;"I'm saying that if if if Tom Brady didn't play like a regional sport like football"
23:06,760;23:13,220;"He would be in that same category of being beloved by sports fans if not higher"
23:13,220;23:17,900;"I agree because the reason they hate him is because he beats every roots"
23:17,900;23:18,300;"Yeah"
23:18,300;23:22,260;"And it's just like that's how sports go when you play these regional sports"
23:22,260;23:25,540;"But if it's like Tigers just an American playing these tournaments"
23:25,540;23:27,700;"Every American get behind them, right?"
23:27,700;23:32,500;"So I think if Tom Brady played a sport like golf football with international sport"
23:32,500;23:37,060;"everybody would love them every single person on playing earth alone, you know, it's kind of like"
23:37,060;23:39,540;"when we talked about"
23:39,540;23:42,180;"When they had whatever that baseball tournament was"
23:42,180;23:49,300;"Like the national baseball thing. Yeah, and Derek jeter was on the usa team and we all got to move like finally we get to room for"
23:49,620;23:52,780;"Yeah, it felt kind of nice because it's fucking dare to hear."
23:52,780;23:53,460;"I know."
23:53,460;23:55,580;"You all just back to this ass, but you couldn't root for him."
23:55,580;23:57,420;"He's a Yankee."
23:57,420;23:58,420;"So yeah, I think you're right."
23:58,420;23:59,220;"I think it'd be pretty soon."
23:59,220;24:00,740;"This game was pretty good."
24:00,740;24:02,700;"How far went away?"
24:02,700;24:04,780;"That only but."
24:04,780;24:09,460;"This is what you do when you have a 27, 13 week 14 game."
24:09,460;24:13,980;"It was a bit of a slog, but I think this is the first game"
24:13,980;24:16,380;"this season I have no memory of."
24:16,380;24:19,500;"Give it a walk in the water score, Andy."
24:19,500;24:21,500;"Give it a move."
24:21,500;24:23,300;"I'm just looking back."
24:23,300;24:25,820;"I give it a three just because Troy Brown's back."
24:25,820;24:27,900;"Yeah."
24:27,900;24:31,180;"It was somewhat entertaining."
24:31,180;24:32,420;"It was good defense."
24:32,420;24:32,980;"Yeah."
24:32,980;24:34,500;"Wasn't as good as last week."
24:34,500;24:37,500;"Like a comeback Jags Jags played pretty well too for a bit of it."
24:37,500;24:39,500;"And then they hung in there, which is also cool."
24:39,500;24:40,900;"Yeah."
24:40,900;24:45,300;"Yeah, and the Patriots defenses again nasty."
24:45,300;24:48,100;"Yeah, that field was a shit show though."
24:48,100;24:49,300;"Yes."
24:49,380;24:51,860;"- Oh, we're even better if it was Brunel."
24:51,860;24:53,380;"Just follow what if. - Yeah."
24:53,380;24:54,420;"- An nostalgia sake."
24:54,420;24:56,900;"- I just like the Byron left, which versus Tom Brady."
24:56,900;24:59,780;"That struck a chord to me because there,"
24:59,780;25:01,900;"one's coaching the other one."
25:01,900;25:03,420;"- Yeah, that's true too, yeah."
25:03,420;25:04,260;"Good point. - Yeah."
25:04,260;25:08,060;"- So he's younger than Brady."
25:08,060;25:09,740;"And he's coaching Brady."
25:09,740;25:10,580;"- Yeah."
25:10,580;25:11,780;"- That's interesting."
25:11,780;25:13,460;"- Tom Brady's older than like,"
25:13,460;25:14,300;"(laughing)"
25:14,300;25:16,220;"- I think it's like a quarter or a third of"
25:16,220;25:19,340;"- One of your coaches. - Coach is younger than you."
25:19,340;25:25,420;"Yeah, let's be honest. What is buyer and left which teaching Tom Brady? Yeah, if the other way around this point, right?"
25:25,420;25:28,620;"Tom Brady's like I hear what you're saying, but"
25:28,620;25:39,060;"I've seen you play this so I think we do it my way and you can learn from me"
25:39,060;25:42,760;"That's interesting. I wonder what that dynamic is like"
25:42,760;25:47,660;"I mean it takes a certain type of person to be the coach too and like"
25:47,660;25:54,820;"like, you know, to be able to like see some of that, like in a"
25:54,820;25:57,540;"power that you have in that role to be like, okay, this is no"
25:57,540;26:00,340;"longer like I'm your boss and you're my player, like this is"
26:00,340;26:02,820;"like a mutual like let's work together and figure things out,"
26:02,820;26:06,820;"you know, how can I make the offense work better for what you"
26:06,820;26:09,780;"need to tell me what I need to do as a coach? I'm almost like"
26:09,780;26:12,220;"working for you. I bet that's what it's like. Yeah, I think so"
26:12,220;26:15,140;"too. All right, and yet they still go fucking runs up the"
26:15,140;26:19,700;"middle of every first day. So maybe not. Hey, one Super Bowl."
26:19,700;26:22,500;"It felt like in spite of that."
26:22,500;26:25,620;"By when played nine years, I'd slip it up. Yeah."
26:25,620;26:27,260;"I played ahead of nine year NFL career."
26:27,260;26:32,660;"So far than most. And then retired, did whatever if I could"
26:32,660;26:34,460;"did work this way all the way up to the country when I get to"
26:34,460;26:36,500;"OC and then coach Brady."
26:36,500;26:40,220;"Yeah. Yeah. He retired in 2012."
26:40,220;26:42,620;"So nine years ago."
26:44,700;26:45,900;"I remember liking him."
26:45,900;26:51,660;"Like that was my memory of he's one of those guys that was like, you know, put up flashy numbers,"
26:51,660;26:57,660;"but he was like a scrappy, like he's not an easy out, you know, you're going to have to play when you come and play."
26:57,660;27:01,180;"Yeah, almost like Ben Rothlessberger asked, I thought."
27:01,180;27:01,860;"Yeah."
27:01,860;27:06,620;"That big dude who had a cannon for an arm and always played smart enough."
27:06,620;27:11,060;"On this team, because he ended up playing with the Patriots too, which I know we're all stoked about."
27:11,060;27:11,880;"Who?"
27:11,880;27:12,900;"Fred Taylor."
27:12,900;27:13,580;"Oh, yeah."
27:13,580;27:17,020;"feel like a minute. Yeah, didn't he get hurt really early?"
27:17,020;27:23,260;"Something like that. I remember playing with him in Madden and he was like an absolute monster"
27:23,260;27:29,820;"because he realized that people age, especially running backs. Well, a lot of Madden Super Bowls"
27:29,820;27:36,140;"with Fred Taylor was a patriot. Whatever year that was. He played for Patriots for two years."
27:37,260;27:39,820;"Oh, probably not many games though."
27:39,820;27:40,860;"Nine and 10."
27:40,860;27:42,180;"Wow."
27:42,180;27:44,060;"OK, 13 games total one start."
27:44,060;27:46,140;"Yeah, he didn't start much."
27:46,140;27:49,260;"Well, that's four Fred Taylor touchdowns, though."
27:49,260;27:50,300;"Damn right."
27:50,300;27:51,140;"We will."
27:51,140;27:58,140;"Speaking of touchdowns, though, most of these were Tom Brady touchdown passes."
27:58,140;28:00,980;"Well, both of the touchdowns, I should say."
28:00,980;28:04,460;"I mean, there could have been a lot more touchdowns, too."
28:04,460;28:06,620;"The there is some crazy drops."
28:06,620;28:13,420;"Yeah. Yeah. There was a lot of missed opportunities on both sides. Fred Taylor, especially dropped"
28:13,420;28:20,220;"a wide open screen pass from the five yard line that bonked off his face mask because it went through his hands."
28:20,220;28:26,620;"It was the perfect call against the perfect defense. They brought the house, they threw the quick little slip screen."
28:26,620;28:31,620;"Yeah. It was wide open, perfect ball right in his face and just eat it."
28:31,620;28:34,540;"Yeah, and then Larry Center is the other usual"
28:34,540;28:41,740;"Sure-handed what do we decide he was a full-back. Yeah, I don't like Larry centers. They caught him. That was a center"
28:41,740;28:45,700;"Good one"
28:45,700;28:47,780;"Yeah"
28:47,780;28:52,780;"Yeah, no there. I think the highlight of the game for me was Troy Brown being back"
28:52,780;28:54,700;"Return and puns"
28:54,700;29:00,820;"Didn't quite look the same but still like getting the job done and like his first catch I think was"
29:00,820;29:04,500;"was converting a third and 20."
29:04,500;29:07,060;"And he got 23 yards on it."
29:07,060;29:09,160;"And he was like, hopped up like he's been there."
29:09,160;29:10,660;"It's like, yeah, that's cool."
29:10,660;29:12,500;"Fucking typical."
29:12,500;29:15,500;"But, and he had a touchdown catch,"
29:15,500;29:17,600;"and that was a great touchdown catch too."
29:17,600;29:18,980;"- It was an entire way. - It was an entire way."
29:18,980;29:21,220;"- So tapper. - Yep."
29:21,220;29:23,380;"But you're looking at him the entire way."
29:23,380;29:24,220;"Beautiful."
29:24,220;29:27,500;"What else?"
29:27,500;29:29,660;"I mean, what would you guys give"
29:29,660;29:31,660;"as a watchability score."
29:31,660;29:33,940;"- Greg?"
29:33,940;29:35,040;"- I didn't watch it."
29:35,040;29:43,220;"Nothing jumped out at me from the highlights or any of that"
29:43,220;29:46,300;"that made it particularly enticing besides just like"
29:46,300;29:49,280;"the names of this team."
29:49,280;29:52,860;"- Yeah, I know I talked about it earlier, but I'm still--"
29:52,860;29:53,700;"- About two?"
29:53,700;29:55,460;"- I'll say it with two Lombardi."
29:55,460;29:56,300;"- Yeah."
29:56,300;29:57,780;"- I like defense, I'll give it three."
29:57,780;29:59,900;"This defense is absolutely outstanding."
29:59,900;30:02,900;"This is, I think when you talk about old school"
30:02,900;30:06,460;"Patriots football and like the defense first"
30:06,460;30:08,940;"offense does not make mistakes, this is,"
30:08,940;30:11,140;"like this stretch is almost what I think of."
30:11,140;30:12,980;"It is an E-2003 stretch."
30:12,980;30:16,900;"Like they kept showing different stats about the defense."
30:16,900;30:18,940;"Let's see."
30:18,940;30:22,620;"In the first quarter when the,"
30:22,620;30:26,220;"the Jaguars finally got in the red zone,"
30:27,260;30:29,420;"They showed a stat that said New England defense at home."
30:29,420;30:33,980;"First time the opponent has penetrated New England 10-yard line in last 47 drives,"
30:33,980;30:36,700;"which is fucking batshit."
30:36,700;30:40,500;"I mean, games is a must have been."
30:40,500;30:46,860;"I bet I know the last time when William again, it's I wasn't at home."
30:46,860;30:48,180;"Oh, I know."
30:48,180;30:48,820;"I've got home."
30:48,820;30:49,140;"Yeah."
30:49,140;30:52,300;"So probably towards the beginning of the season, maybe week one."
30:52,300;30:53,220;"They lost anyone."
30:53,220;30:53,700;"Yeah."
30:53,700;30:55,100;"That's a lot of drives."
30:55,100;30:55,700;"Right."
30:55,700;31:02,760;"Um, another one. They haven't allowed a touchdown at home in the last five games, which was"
31:02,760;31:11,620;"260 minutes of game time. 53 drives, 292 total plays. Well, that got broken at the end."
31:11,620;31:15,660;"Right at the ending garbage time. Yes, it did, which was really frustrating because it was"
31:15,660;31:21,940;"like a garbage time absolute prayer of a throw into the snowstorm light. Yeah. And it hung"
31:21,940;31:28,340;"on the camera, you couldn't see it. No, no idea. No idea. Whoever caught it had no idea either."
31:28,340;31:32,020;"Yeah. It's going to drop right in his last. Some note like Robert Johnson or someone like this."
31:32,020;31:36,340;"Kevin Johnson. He's got a. But some respect on his name. Like a no name."
31:36,340;31:42,260;"No name. I don't recognize him. He's a no name. Kevin Johnson. He was a brown guy, right?"
31:42,260;31:47,220;"Dude, Kevin Johnson is like a fucking, you had a thousand yards season. That's that's the name"
31:47,220;31:49,780;"that Madden like creates when you're doing a draft."
31:49,780;31:53,820;"You're like, oh, we got to create some real names."
31:53,820;31:55,140;"- Looking Kevin Johnson."
31:55,140;31:57,020;"- Yeah, Andy Brown back."
31:57,020;31:58,940;"Andrew Brown."
31:58,940;32:00,340;"You had a thousand yards season."
32:00,340;32:02,140;"- Not good."
32:02,140;32:03,300;"- That's good, no."
32:03,300;32:05,620;"- The total streak was 63 drives."
32:05,620;32:07,020;"I didn't write down the minutes or whatever,"
32:07,020;32:09,980;"but it was some 63 drives out allowing"
32:09,980;32:11,180;"that touchdown at home."
32:11,180;32:12,580;"- That's amazing."
32:14,140;32:18,660;"Yeah. And then there was another like halfway through the fourth quarter,"
32:18,660;32:25,660;"they showed that the Jaguars averaged 123 yards rushing per game."
32:25,660;32:31,180;"And today they had 46. And that had been their huge, like,"
32:31,180;32:33,380;"cause they'd been on a bit of a streak lately."
32:33,380;32:38,180;"And the most rushing yards in the last five weeks of the season,"
32:38,180;32:40,940;"Fred Taylor was second just behind Clinton Portis."
32:41,820;32:47,220;"Clint Porter had 659 yards in the last five weeks because was it last week?"
32:47,220;32:48,580;"He had that five touchdown game."
32:48,580;32:48,780;"Yeah."
32:48,780;32:50,860;"He had like 200 some rushing guys and five touchdowns."
32:50,860;32:53,540;"Fred Taylor is 617 yards."
32:53,540;32:55,580;"He's only like 40 something yards behind him."
32:55,580;32:58,060;"Right."
32:58,060;32:58,820;"Taylor was good."
32:58,820;32:59,540;"He was good."
32:59,540;32:59,940;"Yeah."
32:59,940;33:03,420;"And he was, he was hot right this point of the season too."
33:03,420;33:03,820;"Yeah."
33:03,820;33:05,100;"So hot right now."
33:05,100;33:06,180;"So hot right now."
33:06,180;33:07,220;"Oh, Fred Taylor."
33:07,220;33:08,500;"So hot right now."
33:09,380;33:14,900;"Uh, buyer left was also hot too, because, uh, I'm going to throw in some more right now."
33:14,900;33:19,340;"Uh, we're going to do a verbal meme."
33:19,340;33:21,300;"Isn't that what they do on some other podcast?"
33:21,300;33:24,860;"You know, the, um, are my take where we started."
33:24,860;33:25,580;"Sure."
33:25,580;33:28,740;"Where we started, uh, where we are now sort of thing."
33:28,740;33:29,660;"It's all over Twitter."
33:29,660;33:33,540;"So the where we started was in the first quarter, they showed the staff buyer"
33:33,540;33:36,300;"left, which zero inceptions and last 99 patch attempts."
33:36,740;33:39,660;"And it went over 100 as they were talking about it."
33:39,660;33:42,540;"And then later in the fourth quarter, they showed a step by"
33:42,540;33:44,940;"our left, which two interceptions and last eight pass attempts."
33:44,940;33:46,340;"So"
33:46,340;33:51,940;"that verbal meme, Drake doing like that."
33:51,940;33:54,220;"You know, the pointing."
33:54,220;33:55,260;"Yeah."
33:55,260;33:56,300;"The hand thing."
33:56,300;33:56,820;"Yeah."
33:56,820;34:03,300;"Except instead of Drake, it's actually a Byron left, which is mugshot from this."
34:04,020;34:07,180;"He's a super baby phase looking guy here."
34:07,180;34:09,460;"A mug shot, like a rest mug shot."
34:09,460;34:12,220;"Or his picture."
34:12,220;34:13,980;"With the stats."
34:13,980;34:16,740;"Yeah, his picture here."
34:16,740;34:18,020;"He's not looking like a happy dude."
34:18,020;34:21,460;"That last--"
34:21,460;34:23,460;"I think he looks like a kick puppy."
34:23,460;34:27,060;"So he looks like, oh, me?"
34:27,060;34:28,740;"That last waterfall interception"
34:28,740;34:32,440;"the where he was doing the non BB thing."
34:32,440;34:35,340;"Very close to that."
34:35,340;34:36,540;"Yeah, it was."
34:36,540;34:38,140;"He, uh, the Leon Leon."
34:38,140;34:39,140;"Celebrating."
34:39,140;34:39,840;"Yeah, the Leon Leon."
34:39,840;34:43,860;"You start celebrating five yards too early and go run down from behind or"
34:43,860;34:47,240;"Deshawn Jackson, if you will, or that guy from the Seahawks."
34:47,240;34:47,740;"What's his name?"
34:47,740;34:48,940;"Which one?"
34:48,940;34:50,240;"Seahawks one."
34:50,240;34:50,740;"Seahawks one."
34:50,740;34:52,640;"Yeah, it was like this past year."
34:52,640;34:53,940;"He did that too."
34:53,940;34:54,740;"Oh, yeah."
34:54,740;34:55,340;"Yeah."
34:55,340;34:56,340;"Oh, fuck."
34:56,340;34:58,140;"Um, big guy."
34:58,340;35:01,040;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He did that."
35:01,040;35:02,840;"Yeah. I miss that."
35:02,840;35:04,880;"Yeah. My buddy had been fantasy"
35:04,880;35:06,520;"and he threw a little hissy fit."
35:06,520;35:08,520;"Shout out, Mark."
35:08,520;35:10,120;"Hissy fits not uncommon."
35:10,120;35:12,120;"[LAUGHTER]"
35:12,120;35:15,120;"Oh boy."
35:15,120;35:18,360;"Yeah, but that was pool's second interception in the game too."
35:18,360;35:20,360;"Yeah."
35:20,360;35:22,900;"It actually worked out better because the pages got first"
35:22,900;35:24,800;"and goal from the two-yard line."
35:24,800;35:25,240;"Yeah."
35:25,240;35:27,500;"And we were able to just run Antoine Smith up the middle"
35:27,500;35:29,740;"three times and finally score a touchdown in the third."
35:29,740;35:34,420;"- Well, and the key to celebrating those prematurely"
35:34,420;35:37,820;"is do the ball in front raise high step thing."
35:37,820;35:40,480;"Don't do the ball down to the side behind,"
35:40,480;35:42,300;"like running through, like sprinting,"
35:42,300;35:43,740;"running through the final thing."
35:43,740;35:47,060;"Just make sure your swag is out in front of you."
35:47,060;35:47,980;"That way if you get caught,"
35:47,980;35:49,060;"you're not gonna fumble at least,"
35:49,060;35:50,780;"you're just gonna get tackled."
35:50,780;35:52,460;"- Well, that was the swag corner with Greg Brown."
35:52,460;35:55,700;"- That's a little bit wrong with the swag projects."
35:55,700;35:57,700;"the"
35:57,700;36:03,780;"Deon Sanders he used to do the swag out front, you know true. Yeah, tyla"
36:03,780;36:07,660;"Swag out front see he only swag when he got in there. Yeah"
36:07,660;36:14,420;"That's what that's true. He did I was swagging the floor. Yeah, it's swag all over that floor"
36:14,420;36:18,580;"Oh my god"
36:18,580;36:20,900;"But did you guys know it snowed in this game"
36:21,420;36:26,420;"Saw that because speaking speaking of segments. This is the time for me to shit on the commentators"
36:26,420;36:30,340;"I don't think they'd ever seen snow before so maybe we'll we'll chalk it up to that"
36:30,340;36:33,500;"but they would not stop talking about how cold it was and"
36:33,500;36:38,540;"They like especially towards the end of the game. They just got obsessed about it soon started snowing"
36:38,540;36:45,300;"You could see the snow in the field like look. There's this guy on the sideline wearing shorts and then they cut to a"
36:45,300;36:50,500;"Clip of bill Belichick pregame in shorts like the weather was 21 degrees"
36:50,500;36:55,900;"and but we've got we've got heaters and and they had like in the little studio"
36:55,900;36:59,560;"there was like the TV behind them that they would show stats on it had like"
36:59,560;37:04,500;"fire in it like oh we're standing next to this but it's not warming us up"
37:04,500;37:13,620;"the Natalie clad bill Belichick I did a prime time I love Berman I just love"
37:13,620;37:17,720;"Berman so much just little things like that yeah the Natalie clad bill"
37:17,720;37:21,600;"about it. Perfect. Yeah. The alliteration is so on points."
37:21,600;37:24,840;"Just roll off the top. And it paints a picture too."
37:24,840;37:29,120;"One complaint. And I think that I'm building a case against Phil here."
37:29,120;37:31,800;"Oh, OK. A lot of case for me, a case for"
37:31,800;37:36,720;"I'm in Catean. Oh, yeah. In some sort of workplace sexual harassment."
37:36,720;37:38,920;"Oh, because it's number two."
37:38,920;37:40,280;"Talking about his feet."
37:40,280;37:42,280;"And one of my Monday night games, something like that."
37:42,280;37:44,680;"It was a very awkward foot thing."
37:44,680;37:46,520;"There were. Yeah, there was something, wasn't it?"
37:46,520;37:53,160;"The foot of the hand thing maybe yeah, I don't even want to relive that look that on but it's out there somewhere. I'll find it on this one. They're like"
37:53,160;37:58,360;"Oh, I mean you look good with a little snow on you. You little snowman"
37:58,360;38:04,600;"You know, he's a snow slide, but then and then like at one point around that same time"
38:04,600;38:08,440;"They're like huh they cut to him and he didn't have much snow. I'm like, oh, he's got a"
38:08,440;38:14,760;"A like a surprisingly little amount of snow on him. What are you like hiding a munder or something guys?"
38:15,880;38:17,640;"Oh yeah, I mean, you getting wet."
38:17,640;38:18,120;"Yeah."
38:18,120;38:20,840;"Naughty little bitch."
38:20,840;38:24,320;"And then they're from there, they come to build Ballet check"
38:24,320;38:27,720;"who's just like in his hoodie and the whole front of him just covered in snow."
38:27,720;38:29,120;"He just stay there like a miserable."
38:29,120;38:30,120;"Mm hmm."
38:30,120;38:32,560;"Like, you know, he knows he can wear more clothing, right?"
38:32,560;38:33,640;"Right."
38:33,640;38:34,360;"He doesn't."
38:34,360;38:36,440;"He's still still going to look miserable."
38:36,440;38:39,480;"You're the fucking one on Bill Ballet check."
38:39,480;38:41,160;"He's still going to look miserable."
38:41,160;38:45,760;"Well, isn't the story that like he wanted to wear a suit on the sidelines?"
38:45,760;38:49,680;"to because that's how old school coaches used to do it."
38:49,680;38:51,360;"They used to wear a full suit."
38:51,360;38:52,200;"So you want to do that."
38:52,200;38:55,480;"And the NFL for whatever,"
38:55,480;38:56,840;"I think for licensing reasons,"
38:56,840;38:58,920;"because Reebok doesn't make a fucking suit."
38:58,920;39:00,880;"Like, no, you have to wear Reebok shit."
39:00,880;39:02,720;"It's like, okay, fine, I'll wear this."
39:02,720;39:03,560;"I'm not gonna give a shot."
39:03,560;39:04,640;"I'll cut the fucking sleeves off."
39:04,640;39:06,240;"And it's like supposed to be like"
39:06,240;39:08,280;"thumbing his nose at the end of the door or something."
39:08,280;39:09,400;"- I did not know that."
39:09,400;39:10,680;"See, I just got the impression"
39:10,680;39:14,240;"that he just did not give a shit in one way or the other."
39:14,240;39:18,120;"I mean, you've seen him like dressed like in public"
39:18,120;39:19,920;"and he's not wearing a suit and tie there."
39:19,920;39:24,880;"So I think yeah, he's just like the definition of disheveled."
39:24,880;39:26,920;"- He dresses like our father does."
39:26,920;39:31,920;"- Yeah, if Mick Brown could wear that fucking button-up"
39:31,920;39:35,600;"turtle shirt or whatever frogs or whatever fuck it was all"
39:35,600;39:36,440;"over the truck."
39:36,440;39:37,920;"- Sure rules."
39:37,920;39:41,320;"- Yeah, the America flag shirt also rules."
39:42,400;39:43,240;"- Yeah."
39:43,240;39:46,080;"- And the fact that he can't wear a ball cap,"
39:46,080;39:47,080;"but he does anyway."
39:47,080;39:50,280;"- The Jerry Garcia sweatshirt that he wears"
39:50,280;39:51,800;"in like June and July."
39:51,800;39:52,920;"- Yeah, oh, just constantly."
39:52,920;39:53,760;"- The Christmas one."
39:53,760;39:54,600;"- Yeah."
39:54,600;39:56,560;"- Christmas Jerry Garcia sweatshirt."
39:56,560;39:57,600;"- Just the mullet."
39:57,600;39:59,320;"- No, he doesn't."
39:59,320;40:00,320;"- Yeah, well, he's growing up on his own."
40:00,320;40:01,600;"- He's missing front tooth."
40:01,600;40:02,440;"(laughing)"
40:02,440;40:03,280;"- Oh my God."
40:03,280;40:06,000;"- That was bad."
40:06,000;40:06,840;"- Yeah, all right."
40:06,840;40:10,520;"So, the missing front tooth era was an era."
40:10,520;40:13,440;"- And McBrown kind of has that Belichick scowl,"
40:13,440;40:14,560;"I think it's around the mouth."
40:14,560;40:15,560;"They look very similar."
40:15,560;40:17,720;"- They look very similar, yeah."
40:17,720;40:18,880;"So we gotta get--"
40:18,880;40:21,880;"- But that's OG hipster, right?"
40:21,880;40:24,560;"Like hipster like claim that they don't like care"
40:24,560;40:25,400;"what they look like."
40:25,400;40:28,280;"No, you do care, you just care in a different way."
40:28,280;40:31,320;"McBrown, Bill Belichick, they're real hipsters."
40:31,320;40:32,600;"- Literally do not care."
40:32,600;40:35,520;"- Truly do not give a shit what they look like."
40:35,520;40:38,520;"- I don't know, I like the spite angle better."
40:38,520;40:41,480;"I feel like him spiting Roger Goodell."
40:41,480;40:42,320;"I find myself better."
40:42,320;40:43,160;"- Feels good, doesn't it?"
40:43,160;40:44,000;"- Yeah."
40:44,000;40:44,840;"- Yeah."
40:44,840;40:45,720;"So who knows?"
40:45,720;40:47,740;"- Once we get him on the pod, we'll ask him."
40:47,740;40:48,580;"- Oh yeah."
40:48,580;40:50,280;"Oh, we've got a whole bunch of hard hitting questions"
40:50,280;40:51,280;"to ask Bill Belichick."
40:51,280;40:55,520;"Oh, speaking of who's back,"
40:55,520;40:56,840;"we all know Troy Brown's back,"
40:56,840;41:00,840;"but also huge news."
41:00,840;41:03,680;"Ken Walter, my boy's back."
41:03,680;41:05,800;"- Ken Walter, back of the vault."
41:05,800;41:06,640;"- Back."
41:06,640;41:10,140;"And not punting like booty I wrote down."
41:10,140;41:11,500;"- Yeah, for some reason."
41:11,500;41:13,500;"- They boot him getting cut and then re-signed again,"
41:13,500;41:14,980;"turned him into a decent punter."
41:14,980;41:17,620;"- Yeah, average 40 yards a punt on four puns in the game."
41:17,620;41:19,620;"- Did you hear how the crowd cheered him?"
41:19,620;41:21,300;"- They gave him a stand to go."
41:21,300;41:22,660;"- On the first pun, yeah."
41:22,660;41:23,700;"- Yeah."
41:23,700;41:25,340;"- 'Cause it went more than 30 yards."
41:25,340;41:27,260;"- That's being a good fan there."
41:27,260;41:28,100;"- Yeah."
41:28,100;41:29,980;"- Yeah, and then like what's going on."
41:29,980;41:30,820;"- Yeah."
41:30,820;41:33,540;"- And then one of the punts he pinned at the four yard line."
41:33,540;41:34,380;"- Yeah."
41:34,380;41:35,260;"- Who is this guy?"
41:35,260;41:37,020;"'cause I don't think it's Ken Walter."
41:37,020;41:41,260;"And then he had, his next punt was the typical"
41:41,260;41:44,220;"really bad punt that died halfway,"
41:44,220;41:46,940;"but then dribbled another like 30 yards."
41:46,940;41:48,680;"We dribbled that one inside the 20."
41:48,680;41:51,540;"So that still counts in the stats boys."
41:51,540;41:53,620;"That's classic Walter though."
41:53,620;41:54,680;"So he's back."
41:54,680;41:58,100;"And Vignitary looked a lot less shaky on his field goals"
41:58,100;41:59,780;"'cause Ken Walter's holding again."
41:59,780;42:01,060;"So that was nice to see."
42:01,060;42:03,100;"He reminds me of like what Flanders"
42:03,100;42:04,500;"would look like in real life."
42:04,500;42:06,180;"(laughing)"
42:06,180;42:07,780;"I don't know, it's personality at all,"
42:07,780;42:10,900;"but I don't know, just the name being bland,"
42:10,900;42:13,220;"him being just generic looking dude."
42:13,220;42:16,540;"- Ken Walters is also another Madden recreated name."
42:16,540;42:17,700;"(laughing)"
42:17,700;42:18,520;"Yeah, it is."
42:18,520;42:21,820;"And the guy that you kind of remember,"
42:21,820;42:23,340;"but I don't know, was he good?"
42:23,340;42:24,180;"Who knows?"
42:24,180;42:25,500;"(laughing)"
42:25,500;42:27,820;"It's just a dude that was on the roster."
42:27,820;42:29,380;"- I just tried to Google Ken Walters"
42:29,380;42:32,020;"to see if we could find him to reach out"
42:32,020;42:33,900;"to him on Twitter or something."
42:33,900;42:36,060;"He's not on the front page of Google."
42:36,060;42:38,740;"- There's other 10 Walters."
42:38,740;42:41,440;"That's 200 plus 10 Walters profiles on LinkedIn."
42:41,440;42:43,580;"- It's Walter Andy, that's why."
42:43,580;42:44,420;"- Is it?"
42:44,420;42:45,260;"- Yeah."
42:45,260;42:46,100;"- Yeah."
42:46,100;42:47,420;"- 'Cause I just Google search,"
42:47,420;42:49,340;"Jim and I got millions of pictures."
42:49,340;42:50,180;"- 10 Walter. - Okay."
42:50,180;42:53,020;"- First hit, 10 Walter Wikipedia."
42:53,020;42:54,140;"- You play for the Panthers."
42:54,140;42:56,180;"- Wow, good thing we have you to stat check, Greg."
42:56,180;42:57,020;"- I don't know."
42:57,020;42:58,580;"Someone's gonna keep us on us around."
42:58,580;43:00,980;"(laughing)"
43:00,980;43:03,700;"- Look at this, people also searched for"
43:03,700;43:07,400;"Mark Edwards, JR Redmond, Bethel Johnson,"
43:07,400;43:09,200;"and Rachey Caldwell."
43:09,200;43:10,300;"(laughing)"
43:10,300;43:12,280;"That's rarefied air right there."
43:12,280;43:14,120;"- It's called classification there."
43:14,120;43:16,180;"- But Edwards is in this game, right?"
43:16,180;43:17,440;"- Yeah, he's on, yeah."
43:17,440;43:19,880;"So is Chris Fuumatu Mahfala."
43:19,880;43:21,760;"- Wait, Fuumatu in this game?"
43:21,760;43:25,360;"- Yeah, he, in one bad Mahfala, yeah, he's Max ago."
43:25,360;43:29,280;"- Yeah, I saw that Edwards was in this game."
43:29,280;43:31,320;"- Wait, no, it's Troy Edwards."
43:31,320;43:32,160;"- No, Mark Edwards."
43:32,160;43:33,400;"- No, it's Mark."
43:33,400;43:34,240;"- Oh, it is Mark."
43:34,240;43:37,420;"- The full back who was like the Patriots top weapon"
43:37,420;43:38,420;"like two years ago."
43:38,420;43:40,960;"- Well, catch his 41 yards, not a 13."
43:40,960;43:43,260;"- I know, who knew?"
43:43,260;43:44,900;"Mark Edwards."
43:44,900;43:47,740;"- He's a super like MAGA guy now though."
43:47,740;43:50,400;"- Oh, who cares?"
43:50,400;43:55,400;"- I, there's a lot of people that are either former Patriots"
43:55,400;43:59,080;"or future Patriots, right?"
43:59,080;43:59,920;"- Yeah."
43:59,920;44:01,520;"- Fred Taylor."
44:01,520;44:04,200;"Mark Edwards, Kyle Brady."
44:04,200;44:05,240;"- Yep, yeah."
44:05,240;44:07,840;"There is at least one Brady to Brady touchdown."
44:07,840;44:11,880;"I believe it was an '07 against the..."
44:11,880;44:13,040;"- I guess it's on the..."
44:13,040;44:14,680;"- It's the other one I didn't think."
44:14,680;44:15,520;"- Yeah."
44:15,520;44:19,280;"Jimmy Smith feels like he could be a patriot."
44:19,280;44:20,800;"- He's shot at it, yeah."
44:20,800;44:23,400;"- Jack Del Rio, he was a linebacker for 11 years."
44:23,400;44:24,240;"Where did he play?"
44:24,240;44:26,720;"- Ohio State."
44:26,720;44:29,120;"(laughing)"
44:29,120;44:31,120;"Oh, that's"
44:31,120;44:37,560;"Look it up Betty's Ohio State guy Jack Del Rio USC"
44:37,560;44:44,720;"JDR the player"
44:44,720;44:49,340;"What is this come on show me him as a player"
44:49,340;44:52,640;"Jack Del Rio"
44:52,640;44:56,740;"Yeah, went to USC. Do you see his little turtleneck setup in this game?"
44:56,740;45:01,720;"Yeah, I respect from I don't know how many years see yeah, but the other comment who's like all look"
45:01,720;45:07,200;"He's he's braving the winter weather. I'm like a turtle neck. You're not braving anything in a turtleneck"
45:07,200;45:12,200;"Oh, yeah, it's got some turtleneck hate going on right now. Yeah. Why you got a turtleneck you want to put on?"
45:12,200;45:14,360;"No, but you Steve Jobs"
45:14,360;45:19,520;"Yeah, some sort of obscure Patriots player that we didn't even know you had a jersey turned into a turtleneck"
45:19,520;45:23,920;"I'm Elizabeth Holmes, bro"
45:25,560;45:27,560;"That's a deep cut"
45:27,560;45:29,880;"But"
45:29,880;45:31,880;"applicable here. Yeah, I"
45:31,880;45:37,720;"Turn that glady that we turn out to be a fraud and phony. That's me. Okay, it's perfect. Yeah, it's a self"
45:37,720;45:40,360;"Self burn that makes sense"
45:40,360;45:48,000;"All right, you guys got anything else in this game. I think I've got some trivia you want to give my oh, yeah, it's too trivia"
45:48,000;45:50,600;"Okay, this is not gonna be a Patriots"
45:51,320;45:56,080;"Related trivia, but it's going to be a Jacksonville related trivia. Oh good. We know all about them"
45:56,080;45:59,160;"Well, you were football fans so"
45:59,160;46:02,000;"Suck it up about to find out"
46:02,000;46:03,400;"Okay"
46:03,400;46:05,400;"Can you name?"
46:05,400;46:08,640;"the top five"
46:08,640;46:14,000;"Quarterbacks for Jacksonville in terms of yards"
46:14,000;46:17,000;"Asquals"
46:17,000;46:18,000;"Well, Mark Brinell."
46:18,000;46:20,700;"Mark Brinell is number one."
46:20,700;46:22,200;"Okay."
46:22,200;46:23,740;"Left which is number four."
46:23,740;46:26,300;"Oh, shit."
46:26,300;46:27,640;"Who is the other one we talked about?"
46:27,640;46:28,480;"Garard?"
46:28,480;46:30,640;"Garard is number three."
46:30,640;46:31,440;"So yeah, I'll do it."
46:31,440;46:33,280;"Left which line."
46:33,280;46:33,800;"All right."
46:33,800;46:34,300;"All right."
46:34,300;46:34,300;"All right."
46:34,300;46:36,920;"This is yards thrown in Jacksonville."
46:36,920;46:37,600;"Not OK."
46:37,600;46:37,880;"All right."
46:37,880;46:38,880;"Yeah."
46:38,880;46:40,800;"Yeah."
46:40,800;46:42,800;"Who is the one that?"
46:42,800;46:44,040;"Bortles, Blake Bortles."
46:44,040;46:46,400;"Blake Bortles is number two."
46:46,400;46:50,000;"Oh, so we're missing number five."
46:50,000;46:51,320;"They're missing number five."
46:51,320;46:52,720;"Gardner."
46:52,720;46:56,360;"Now Gardner and you is number six."
46:56,360;47:00,840;"Oh, he's playing like four games."
47:00,840;47:03,640;"I just hope."
47:03,640;47:06,040;"What's he getting over?"
47:06,040;47:08,200;"I don't know."
47:08,200;47:08,840;"Do you get to number seven?"
47:08,840;47:09,600;"Is that what you said?"
47:09,600;47:10,560;"I feel it."
47:10,560;47:12,480;"J.P."
47:12,480;47:13,520;"There is 15."
47:13,520;47:16,240;"Oh my goodness."
47:16,240;47:18,240;"I"
47:18,240;47:26,160;"Don't even need a time frame for number five. Okay number five played from 2012 to 2017"
47:26,160;47:29,240;"Oh"
47:29,240;47:37,120;"Fuck what was his name? I know who he is because we beat him like 51 to like seven or something that year"
47:37,120;47:41,200;"He was a high draft pick too, right? I"
47:41,200;47:44,760;"Like I think you're thinking of number"
47:44,760;47:51,760;"I'm going to give me number seven. I need it. Number seven is the infamous Blaine Gabbard."
47:51,760;47:56,960;"Blaine fucking Gabbard is seven."
47:56,960;48:02,360;"Wow. How many yards do you have at number seven? A total of four thousand three hundred"
48:02,360;48:08,060;"fifty seven yards. I'm ready to throw for more yards of the season. Oh, number number"
48:08,060;48:19,860;"12 is Nick Foles. What? You played four games last year. He's number 736. I'll give you"
48:19,860;48:24,940;"number five because I don't think you're going to get it's a deep cut. Chad Henny. Oh,"
48:24,940;48:29,940;"yes. I should have got that. Yes. Who's back in the limelight these days when in playoff"
48:29,940;48:37,020;"games like five years in Jacksonville. Damn. Yeah."
48:37,020;48:41,160;"I haven't came in Drew Henson next up. Oh Drew Henson. Yeah. Yeah."
48:41,160;48:46,840;"I can see that kind of a similar time frame. So from that I started thinking like where"
48:46,840;48:51,420;"does like how does Brady compare to these numbers?"
48:51,420;48:59,300;"So I think my question to you because I think this is where this is headed. How many of the"
48:59,300;49:02,220;"Top 10 lists combined."
49:02,220;49:04,180;"Does it take to get to Tom Brady's total?"
49:04,180;49:05,420;"Right."
49:05,420;49:06,740;"So that's where I started."
49:06,740;49:11,620;"OK, so Brunel actually has like a decent number of yards."
49:11,620;49:12,300;"OK, that makes sense."
49:12,300;49:13,420;"So it takes a little."
49:13,420;49:15,700;"It's like the top seven, I think."
49:15,700;49:18,500;"You'll get to like Brady."
49:18,500;49:19,860;"That's really cool."
49:19,860;49:21,100;"The touchdowns."
49:21,100;49:23,460;"That sounds very different story."
49:23,460;49:24,500;"Oh, no."
49:24,500;49:26,780;"Believe it or not."
49:27,660;49:32,300;"Tom Brady has more passing touchdowns than the entire Jacksonville franchise."
49:32,300;49:38,860;"So I'm Brady has 581 career touchdowns."
49:38,860;49:44,460;"Jacksonville quarterbacks in general, 520 touchdowns."
49:44,460;49:48,060;"So let's not even close 61 more touchdowns."
49:48,060;49:50,860;"Oh my God."
49:50,860;49:52,780;"And then you go, well, what about interceptions?"
49:53,340;49:55,820;"- Wait, Tom Brady's played a long time, yes."
49:55,820;49:59,700;"Tom Brady has 191 Korean receptions."
49:59,700;50:02,900;"Jacksonville quarterbacks, 358."
50:02,900;50:04,500;"(laughing)"
50:04,500;50:05,340;"- Double."
50:05,340;50:07,600;"(laughing)"
50:07,600;50:15,300;"- I'm pretty sure Tom Brady also has"
50:15,300;50:20,300;"more playoff touchdown passes for Tampa Bay"
50:20,300;50:23,140;"than every other Tampa Bay quarterback."
50:23,140;50:24,340;"Yeah, that makes sense."
50:24,340;50:25,180;"- That makes sense."
50:25,180;50:28,260;"- Except Tampa Bay was around since like how long ago?"
50:28,260;50:29,580;"The '70s, '80s?"
50:29,580;50:30,420;"- Yeah, there it is."
50:30,420;50:33,200;"- But now--"
50:33,200;50:36,260;"- See all the playoff stats are gonna make sense."
50:36,260;50:37,340;"- Yeah, what about--"
50:37,340;50:40,580;"- But this team was a 95 expansion team."
50:40,580;50:43,500;"They got like a six year head start on Tom Brady."
50:43,500;50:48,300;"- They've been able to choose whoever they want to do it too."
50:48,300;50:52,700;"- A six year head start with like first overall picks,"
50:52,700;51:00,220;"like galore. Yep. Unbelievable. But yeah, it's ridiculous."
51:00,220;51:01,460;"Does he have a blank?"
51:01,460;51:03,260;"Panthers? Shout out, chat."
51:03,260;51:06,940;"And if he beats the Panthers and the Jags, then it makes the"
51:06,940;51:11,860;"Chags look a little less. But the Panthers are also, you know,"
51:11,860;51:13,900;"doing way better than that. That's true. Yeah. I wonder if the"
51:13,900;51:19,100;"Panthers. Yeah. Yeah. I wonder what the touchdown totals are"
51:19,100;51:22,060;"for every team and where Brady ranks just on that list in"
51:22,060;51:24,860;"in general, more to how many t because I imagine it's probably"
51:24,860;51:26,500;"there are more touchdowns than Texans too."
51:26,500;51:30,020;"Just because they're the most recent, but I don't know."
51:30,020;51:31,300;"It's been"
51:31,300;51:34,420;"pain. It was got like they have big years from cam and they made"
51:34,420;51:37,660;"the Super Bowl with, you know, yeah, this year."
51:37,660;51:40,220;"Yeah, with Jake the loan through a bunch of touchdowns."
51:40,220;51:41,380;"I had a couple of good years."
51:41,380;51:46,020;"I would think the pandemic of Brady's career or at least closer."
51:46,020;51:51,260;"Also, we're comparing an entire franchise to Tom Brady."
51:51,500;51:53,780;"It was, I mean, played for 20 fucking years instead."
51:53,780;51:55,300;"God damn."
51:55,300;51:58,460;"And just for the record, Tom Brady's 500 and what do you say?"
51:58,460;51:59,380;"81 touchdowns."
51:59,380;52:00,860;"That's just what the Patriots."
52:00,860;52:02,540;"He's thrown 664 total."
52:02,540;52:07,180;"But what Tom Brady's thrown 664 touchdown passes in his career."
52:07,180;52:09,260;"I don't know if you're not in good and playoffs or what."
52:09,260;52:09,940;"Yeah."
52:09,940;52:11,100;"Yeah, it must be non-play."
52:11,100;52:13,260;"Andy, stat check in the stat check."
52:13,260;52:14,420;"Where are you from?"
52:14,420;52:15,340;"For Paul reference?"
52:15,340;52:17,740;"No, I have my own website for this."
52:17,740;52:18,500;"Oh, because I'm the"
52:18,500;52:20,100;"He's dying of the info."
52:20,100;52:20,900;"No, it's a new one."
52:20,900;52:22,860;"It's just Tom Brady's touchdowns."
52:22,860;52:25,580;"Oh, he's got his Tom Brady touchdown website."
52:25,580;52:26,420;"Yeah."
52:26,420;52:27,220;"Of course."
52:27,220;52:29,340;"Yeah, you know, as you do."
52:29,340;52:29,900;"Mm-hmm."
52:29,900;52:33,460;"And he's something to get me through the playoffs this year."
52:33,460;52:34,460;"And that was it."
52:34,460;52:38,220;"His touchdown for the most area yards"
52:38,220;52:40,860;"were the most common area yards is 10."
52:40,860;52:44,700;"For him, he's from 45 touchdowns of 10 area yards."
52:44,700;52:45,940;"Imagine that."
52:45,940;52:46,340;"Hi."
52:46,340;52:47,060;"Hello."
52:47,060;52:48,420;"Hi, Kelly."
52:48,420;52:50,420;"I can't hear you so I don't know."
52:50,420;52:51,420;"Hi."
52:51,420;52:54,420;"Whatever drag is saying, we're getting actually--"
52:54,420;52:58,420;"What do you think of the Jacksonville Jaguars?"
52:58,420;53:00,420;"Your dinner is going to be delicious."
53:00,420;53:02,420;"[LAUGHTER]"
53:02,420;53:03,420;"Nailed it."
53:03,420;53:04,420;"Thanks, Kelly."
53:04,420;53:05,420;"Yeah."
53:05,420;53:07,420;"[LAUGHTER]"
53:07,420;53:11,420;"All right, best and worst."
53:11,420;53:12,420;"Go ahead."
53:12,420;53:13,420;"Steven?"
53:13,420;53:14,420;"Greg's got to eat dinner."
53:14,420;53:15,420;"Yeah."
53:15,420;53:16,420;"So Greg, you go first before you."
53:16,420;53:17,420;"OK."
53:17,420;53:20,060;"So eating on fucking audio because that's what we need."
53:20,060;53:23,980;"Oh, can you guys go first?"
53:23,980;53:34,300;"Sure. Oh, here's my best. I will share my screen so you can all hear it."
53:34,300;53:40,140;"Tom Brady definitely had an Omaha call. If you're listening closely."
53:45,740;53:48,060;"really making adjustments at the line of screen."
53:48,060;53:52,620;"Do you hear it? Yeah. You're right."
53:52,620;53:59,820;"So I don't know if he's copying a certain other quarterback or if he's making fun of it because"
53:59,820;54:04,540;"I feel like that would be something you would do. So that's, is that a best or worst? I don't know."
54:04,540;54:11,340;"Oh, one of my best was William McGinnest played out of his mind and he almost had these"
54:12,380;54:21,260;"really amazing interception where he jumps like back against the way he was moving and almost"
54:21,260;54:27,980;"snagged like two handed this like ridiculous like a fucking cannon throw of Byron left which"
54:27,980;54:33,100;"he had a superb sack to that just got recovered by the team he did yeah he was uh he was disruptive"
54:33,100;54:38,140;"and he had some like play where he blew up the run and the commentators couldn't get over the"
54:38,140;54:42,240;"the fact that Ted Washington was also on the field, who like eventually made the tackle"
54:42,240;54:46,240;"because of William Egan is disrupting the entire play all by himself."
54:46,240;54:52,820;"But yeah, it was a good game for the defense again, who just like aren't allowing anything."
54:52,820;54:56,160;"And eventually the offense I think will probably come into their own, but they don't even need"
54:56,160;55:02,960;"to because this Patriots is, this Patriots team isn't allowing any fucking, any scores,"
55:02,960;55:05,640;"any yards, any anything at this point in the season."
55:05,640;55:11,200;"Because they're all healthy again, which is another thing we haven't touched on. Yeah, I'm getting everybody back. Yeah, although"
55:11,200;55:15,460;"Dion branch first play from scrimmage"
55:15,460;55:23,000;"That was a really nice long catch on the sideline hurts himself and is out for the rest of the game. You don't see him again"
55:23,000;55:25,940;"Yeah, I can get your break. Yeah"
55:25,940;55:29,960;"Am I worse is probably Jack Del Rio's"
55:29,960;55:32,760;"Turleneck"
55:32,800;55:39,080;"Hate's turtlenecks. Yeah, fuck it fucking turtlenecks. I mean fucking make up your mind either wear like a"
55:39,080;55:42,800;"Like a full thing or not like we're a t-shirt"
55:42,800;55:47,920;"How do you feel about scarves and even it's kind of like a removable turtleneck scarves are fine"
55:47,920;55:54,800;"Because they are what they are like a turtleneck's like, you know, do I want to be like a full thing or what about callers?"
55:54,800;55:59,720;"Not a huge fan of callers, but I wear them because I have to I have a short sleeve turtleneck"
55:59,920;56:03,240;"That's that's a crime against humanity. I'm pretty sure"
56:03,240;56:07,440;"It's like a shirt sleeve turtle neck wicking"
56:07,440;56:10,800;"Material I have a short sleep hoodie"
56:10,800;56:18,080;"Well, that's because your bill Bellagion. It's legit a bill Bellag check hoodie"
56:18,080;56:25,800;"branded Patriots yes the one little BB on it like they took bill Bell cheques protest and turned it into an even more"
56:26,560;56:32,420;"Look at the revenue stream by the day did it's nice. It's not good. It's like a sleeve can often they can save on materials. It's like a nice"
56:32,420;56:36,260;"I guess that's like sure to yeah, but mine has sleeves. I"
56:36,260;56:40,800;"Actually wear it a lot cuz like it's nice to keep like your core warm"
56:40,800;56:45,160;"But like if you're like cooking or like doing woodworking you don't want your sleeves all up in your shit"
56:45,160;56:49,760;"It's true sleeves to get away. Yeah, mm-hmm. Yeah, I discovered the world of vests yet Greg"
56:49,760;56:54,080;"No"
56:54,080;56:57,880;"my worst is to decide what you want to be."
56:57,880;57:00,560;"Fucking turtle next."
57:00,560;57:03,320;"Well, as some colleagues talk about how it feels like if you"
57:03,320;57:05,960;"were in a turtle neck and a backpack, it feels like a week"
57:05,960;57:07,520;"midget is trying to strangle you all day."
57:07,520;57:10,520;"I shout out."
57:10,520;57:13,000;"I'm gonna start my worst."
57:13,000;57:13,760;"Okay."
57:13,760;57:15,960;"You get the bad out of the way early."
57:15,960;57:19,520;"Like the worst play was Antoine Smith fumble inside the tenure line."
57:19,520;57:20,640;"That was bad."
57:20,640;57:21,040;"Yeah."
57:21,360;57:26,080;"his first fumble in like, yeah, 40 games or something though."
57:26,080;57:28,360;"But then like really almost gets that strip sack."
57:28,360;57:29,120;"Yeah."
57:29,120;57:32,160;"Interception by time pool touchdown by clown brown."
57:32,160;57:34,680;"So it all the defense build them out."
57:34,680;57:35,480;"Yes."
57:35,480;57:38,480;"But it was a bad, bad fumble."
57:38,480;57:40,120;"It wasn't great."
57:40,120;57:41,000;"You're right."
57:41,000;57:44,520;"And then just like bigger picture that just speaks to the whole thing."
57:44,520;57:47,800;"Like when we said a couple of times, I cannot believe a Patriots win it."
57:47,800;57:50,200;"Super Bowl is here because there's some fundamental flaws."
57:50,640;57:52,200;"And I'm only not really is it."
57:52,200;57:53,640;"It's penalties."
57:53,640;57:54,480;"- Yep."
57:54,480;57:55,520;"- But they went a whole half of that penalty"
57:55,520;57:57,560;"and I was like, wow, the whole half, no penalties."
57:57,560;57:59,080;"And they get one like the first fucking play"
57:59,080;57:59,920;"of the second half."
57:59,920;58:00,760;"- Yeah."
58:00,760;58:03,300;"And it was like a, it was like a,"
58:03,300;58:08,480;"like a roughing penalty after the play was over,"
58:08,480;58:10,200;"like jumping on the pile or some bullshit."
58:10,200;58:11,720;"- And then like a no doubt or two."
58:11,720;58:12,560;"- Yeah, yeah."
58:12,560;58:13,400;"- Like a, - Yeah."
58:13,400;58:14,640;"- even like a, - Matt Light of all people."
58:14,640;58:15,840;"- Yes."
58:15,840;58:16,680;"- Yeah."
58:16,680;58:17,520;"And not pushing them out of field goal range"
58:17,520;58:19,160;"is like third and 20 something"
58:19,160;58:22,040;"and you're not gonna recover from that."
58:22,040;58:23,940;"- And then they showed another stat"
58:23,940;58:26,440;"in the speaks to the defense,"
58:26,440;58:27,560;"really propped up the offense"
58:27,560;58:30,280;"of the worst red zone percentage in the NFL."
58:30,280;58:31,720;"Which I only got much better in this game."
58:31,720;58:34,280;"They have the worst red zone offense in the whole league."
58:34,280;58:35,360;"- That's 'cause they can't run the ball"
58:35,360;58:38,000;"'cause Antoine Smith is like basically"
58:38,000;58:39,960;"a horse with a broken leg at this point."
58:39,960;58:41,560;"- 17 for 39."
58:41,560;58:43,760;"- That's bad."
58:43,760;58:47,480;"That is, and that is really fucking bad."
58:47,480;58:50,960;"Yeah, but this is why likes to Steve's point has been saying all season"
58:50,960;58:54,480;"This is why they go out and get a running back who can finish drives, right?"
58:54,480;58:56,480;"Yeah, but the question is"
58:56,480;59:00,400;"Why does he still get carries? Why does he have 17 carries?"
59:00,400;59:03,960;"Nobody else and I feel this so shit that like it really"
59:03,960;59:08,120;"And he actually well he played okay in this game"
59:08,120;59:11,640;"He had some decent runs and then as soon as you fumble you have saw him again"
59:11,640;59:15,560;"Yeah, but they also called like a third like on hats right after they showed that stat"
59:15,560;59:20,640;"They called a third and inches Antoine's fresh play and I was like, yeah, what are you doing?"
59:20,640;59:23,320;"Yeah, we all know that's not gonna work. Yeah, of course"
59:23,320;59:28,600;"He's not gonna do and I kick a 22 yard field goal. Yeah, but then he had they had they called a draw play to him"
59:28,600;59:31,080;"And he gained like 15 16 yards on it"
59:31,080;59:37,280;"So I'm thinking we're dumb enough to give the ball to Antoine Smith especially not on a draw"
59:37,280;59:42,720;"But let's talk about best yeah, give me some best"
59:43,480;59:48,480;"My best involved the officials. Oh, oh, not not their"
59:48,480;59:53,800;"Good or bad officiating of the game. I think this is this is a high thing"
59:53,800;59:55,800;"It will be on the website because I"
59:55,800;01:00:01,680;"Before that I noticed this and I think we all noticed this at some point"
01:00:01,680;01:00:04,680;"But it's good to see that it really started very early"
01:00:04,680;01:00:07,200;"Tom Brady gets in every single rep huddle"
01:00:07,200;01:00:11,880;"And they're like he's like one of the refs and yeah Tom. This is what we're doing"
01:00:12,680;01:00:14,800;"You know no no come on. What are you talking about? Yeah?"
01:00:14,800;01:00:18,520;"I didn't see that I didn't see that I saw it slightly differently guys"
01:00:18,520;01:00:22,840;"Yeah, and it's crazy to see that like he's been doing that for his whole career"
01:00:22,840;01:00:27,520;"He's doing that now. Yeah, anytime the rest hot a lot. He's like, what's up? Yeah, I does"
01:00:27,520;01:00:34,720;"Just wants to know what the call is gonna be so we can prepare and then the highlight you're talking about on that"
01:00:34,720;01:00:40,240;"Tyrone pool celebrating to early play the reason he started celebrating"
01:00:41,880;01:00:46,640;"looking out his right eye at left which he's like a you know pretty big and fast"
01:00:46,640;01:00:50,880;"yeah how big was he great how big was fire left which six five two fifty yeah"
01:00:50,880;01:00:53,600;"and like he just with that pick he got it"
01:00:53,600;01:00:57,300;"kind of run into as a pylon yeah and I think left bridge had the angle would"
01:00:57,300;01:01:02,760;"have been pretty close referee trucking along head referee yeah throws the"
01:01:02,760;01:01:09,400;"perfect block oh yeah let me shut them down they tripped him up with his feet"
01:01:09,400;01:01:17,320;"Yeah, and left was like stands on him and then like the end of the clip is just a ref laying on his back as if he's just fucking dead"
01:01:17,320;01:01:21,280;"You just got I thought they almost looked intentional"
01:01:21,280;01:01:25,760;"Oh the rep the ref had no idea. I mean left which I don't know"
01:01:25,760;01:01:33,320;"That guy yeah, maybe I see like stampede in them. It's like fucking Lion King shit"
01:01:33,320;01:01:34,520;"You just want to be from Marshall."
01:01:34,520;01:01:35,600;"- You did it, you did it, you did it, you did it."
01:01:35,600;01:01:36,440;"- Yeah."
01:01:36,440;01:01:37,280;"(laughing)"
01:01:37,280;01:01:38,120;"- I'm doing hard."
01:01:38,120;01:01:38,960;"- I'm doing great."
01:01:38,960;01:01:40,360;"- Coming through, chew, chew."
01:01:40,360;01:01:41,200;"(laughing)"
01:01:41,200;01:01:44,640;"- That thundering heard on him, just get him under foot."
01:01:44,640;01:01:46,160;"- Yeah, that was, that was a minute."
01:01:46,160;01:01:47,440;"And then I don't know if you know,"
01:01:47,440;01:01:49,280;"no, it is this Steve, but after the play,"
01:01:49,280;01:01:52,200;"like after they got him up and like checked everything,"
01:01:52,200;01:01:54,080;"I think it was fourth, oh no,"
01:01:54,080;01:01:55,440;"'cause the page said the ball."
01:01:55,440;01:01:57,320;"So, but you, they showed Teddy Bruce,"
01:01:57,320;01:01:59,320;"you walking over him and holding him fingers like,"
01:01:59,320;01:02:00,320;"and you could tell he was like,"
01:02:00,320;01:02:01,280;"how many fingers am I holding up?"
01:02:01,280;01:02:02,120;"You okay?"
01:02:02,120;01:02:02,960;"Can you still say?"
01:02:02,960;01:02:06,320;"Yeah. That's about a rub. It like heads off."
01:02:06,320;01:02:10,160;"Uh, I was wondering what that's on. Do it. I was like, I didn't get."
01:02:10,160;01:02:12,800;"Yeah. Now it took me a second. I was like, what is he? Oh, all right."
01:02:12,800;01:02:14,760;"Yeah. That's the ref. It just got his ass trucked."
01:02:14,760;01:02:18,400;"Yeah, I have to go in. Good one."
01:02:18,400;01:02:25,480;"All right. Can you mine? Yes, please. Okay."
01:02:25,480;01:02:31,160;"The, my best is going to be Steve's dog."
01:02:31,160;01:02:38,360;"Gus, congratulations Steve. I'm very happy for you. You know, it's never coming back on the bottom."
01:02:38,360;01:02:45,960;"This is a set up for his worst. No, it's not. No, it's not. Yeah. I'm happy for you. You're excited."
01:02:45,960;01:02:55,000;"You got a dog. Congratulations. Wow. My worst is the Overunder on this game. Suck it Steve. Okay."
01:02:56,120;01:03:00,860;"Over under going into this game was 33 with snow in the"
01:03:00,860;01:03:07,500;"Yeah, 25 minutes in a modern day NFL over under at 33. I"
01:03:07,500;01:03:10,840;"Mean they barely got the over"
01:03:10,840;01:03:17,760;"No, I was over bad. Okay. It's nasty over all right. Well the the get the last week's game was 35"
01:03:17,760;01:03:20,160;"It was 12 nothing. Yeah"
01:03:20,760;01:03:23,160;"- Every time, different times, huh?"
01:03:23,160;01:03:25,600;"- And both these defenses were hot."
01:03:25,600;01:03:27,640;"I'm a little surprised I went over to be honest."
01:03:27,640;01:03:30,800;"- Can you filter your website by over under Andy?"
01:03:30,800;01:03:32,000;"- Should be able to you."
01:03:32,000;01:03:33,000;"Is that what you're doing right now?"
01:03:33,000;01:03:34,120;"- Can you guys hear me?"
01:03:34,120;01:03:40,520;"My best is just so much Kelly just brought me to the left."
01:03:40,520;01:03:41,760;"- But my worst?"
01:03:41,760;01:03:43,840;"- My worst is great."
01:03:43,840;01:03:45,800;"- Ellie's timing on dinners."
01:03:45,800;01:03:47,920;"(laughing)"
01:03:47,920;01:03:49,800;"We recorded 7 p.m."
01:03:49,800;01:03:51,800;"Every Thursday."
01:03:51,800;01:03:53,500;"What time's dinner serves?"
01:03:53,500;01:03:55,440;"- She's giving me an eight o'clock."
01:03:55,440;01:03:57,680;"(laughing)"
01:03:57,680;01:03:59,280;"- We used dinner at eight o'clock."
01:03:59,280;01:04:01,720;"- Right, there was one other Patriots game"
01:04:01,720;01:04:05,160;"with a lower over under than this game."
01:04:05,160;01:04:06,000;"- Really?"
01:04:06,000;01:04:07,600;"- Whoa, how did you figure this out?"
01:04:07,600;01:04:09,640;"- Andy's website, you can filter by over under."
01:04:09,640;01:04:10,640;"- Oh, yeah."
01:04:10,640;01:04:12,260;"Sweet, website Andy."
01:04:12,260;01:04:14,360;"Fuck yourself."
01:04:14,360;01:04:17,640;"- We call them in 2000, Cleveland Browns."
01:04:17,640;01:04:18,960;"- Oh, and you're fucking hot."
01:04:18,960;01:04:25,520;"It was 19 to 11. We lost to the Browns and the overunder was 32."
01:04:25,520;01:04:30,560;"There it was. And it was under. Yeah. Wow. The underhand."
01:04:30,560;01:04:34,160;"Wait, which season was that? 2000."
01:04:34,160;01:04:38,400;"So this is pretty remarkable that an overunder would be 33."
01:04:38,400;01:04:40,080;"Yes. What week was that, Steve?"
01:04:40,080;01:04:42,080;"Uh, was it so?"
01:04:42,080;01:04:44,160;"It was a week 11."
01:04:44,160;01:04:48,560;"All right. So because I think, I remember reading a story about how in"
01:04:48,560;01:04:55,880;"2000 because the cap had been so mismanaged by Pete Carroll probably. The"
01:04:55,880;01:05:02,240;"Patriots didn't have enough money to sign a full 53 players to the roster. So"
01:05:02,240;01:05:05,840;"they actually played with like 50 guys on the team the end of that season. And"
01:05:05,840;01:05:09,760;"their Patriots like we just want guys who want to be here at this point like"
01:05:09,760;01:05:13,240;"they're doing it to prove a point as well as having no money. So I'm wondering if"
01:05:13,240;01:05:18,240;"that contributed to an overrun 32 and then hit the under."
01:05:18,240;01:05:21,600;"'Cause that would be about that same time, I think."
01:05:21,600;01:05:22,960;"Yeah, all right."
01:05:22,960;01:05:25,560;"I wish I got to go to Shaper Stadium."
01:05:25,560;01:05:26,840;"Yeah."
01:05:26,840;01:05:30,600;"Apparently I did once, but I was an infant"
01:05:30,600;01:05:33,320;"and my grandmother took me back to the car"
01:05:33,320;01:05:35,440;"and watched a guy pee in the,"

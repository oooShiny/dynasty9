00:06,840;00:08,280;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,280;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:14,320;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,320;00:15,560;"You still want to listen?"

00:43,240;00:45,800;"- I mean, it's also finding you with their warm glow"
00:45,800;00:48,080;"of Tom Brady pictures."
00:48,080;00:48,920;"- All right."
00:48,920;00:51,080;"Welcome to the ""Pagers Dynasty"" podcast."
00:51,080;00:52,920;"And for those of you who've been listening all the way through,"
00:52,920;00:53,760;"welcome back."
00:53,760;00:57,920;"We're week five of the 2002 NFL season."
00:57,920;01:00,120;"The Patriots have traveled to Miami"
01:00,120;01:02,320;"to visit the three-in-one Dolphins."
01:02,320;01:03,960;"The Patriots also three-in-one,"
01:03,960;01:07,080;"but not for long for either of these teams."
01:08,480;01:14,400;"Let's talk about these fucking Miami fucking dolphins, shall we?"
01:14,400;01:15,400;"Well, wait."
01:15,400;01:17,880;"I want to acknowledge a mistake you made there."
01:17,880;01:21,640;"He said they're both three and one, but not for long."
01:21,640;01:22,560;"That's true."
01:22,560;01:26,000;"By the fact, though, that they're playing the game."
01:26,000;01:26,500;"Right."
01:26,500;01:28,600;"That's what I was meaning."
01:28,600;01:30,920;"Oh, they're both going to have a different record"
01:30,920;01:31,960;"at the end of this game."
01:31,960;01:34,240;"Yeah, I think it was podcast."
01:34,240;01:36,760;"We will find out what those records are."
01:36,760;01:37,280;"OK."
01:37,280;01:38,360;"All right."
01:38,360;01:42,760;"Oh, we can ruin it now and let you know that the new game on page would lose this game."
01:42,760;01:45,880;"They get doubled up by a score of 26 to 13."
01:45,880;01:50,680;"This is like the longest losing streak of our dynasty."
01:50,680;01:52,640;"So clearly they lost so far it is."
01:52,640;01:54,360;"We're to ruin that, Steve."
01:54,360;02:00,560;"What everyone knows this period is one of the pages lost in most games in a row."
02:00,560;02:01,920;"It's true."
02:01,920;02:04,400;"Have you learned how many games it is yet?"
02:04,400;02:08,320;"No, don't tell me how I want to be surprised when we win a game."
02:08,320;02:11,880;"I know that we're going to lose a bunch."
02:11,880;02:14,200;"But I don't know how many."
02:14,200;02:15,920;"I don't remember how long the street lasted."
02:15,920;02:18,080;"Do you have a do you have like a ballpark in your mind?"
02:18,080;02:19,560;"What you think it's going to be question?"
02:19,560;02:23,640;"But I think I'm are we ended up nine and seven, right?"
02:23,640;02:26,320;"I think yeah."
02:26,320;02:27,680;"Now we're eight, eight, right?"
02:27,680;02:28,760;"We were nine, seven, I think."
02:28,760;02:30,680;"I think so. Yeah."
02:30,680;02:32,440;"So I'm going to say five games."
02:32,440;02:34,600;"OK, let's see how that turns out."
02:34,600;02:36,160;"We're five."
02:36,160;02:41,160;"And let's do our Lombardi rating."
02:41,160;02:43,480;"- Oh, right, yeah."
02:43,480;02:47,120;"The watchability of this."
02:47,120;02:48,480;"- One of the parties."
02:48,480;02:50,920;"- Greg, how many Lombardi would you give this game?"
02:50,920;02:52,320;"(laughing)"
02:52,320;02:53,480;"- Well, the highlights."
02:53,480;02:57,360;"- They had the prime time highlights on YouTube."
02:57,360;02:58,840;"- So that's already won."
02:58,840;02:59,760;"- Yes."
02:59,760;03:00,960;"- By default."
03:00,960;03:02,600;"- And that's all I watch, so."
03:03,800;03:10,520;"I'm on the scale of like not on YouTube to prime time on YouTube."
03:10,520;03:12,800;"So I'll go."
03:12,800;03:14,520;"I'll give it a three, three Lombardis."
03:14,520;03:15,080;"All right."
03:15,080;03:15,560;"Fair enough."
03:15,560;03:18,600;"I watched this whole game and I give it negative one."
03:18,600;03:19,360;"Not Lombardi."
03:19,360;03:21,560;"Dude, you can't do that."
03:21,560;03:23,000;"I don't think we can do negative."
03:23,000;03:25,080;"So zero zero Lombardis."
03:25,080;03:26,760;"This game was atrocious."
03:26,760;03:31,160;"I would give it one Lombardi."
03:33,040;03:38,600;"Just because of the touchdown catches that happened for the Patriots in this game, they were pretty sick."
03:38,600;03:41,720;"Two good plays in the entire game."
03:41,720;03:43,120;"Yeah."
03:43,120;03:47,400;"And there was a stat where the Patriots had two scoring drives, right?"
03:47,400;03:52,160;"And two drives of five or more plays in the whole game."
03:52,160;03:53,840;"And those are the two scoring drives."
03:53,840;03:54,840;"First half."
03:54,840;03:57,080;"All right."
03:57,080;03:57,280;"All right."
03:57,280;03:58,000;"Pump the brakes."
03:58,000;04:01,600;"We haven't actually talked about these fucking Miami fucking dolphins yet."
04:01,640;04:04,160;"But if that's not a zero Lombardi game, I don't know what is."
04:04,160;04:07,520;"I can think of one off the top of my head."
04:07,520;04:10,640;"It wasn't entertaining, though."
04:10,640;04:12,920;"I was going to give a couple off the top of my head."
04:12,920;04:14,640;"He's watching here."
04:14,640;04:15,480;"Yeah."
04:15,480;04:16,840;"What are they, Andy?"
04:16,840;04:20,000;"The 0.7 Super Bowl."
04:20,000;04:20,840;"Is it a bomb?"
04:20,840;04:24,960;"Bardi's and then the loss to the Jets and the playoffs."
04:24,960;04:26,680;"That's close."
04:26,680;04:27,440;"I'm going to get to negative."
04:27,440;04:28,280;"Oh, yeah."
04:28,280;04:29,000;"I was at that game."
04:29,000;04:29,720;"It was brutal."
04:29,720;04:34,720;"Oh, seven, two bowls at least like close and you're on the edge of your seat all the time."
04:34,720;04:37,720;"Yeah, but it's just the way it ended, bud."
04:37,720;04:40,720;"That negates anything that happened beforehand for me."
04:40,720;04:42,720;"We'll get to that."
04:42,720;04:43,720;"Yeah."
04:43,720;04:47,720;"You should never get blown out, but they got a wolf in here."
04:47,720;04:49,720;"They lost by 13 points."
04:49,720;04:55,720;"That's not exactly a blowout, but it's actually less than they lost to Miami last year."
04:55,720;04:56,720;"I didn't watch that."
04:56,720;05:02,480;"30 to 10 right that was a me and Mike game and that was one where you said I think that was also a zero on party game"
05:02,480;05:06,400;"Yes, never watch that again. No, and that was in Miami as well, right?"
05:06,400;05:08,080;"Yeah"
05:08,080;05:11,620;"so let's actually touch on that real quick because I"
05:11,620;05:16,160;"Remember the page is not playing well in Miami. I"
05:16,160;05:21,680;"Didn't realize how bad it actually was"
05:21,680;05:24,360;"good"
05:24,360;05:26,560;"Like oh, I knew it was pretty well documented"
05:26,560;05:34,640;"Yeah, they mustn't know but I feel like the the the edges have kind of been taken off of that in the in the dynasty era"
05:34,640;05:36,680;"have they"
05:36,680;05:43,520;"To a certain extent. I mean it's still a hard place to play but it's it wasn't the nightmare that I think you"
05:43,520;05:46,680;"Are underestimating it used to be?"
05:48,600;05:53,060;"Because the Patriots it's since since Bell check took over the pages of 9 and 11"
05:53,060;05:56,160;"Which you know feels like a travesty of itself"
05:56,160;06:02,840;"It against dolphins in Miami, right? Yeah, which is terrible compared to their"
06:02,840;06:06,840;"Like average, you know win percentage"
06:06,840;06:10,840;"I have you know what they were before Bell check took over though"
06:10,840;06:17,720;"Yeah, but that they're consistent with how they were normally playing like it's an aberration"
06:17,720;06:19,720;"That's why it's so crazy that they're"
06:19,720;06:22,600;"Yeah"
06:22,600;06:24,600;"They were seven and 27"
06:24,600;06:31,800;"They were four and twenty five actually okay, so it's a disparity between their total"
06:31,800;06:36,480;"win percentage over that time and then the disparity between in"
06:36,480;06:43,260;"Underpeil check so I just I just want to want to just pause this moment right now because I"
06:43,800;06:49,280;"Don't think what Greg realized what he's done is that he the stat tracker has given himself a stat to check"
06:49,280;06:58,220;"I've been listening to that podcast. He sent me oh yeah stats over storylines, baby. It's great. It's shout him out"
06:58,220;06:59,920;"Yeah"
06:59,920;07:06,520;"I'm not buying these storylines anymore Andy check the goddamn numbers. All right. I'm telling them is the Patriots"
07:06,520;07:09,280;"from"
07:09,280;07:10,680;"whatever the"
07:10,680;07:16,320;"Pro Football reference start is the like the Super Bowl era right back in the 70s 70 or 72"
07:16,320;07:18,600;"Okay"
07:18,600;07:20,840;"From when they started playing the dolphins"
07:20,840;07:29,800;"They were their first win from 1970 came against the dolphins in Miami anybody want to guess the year that it came"
07:29,800;07:34,160;"1970 no"
07:34,160;07:36,840;"83 no"
07:36,840;07:39,800;"Further or after you were born"
07:40,320;07:42,720;"Uh, it was just after."
07:42,720;07:43,760;"Wow."
07:43,760;07:45,040;"I was two."
07:45,040;07:46,680;"It was 1985."
07:46,680;07:50,120;"They started to own 16 at Miami before getting the first one."
07:50,120;07:52,240;"Oh, yeah."
07:52,240;07:56,880;"There at the longest wind streak the pages have had in my like playing in Miami."
07:56,880;07:58,640;"Three games."
07:58,640;08:02,000;"That's not very good."
08:02,000;08:05,600;"2010 to 2012, like this is it's a house of horrors."
08:06,120;08:10,520;"So I kind of almost want to write to the stats in storylines guy."
08:10,520;08:19,880;"That's over storylines guys and say, do does Miami as a home stadium?"
08:19,880;08:24,600;"Is it more of a home field advantage than these other like so-called home field"
08:24,600;08:26,520;"advantage is like Denver and Kansas."
08:26,520;08:32,720;"I would say and not in terms of like how, how many more games they win at home"
08:32,720;08:34,560;"than they do away because dogs are terrible away."
08:34,560;08:38,560;"Yeah, so I think that's just a Patriots thing."
08:38,560;08:39,560;"Maybe."
08:39,560;08:42,560;"And it's also a like September thing."
08:42,560;08:48,560;"Like this game is pretty early in the year and they're talking about how hot it is and the dark jerseys and all that."
08:48,560;08:53,560;"That's always been that like the early season Patriots games over that."
08:53,560;08:54,560;"She's done for the game."
08:54,560;08:56,560;"We went to as a family."
08:56,560;08:57,560;"Yep."
08:57,560;08:58,560;"Early in the year."
08:58,560;08:59,560;"It was pretty hot as shit."
08:59,560;09:00,560;"So hot."
09:00,560;09:01,560;"I'd take my shirt off."
09:01,560;09:03,560;"Yeah, that's why you did it."
09:03,560;09:09,360;"Yeah, the Patriots at home against the Dolphins 16 and four."
09:09,360;09:11,280;"Like that's a ridiculous disparity."
09:11,280;09:13,920;"16 and four."
09:13,920;09:17,480;"Yeah, as opposed to 9 and 11 in my own."
09:17,480;09:19,920;"So 56 features 53."
09:19,920;09:26,520;"Yeah, so basically Miami only wins when they're playing home and the Patriots only win when"
09:26,520;09:27,520;"they play at home."
09:27,520;09:28,520;"Crazy."
09:28,520;09:33,520;"So what is it Andy for before Bella check at home?"
09:33,520;09:37,400;"I don't have those numbers right now."
09:37,400;09:40,000;"Said it was four and 25."
09:40,000;09:41,980;"Yeah, four and 25 in Miami."
09:41,980;09:44,480;"Okay."
09:44,480;09:46,820;"We'll put it in the show notes,"
09:46,820;09:49,520;"but I'm running those numbers 'cause I wanna know."
09:49,520;09:50,520;"Yeah, so do I."
09:50,520;09:54,600;"Because my gut feeling is,"
09:54,600;09:58,040;"this is like somewhat of just like a weird anomaly."
09:58,040;10:02,040;"Like yeah, there's the heat element."
10:02,040;10:04,760;"But I think it's just one of those weird,"
10:04,760;10:09,000;"like the Hail Mary or the Hail Mary play, right?"
10:09,000;10:12,080;"Where Crog could, that's just like a weird thing."
10:12,080;10:12,920;"- That's true."
10:12,920;10:15,040;"- You know, it's got nothing to do with like,"
10:15,040;10:17,120;"where you know they didn't play well enough to."
10:17,120;10:17,960;"- Yeah."
10:17,960;10:19,280;"- Yeah, it was just like a weird,"
10:19,280;10:22,040;"one of those Ryan Fitzpatrick games."
10:22,040;10:23,360;"- Yeah."
10:23,360;10:24,760;"- The game that we went to,"
10:24,760;10:27,400;"they had four chances from like the 10 yard line"
10:27,400;10:29,640;"to punch in, they didn't remember."
10:29,640;10:30,640;"- Yep. - Yeah."
10:30,640;10:34,760;"- So the more of the story,"
10:34,760;10:36,800;"it's like a Bermuda triangle, you know?"
10:36,800;10:38,160;"There's no explanation."
10:38,160;10:39,480;"- A Miami triangle, if you will."
10:39,480;10:40,840;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
10:40,840;10:42,800;"- Where do you think it's, I mean,"
10:42,800;10:44,640;"over the, at least the pages of Odyssey,"
10:44,640;10:46,300;"it's been pretty clear it's been two stadiums"
10:46,300;10:47,140;"when they struggle."
10:47,140;10:49,680;"It's on the road of Miami early in the year"
10:49,680;10:51,320;"and it's at mile high."
10:51,320;10:52,160;"- Yep."
10:52,160;10:53,480;"- Which one's worse, you think?"
10:53,480;11:00,040;"Um, worse in which way."
11:00,040;11:03,360;"Which one kept Brady up later at night?"
11:03,360;11:05,400;"Oh."
11:05,400;11:09,080;"Mile high."
11:09,080;11:10,000;"That's a good question."
11:10,000;11:12,920;"Yeah, because I feel like the mile high games were more"
11:12,920;11:15,680;"stakes were higher and you didn't play him as often."
11:15,680;11:16,040;"Yeah."
11:16,040;11:19,320;"Yeah, because three of those losses came in the playoffs."
11:19,320;11:22,440;"Two came in over time."
11:23,240;11:24,720;"There were five and seven mile high."
11:24,720;11:29,620;"I bet early in the year, though, like, like an early embrace career."
11:29,620;11:31,020;"That's probably the dolphins though."
11:31,020;11:34,820;"Oh, yeah, they had his number like nothing else."
11:34,820;11:35,460;"Sure."
11:35,460;11:37,720;"All right."
11:37,720;11:42,380;"You want to hear true home field advantage statistics?"
11:42,380;11:43,900;"Okay."
11:43,900;11:46,500;"For all 32 NFL teams."
11:46,500;11:47,100;"I do."
11:47,100;11:49,780;"The best."
11:49,780;11:52,660;"The Baltimore Ravens."
11:52,660;11:59,260;"really. What? I think this goes back to Cleveland though, because they're looking at it."
11:59,260;12:04,180;"I was just going to ask if that population of like 400 games. So that's got to be before"
12:04,180;12:10,860;"they moved to Baltimore. I think so. The bills are second. That makes sense. Got to love it."
12:10,860;12:19,060;"Vikings, Niners, dolphins are like middle of the pack. Where are the Broncos? No one's"
12:19,060;12:26,060;"like, seven maybe. Seahawks are universal guardians, the 12th man and all that shit."
12:26,060;12:33,060;"Right. They're like 10th. And what are these numbers based on? Oh, I don't look at those"
12:33,060;12:38,420;"things. I just see as I see a table in the article and I just go right there. The words"
12:38,420;12:47,780;"fuck them. So I say it was probably like, like, win percentage. We surveyed. It looks"
12:47,780;12:50,220;"like it's using home in a way scoring margins."
12:50,220;12:54,300;"Okay, I mean, I don't know."
12:54,300;12:56,060;"Where is July?"
12:56,060;13:00,540;"It's not stadium specific, Steve."
13:00,540;13:01,620;"I think that's where you're getting hung up."
13:01,620;13:03,700;"Like Seattle right now is because they're stadium."
13:03,700;13:08,180;"But if you're looking at 400 games, then right, you're talking about like the whole"
13:08,180;13:10,100;"lifetime of the franchise."
13:10,100;13:12,500;"They were pretty terrible early on."
13:12,500;13:16,740;"I don't see the Patriots are about what we're trying to tackle here."
13:16,740;13:20,740;"right how many games is this podcast supposed to be if we will all look to the end of"
13:20,740;13:32,100;"Oh, that's a great question. It is 361 games. Yeah. Right. So we're at least them. I don't know."
13:32,100;13:36,820;"We're probably one of the older half of the stadiums now in the league. Would you say that?"
13:36,820;13:42,580;"I would say. Yeah, because it was built in one 2001. Yeah. So 20 years ago, that's pretty old for a stadium."
13:46,260;13:52,260;"Yeah, speaking of stadiums though, I still have a problem."
13:52,260;13:57,460;"And it wasn't even here in this game, but I have a problem with the teams that share"
13:57,460;13:59,140;"stadiums with baseball team."
13:59,140;14:00,820;"You don't like that?"
14:00,820;14:01,860;"What is it?"
14:01,860;14:03,140;"Is that for like poor people?"
14:03,140;14:04,820;"Like are we sharing?"
14:04,820;14:07,620;"So they couldn't afford their own stadium?"
14:07,620;14:09,540;"Like this is the NFL we're talking about here."
14:09,540;14:10,420;"Four people."
14:10,420;14:11,140;"Yes, Indians."
14:11,140;14:13,620;"Well, yeah, the cities are paying for it."
14:13,620;14:15,220;"Well, that's true."
14:15,940;14:17,940;"Miami's got a shit ton of money though."
14:17,940;14:18,820;"I know."
14:18,820;14:22,980;"You know what I always like built the Marlins like their third stadium in 10 years."
14:22,980;14:23,380;"Yeah."
14:23,380;14:25,060;"And no one goes to those games."
14:25,060;14:25,860;"Exactly."
14:25,860;14:28,660;"I used to always like watch those games and just."
14:28,660;14:34,500;"You know how like when you watch that old screensaver and hope it hits the corner."
14:34,500;14:34,500;"Yeah."
14:34,500;14:35,140;"Yeah."
14:35,140;14:39,940;"I used to always hope that I'd see someone like running on football field at quarterback and then"
14:39,940;14:44,820;"slide and like have it time up so they were sliding into like a second base."
14:44,820;14:49,160;"I was like just once in my life. I want to see that time up correctly"
14:49,160;14:51,920;"That would have been a great celebration though"
14:51,920;14:56,540;"Like if you scored touchdown because the whole play had to be like towards a corner of the end zone, right? No"
14:56,540;15:01,700;"And it's not the field that feel I don't know I mean"
15:01,700;15:06,180;"Be in the outfield with like a portion of like the second base"
15:06,180;15:09,140;"Part of the dirt coming in like near the 50 yard line"
15:09,140;15:13,940;"It wasn't it was like 30 yard line, but still I think I don't know"
15:13,940;15:14,780;"- No."
15:14,780;15:17,220;"And how do they not just put sod on that?"
15:17,220;15:20,540;"Like, I'm sure it's a real reason,"
15:20,540;15:24,460;"but they can turn that MBA stadium into an NHL stadium"
15:24,460;15:26,260;"in like two hours."
15:26,260;15:27,900;"- Well, I'm out. - Mimi grass."
15:27,900;15:29,660;"Grass is alive for one."
15:29,660;15:30,740;"- Yeah."
15:30,740;15:31,580;"- Yeah."
15:31,580;15:32,420;"- And put it, just laying it down."
15:32,420;15:34,300;"It's just gonna slide all over the place."
15:34,300;15:36,820;"- Oh, you wanna talk about growing grass to you?"
15:36,820;15:38,780;"Was it in your episode?"
15:38,780;15:39,780;"Let's go."
15:39,780;15:40,620;"- Here we go."
15:42,140;15:47,140;"- Well, you see what the new Raider Stadium is doing?"
15:47,140;15:47,980;"- No."
15:47,980;15:51,460;"- They have like that fake turf stuff"
15:51,460;15:53,660;"for the University of Nevada who are playing on it."
15:53,660;15:57,860;"And then on top of it is sitting like a huge slab"
15:57,860;16:01,020;"of real grass that they can put on rollers"
16:01,020;16:03,460;"and roll outside the stadium."
16:03,460;16:04,900;"- Oh, like they have an Arizona."
16:04,900;16:05,740;"- Yeah."
16:05,740;16:06,580;"- Yeah."
16:06,580;16:07,420;"- Aren't those through that, right?"
16:07,420;16:08,260;"- Yeah."
16:08,260;16:10,420;"- For no fucking reason, they're like, dude,"
16:10,420;16:12,260;"Why not just not have a roof problem?"
16:12,260;16:15,580;"Well, then you get everyone inside your top and sweaty during the game."
16:15,580;16:17,700;"It's Arizona."
16:17,700;16:18,460;"It's not sweaty."
16:18,460;16:19,860;"It's it's a dry heat."
16:19,860;16:22,380;"That's everybody."
16:22,380;16:25,580;"I said, you're going to Arizona, huh?"
16:25,580;16:27,300;"Heard it's hot there."
16:27,300;16:29,500;"Dry."
16:29,500;16:30,620;"Oh, it's a dry heat."
16:30,620;16:31,700;"Don't be all right."
16:31,700;16:34,700;"Like one damn machine with dry heat."
16:34,700;16:38,500;"Yeah, that's like that's work talk that I cannot stand."
16:38,500;16:39,140;"Yeah."
16:39,780;16:43,600;"I don't really know. I think about your personality, but here's the fact I know about the heat"
16:43,600;16:44,040;"in"
16:44,040;16:45,060;"in Arizona."
16:45,060;16:50,040;"Oh, did you see Ryan Fitzpatrick on the football field? He went to Harvard."
16:50,040;16:50,860;"Yeah."
16:50,860;16:54,100;"It's totally okay to think he played basketball."
16:54,100;16:58,860;"So apparently the there's something about that too, about the"
16:58,860;17:03,780;"the heat and Nevada. They're talking, they have like this like"
17:03,780;17:09,500;"glass-like material, I guess, that lets in sunshine, but keeps out"
17:09,500;17:12,500;"heat somehow. It's called glass."
17:12,500;17:14,500;"[laughter]"
17:14,500;17:16,500;"You know, but the double-pane windows work."
17:16,500;17:19,500;"Andy, the heat transition."
17:19,500;17:22,500;"Don't talk to me about heat transition coefficients, all right?"
17:22,500;17:26,500;"I study chemical engineering in college."
17:26,500;17:30,500;"How much do you use that in the daily basis?"
17:30,500;17:32,500;"Absolutely not at all."
17:32,500;17:34,500;"It's as much as I use my communication."
17:34,500;17:37,500;"I can barely spit those words out, yeah."
17:37,500;17:39,600;"(laughing)"
17:39,600;17:42,940;"But it's not glass, it's some like weird material."
17:42,940;17:44,340;"It's got cool though."
17:44,340;17:45,340;"- Cool."
17:45,340;17:46,260;"- Cool."
17:46,260;17:48,340;"- Speaking of heat though,"
17:48,340;17:51,900;"this game was playing 86 degree heat with,"
17:51,900;17:54,660;"it was something like 80 something percent humidity."
17:54,660;17:58,340;"So it felt like, I think like the feel like temperature"
17:58,340;17:59,700;"on the field was like 95."
17:59,700;18:05,380;"And the commentators had this story"
18:05,380;18:10,380;"about Belichick putting garbage bags over the AC vents"
18:10,380;18:16,500;"in the locker room because apparently Miami would crank"
18:16,500;18:20,300;"the AC in the opposing team's locker room."
18:20,300;18:23,820;"So that it felt the quote was as cold as a meat locker"
18:23,820;18:27,780;"in there, which would kind of slow the guys,"
18:27,780;18:30,300;"the opposing team in the second half"
18:30,300;18:31,660;"because they didn't want to come back out"
18:31,660;18:33,260;"into the heat from the cold."
18:35,300;18:36,900;"So yeah, it is."
18:36,900;18:38,580;"It's a city block."
18:38,580;18:40,780;"You're going to have like that's a that's totally fair"
18:40,780;18:43,860;"advantage and the Patriots should cut off the heat in the"
18:43,860;18:47,260;"visiting room locker room in Jules Stadium in December."
18:47,260;18:52,300;"Can you imagine the pushback that would have to be amazing?"
18:52,300;18:55,900;"Yeah, I also think that the home team should be able to control"
18:55,900;18:57,700;"the PSI and footballs too."
18:57,700;18:59,140;"You know, where's it stops, Steve?"
18:59,140;19:00,300;"Where does it stop?"
19:00,300;19:03,500;"Go fuck yourself."
19:03,500;19:06,360;"But what do you think is worse?"
19:06,360;19:08,540;"Like, Conbra is a record when it's super duper hot out,"
19:08,540;19:11,420;"and then it's like record when it's super duper cold out, too."
19:11,420;19:11,920;"Right?"
19:11,920;19:13,580;"Because it's always been like just as much as they've"
19:13,580;19:15,540;"struggled in the heat in Miami."
19:15,540;19:16,740;"And people make a big deal that."
19:16,740;19:19,740;"It makes us equally a big deal as how awesome he is when"
19:19,740;19:21,940;"it's like really fucking cold out."
19:21,940;19:24,860;"You can find those numbers on pages down and see that info."
19:24,860;19:25,540;"Really?"
19:25,540;19:26,900;"Slash search slash Brady."
19:26,900;19:27,940;"Yeah."
19:27,940;19:30,500;"You got temperature here?"
19:30,500;19:31,460;"Yeah."
19:31,460;19:33,380;"You can filter game by temp."
19:33,380;19:33,900;"Oh, yeah."
19:33,900;19:35,940;"Oh, so it's the game search that has it right now."
19:35,940;19:38,540;"But yes, it will be added to the Brady search as well."
19:38,540;19:40,940;"So search slash games."
19:40,940;19:42,260;"There's a temperature slider."
19:42,260;19:43,220;"And you can figure out there--"
19:43,220;19:44,420;"It's a fucking nerd, Andy."
19:44,420;19:45,260;"--for percentage."
19:45,260;19:48,220;"You can also do it by surface type, the Vegas line,"
19:48,220;19:50,500;"and the overunder if you want as well."
19:50,500;19:53,580;"For the month or whether it was an overtime game"
19:53,580;19:56,700;"or a game played after a buy."
19:56,700;19:59,620;"You said it just fucking throw this together."
19:59,620;20:01,420;"That's it."
20:01,420;20:03,420;"No, actually, that's only maybe half of them."
20:03,420;20:04,220;"You should."
20:04,220;20:08,660;"You should like put if they beat the Vegas over under or not."
20:08,660;20:11,460;"And like the spread."
20:11,460;20:14,860;"Oh, love to like look at games that they didn't be spread because they're like"
20:14,860;20:16,420;"crushes spread historically, right?"
20:16,420;20:17,820;"Well, in theory, you could do that."
20:17,820;20:22,100;"You could put games that they weren't favored and then whether or not they"
20:22,100;20:25,300;"won or lost because you can search for you can filter by game results."
20:25,300;20:27,820;"Well, they're always favored."
20:28,460;20:31,760;"I think they're decent against the spread, but not like crazy."
20:31,760;20:34,220;"Cause they're always favorites."
20:34,220;20:35,420;"Yeah."
20:35,420;20:37,140;"They are favorites a lot of the time."
20:37,140;20:37,820;"Yeah."
20:37,820;20:43,900;"Let's say if you're going to be betting NFL, you have to go dogs."
20:43,900;20:47,300;"You tell them."
20:47,300;20:51,780;"We'll they are 38 and 31 as underdogs."
20:51,780;20:55,780;"Patriots are 60% against the spread."
20:55,780;20:57,700;"It's pretty good."
20:57,700;21:04,940;"over what time period Tom Brady starts this article written in March 2019 that's"
21:04,940;21:13,540;"pretty good yeah that is supposed to be 50 50 right theoretically right yeah"
21:13,540;21:20,900;"all right speaking the dolphins I mean we've avoided this game prayer 20 minutes"
21:20,900;21:27,260;"now. Yeah, I will say there was one thing that stood out to me in this game."
21:27,260;21:35,380;"All right. Robert Edward signing. Yes. He was back. He was back. Like, as I"
21:35,380;21:39,100;"understood it, Robert Edward suffered that knee injury, which they talked about"
21:39,100;21:43,420;"on this, whereas he tore three ligaments and nearly severed an artery and almost"
21:43,420;21:47,940;"had to have his leg amputated playing a five football in the beach in the"
21:47,940;21:50,380;"Pro Bowl after his rookie year. Yeah."
21:50,380;21:54,900;"We're like 1200 yards rushing had like 12 TDs."
21:54,900;21:58,460;"And then he never had yet. I have the."
21:58,460;22:00,980;"I remember I remember coming back."
22:00,980;22:03,180;"Not last month. I never remember."
22:03,180;22:04,700;"I didn't remember him coming back."
22:04,700;22:09,540;"But he didn't last long, but I think he played a couple years with dolphins here."
22:09,540;22:11,540;"You look like in this game."
22:11,540;22:14,980;"Yeah, it was a kind of the third down back, which I feel like is almost how the"
22:14,980;22:19,120;"Patriots use him in 99 to almost like the J. R. Redmond sort of thing."
22:19,120;22:20,180;"It wasn't like a bruiser."
22:20,180;22:23,220;"But he ran for a thousand years."
22:23,220;22:23,820;"So maybe it was."
22:23,820;22:24,260;"I don't remember."
22:24,260;22:24,420;"Yeah."
22:24,420;22:25,620;"No, no, he was there number one back."
22:25,620;22:28,500;"He was there a version of twan and Corey Dylan and all that."
22:28,500;22:29,260;"Yeah."
22:29,260;22:31,020;"Well, maybe not Corey Dylan."
22:31,020;22:31,740;"Let's pump the brakes."
22:31,740;22:34,540;"I just remember being so hype because he was so good as a rookie."
22:34,540;22:36,980;"And I was like, we finally found like our guy."
22:36,980;22:39,140;"You know, I felt that about my dad."
22:39,140;22:40,100;"Ricardo Martin to."
22:40,100;22:41,140;"Yeah, that too."
22:41,140;22:42,700;"Andy Katz and more."
22:43,860;22:47,380;"Dude, I have a Robert Edwards jersey."
22:47,380;22:48,380;"You do?"
22:48,380;22:49,380;"Uh huh."
22:49,380;22:50,620;"Oh, I love that jersey."
22:50,620;22:51,460;"Yeah, good job."
22:51,460;22:54,220;"He gave it to me."
22:54,220;22:55,380;"It's crazy."
22:55,380;22:56,740;"Yeah, it does."
22:56,740;22:58,460;"They had--"
22:58,460;23:00,060;"At the back side of the game, they were just"
23:00,060;23:03,620;"like trying to fill time because it was to blow out."
23:03,620;23:04,120;"Yeah."
23:04,120;23:05,340;"I don't know why I watch this whole game."
23:05,340;23:06,700;"I was stupid, but--"
23:06,700;23:08,180;"[INAUDIBLE]"
23:08,180;23:09,740;"They had a thing about--"
23:09,740;23:12,020;"because they're going deep on Robert Edwards."
23:12,020;23:17,020;"And like how he had no ill will, but against the Patriots,"
23:17,020;23:20,900;"Robert Kraft, they called him up personally"
23:20,900;23:22,540;"and like talked to him about it and said,"
23:22,540;23:24,580;"you know, this is not something like,"
23:24,580;23:25,780;"there's no hard feelings,"
23:25,780;23:27,140;"but it's just like a business thing."
23:27,140;23:29,300;"And he told me all that."
23:29,300;23:34,020;"I think our cake, it gets a lot of credit like nowadays,"
23:34,020;23:35,420;"like all that, but it's cool."
23:35,420;23:36,980;"Like this has happened a couple of times."
23:36,980;23:38,980;"When you look back at it, you see like,"
23:38,980;23:41,540;"it's not really, it's something they've always been"
23:41,540;23:44,460;"like a personality trader of value, right?"
23:44,460;23:47,900;"Probably a lot of owners calling him up like that."
23:47,900;23:48,740;"- That's true, yeah."
23:48,740;23:50,780;"I mean, you don't really hear"
23:50,780;23:54,740;"ex-patriots come out with negative stories"
23:54,740;23:57,140;"about their time on the Patriots."
23:57,140;23:58,820;"Even people like, you know, Michael Bennett,"
23:58,820;23:59,860;"who wasn't here for very long"
23:59,860;24:02,420;"and wasn't particularly well utilized."
24:02,420;24:05,140;"And people thought, you know, he was gonna be a distraction"
24:05,140;24:06,100;"and he got traded and everything."
24:06,100;24:09,620;"And he had absolutely no bad words to say about it."
24:09,620;24:16,660;"some, but it's more about like how I was used or what I was asked to do or like that sort of thing."
24:16,660;24:19,940;"Yeah, yeah, there hasn't been any like, the analyst."
24:19,940;24:21,980;"And locker room wasn't."
24:21,980;24:24,340;"Yeah, Dion Lewis is probably the closest you can get."
24:24,340;24:27,620;"Dude, Gronk retired just to get away from the Patriots."
24:27,620;24:29,780;"Did he though? Or do you retire to get away from football?"
24:29,780;24:36,340;"I don't know. It seems awfully coincidental that soon as Brady left, he's suddenly unretired."
24:36,340;24:40,540;"Maybe. I said that wasn't the reason, but yeah,"
24:40,540;24:42,860;"they're also allowing weed this year too."
24:42,860;24:44,380;"That red you way."
24:44,380;24:46,020;"Think it's weed."
24:46,020;24:50,660;"Oh, you always do it is pumping fucking CBD companies now."
24:50,660;24:52,540;"So that's not weed, Andy."
24:52,540;24:55,740;"I understand that, but it'll still pop you for a test."
24:55,740;24:56,100;"I won't."
24:56,100;24:58,100;"Have you ever even smoked doobies?"
24:58,100;25:00,300;"Yes, you made me do it."
25:00,300;25:02,460;"What?"
25:02,460;25:03,340;"Yeah."
25:03,340;25:05,420;"Oh, this is a great story time."
25:05,420;25:06,500;"I've not heard the story."
25:06,500;25:07,820;"- No."
25:07,820;25:11,140;"Father's Day, what was it like five, six years ago?"
25:11,140;25:12,460;"- Yeah."
25:12,460;25:17,460;"- When we were all drinking in Portland, Maine,"
25:17,460;25:20,780;"and then like halfway through the drinking session,"
25:20,780;25:25,540;"Kelly was like, ""Oh yeah, I have these hash brownies."""
25:25,540;25:26,820;"- There were cookies."
25:26,820;25:29,060;"- And yeah, and we're like, ""Oh, we'll give something"
25:29,060;25:31,060;"to my dad 'cause he's like a deadhead."""
25:31,060;25:32,540;"So it's like, ""Yeah, we'll give something to him"
25:32,540;25:33,700;"as a present."""
25:33,700;25:36,340;"not expecting him to like just eat it right then and there."
25:36,340;25:39,020;"But we're like here, happy father's day."
25:39,020;25:41,420;"He just like pops when in his mouth and I was like, oh God."
25:41,420;25:44,260;"I guess I guess we're all jumping on this train."
25:44,260;25:45,460;"Yep."
25:45,460;25:49,780;"And then Andy took one who and Andy claimed that he doesn't"
25:49,780;25:52,700;"a weed doesn't affect him."
25:52,700;25:54,820;"Which spoiler alert turned out not to be true."
25:54,820;26:03,300;"And then like me and the dad and Kelly, my wife, we're all"
26:03,300;26:06,060;"super stoned walking around Portland."
26:06,060;26:09,900;"And then my mom showed up and at first we didn't tell her."
26:09,900;26:11,860;"(laughing)"
26:11,860;26:13,000;"Which I don't know why we didn't,"
26:13,000;26:14,220;"probably because they were like,"
26:14,220;26:16,020;"""Hi, a paranoid."""
26:16,020;26:19,820;"But we were acting so strange that eventually she's like,"
26:19,820;26:21,220;"""What is going on with you guys?"""
26:21,220;26:24,060;"And I was like, ""Kelli drugged us."""
26:24,060;26:26,320;"(laughing)"
26:26,320;26:29,620;"But she was like, ""I'm gonna thank God."""
26:29,620;26:32,020;"(laughing)"
26:32,020;26:33,420;"It was unbelievable."
26:33,420;26:36,340;"You think that's the end of the story?"
26:36,340;26:38,980;"Well, I don't know how much you want to divulge, Andy."
26:38,980;26:39,820;"Oh, no, let's look."
26:39,820;26:41,180;"I mean, we're here now, right?"
26:41,180;26:41,660;"May as well."
26:41,660;26:42,180;"OK."
26:42,180;26:42,700;"All right."
26:42,700;26:44,820;"Well, let's just finish the story then."
26:44,820;26:46,180;"So we're all--"
26:46,180;26:47,180;"Yeah, tell it."
26:47,180;26:50,180;"The way I remember this was I remember that part,"
26:50,180;26:52,860;"but I remember that we didn't actually eat lunch"
26:52,860;26:56,220;"because there was no food in the condo because dad was there"
26:56,220;26:58,340;"and he doesn't fucking do that sort of thing."
26:58,340;27:01,300;"So the cookies were lunch."
27:01,300;27:06,300;"And so I think I probably had more than one, which was a bad decision."
27:06,300;27:07,300;"Looking back on it now."
27:07,300;27:10,580;"And, you know, I felt fine all the way through."
27:10,580;27:13,500;"And then we were sitting at the bar underneath the condo."
27:13,500;27:18,620;"It's the top floor of a hotel and so the hotel bar there and we're,"
27:18,620;27:22,620;"I was eating a burger and I just like, I felt all the,"
27:22,620;27:24,940;"the color drain from my face."
27:24,940;27:26,460;"Like that's probably not good."
27:26,460;27:29,740;"So I have mom walking me back to."
27:30,300;27:32,060;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, sorry to interrupt,"
27:32,060;27:36,660;"but I remember this so distinctly,"
27:36,660;27:39,780;"you like nudged my arm and you looked at me and you go,"
27:39,780;27:40,780;"I'm faded."
27:40,780;27:43,260;"(laughing)"
27:43,260;27:44,980;"It's like someone's gotta get in the out of here."
27:44,980;27:47,100;"Yep, that feels alright."
27:47,100;27:49,940;"'Cause all I remember is that it was a burger"
27:49,940;27:52,940;"with one of those pretzel buns."
27:52,940;27:54,860;"I'm like, this is gonna be so good."
27:54,860;27:58,300;"And I was so like torn about whether or not I should leave it."
27:59,540;28:02,820;"But I realized I had to because I was fading fast."
28:02,820;28:06,180;"So the walk was like maybe a hundred yards, not even,"
28:06,180;28:07,780;"maybe 50 yards."
28:07,780;28:09,220;"And so we get in the elevator."
28:09,220;28:10,780;"And the next thing, just me and mom,"
28:10,780;28:11,620;"we get in the elevator,"
28:11,620;28:13,700;"just taking me back to the condo."
28:13,700;28:16,700;"And the next thing I remember is waking up,"
28:16,700;28:19,820;"sitting down on the floor of the elevator"
28:19,820;28:22,700;"with mom very worriedly looking at me,"
28:22,700;28:23,900;"asking me if I'm okay."
28:23,900;28:25,380;"I'm like, yeah, I'm fine, why?"
28:25,380;28:26,940;"It's like because you passed out"
28:26,940;28:30,300;"and hit your head on the side of the elevator and sat down."
28:30,300;28:33,340;"I feel okay."
28:33,340;28:35,820;"And then I went to the, we got back to the condo"
28:35,820;28:37,860;"without any more issues."
28:37,860;28:40,540;"And I immediately threw up and felt perfectly fine."
28:40,540;28:42,380;"- Dad threw up too."
28:42,380;28:43,220;"- Yeah."
28:43,220;28:46,380;"I think Dad also had more than one cookie."
28:46,380;28:48,420;"I think it was also lunch for him as well."
28:48,420;28:50,220;"- And to put this in perspective,"
28:50,220;28:54,860;"our mom is like five, five, like 120 pounds."
28:54,860;28:56,100;"- Yeah, she's tiny."
28:56,100;29:03,100;"Yeah. And meanwhile, Andy's like six, two, and she doesn't know that he's eating a"
29:03,100;29:09,300;"wheat cookie, right? So that she has no idea what's wrong with him. She was so scared."
29:09,300;29:11,300;"I blame Kelly. I'm like, Kelly, give me drugs."
29:11,300;29:16,260;"Yeah. And then like so dad had a similar experience where he had to go up to the room"
29:16,260;29:18,380;"early and he puked and went to bed early."
29:18,380;29:22,020;"And Kelly was all sketched out because this was like early in our relationship."
29:22,860;29:26,180;"She's like, oh my God, your parents are gonna hate me, this and that."
29:26,180;29:27,820;"And then we woke up the next day."
29:27,820;29:33,020;"And that was like, that was the best father's day ever."
29:33,020;29:35,500;"You puked."
29:35,500;29:40,020;"Good Lord."
29:40,020;29:42,660;"That's how the idea for this podcast was born."
29:42,660;29:51,780;"So speaking of devastating injuries, I found an article"
29:52,180;29:57,620;"talking about Robert Edwards and what actually happened to his knee. And this is the quote."
29:57,620;30:03,220;"""In a single moment without warning, Edwards has dislocated his knee while diving to knock down a"
30:03,220;30:07,860;"pass that afternoon. Dislocation, however, doesn't come close to explain the carnage that occurred."
30:07,860;30:14,180;"Edwards' anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate, and medial collateral ligaments were all completely"
30:14,180;30:19,620;"torn. But fourth ligament was nearly shredded. In addition, he suffered severe nerve damage"
30:19,620;30:22,260;"and a severed artery that had to be repaired immediately."
30:22,260;30:26,100;"One doctor said it looked as though Edward's knee had been hit by a hand grenade."
30:26,100;30:30,940;"That's what I don't understand is like, it's sand."
30:30,940;30:35,540;"You think like to get a crazy tear like that, it would have to be like a hard impact."
30:35,540;30:37,260;"Shouldn't sand be less of an impact?"
30:37,260;30:38,220;"That's yeah."
30:38,220;30:42,780;"But I mean, the worst ones always seem to be non-contact injuries."
30:42,780;30:43,820;"Like remember, Wes Walker?"
30:43,820;30:45,940;"Yeah, maybe it's like an angle thing."
30:45,940;30:48,380;"Like if you come at a weird angle on the sand."
30:49,060;30:53,500;"But I think it's like, it's stuck and the rest of your weight goes the other way."
30:53,500;30:54,820;"And I can see that maybe in sand."
30:54,820;30:57,700;"Because, um, Edelman had the same thing."
30:57,700;31:00,060;"Remember in the pre-season against the lions."
31:00,060;31:01,980;"Yeah, you just caught the ball."
31:01,980;31:03,740;"His leg landed wrong and just popped."
31:03,740;31:05,540;"So disappointing."
31:05,540;31:07,100;"Yeah."
31:07,100;31:15,380;"Kids who do heavies always as a, as a person with knee problems."
31:15,380;31:17,220;"Yep. Same here."
31:17,220;31:25,320;"Well, can I can I transition from the weed story to my weed stories?"
31:25,320;31:26,820;"I wish you would."
31:26,820;31:27,820;"All right."
31:27,820;31:28,820;"Ricky Williams."
31:28,820;31:33,820;"This is the player that we're deep diving into."
31:33,820;31:35,820;"That feels appropriate."
31:35,820;31:38,740;"The recently traded for, right?"
31:38,740;31:39,740;"They traded for?"
31:39,740;31:40,740;"They did."
31:40,740;31:41,900;"From the New Orleans Saints."
31:41,900;31:44,980;"So this is his first season in Miami."
31:44,980;31:46,740;"So fourth game."
31:46,740;31:53,220;"So I think, well, there's one really interesting thing that I did deep dive on like his initial"
31:53,220;31:56,740;"contract that he signed his rookie year."
31:56,740;31:58,700;"Okay."
31:58,700;32:03,140;"So maybe I'll go over that first and then we can kind of talk about general things about"
32:03,140;32:05,380;"him after."
32:05,380;32:10,380;"So 1999, he was a fifth overall pick by the Saints."
32:10,380;32:12,300;"He just won the Heisman at Texas."
32:12,300;32:19,460;"He's putting up crazy numbers there, record setting, yardage, touchdowns, all that crap."
32:19,460;32:25,700;"So when he got drafted, he's always been a bit out there, dude, anyways, but the whole"
32:25,700;32:32,180;"rap and sports scene was kind of merging, right?"
32:32,180;32:37,180;"So you had a lot of those guys hanging out with each other."
32:37,180;32:41,420;"And they always say, ""Every rapper wants to be an athlete and every athlete wants to"
32:41,420;32:44,940;"be a rapper. So this is kind of like the crossing of those"
32:44,940;32:53,380;"cultures. So there was a new sports agency in town in New"
32:53,380;32:59,140;"Orleans called No Limit Sports. And this is the brainchild of"
32:59,140;33:03,900;"Master P, the entrepreneur. So he had a record label that he"
33:03,900;33:09,340;"like was turning into a sports agency. Basically like the"
33:09,340;33:12,940;"original idea of Jay Z's like rock nation sports, right?"
33:12,940;33:13,540;"Yeah."
33:13,540;33:13,940;"Okay."
33:13,940;33:17,140;"So up to this point, it was kind of just like NBA stars."
33:17,140;33:19,980;"So Ron Mercer, Jason Terry."
33:19,980;33:22,380;"Remember Ricky Davis from the Celtics?"
33:22,380;33:23,020;"Yeah."
33:23,020;33:27,700;"The guy that infamously shot at his own hoop to get one more"
33:27,700;33:28,980;"rebound for a triple double."
33:28,980;33:31,380;"He's a legend."
33:31,380;33:33,820;"He's very much kind of like Ricky Williams."
33:33,820;33:35,260;"Did he actually get it?"
33:35,260;33:36,140;"Yes."
33:36,140;33:36,580;"The triple."
33:36,580;33:36,820;"Yeah."
33:36,820;33:40,060;"I don't know if they gave him the stat though."
33:40,060;33:41,340;"That's what I was wondering."
33:41,340;33:42,180;"Yeah."
33:42,180;33:44,140;"'Cause he did fucking worth it."
33:44,140;33:47,380;"Yeah, it's just so like blatantly fucking, you know?"
33:47,380;33:49,800;"(laughing)"
33:49,800;33:53,060;"So this is like a new agency, right?"
33:53,060;33:55,620;"They don't really have much experience on the staff,"
33:55,620;34:00,620;"but it's, yeah, they're basically trying to like,"
34:00,620;34:04,820;"stop getting screwed over by these crusty old white guys"
34:04,820;34:06,660;"that kind of control the sport, right?"
34:06,660;34:11,060;"So it's like a good idea in theory, which I think JZ is kind of like figuring out himself."
34:11,060;34:20,100;"So in his rookie contract, what they ended up doing was this is actually Ricky"
34:20,100;34:25,900;"wanted it this way, where there's he wanted like as much money as he could get up front"
34:25,900;34:30,100;"and then basically everything beyond that was incentive based."
34:31,020;34:35,340;"So he signs a $8.8 million signing bonus"
34:35,340;34:38,940;"and then the league minimum salary based salary"
34:38,940;34:40,380;"for five years."
34:40,380;34:46,940;"And then the incentives are worth up to $68 million"
34:46,940;34:49,380;"over the life of the contract."
34:49,380;34:50,220;"Damn."
34:50,220;34:51,060;"All right."
34:51,060;34:54,540;"However, here we come."
34:54,540;34:57,220;"These incentives were just fucking ridiculous."
34:57,220;34:59,620;"Some say it's like the worst contract ever."
34:59,620;35:07,720;"I'll just give you some, there was three types of bonuses he could get."
35:07,720;35:11,580;"So the first one was like rushing yards bonus."
35:11,580;35:17,220;"And it would give him like one to three million dollars based on like tiered yardage."
35:17,220;35:24,180;"So per season, but it started at 1600 yards."
35:24,180;35:28,700;"And then the three million was for like, if he sets the rushing record."
35:28,700;35:33,700;"So basically it's like he has to set the rushing record every year of his contract to get that full 68, right?"
35:33,700;35:34,700;"Yeah."
35:34,700;35:38,700;"So he only hits that once in his career."
35:38,700;35:39,700;"Yeah."
35:39,700;35:40,700;"This year, 2002."
35:40,700;35:41,700;"Yeah."
35:41,700;35:42,700;"1853 yards."
35:42,700;35:43,700;"Yep."
35:43,700;35:51,700;"And then there was like the next bonus category was like all these like there was like 40 different."
35:51,700;35:56,860;"Uh, just weird things, you know, like, uh, you got to be a, this percentage of snaps."
35:56,860;35:57,940;"Oh, blah."
35:57,940;35:59,900;"But then some of them started getting ridiculous."
35:59,900;36:01,620;"Like NFL MVP."
36:01,620;36:02,740;"Oh, I'm sorry."
36:02,740;36:04,020;"Bowl MVP."
36:04,020;36:10,620;"One of them was 12 plus receiving touchdowns, which, which I guess no running"
36:10,620;36:11,660;"back has ever done."
36:11,660;36:17,640;"I think the list of, uh, wide receivers that have done it in a season is probably"
36:17,640;36:18,940;"not that long either."
36:18,940;36:19,660;"Yeah."
36:19,660;36:20,100;"Yeah."
36:20,100;36:20,820;"Exactly."
36:21,060;36:23,700;"Yeah, that's a great wide receiver year this year."
36:23,700;36:24,540;"Yeah."
36:24,540;36:29,940;"So then the other one I think is the most interesting"
36:29,940;36:34,660;"was over after the fourth season,"
36:34,660;36:39,660;"if he had like 6413 yards rushing, 7574 total,"
36:39,660;36:43,740;"4.8 yards of carry,"
36:43,740;36:44,580;"through into six, six points,"
36:44,580;36:47,980;"they're all like these kind of like obscure numbers."
36:47,980;36:49,780;"And then people looked into it"
36:49,780;36:53,340;"And basically it was the Terrell Davis bonus."
36:53,340;36:57,620;"So those were the exact numbers that Terrell Davis had put in."
36:57,620;37:00,660;"All right, he had put up for his first four seasons."
37:00,660;37:05,500;"So the bonus was basically if you hit three of these four,"
37:05,500;37:07,660;"you get that full bonus."
37:07,660;37:09,740;"(laughs)"
37:09,740;37:12,340;"Jesus."
37:12,340;37:14,580;"- But how long was he on that contract, right?"
37:14,580;37:18,860;"'Cause he was on the States for that long."
37:18,860;37:20,500;"I think he did three years at the Saints."
37:20,500;37:23,740;"I think it was a five year contract, if I'm not mistaken."
37:23,740;37:25,620;"He did three years with the Saints."
37:25,620;37:27,420;"One, two, three, four."
37:27,420;37:28,860;"He did seven years Miami,"
37:28,860;37:31,900;"and then one with Baltimore to finish it up."
37:31,900;37:33,300;"- I feel like the seven years Miami"
37:33,300;37:35,260;"were probably one or two of those,"
37:35,260;37:37,580;"at least he was out smoking weed into that."
37:37,580;37:41,060;"- So he won here."
37:41,060;37:41,900;"- So he won here how many?"
37:41,900;37:44,300;"- Well, seven, he played, but he skipped 2004,"
37:44,300;37:47,220;"Miss season retired in 2006,"
37:47,220;37:50,300;"Miss season violation of league substance abuse policy."
37:50,300;37:53,060;"So yes, you're right."
37:53,060;37:55,100;"You were tired to go smoke weed."
37:55,100;37:56,180;"Miss a couple of seasons."
37:56,180;37:57,580;"- No, I, all right."
37:57,580;37:59,340;"So let's get into this then."
37:59,340;38:03,140;"I love Ricky Williams."
38:03,140;38:04,580;"I'm just gonna say it right now."
38:04,580;38:05,420;"- All right."
38:05,420;38:07,580;"(laughs)"
38:07,580;38:12,580;"- Dude, he's been completely unfairly maligned in the press."
38:13,260;38:15,860;"He didn't quit football to smoke weed."
38:15,860;38:18,860;"He quit football 'cause his body was deteriorating"
38:18,860;38:20,700;"and he didn't wanna play anymore."
38:20,700;38:21,940;"And then he smoked weed."
38:21,940;38:25,980;"- I would agree with you if you hadn't come back"
38:25,980;38:30,180;"for one, two, three, four, five years of playing"
38:30,180;38:31,940;"after he retired twice."
38:31,940;38:34,020;"- I thought it was more like a Dave Shrepel situation"
38:34,020;38:35,940;"where he was like, this is all a bunch of like"
38:35,940;38:39,480;"corporate ass bullshit, like I'm just gonna be out."
38:40,580;38:44,460;"Well, so I watched football life Ricky Williams."
38:44,460;38:48,820;"And it was basically like he was a workhorse in Miami."
38:48,820;38:51,580;"And then they had told them that they were gonna like"
38:51,580;38:53,420;"revamp the offense, get a good quarterback."
38:53,420;38:54,420;"And they just didn't do that."
38:54,420;38:56,980;"And he's like, all right, I'm already beat up."
38:56,980;39:00,140;"And now I'm clearly gonna get a ton of carries"
39:00,140;39:01,980;"and just get even more beat up."
39:01,980;39:05,140;"And he's always been a bit of like a eccentric guy."
39:05,140;39:08,220;"And he's like, all right, I'm not doing this."
39:08,220;39:09,420;"I'm leaving."
39:09,420;39:11,540;"I kind of respect that."
39:11,540;39:16,660;"You know, and even just watching this game, like he, he wasn't a shifty guy."
39:16,660;39:18,660;"He wasn't the priest's homes of the Danny Thompson."
39:18,660;39:19,660;"He was a bruiser."
39:19,660;39:20,420;"Yeah."
39:20,420;39:24,420;"And he even in this game, he took some shots that I don't think I would have gotten"
39:24,420;39:26,380;"up from and he took a bunch of them."
39:26,380;39:30,820;"So I completely understand and agree with that decision."
39:30,820;39:34,500;"I heard someone say that like"
39:35,700;39:39,140;"I think it was a Doug Stanhope stand up about it."
39:39,140;39:43,980;"And he's like, all he's really doing is what like normal people do."
39:43,980;39:46,660;"You always talk about if you win the lottery, what do you do?"
39:46,660;39:48,100;"You quit your job, right?"
39:48,100;39:52,140;"He's like, you got an $8.8 million signing bonus and he quit his job."
39:52,140;39:54,660;"You got to kind of respect them for it."
39:54,660;39:55,260;"Yeah."
39:55,260;39:56,740;"No, I'm a hundred percent behind that."
39:56,740;39:59,460;"I never, I never just like Ricky Lance on his buddies."
39:59,460;40:00,460;"No."
40:00,460;40:03,860;"And he's actually like pretty insightful guy too."
40:03,860;40:05,340;"So he's not like, yeah."
40:05,340;40:12,500;"He was a, he was an honor roll student all the way through school."
40:12,500;40:17,240;"Like all these coaches, like Mike, uh, Mike Dick, uh, Sabin,"
40:17,240;40:18,540;"Parse sells all those guys."
40:18,540;40:21,580;"Absolutely love them and like vouch for them and stuff like that."
40:21,580;40:24,260;"Cause he's like, he's a thoughtful dude."
40:24,260;40:28,540;"Or he's kind of like an Aryan foster where he's, he's not just a football player."
40:28,540;40:29,420;"It comes in place, football."
40:29,420;40:34,580;"And I think in this time era, like that was kind of frowned upon where now"
40:34,580;40:39,300;"He was starting to come more around to it being like all right thoughtful players. It's like kind of a good thing"
40:39,300;40:41,860;"just I think he kind of got like"
40:41,860;40:47,380;"Drag through the mud a little bit because everyone was like oh what a dope he gave up all his money"
40:47,380;40:49,220;"And he's quitting and putting smoking weed"
40:49,220;40:55,060;"But I think he was actually like a really thoughtful dude if you listen to him and like tried to understand his perspective"
40:55,060;40:57,620;"Yeah, I agree with that"
40:57,620;41:02,980;"I think um the one thing you missed was his draft day"
41:02,980;41:05,980;"Did you look at this at all?"
41:05,980;41:07,980;"No, I don't think I."
41:07,980;41:08,980;"It was Ben."
41:08,980;41:11,980;"So, and also his, you touched on it a bit."
41:11,980;41:16,980;"He did win the Heisman and his college stats."
41:16,980;41:18,980;"I'll just read him to you real quick."
41:18,980;41:21,980;"First year he ran for 990 yards eight touchdowns."
41:21,980;41:25,980;"Second year, 1200 yards and 12 touchdowns."
41:25,980;41:29,980;"Third year, 1800 yards, 25 touchdowns."
41:29,980;41:32,620;"fourth year, which I'm assuming is the one you won the"
41:32,620;41:37,820;"thysmin 2,124 yards and 27 touchdowns."
41:37,820;41:40,060;"My god, ridiculous."
41:40,060;41:43,420;"So that first one carries a priest's homes, right?"
41:43,420;41:47,900;"Maybe we touched on this in the KC episode."
41:47,900;41:51,900;"Because they're at Texas at the same time."
41:51,900;41:53,260;"Oh, that's right."
41:53,260;41:54,140;"They were weren't they?"
41:54,140;41:55,820;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
41:55,820;41:56,500;"So then maybe."
41:57,340;41:58,660;"God, that's a hell of a backfield."
41:58,660;41:59,500;"Yeah."
41:59,500;42:01,780;"Um, college football for you."
42:01,780;42:02,220;"Yeah."
42:02,220;42:07,900;"So in that last season, 98, he set the NCAA record for rushing yards in one"
42:07,900;42:08,300;"the Heisman."
42:08,300;42:09,940;"Is that still standing?"
42:09,940;42:14,540;"No, it got, it got broken in the year after by Ron Dain."
42:14,540;42:17,140;"Ron Dain of all people."
42:17,140;42:18,740;"That's a shame."
42:18,740;42:21,420;"Um, so."
42:21,420;42:26,780;"Uh, so he was like the highly touted running back coming out of the draft."
42:26,780;42:28,900;"like what's his name for the giants?"
42:28,900;42:32,300;"This is a sake, sake one bar."
42:32,300;42:33,420;"Yeah, yeah, exactly."
42:33,420;42:35,900;"So he was like the sake one of the draft."
42:35,900;42:41,540;"And Mike Dicker was the head coach of the Saints at the time."
42:41,540;42:42,860;"Oh, I know."
42:42,860;42:44,780;"Yeah, I did read about this."
42:44,780;42:45,020;"Yeah."
42:45,020;42:49,300;"And so they decided that they really wanted Ricky Williams."
42:49,300;42:51,420;"So they were going to trade up to get him."
42:51,420;42:55,020;"And so they traded with the Washington Redskins."
42:55,460;43:02,340;"and the Washington Redskins traded the fifth overall pick that the Saints would use to pick"
43:02,340;43:11,620;"rickulians. The Saints traded and give me a minute here. The 12th overall pick, which was later"
43:11,620;43:20,180;"traded Chicago where they selected K-Mingan. The 71st overall pick in this draft. The 107th overall"
43:20,180;43:26,020;"pick, which is those are third and fourth round picks, their fifth round pick, which 144th overall,"
43:26,020;43:32,100;"their sixth round pick, which is 179 overall, and their seventh round pick, which is 218th overall."
43:32,100;43:35,780;"So literally all but their second round pick, which I don't even know what they had."
43:35,780;43:44,580;"And their 2000, the year after, first round pick, which ended up being second overall,"
43:45,380;43:49,540;"And the third round pick, which ended up being 64th overall."
43:49,540;43:52,420;"Who was the first round pick in that draft?"
43:52,420;43:53,940;"LeVar Harrington."
43:53,940;43:55,220;"See? Yeah."
43:55,220;43:56,500;"Solid."
43:56,500;43:58,420;"Yeah. But he's a bum."
43:58,420;44:02,180;"I'll give you the names of the people that were drafted that weren't Ricky Williams."
44:02,180;44:04,180;"Kate McNown,"
44:04,180;44:06,020;"DeWayne Bates,"
44:06,020;44:07,780;"Nate Stimson,"
44:07,780;44:10,260;"Kari Samuel,"
44:10,260;44:11,780;"Desmond Clark,"
44:11,780;44:13,540;"Billy Miller,"
44:14,020;44:16,340;"Levar Arrington Lloyd Harrison."
44:16,340;44:18,580;"Who won that trade?"
44:18,580;44:20,340;"Don't know."
44:20,340;44:21,780;"I don't know."
44:21,780;44:24,740;"I might go with the same three years."
44:24,740;44:26,980;"And then they fired Dick a year later."
44:26,980;44:28,580;"They're like, bro, what are you doing?"
44:28,580;44:29,540;"You know winning games."
44:29,540;44:34,900;"So and you may think that that's the best part of this."
44:34,900;44:41,700;"But actually the best part was the ESPN magazine cover."
44:41,700;44:42,580;"Oh, yeah."
44:43,540;44:45,540;"So here's the quote from Wikipedia."
44:45,540;44:52,020;"After the trade, Dickett and Williams appeared on the cover of the August 9th, 1999 issue of ESPN, the magazine,"
44:52,020;44:54,340;"dressed as a bride in groom."
44:54,340;44:58,980;"Dickett agreed to the photo shoot as long as he wasn't wearing the wedding dress."
44:58,980;45:04,740;"We can have a mustache on your bride."
45:04,740;45:08,020;"Dude, the picture is phenomenal."
45:08,020;45:10,500;"Dude, he's the thickest bride ever."
45:10,500;45:11,860;"That dude."
45:12,980;45:16,340;"Yeah, I saw him interviewed about that too. He was so funny."
45:16,340;45:20,380;"He was like, Oh, I had no idea what to be a big deal. He's a guy."
45:20,380;45:25,820;"I just thought it'd be funny. And then they cut the video cut to like all"
45:25,820;45:28,180;"these fans like scream at Adam like,"
45:28,180;45:30,860;"about the dress back on."
45:30,860;45:35,500;"Welcome to the NFL, Ricky."
45:35,500;45:41,380;"And speaking of his his really thick arms."
45:42,580;45:45,060;"tying it back to this football game that we were supposed to be talking about."
45:45,060;45:45,940;"Oh, no, I don't know."
45:45,940;45:46,860;"Back in the football game."
45:46,860;45:48,380;"No, but this one's good."
45:48,380;45:49,540;"I promise."
45:49,540;45:53,020;"The commentators on Ricky Williams fumble"
45:53,020;45:58,300;"blamed on the fact that he has a hard time tucking the football in because his arms are too muscular."
45:58,300;45:59,300;"It makes sense."
45:59,300;46:01,140;"It's why Shaq can't shoot free throws."
46:01,140;46:03,740;"Yeah, you just couldn't tuck it hands to me."
46:03,740;46:04,580;"Yeah. Yeah."
46:04,580;46:07,580;"That's why I don't work out."
46:07,580;46:08,740;"Better ball security."
46:08,740;46:09,460;"Yeah."
46:09,460;46:14,460;"two. And free free throw percentage. What is your"
46:14,460;46:17,800;"percentage? Dude, I'm a sick free throw shooter. It's fucking"
46:17,800;46:22,960;"zero. No, I don't. I consistently shoot in the 80s. Uh huh."
46:22,960;46:28,360;"In my backyard. Yeah. On your nerve hoop. I've probably"
46:28,360;46:34,560;"only ever taken like 15 to 20 in real life. I looked up the"
46:35,920;46:39,440;"called football Russian leaders in a single season. Oh yeah."
46:39,440;46:44,720;"You were wrong Greg. Ron Dane is 17th. Oh, Wikipedia was wrong."
46:44,720;46:48,000;"Ricky Williams is single season or career?"
46:48,000;46:50,800;"Single season. Yeah, we're talking about career."
46:50,800;46:54,800;"Well, now that the Ricky Williams he set the single season."
46:54,800;46:58,000;"All right. I thought. 2,100 yards."
46:58,000;47:01,440;"I think he has the most career though. Yeah. At the time."
47:02,240;47:07,220;"Anyway, any guesses at number one and two well, where is Ricky Williams? You third 15"
47:07,220;47:10,940;"15th, yeah, oh God"
47:10,940;47:15,840;"Barry Sanders is probably up there. That's all thinking but he would have been before"
47:15,840;47:18,560;"No, Barry Sanders number one still"
47:18,560;47:25,280;"28 in 1988"
47:25,280;47:30,980;"You say well Barry Sanders came out. So how did he set the record? I don't know saying maybe it was for total"
47:30,980;47:32,980;"I"
47:32,980;47:38,140;"Failing us right now and yeah, it was it was probably totally handy must have been yeah"
47:38,140;47:40,500;"number two is"
47:40,500;47:43,580;"Like 60 yards behind him and he's an active player"
47:43,580;47:46,140;"active player"
47:46,140;47:50,780;"Oh Kareem high. Nope. New deal Peterson. Nope"
47:50,780;47:54,540;"It's not someone you think"
47:54,540;47:57,100;"Is it a is it a power five?"
47:58,140;48:03,320;"Yeah, I don't know the power five is but it's a big school James White"
48:03,320;48:06,560;"No"
48:06,560;48:10,240;"School assigned a new deal with a new team this year. What was the school?"
48:10,240;48:13,560;"Wisconsin oh"
48:13,560;48:15,960;"The dude that just got drafted"
48:15,960;48:21,920;"No, no, you just signed a new deal with a new team. He held out recently as well. Oh"
48:21,920;48:27,120;"Oh god damn it"
48:27,120;48:30,120;"the guy you play for the Vikings?"
48:30,120;48:31,120;"No."
48:31,120;48:32,120;"Yeah, fuck."
48:32,120;48:35,120;"I don't know."
48:35,120;48:36,120;"Who is it?"
48:36,120;48:37,120;"Melvin Gordon."
48:37,120;48:39,120;"No shit."
48:39,120;48:42,120;"Only 587 and 2014."
48:42,120;48:43,120;"Wow."
48:43,120;48:46,120;"Wait, wasn't he on the same team as James White?"
48:46,120;48:47,120;"That was constant."
48:47,120;48:48,120;"No."
48:48,120;48:49,120;"Yeah."
48:49,120;48:52,120;"I might be making that up."
48:52,120;48:54,120;"I'm not a college football guy."
48:54,120;48:57,120;"I'll pay attention with all the pages."
48:57,120;49:00,240;"Reggie Bush."
49:00,240;49:02,600;"Landale White."
49:02,600;49:05,240;"All right."
49:05,240;49:06,240;"So favorites."
49:06,240;49:08,720;"OK."
49:08,720;49:13,080;"Um, do we want to do?"
49:13,080;49:15,920;"Do we have any other thing worth talking about this game?"
49:15,920;49:18,000;"Our scheme was awful."
49:18,000;49:20,280;"I only took like 10 notes."
49:20,280;49:21,480;"I didn't watch it."
49:22,920;49:25,820;"We know first start for Jarvis Green. I guess that was cool."
49:25,820;49:28,560;"All right. Well, how about you? Give me your best or worst?"
49:28,560;49:35,880;"Can you give me a best? Can you give me a best?"
49:35,880;49:42,360;"Okay. That touchdown throw, you know, right?"
49:42,360;49:44,960;"Kind of towards the end of the second half."
49:44,960;49:46,880;"No, it's right."
49:46,880;49:49,240;"No, it's right."
49:49,240;49:51,040;"Well, they're both a bad."
49:52,680;49:57,160;"Yeah, but actually, I think it was right at the beginning of the second half where they, yeah, because they put the bags on the thing."
49:57,160;49:58,360;"Yeah, yeah."
49:58,360;50:04,400;"And they came out and they threw that nice, you know, patent was kind of, you know, a little OPI to get open, but"
50:04,400;50:06,720;"they were hand fighting. I think that was even"
50:06,720;50:08,200;"whatever."
50:08,200;50:09,560;"It was a great route though."
50:09,560;50:11,080;"You got open."
50:11,080;50:13,000;"Yeah, he was wide open."
50:13,000;50:13,560;"Yeah."
50:13,560;50:15,600;"Yeah, that was a great, that was a great touchdown."
50:15,600;50:19,320;"I think the other one was good too, just him going up and fighting for the ball."
50:19,880;50:24,440;"It was like the Zach Thomas blade and absolute lumber on Kevin"
50:24,440;50:28,320;"Falk, which is the football part of me and appreciated that."
50:28,320;50:29,360;"That's fair."
50:29,360;50:29,840;"All right."
50:29,840;50:32,400;"So do you have a singular worst?"
50:32,400;50:39,120;"There was a triple cover interception by Brady in the second and the first half"
50:39,120;50:42,160;"of the second quarter where he's just like, was like 10 yards."
50:42,160;50:47,600;"Like a just awful, awful, awful throw."
50:47,600;50:48,200;"Like what?"
50:49,480;50:51,680;"What do you I thought his other interception was of course."
50:51,680;50:52,420;"Yeah."
50:52,420;50:55,360;"And the fourth quarter we got picked off at the Miami 10 yard line."
50:55,360;50:57,400;"You're like, I don't know who that one's to."
50:57,400;50:59,120;"I think we're all either."
50:59,120;51:01,440;"Cause that was a, no, it was just a bad ball."
51:01,440;51:02,480;"You already can't."
51:02,480;51:03,880;"You can't throw the deep ball, right?"
51:03,880;51:04,720;"Steve."
51:04,720;51:06,640;"That wasn't even a deep ball."
51:06,640;51:08,040;"It was like 20 yards in the air."
51:08,040;51:09,400;"It was bad."
51:09,400;51:12,760;"It's, it should have been like out of the 30 or 10."
51:12,760;51:13,800;"You threw it 20."
51:13,800;51:19,360;"Steve, it's a, your whole like language and the way you talk"
51:19,360;51:22,360;"Brady now. It's very disappointing to me."
51:22,360;51:26,760;"It's a noticeable change. I think."
51:26,760;51:29,960;"No, he deserved in this game. I"
51:29,960;51:30,520;"didn't see it."
51:30,520;51:31,160;"It was a mistake."
51:31,160;51:31,800;"Great."
51:31,800;51:35,160;"They awful in this game. I will call it when I see it."
51:35,160;51:37,520;"You know, I'm always very honest."
51:37,520;51:39,360;"I still loved on Brady. I hope he"
51:39,360;51:40,520;"still love him as well."
51:40,520;51:43,440;"I hope he doesn't get to play this season because the season"
51:43,440;51:45,280;"doesn't get played and then he comes back to the Patriots."
51:45,280;51:47,800;"I agree."
51:49,000;51:51,000;"Do you have any best and worst?"
51:51,000;51:54,040;"Well, I didn't watch the game. We know"
51:54,040;51:57,000;"That's a worse just"
51:57,000;52:00,440;"Look at my notes here"
52:00,440;52:03,000;"Is a is a good quote"
52:03,000;52:09,960;"I read about Ricky Williams said some people some people say drugs ruined Ricky Williams career, which is not true"
52:09,960;52:13,000;"Drug testing ruined his career"
52:13,000;52:19,080;"[LAUGHTER]"
52:19,080;52:21,400;"Let's see, worst."
52:21,400;52:27,480;"So that Terrell Davis bonus, those four things he had to hit."
52:27,480;52:29,640;"Yeah, he didn't hit a single one."
52:29,640;52:30,320;"No."
52:30,320;52:31,680;"Ever?"
52:31,680;52:32,480;"No."
52:32,480;52:32,980;"No."
52:32,980;52:38,280;"Oh, well, I mean, over-- so any-- so that was like a four-year span, right?"
52:38,280;52:39,000;"Yeah."
52:39,000;52:42,880;"There's only five players since like the 80s."
52:42,880;52:48,260;"Four players that have ever hit it over any four"
52:48,260;52:49,960;"four years span in their career."
52:49,960;52:53,040;"Real Davis, obviously."
52:53,040;52:56,000;"Barry Sanders, Emmett Smith and Marshall Falk."
52:56,000;53:00,080;"Basically like, hey, you gotta be a hall of famer."
53:00,080;53:01,320;"You don't make any money."
53:01,320;53:02,640;"- Yeah, basically."
53:02,640;53:04,440;"Well, I mean, he thought he would be, I guess."
53:04,440;53:05,280;"- Yeah."
53:05,280;53:07,400;"- Rep 2,000 yards, fuck it, right?"
53:07,400;53:08,520;"How can it be?"
53:08,520;53:10,920;"He was also drafted by the Phillies."
53:10,920;53:12,720;"He was a two sport athlete."
53:12,720;53:13,720;"No, sure."
53:13,720;53:16,400;"Like all those dudes are."
53:16,400;53:17,800;"Yeah, apparently, Dan Marino was."
53:17,800;53:21,320;"I saw something today about Dan Marino being,"
53:21,320;53:25,680;"oh, he went like 14 and 0 as a pitcher."
53:25,680;53:27,000;"And apparently,"
53:27,000;53:30,040;"well, his coach came to the mound to ask him,"
53:30,040;53:31,720;"you know, like he was in a jam or something,"
53:31,720;53:33,320;"coach came to the mound."
53:33,320;53:34,280;"He's like, so what are we gonna do?"
53:34,280;53:35,680;"He's like, well, you're gonna shut up"
53:35,680;53:37,760;"and I'm gonna finish this sort of thing."
53:37,760;53:40,120;"Yeah, it damn reno is kind of asshole apparently"
53:40,120;53:46,980;"It's like me. I'm like a field general in the mid-field and soccer and I shoot like 87% from the line"
53:46,980;53:50,800;"Yeah, I don't think it's like you at all. Yeah"
53:50,800;53:56,040;"Appreciate that but no"
53:56,040;53:58,720;"You're right. I'm more of a three sport athlete"
54:00,920;54:07,900;"Dare I ask what that third sport is God, you know, I'm sick of beer pong. I'll fucking take I'll take anybody at this party"
54:07,900;54:19,900;"Literally like your point moment crack. I know you have one my favorite beer pong moment. Yeah"
54:19,900;54:24,480;"So good question"
54:24,840;54:26,680;"- Food's ball moment."
54:26,680;54:28,120;"- All right, let's hear it."
54:28,120;54:30,840;"- Back when I had our old member, our old table we used to have."
54:30,840;54:31,880;"- Yeah."
54:31,880;54:33,480;"- And I brought it with me to college."
54:33,480;54:37,680;"Which was an amazing, amazing idea, by the way."
54:37,680;54:38,520;"- Oh, I bet."
54:38,520;54:39,760;"- Remember, I fit that in Chewie."
54:39,760;54:42,040;"I took all the poles out and fit that fucker"
54:42,040;54:44,240;"in the minivan, drove it down."
54:44,240;54:45,080;"- Good Lord."
54:45,080;54:50,240;"- And I was playing a ton, a ton."
54:50,240;54:51,600;"I was playing all the time."
54:51,600;54:53,040;"I got wicked good at it."
54:53,040;54:55,100;"And then Greg came to visit me at college,"
54:55,100;54:58,080;"like maybe two years after I had it there."
54:58,080;55:00,200;"And we were playing in that house, Greg,"
55:00,200;55:03,440;"and I let him go up like eight to two,"
55:03,440;55:04,740;"and I beat him 10, eight."
55:04,740;55:06,720;"(laughs)"
55:06,720;55:07,740;"- Let him go up."
55:07,740;55:10,600;"Yeah, I was like, he had a couple of cheesy goals."
55:10,600;55:11,440;"I wasn't really trying."
55:11,440;55:14,240;"I was like, did I not even have my moves yet?"
55:14,240;55:15,080;"(laughs)"
55:15,080;55:15,920;"I didn't like, pull it all out."
55:15,920;55:17,640;"I was like, yeah."
55:17,640;55:19,560;"- This is the most brotherish story."
55:19,560;55:21,200;"- Yeah, the fact that you're so--"
55:21,200;55:25,480;"- You practiced for two years and you beat me by two goals."
55:25,480;55:26,720;"- Yeah, but I want you to be like,"
55:26,720;55:28,560;"you know, you're the top of the walk."
55:28,560;55:31,040;"- You crush your soul though, you crush your hope."
55:31,040;55:32,240;"- Yeah. - It's worth it."
55:32,240;55:34,080;"I'd probably beat him the next game."
55:34,080;55:34,920;"- Nope."
55:34,920;55:35,740;"- I'll agree with you."
55:35,740;55:39,040;"- What's your best beer pong story?"
55:39,040;55:39,880;"- I was just trying to think,"
55:39,880;55:42,160;"I can't, there's nothing that really comes to mind."
55:42,160;55:46,240;"Well, I remember one story of, you remember Stefan?"
55:46,240;55:49,200;"Steve, like he was like super black"
55:49,200;55:50,520;"that'll play in beer pong."
55:50,520;55:52,400;"And I remember him like falling asleep"
55:52,400;55:54,680;"with his sitting down with his face on the table"
55:54,680;55:56,080;"and it's something like nudged him."
55:56,080;55:59,320;"And he just like wakes up and just like instinctively throws it."
55:59,320;56:01,200;"And it was like the last company got it."
56:01,200;56:02,200;"(laughing)"
56:02,200;56:04,440;"And then just like passed out again immediately."
56:04,440;56:09,640;"It was like a quality fucking like 90s movie, you know?"
56:09,640;56:11,900;"(laughing)"
56:11,900;56:18,480;"But for foosball, I had the hammer"
56:18,480;56:21,080;"When I take it from my forwards and I pass it between him,"
56:21,080;56:22,000;"tak tak tak."
56:22,000;56:23,680;"And then I fuck a spang."
56:23,680;56:24,520;"- Oh yeah."
56:24,520;56:27,320;"- And he's like, ""You don't have the hammer got you again?"""
56:27,320;56:28,160;"Uh huh."
56:28,160;56:31,280;"When you're a hammer, everything looks like a nail, Andy."
56:31,280;56:32,120;"- This is."
56:32,120;56:33,640;"- Bang, bang, bang."
56:33,640;56:36,160;"- This is why it took so much pleasure in beating him."
56:36,160;56:37,200;"- Yeah, exactly."
56:37,200;56:39,160;"- He was saying that exact same thing,"
56:39,160;56:41,040;"the hammers have been around for 10 years."
56:41,040;56:41,880;"- Yeah, exactly."
56:41,880;56:42,880;"- He's saying the same thing when we were playing."
56:42,880;56:43,720;"- And I, I didn't say."
56:43,720;56:45,200;"- If you played them now, we'd still say it."
56:45,200;56:46,040;"- Yeah."
56:46,040;56:46,880;"- And then I did that move, you know,"
56:46,880;56:51,040;"Instead of passing it in between your guys, you can just put it on like the guys left foot and you just like do that"
56:51,040;56:54,740;"We're all loop the loop with that same dude and get behind it and slam it in the corner"
56:54,740;56:59,640;"See this is what you need a name for your moves Steve because no one knows what you're talking about a"
56:59,640;57:02,440;"Loop a loop. I got yeah"
57:02,440;57:08,440;"All right, well then you got to start consistently calling it to look to look all right. I'll call the correct Peter"
57:08,440;57:13,080;"That's not even clever pretty good"
57:15,000;57:19,340;"And he likes it. All right, so my my best and worst"
57:19,340;57:25,080;"We we really have avoided this game almost completely that's how it should be"
57:25,080;57:30,020;"It was zero if you can't hear"
57:30,020;57:33,320;"Expecting us like I don't know your dolphins fan UK"
57:33,320;57:39,120;"Mary expecting us to like actually talk about this game you you're severely disappointed and for that I say good"
57:39,120;57:43,740;"What we talked about Ricky Williams, so that's actually a dolphin's family"
57:43,740;57:47,900;"listen to this for like some sort of karmic whatever bullshit like they they got what"
57:47,900;57:54,100;"they deserved. Yeah. I don't know. That great story about Father's Day. So I will not."
57:54,100;58:01,620;"I think my my best in this game came in garbage time like he was talking about. But he picked"
58:01,620;58:07,180;"a different story. So I'm going to pick this one. They went on probably a good two, three,"
58:07,180;58:11,180;"maybe five minute conversation about Teddy Bruski"
58:11,180;58:13,900;"and how he plays the Alto saxophone?"
58:13,900;58:15,860;"- Really?"
58:15,860;58:16,700;"- Yes."
58:16,700;58:17,540;"- Yes."
58:17,540;58:19,420;"- So apparently he played it in high school"
58:19,420;58:22,460;"and was on the varsity marching band"
58:22,460;58:25,700;"but then had to choose because he's also in varsity football"
58:25,700;58:26,820;"and he couldn't do ball at the same time."
58:26,820;58:29,420;"He had to choose football or saxophone."
58:29,420;58:31,940;"And so he chose football obviously,"
58:31,940;58:33,820;"but still plays his saxophone."
58:33,820;58:35,940;"- Well, I could just like run out there at halftime."
58:35,940;58:37,340;"But let me say it is uni."
58:37,340;58:39,420;"Oh, so you did watch it."
58:39,420;58:40,860;"That's exactly what they said."
58:40,860;58:41,460;"Did he do it?"
58:41,460;58:42,900;"Did he wear his cleats?"
58:42,900;58:44,940;"Yeah, see, I could do it."
58:44,940;58:45,580;"I know."
58:45,580;58:47,980;"Yeah, remember it."
58:47,980;58:48,820;"It was bad as they are."
58:48,820;58:52,620;"Elle's our sister used to do band."
58:52,620;58:54,060;"And these are like band camp."
58:54,060;58:58,020;"And she's to come back and be like, oh, band camp was so tough today."
58:58,020;58:59,860;"They made us march for like three hours."
58:59,860;59:02,140;"And I said, eat shit, Kelly."
59:02,140;59:03,700;"OK, I'm a real athlete."
59:03,700;59:04,900;"Just came from fucking."
59:04,900;59:13,980;"soccer practice. Yeah. Yeah. What is that? Kelly. I guess it's just yeah. It's just"
59:13,980;59:26,140;"second nature. Yeah. It's just so often. So my worst in this game. I'm sure it was tough"
59:26,140;59:31,320;"though. They had to wear the big old get-ups and carry around tubas. Yeah. That description"
59:31,320;59:37,960;"dad put in the Christmas letter about their March in the Macy's Day parade was ridiculous."
59:37,960;59:43,880;"What was it? You call it like a freezing death march while I picked the New Yorkers"
59:43,880;59:49,400;"sneered at him and shit. He has a way with words that one. Oh, that's awesome."
59:49,400;59:59,400;"I found this dad interesting. It's not a best or worse, but Tom Brady had a 66% completion percentage,"
59:59,400;01:00:07,480;"which was the second highest behind Kurt Warner since 1970, which I'm guessing at this point has"
01:00:07,480;01:00:13,640;"probably been broken. Because that doesn't seem very high. That's pretty. I'm pretty sure Drew"
01:00:13,640;01:00:21,080;"Breeze's like career completion, which is like 70 something percent. We don't talk about"
01:00:22,280;01:00:27,800;"True breeze on this podcast. Okay. He apologized. He's uh, he's turning a corner. It's okay"
01:00:27,800;01:00:32,120;"Um, and then the other step that I could touch that one. Nope"
01:00:32,120;01:00:37,400;"We're moving on the other staff that I found her sing was um, they showed a list of"
01:00:37,400;01:00:41,720;"Miami dolphins most 100 yard rushing games in a season"
01:00:41,720;01:00:47,960;"And remember this is make a quiz out of it. The trivia. This is week five, right? So um"
01:00:47,960;01:00:51,160;"You won't get number one because I never even heard of them"
01:00:52,120;01:00:53,200;"- Okay."
01:00:53,200;01:00:55,960;"- Delvin Williams back in 1978, right."
01:00:55,960;01:00:58,840;"So, Ricky Williams, tie for second."
01:00:58,840;01:01:01,240;"Now, that guy had five in 1978."
01:01:01,240;01:01:04,200;"Ricky Williams, tie for second with three other people."
01:01:04,200;01:01:05,400;"Can you name any of them?"
01:01:05,400;01:01:10,120;"- Are they within the last 20 years?"
01:01:10,120;01:01:15,480;"- One is this, two of these are kind of this sort of timeframe."
01:01:15,480;01:01:19,560;"One was late '90s, one was 2000, and then one was 1972."
01:01:20,440;01:01:22,760;"Larry Zonka is the only two."
01:01:22,760;01:01:24,440;"Correct."
01:01:24,440;01:01:26,520;"Four."
01:01:26,520;01:01:29,280;"Late '90s and early 2000s."
01:01:29,280;01:01:31,120;"Dolphins running backs."
01:01:31,120;01:01:34,360;"Think of last season."
01:01:34,360;01:01:36,120;"I didn't watch that."
01:01:36,120;01:01:38,520;"I did watch the other game."
01:01:38,520;01:01:41,520;"He looked exactly like Antoine Smith as well."
01:01:41,520;01:01:44,720;"And I brought him up every time that he was on the screen."
01:01:44,720;01:01:45,720;"Looked up."
01:01:45,720;01:01:48,960;"I can't do this."
01:01:48,960;01:01:50,960;"even"
01:01:50,960;01:01:51,960;"now"
01:01:51,960;01:01:56,960;"even chair last night"
01:01:56,960;01:01:58,960;"well"
01:01:58,960;01:02:01,960;"remember dolphins on the backs of the mar smith"
01:02:01,960;01:02:05,520;"that's really he's that old"
01:02:05,520;01:02:07,360;"i thought he was more recent than that"
01:02:07,360;01:02:12,080;"but he'd be out and i don't think you'll get this one either"
01:02:12,080;01:02:17,520;"kareem of dole jabar in nineteen ninety six oh shit that's a name for a"
01:02:17,520;01:02:25,920;"Right. So all those, all those four players, including Ricky Williams, had 400 yard Russian"
01:02:25,920;01:02:30,720;"games in a season. By the way, this is 2002, week five."
01:02:30,720;01:02:35,600;"Basically, he just run for his 400 yard game."
01:02:35,600;01:02:37,440;"Wow. So he did four and five games."
01:02:37,440;01:02:41,680;"Yeah. It's a great year. This is best year as a."
01:02:41,680;01:02:43,680;"Yeah, I have like 1,800 yards this year."
01:02:43,680;01:02:44,480;"It was amazing."
01:02:44,480;01:02:46,240;"Yeah. Do the Dolphins make the playoffs this year?"
01:02:46,240;01:02:48,240;"They do not."
01:02:48,240;01:02:49,240;"Nope."
01:02:49,240;01:02:52,600;"Who from the AC East made it?"
01:02:52,600;01:02:55,000;"And New York football jets."
01:02:55,000;01:02:56,000;"Mm hmm."
01:02:56,000;01:02:58,520;"There's three-way tie for first."
01:02:58,520;01:03:00,440;"And then the bills are eating eight, too."
01:03:00,440;01:03:01,440;"Yeah."
01:03:01,440;01:03:03,240;"No, this was like a real, real time."
01:03:03,240;01:03:04,720;"The pass for the tie for first?"
01:03:04,720;01:03:05,720;"Yeah."
01:03:05,720;01:03:06,720;"That's why I hate Red Fire."
01:03:06,720;01:03:07,720;"I hate Red Fire because of the season."
01:03:07,720;01:03:12,600;"So, well, yeah, we'll get to this whole thing because it was like, it was like multiple"
01:03:12,600;01:03:13,600;"tiebreakers at the end."
01:03:13,600;01:03:15,680;"Well, a lot of my hatred."
01:03:15,680;01:03:16,640;"This is like no."
01:03:16,640;01:03:18,820;"- The final moment of the season is,"
01:03:18,820;01:03:19,660;"if Brett Favre--"
01:03:19,660;01:03:20,780;"- It's not this season, Steve."
01:03:20,780;01:03:22,260;"- Stop."
01:03:22,260;01:03:23,100;"- We would have been in the playoffs."
01:03:23,100;01:03:24,240;"- It's not this season."
01:03:24,240;01:03:29,240;"It's the season they had with Castle that he did that."
01:03:29,240;01:03:30,080;"- Really?"
01:03:30,080;01:03:31,640;"- Really, Andy?"
01:03:31,640;01:03:35,200;"- I feel like I've hidden Brett Favre forever, though."
01:03:35,200;01:03:40,200;"- I think Brett Favre, I think Chad Pennington"
01:03:40,200;01:03:42,880;"had something to do with both of the times"
01:03:42,880;01:03:44,960;"at the Patriots in this playoffs."
01:03:44,960;01:03:49,400;"Yeah, the breath five thing is when he at the end of his career, when he was on the Jets."
01:03:49,400;01:03:50,180;"Yes."
01:03:50,180;01:03:50,480;"Yeah."
01:03:50,480;01:03:53,200;"And we needed him to be like the Colts or something."
01:03:53,200;01:03:54,120;"And he couldn't do it."
01:03:54,120;01:03:59,200;"I believe it was, I believe it was actually the Dolphins with, um,"
01:03:59,200;01:04:00,760;"chat Pennington or something like that."
01:04:00,760;01:04:01,240;"Okay."
01:04:01,240;01:04:02,360;"Yeah, that would make sense."
01:04:02,360;01:04:06,360;"That doesn't really sound like me rooting for the Jets, even if that means we get in the playoffs."
01:04:06,360;01:04:08,880;"That's what it ended up being, I think."
01:04:08,880;01:04:11,040;"Oh, and then it wasn't great."
01:04:11,040;01:04:14,120;"You guys, even desperate times call for desperate measures."
01:04:14,640;01:04:16,360;"I watched that game at your house, Andy."
01:04:16,360;01:04:17,520;"I don't know why I remember that."
01:04:17,520;01:04:19,320;"There's something to do with a QB sneak"
01:04:19,320;01:04:20,560;"that Farrv couldn't get,"
01:04:20,560;01:04:23,000;"and we're all like, ""Oh, fuck it, asshole."""
01:04:23,000;01:04:25,000;"- That feels familiar."
01:04:25,000;01:04:26,000;"- Yeah. Let me guess."
01:04:26,000;01:04:27,200;"Ryan Sawyer was there."
01:04:27,200;01:04:28,560;"That fucking prick."
01:04:28,560;01:04:30,800;"(laughing)"
01:04:30,800;01:04:32,960;"- He deserved it."
01:04:32,960;01:04:34,280;"- Why do you hate Breff Farrv?"
01:04:34,280;01:04:38,200;"- Well, I think I never really liked him,"
01:04:38,200;01:04:41,160;"but then I hated him after that."
01:04:41,160;01:04:42,000;"- I like him."
01:04:42,000;01:04:44,600;"- That was like way early, and I've always hated him."
01:04:44,600;01:04:49,040;"Wranglers real comfortable"
01:04:49,040;01:04:56,200;"Good he's he just like to have fun. Yeah"
01:04:56,200;01:05:01,440;"Just playing back air football. He he's one of the best ever do it"
01:05:01,440;01:05:04,280;"Okay"
01:05:04,280;01:05:08,280;"If he actually imagine if he had like Brady's work ethic"
01:05:08,280;01:05:14,580;"Oh, God, he would have been like the best quarterback that's ever lit you could say about a bunch of guys"
01:05:14,580;01:05:16,180;"You can say about Ryan."
01:05:16,180;01:05:17,380;"I don't know."
01:05:17,380;01:05:18,380;"I don't know."
01:05:18,380;01:05:21,660;"He, Ryan Malant had all the physical tools."
01:05:21,660;01:05:23,780;"Ryan Leif had all the physical tools."
01:05:23,780;01:05:26,380;"You know, approach the game like Tom Brady."
01:05:26,380;01:05:27,220;"Maybe they would have been."
01:05:27,220;01:05:30,180;"No approach like how hard they were."
01:05:30,180;01:05:32,140;"This is like Brett Farf."
01:05:32,140;01:05:33,100;"No, Brett Farf."
01:05:33,100;01:05:37,380;"Brett Farf had way more natural skill than Ryan Malant."
01:05:37,380;01:05:38,500;"He just didn't give a shit."
01:05:38,500;01:05:40,740;"He's like for like Hall of Fame quarterbacks."
01:05:40,740;01:05:43,420;"He gave the least amount of shit."
01:05:43,420;01:05:48,420;"about just like, you know, off season workouts, that kind of thing."
01:05:48,420;01:05:50,420;"Maybe Big Ben, I'll throw Big Ben in there."
01:05:50,420;01:05:51,420;"That's kind of sad."
01:05:51,420;01:05:54,420;"There's got to be somebody else."
01:05:54,420;01:05:57,420;"Big Ben's a good candidate."
01:05:57,420;01:06:05,420;"Dude, Brett Favre showed up like 30 pounds overweight to his rookie season."
01:06:05,420;01:06:06,420;"Is that where I got traded from the Falcons?"
01:06:06,420;01:06:09,420;"Yeah, I'm pretty sure that was like a big part of it."
01:06:09,420;01:06:10,420;"Probably."
01:06:10,420;01:06:11,420;"Yeah."
01:06:11,420;01:06:18,020;"So speaking of Big Ben, did you see that he is now unblocking people on Twitter?"
01:06:18,020;01:06:19,020;"Yeah."
01:06:19,020;01:06:20,020;"Yeah."
01:06:20,020;01:06:26,660;"So we preemptively from the Page of Dinesy podcast blocked Ben Roffensberger."
01:06:26,660;01:06:32,900;"Well, you should at first like just send him a picture of his own face."
01:06:32,900;01:06:35,100;"See, see how he likes that."
01:06:35,100;01:06:36,420;"Because what is he going to do?"
01:06:36,420;01:06:37,900;"Blocky for saying it's offensive?"
01:06:37,900;01:06:38,900;"No."
01:06:38,900;01:06:39,900;"It's your face, dude."
01:06:39,900;01:06:41,900;"I'm gonna be all unblock him"
01:06:41,900;01:06:47,700;"Unblock him send him a picture of the ugliest picture of his face that you can find and then all right"
01:06:47,700;01:06:51,660;"So we may have to crowdsource this because I think there's a lot of ugly pictures of his face out there"
01:06:51,660;01:06:55,800;"I know yeah, okay next time we get one where he's you shaved half his face"
01:06:55,800;01:07:00,020;"Yes, the other half of a beard. I think that looks good"
01:07:00,020;01:07:02,880;"I think you'll see a lot of people doing that in the coming years"
01:07:06,220;01:07:11,900;"Just like the other time I tried to start a trend with inside out t-shirts that never took off"
01:07:11,900;01:07:20,300;"Okay, I was trying to piggyback the hipster thing of like I don't need like to show my brand"
01:07:20,300;01:07:22,900;"So just turn all my t-shirts inside out"
01:07:22,900;01:07:26,900;"And I was like just you wait guys. This is gonna catch on"
01:07:26,900;01:07:34,100;"Never did I'm still hoping you try to bring back the ball cut again. No, nope"
01:07:34,900;01:07:36,900;"That's you may have to spearhead that one"
01:07:36,900;01:07:39,200;"so I"
01:07:39,200;01:07:42,180;"Think you're all very deep. I think you're all sleeping on the"
01:07:42,180;01:07:45,140;"the the guy who was actually"
01:07:45,140;01:07:52,660;"Named class trendsetter in high school. Do you wear what? No, you weren't"
01:07:52,660;01:07:58,300;"I have the yearbook to prove it. Do they just give everybody an award or no?"
01:07:58,300;01:08:03,760;"They did not but this was the time where I was wearing that red spiky backpack in the house"

01:08:37,800;01:08:43,960;"Why you had to call her best friend and say is it judgmental if I don't date him because of this?"
01:08:43,960;01:08:49,160;"I hope she didn't see the hat then that match it. No, she hadn't seen that yet"
01:08:49,160;01:08:56,440;"Backpack was sweet. Did you buy in England? I believe I did. Yeah, it was for those that don't know it was like a red"
01:08:58,120;01:09:06,700;"It's like a latexy rubber that had it was just a regular backpack and it was like a thermo form like shaping"

01:09:10,080;01:09:13,860;"Rubber spikes coming off of it. Yeah, right?"
01:09:13,860;01:09:18,780;"Thank you like the ninja turtles. I don't know one of those bad guys had like a spiky shell back"
01:09:18,780;01:09:24,780;"That kind of idea. Yeah, that's what it looked like and then you had a ski hat that was like"
01:09:25,720;01:09:30,920;"Almost identical. Yeah, it's like the what the snowboard is used were at the time and it had it black hat with red"
01:09:30,920;01:09:37,920;"Yeah, did you wear that metal band Andy we weren't wearing this this key hat while you're sitting in class? I"

01:09:54,540;01:10:04,540;"Yeah, talk about trend setting, you know, naming your bands after blended up babies."
01:10:04,540;01:10:13,540;"I didn't care to mention what the debut album was titled."
01:10:13,540;01:10:16,540;"What was it titled?"
01:10:16,540;01:10:19,540;"Oh, it's called in the womb."
01:10:19,540;01:10:25,340;"the womb. Yeah. Well, did you have like the future albums titled out?"
01:10:25,340;01:10:29,140;"No, that was just one of the names of the songs that we see."
01:10:29,140;01:10:30,340;"We're gonna go on dude."
01:10:30,340;01:10:32,380;"The second album, ""Breeching the Canal."""
01:10:32,380;01:10:38,180;"If there was a second album, we probably would have come to you for"
01:10:38,180;01:10:38,580;"naming."
01:10:38,580;01:10:43,380;"Their album is in the blender."
01:10:43,380;01:10:44,740;"Yeah. Oh my God."
01:10:45,380;01:10:47,020;"umbilical separation."
01:10:47,020;01:10:52,620;"No, by the third album, we're all acoustic anyway, so it"
01:10:52,620;01:10:53,700;"wouldn't it wouldn't work."
01:10:53,700;01:10:54,540;"Yeah."
01:10:54,540;01:11:03,500;"Speaking of bad football, my worst in this game, bringing it"
01:11:03,500;01:11:07,860;"all back was the pages tried their beloved direct snap to"
01:11:07,860;01:11:08,540;"Kevin Falk."
01:11:08,540;01:11:10,780;"And it didn't fucking work."
01:11:10,780;01:11:11,700;"It didn't work."
01:11:11,700;01:11:13,620;"That's a didn't work bad game."
01:11:13,780;01:11:18,180;"Yeah, when that that was a staple for me to triangle did"
01:11:18,180;01:11:25,780;"Selling yeah, was that right before you through the worst egg maybe he's ever thrown to I think it could have been yeah"
01:11:25,780;01:11:32,980;"Thought I wrote down this Dave once dead it is yeah, I"
01:11:32,980;01:11:41,180;"Actually did a decent job against Patriots. Yeah, it's only five and four against him against his"
01:11:41,980;01:11:43,740;"I see your once a year Miami."
01:11:43,740;01:11:45,280;"And the true."
01:11:45,280;01:11:47,740;"I actually the average."
01:11:47,740;01:11:49,780;"Has an obvious."
01:11:49,780;01:11:50,140;"Yeah."
01:11:50,140;01:11:50,860;"Yeah."
01:11:50,860;01:11:50,860;"Yeah."
01:11:50,860;01:11:51,860;"You see the list."
01:11:51,860;01:11:52,700;"Yeah."
01:11:52,700;01:11:54,460;"Caution."
01:11:54,460;01:11:56,900;"I don't know."
01:11:56,900;01:11:59,340;"But I remember seeing him and thinking, oh, that was all right."
01:11:59,340;01:12:01,420;"Cause usually all those guys are all jackasses."
01:12:01,420;01:12:02,460;"You know, yeah, yeah."
01:12:02,460;01:12:03,300;"It's true."
01:12:03,300;01:12:04,980;"Half time show."
01:12:04,980;01:12:06,140;"Old coaches."
01:12:06,140;01:12:06,660;"The worst."
01:12:06,660;01:12:07,980;"The worst."
01:12:07,980;01:12:10,460;"Did how have they not figured that out?"
01:12:10,460;01:12:11,380;"I don't know."
01:12:11,380;01:12:13,940;"Everyone hates them, you know."
01:12:13,940;01:12:15,140;"- You don't even need anybody."
01:12:15,140;01:12:17,260;"Just show me like just binge me highlights"
01:12:17,260;01:12:18,100;"from the rest of the game."
01:12:18,100;01:12:18,940;"- Yeah."
01:12:18,940;01:12:19,780;"I mean, like think about what happened"
01:12:19,780;01:12:20,820;"to like Monday night football"
01:12:20,820;01:12:22,140;"where they rotate through people"
01:12:22,140;01:12:23,540;"'cause they just get murdered online."
01:12:23,540;01:12:26,060;"Why are we not doing the same for halftime?"
01:12:26,060;01:12:27,500;"- Yes."
01:12:27,500;01:12:30,540;"- Those guys are even worse than bugger."
01:12:30,540;01:12:32,220;"- Maybe they have like ironclad contracts"
01:12:32,220;01:12:33,260;"or something, I don't get it."
01:12:33,260;01:12:34,100;"- Maybe."
01:12:34,100;01:12:36,660;"- I don't know."
01:12:36,660;01:12:38,260;"- They should put us up there."
01:12:38,260;01:12:39,780;"- They should put them on the Ricky Williams contract."
01:12:39,780;01:12:40,900;"Here's a big signing bonus."
01:12:40,900;01:12:41,900;"You don't have these incentives."
01:12:41,900;01:12:43,220;"Cause you're fucking out."
01:12:43,220;01:12:44,460;"- Yeah, how you talking?"
01:12:44,460;01:12:48,260;"- Gotta make the brown brothers laugh."
01:12:48,260;01:12:50,820;"- Ooh, they should start with 17 people"
01:12:50,820;01:12:53,740;"and then let the fans vote off one each time."
01:12:53,740;01:12:56,180;"Each week."
01:12:56,180;01:12:57,900;"- That would be an absolute shit show."
01:12:57,900;01:12:59,060;"- Wouldn't it be awesome?"
01:12:59,060;01:13:01,340;"Like think of ideas like that."
01:13:01,340;01:13:03,900;"People would watch for that, right?"
01:13:03,900;01:13:04,740;"- Yeah."
01:13:04,740;01:13:05,980;"- I would. - I still think"
01:13:05,980;01:13:09,660;"what they should do is what the Premier League did"
01:13:09,660;01:13:15,660;"for a while in English soccer, where they would have a very small booth."
01:13:15,660;01:13:21,460;"And in it, like, because in England, they had like a multitude of channels"
01:13:21,460;01:13:24,580;"that were showing the same game. It was like a prime time game."
01:13:24,580;01:13:28,660;"And so you could switch each one like one had like no commentary and one had"
01:13:28,660;01:13:32,060;"the regular commentary and one would let us like follow a certain play around"
01:13:32,060;01:13:34,500;"the field for a certain amount of time and switch players."
01:13:34,500;01:13:39,100;"But one of them, every once in a while was they would get a fan of each team"
01:13:39,300;01:13:41,100;"and have them commentate the game together."
01:13:41,100;01:13:45,500;"And that was electric."
01:13:45,500;01:13:47,220;"Couple of daf Kuntz."
01:13:47,220;01:13:51,340;"Yeah, I imagine even just like do it with baseball."
01:13:51,340;01:13:57,580;"I know, but like I think part of the failing part of the appeal is British people are just so funny."
01:13:57,580;01:14:01,140;"It's true, but I guarantee you could you could find some funny."
01:14:01,140;01:14:02,460;"Yeah, that's true. Yeah."
01:14:02,460;01:14:04,100;"You asked us to do it."
01:14:04,100;01:14:07,100;"I think they have done that."
01:14:07,380;01:14:11,940;"Although, you know how like Amazon Prime got some games last year?"
01:14:11,940;01:14:12,660;"Oh, yeah."
01:14:12,660;01:14:16,020;"They would they would have like six different announcers"
01:14:16,020;01:14:17,820;"on the line stream."
01:14:17,820;01:14:20,420;"Dude, I watched an entire Patriots game in Spanish."
01:14:20,420;01:14:22,860;"It's fucking awesome."
01:14:22,860;01:14:25,140;"Didn't know what they were saying, but I was loving it."
01:14:25,140;01:14:26,660;"Didn't matter."
01:14:26,660;01:14:28,820;"I've heard it in German too."
01:14:28,820;01:14:30,420;"I've seen some streams in German."
01:14:30,420;01:14:31,780;"That's actually been really good."
01:14:31,780;01:14:34,500;"Yeah, because you could like pick out random words."
01:14:34,500;01:14:36,180;"So you kind of know what they're talking about."
01:14:36,380;01:14:37,580;"Yeah, you can get the gist."
01:14:37,580;01:14:38,740;"Yeah."
01:14:38,740;01:14:40,020;"They're very excitable."
01:14:40,020;01:14:40,860;"Yeah, yeah."
01:14:40,860;01:14:42,180;"And you can see when they're getting excited,"
01:14:42,180;01:14:44,140;"you can hear it in their voices, it's fucking great."
01:14:44,140;01:14:45,500;"Yeah, it's awesome."
01:14:45,500;01:14:47,460;"I used to, when I was playing like FIFA and stuff,"
01:14:47,460;01:14:50,940;"I used to put the commentary on Spanish."
01:14:50,940;01:14:51,840;"Yeah."
01:14:51,840;01:14:53,620;"Or a different language."
01:14:53,620;01:14:56,580;"Just to see if I would learn a different language."
01:14:56,580;01:14:57,420;"Spoiler alert."
01:14:57,420;01:14:58,260;"Did it work?"
01:14:58,260;01:14:59,260;"No."
01:14:59,260;01:15:03,180;"Bueno Stardice, me and you just--"
01:15:03,180;01:15:05,020;"What was that?"
01:15:05,020;01:15:06,020;"Nest 10, J."
01:15:06,020;01:15:07,020;"Go lasso."
01:15:07,020;01:15:10,020;"See, where'd be at in grass?"
01:15:10,020;01:15:11,020;"Yes."
01:15:11,020;01:15:12,020;"All right."
01:15:12,020;01:15:15,020;"Um, what were you talking about?"
01:15:15,020;01:15:20,020;"I interrupted you there."
01:15:20,020;01:15:21,020;"I don't think I was talking about anything."
01:15:21,020;01:15:23,020;"He had a once dead story."
01:15:23,020;01:15:26,020;"You were saying?"
01:15:26,020;01:15:32,340;"No, he's just going to say that the Patriots games when they played once that team, the average"
01:15:32,340;01:15:36,580;"score was 17 to 17, which seems pretty fucking even to me."
01:15:36,580;01:15:37,660;"Yeah."
01:15:37,660;01:15:39,180;"The fact they were fighting for against them."
01:15:39,180;01:15:44,820;"So so so if you had to pick out one factor that's causing the"
01:15:44,820;01:15:48,140;"Patriots to play so poorly in Miami, what do you think it is?"
01:15:48,140;01:15:51,020;"I see it's the early season."
01:15:51,020;01:15:52,380;"They always suck in the early season."
01:15:52,380;01:15:53,220;"Plus the heat."
01:15:53,220;01:15:53,780;"Yeah."
01:15:53,780;01:15:57,300;"Yeah, that's true because yeah, they always seem to like slowly ramp up the first"
01:15:57,300;01:15:57,740;"four weeks."
01:15:57,740;01:16:00,820;"So if they plan in the first four weeks, that's not usually."
01:16:00,820;01:16:09,140;"I'd love to see the, like, I guess, like the Patriots record in Miami by month or by temperature, you know, so bet."
01:16:09,140;01:16:15,220;"As I get started, like that home field dissipates. I mean, at least in the Brady era. Clearly."
01:16:15,220;01:16:17,220;"You know, you can find that Steve Brown."
01:16:17,220;01:16:23,620;"Um, that stats over storylines podcast. I bet they have it."
01:16:23,620;01:16:28,500;"No, it's actually go fuck yourself Steve Brown."
01:16:28,500;01:16:32,180;"- Oh, see if that exists right now."
01:16:32,180;01:16:34,280;"- And over in tuckusack.com."
01:16:34,280;01:16:37,980;"- Wasn't that your wedding website Greg?"
01:16:37,980;01:16:40,220;"(laughing)"
01:16:40,220;01:16:42,620;"- The picture is in good one Andy."
01:16:42,620;01:16:47,180;"- Like the Patriots in Miami."
01:16:47,180;01:16:49,540;"- Neither of those in Oakland."
01:16:49,540;01:16:52,980;"- September and October are five and four."
01:16:52,980;01:16:56,260;"So that blows your thing out of the water."
01:16:56,260;01:16:57,500;"- That was still not great."
01:16:57,500;01:16:58,340;"want to hear mine."
01:16:58,340;01:16:59,260;"Where are they in December?"
01:16:59,260;01:17:00,460;"Still winning record."
01:17:00,460;01:17:02,980;"Hang on, just December."
01:17:02,980;01:17:04,940;"Or November, December."
01:17:04,940;01:17:05,940;"In December, they are--"
01:17:05,940;01:17:09,100;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:17:09,100;01:17:10,420;"Oh, there's seven games."
01:17:10,420;01:17:12,700;"Anybody want to guess their records?"
01:17:12,700;01:17:14,100;"7-0."
01:17:14,100;01:17:16,500;"No."
01:17:16,500;01:17:17,660;"I have four."
01:17:17,660;01:17:21,420;"One in six in December in Miami."
01:17:21,420;01:17:21,980;"No."
01:17:21,980;01:17:23,100;"The pads are?"
01:17:23,100;01:17:23,980;"The Patriots are."
01:17:23,980;01:17:24,380;"Since now--"
01:17:24,380;01:17:26,180;"I guess it's not the EAT then there is."
01:17:26,180;01:17:36,340;"it's Steve. Oh, I mean, I can see my theory. Yeah. I think I usually don't buy into these"
01:17:36,340;01:17:45,660;"things with professionals, but I think it's like a mental like confidence type thing. Yeah,"
01:17:45,660;01:17:52,660;"right. You this like, I think going into games, thinking you can win is like big towards being"
01:17:52,660;01:17:55,980;"the Patriots, right? You saw it with the Ravens and they would always come in and you'd"
01:17:55,980;01:17:59,580;"be like, play them tough because you got the feeling that they knew they could win those"
01:17:59,580;01:18:03,820;"games. Whereas other teams would be like, like the Bills, they just roll over and let"
01:18:03,820;01:18:10,020;"the Pats rub their tummy, you know? And I think once you get a couple strung together,"
01:18:10,020;01:18:13,980;"we're now it's a thing the media is talking about. All players hear that shit and they're"
01:18:13,980;01:18:18,660;"like, you know what, we can win this game. We always, we always win this game. I think"
01:18:18,660;01:18:20,900;"it doesn't matter what we've done the rest of the season. This is a game we always end"
01:18:20,900;01:18:26,340;"of winning. Yeah, and you can say if you want in the media, but you deep down somewhere,"
01:18:26,340;01:18:30,260;"I think it affects their play of like maybe they're not as aggressive, maybe the play"
01:18:30,260;01:18:35,620;"calling slightly different, but I think that plays a factor."
01:18:35,620;01:18:40,060;"That's a good point, right? Because if you think about the three worst games we've watched"
01:18:40,060;01:18:47,060;"after this point is the two games in Miami and it's the one game in Denver. Yeah, true."
01:18:47,060;01:18:49,620;"By far, like those three have been stand out bad."
01:18:49,620;01:18:51,500;"The other ones have been at least closer."
01:18:51,500;01:18:53,540;"All that."
01:18:53,540;01:18:58,300;"- I just cracked the code, Bermuda Triangle."
01:18:58,300;01:19:01,860;"It's not re-outs in your head."
01:19:01,860;01:19:06,140;"- And on that note,"
01:19:06,140;01:19:09,500;"should we look forward to next weekend?"
01:19:09,500;01:19:11,340;"- Yeah, next weekend."
01:19:11,340;01:19:12,580;"- Oh, how's it going?"
01:19:12,580;01:19:14,100;"- Yeah, okay, who we got?"
01:19:14,100;01:19:14,940;"Who we got?"
01:19:14,940;01:19:17,400;"- Sunday, October 13th, 2002."
01:19:17,400;01:19:20,460;"This is at home."
01:19:20,460;01:19:21,380;"- I got it. - Of actually,"
01:19:21,380;01:19:22,420;"after two weeks on the road,"
01:19:22,420;01:19:24,100;"versus the Green Bay Packers."
01:19:24,100;01:19:28,420;"Steve Brown's favorite quarterback coming to town."
01:19:28,420;01:19:29,940;"- Really?"
01:19:29,940;01:19:31,340;"- This is correct."
01:19:31,340;01:19:32,180;"- Biggest inquiry."
01:19:32,180;01:19:34,020;"He's not my least civic quarterback."
01:19:34,020;01:19:35,620;"- This is in Green Bay?"
01:19:35,620;01:19:37,380;"- No, it's at home."
01:19:37,380;01:19:39,500;"- Wow, I have no recollection of this game."
01:19:39,500;01:19:40,340;"- I don't even know."
01:19:40,340;01:19:42,220;"- I might actually watch this one."
01:19:42,220;01:19:43,060;"- Okay."
01:19:43,060;01:19:45,060;"No, he won't."
01:19:45,060;01:19:48,060;"That's a little alert."
01:19:48,060;01:19:49,060;"Pranglers."
01:19:49,060;01:19:50,060;"Real."
01:19:50,060;01:19:51,060;"Comfortable."
01:19:51,060;01:19:52,060;"James."
01:19:52,060;01:19:54,060;"Is it a two day next week?"
01:19:54,060;01:19:57,060;"Find out if Greg actually watched the game or not."
01:19:57,060;01:20:00,060;"What else do I had other homework?"
01:20:00,060;01:20:02,060;"What was I going to do?"
01:20:02,060;01:20:05,060;"Something about the."
01:20:05,060;01:20:08,060;"Dolphins win record at home."
01:20:08,060;01:20:09,060;"Oh, yes."
01:20:09,060;01:20:10,060;"Yep."
01:20:10,060;01:20:12,060;"I'll report on that."
01:20:12,060;01:20:14,520;"Okay, I hope so I can't wait"
01:20:14,520;01:20:21,940;"All right, I can't either Andy I'm also very excited. Yeah, no, I look forward to that with beta breath"
01:20:21,940;01:20:30,260;"I'm sure you will come through and you will actually do the research and the homework and watch this football game all in a week"
01:20:30,260;01:20:33,740;"I have faith in you"
01:20:33,740;01:20:36,220;"Can't tell if you're fucking with me"
01:20:36,220;01:20:38,900;"That's the idea"
01:20:39,620;01:20:43,620;"I could hear you smiling when you said that."
01:20:43,620;01:20:46,620;"I could hear your smile."
01:20:46,620;01:20:49,620;"I don't know what you're talking about."
01:20:49,620;01:20:51,620;"It's more like a smile."
01:20:51,620;01:20:52,620;"Yeah, I know that."
01:20:52,620;01:20:56,620;"I know that fucking sound when I hear it."
01:20:56,620;01:21:00,620;"Alright, I love you boys."
01:21:00,620;01:21:02,620;"Hey, Elayda."

00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,640;"I am not your mother."
00:18,640;00:27,360;"All right, welcome back to the Patreons Dynasty podcast."
00:27,360;00:36,640;"2003 season, we're making our way through Steve Brown. We are week 11 of 17. So what's that percentage wise?"
00:36,640;00:40,880;"Half. 11/17, so I don't think so."
00:40,880;00:48,880;"Half-ish, we're half-ish way through the 2003 season."
00:48,880;00:54,560;"Pays have just come off their bi-week and are facing at home the Dallas Cowboys."
00:56,800;00:58,240;"Why is that significant, Steven?"
00:58,240;01:04,920;"So I have been reading which I know shocking."
01:04,920;01:07,400;"I was wondering why you you had a pain to face."
01:07,400;01:08,200;"Yeah."
01:08,200;01:08,680;"Joining us."
01:08,680;01:12,600;"I, uh, I had a buddy give me that Patriots dynasty book."
01:12,600;01:13,360;"Oh, yeah."
01:13,360;01:14,680;"This one."
01:14,680;01:15,640;"You mentioned it."
01:15,640;01:16,120;"Yeah."
01:16,120;01:16,480;"Yeah."
01:16,480;01:18,640;"This is named Jeff something."
01:18,640;01:21,280;"Jeff Benedict highly recommended."
01:21,280;01:22,240;"Good book."
01:22,240;01:26,200;"I never like it, but apparently he wrote a Tiger Woods book."
01:26,480;01:27,320;"No, okay."
01:27,320;01:33,960;"Yeah, for never hearing the guy, he clearly got a ton of access."
01:33,960;01:35,320;"Yeah. Yeah."
01:35,320;01:40,080;"I'm not only like, I don't know, a quarter away through it, but it does detail goes"
01:40,080;01:45,000;"real deep. And I learned a ton of stuff about RKK getting the team and all that"
01:45,000;01:50,960;"shit and the rift with build Parcels and how and like how that all went down."
01:50,960;01:51,560;"Yes."
01:51,560;01:56,040;"So I'm glad I read that before I watch this game. Otherwise, I've been like, Oh, yeah,"
01:56,040;02:00,040;"I used to coach for us, but there's a ton of animosity there."
02:00,040;02:03,400;"And I actually had already hated Parcells."
02:03,400;02:04,240;"- Yeah."
02:04,240;02:07,720;"- 'Cause I blame him for stealing Curtis Martin."
02:07,720;02:11,400;"- Right, right, yeah, that he has now shifted, right?"
02:11,400;02:12,920;"- Right, right, so burning hatred,"
02:12,920;02:15,360;"I have her Curtis Martin, focus solely on Parcells,"
02:15,360;02:18,000;"then I read that book and I hate him even more."
02:18,000;02:22,760;"When I saw that he was coaching the cowboys at this time,"
02:22,760;02:26,360;"which I'm not forgotten, but sort of forgotten."
02:26,360;02:27,660;"- Yeah."
02:27,660;02:29,680;"- I was a little, I got up for it."
02:29,680;02:31,360;"I was a little juiced."
02:31,360;02:32,800;"- Yeah, yeah."
02:32,800;02:36,940;"You and the entire ESPN crew was juiced"
02:36,940;02:41,940;"because my first note on this game was in all caps,"
02:41,940;02:43,520;"Parcel's Versbell check."
02:43,520;02:46,120;"They didn't say hello before the game."
02:46,120;02:50,000;"- They showed that clip of them making eye contact"
02:50,000;02:50,840;"across the field."
02:50,840;02:56,320;"Very briefly. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah throughout the game on a regular basis"
02:56,320;03:01,760;"And then they're like what once it got toward the end of the game like will they shake hands after the game?"
03:01,760;03:06,880;"Let's go down to Susie Colder, and she's like, I don't know. Let's find out. I'm sure we'll have cameras on it"
03:06,880;03:14,040;"For the record spoiler alert they did they had like a big long hug and everything. Yeah"
03:14,040;03:18,920;"The best was the Eric man, Jeannie snub. I love that one. Yeah, that was great"
03:20,360;03:23,280;"We'll get also underrated as the McDaniel's one. Oh"
03:23,280;03:29,920;"Yeah, yeah, when McDaniel's beat Bella check and was like doing a victory lap around the stadium"
03:29,920;03:32,440;"Instead of giving hand trick. That was a good one"
03:32,440;03:38,120;"Surprisingly well in his ass back. Yeah, so I was trying to come up with a name for this game"
03:38,120;03:45,120;"I was gonna like the bill bowl or the battle of the bells or I don't do you have any suggestions for me?"
03:45,120;03:49,520;"I don't know we sort of stuck tuning in a locker. Oh"
03:49,520;03:59,180;"Oh, something about the tuna. That's pretty good. Yeah. Oh, there was a sign that reminds me I wrote this down because I thought that's I was good."
03:59,180;04:04,620;"The signs I can the tuna and then underneath and little there's the chicken of the sea."
04:04,620;04:08,620;"[laughter]"
04:08,620;04:10,220;"The tagline made it."
04:10,220;04:11,080;"Yep."
04:11,080;04:12,320;"He is a chicken."
04:12,320;04:13,880;"Chicken of the sea. Yeah, I agree."
04:13,880;04:15,580;"He created that for the Super Bowl."
04:15,580;04:18,260;"Yep. Didn't even fly home with the team."
04:18,260;04:20,000;"Couldn't shop for the groceries."
04:20,000;04:21,560;"And the famous line went."
04:21,560;04:22,880;"That's correct."
04:22,880;04:30,640;"And the commentators are falling over each other to try and blow Jerry Jones for letting him have total control of their franchise."
04:30,640;04:39,520;"They even interviewed Michael Irvin to prove the fact that he had complete control, which, you know, good for him, but he didn't."
04:39,520;04:41,160;"I didn't have the Cowboys finish up this year."
04:41,160;04:43,880;"They finished 10 and 6 and lost in the wild card."
04:43,880;04:46,640;"And then his old career at Dallas."
04:46,640;04:47,560;"How did he do there?"
04:47,560;04:52,720;"That was about it. It wasn't much more. I don't think. Let's"
04:52,720;04:56,560;"stat check that real quick. Bill Parcelle's yet 10 and 6 this"
04:56,560;05:06,000;"season, 2003. 6 and 10, 9 and 7, 9 and 7. And that was his last NFL"
05:06,000;05:11,120;"head coaching. So he was 64. Let me see now 34 and 30 as a head"
05:11,120;05:17,480;"coach. Cool. Yeah. So I put him in salary cap purgatory."
05:17,480;05:24,120;"quite possibly. I mean, that was the thing about Parcels. I mean, it was a good code from the 80s."
05:24,120;05:28,280;"Yeah. We just couldn't do it in the modern game. Pretty salary cap, right? Yeah. And so when,"
05:28,280;05:32,120;"yeah, that was in the book, wasn't it? When RKK came in and was like, which they want to"
05:32,120;05:35,480;"re-sign Bruce Armstrong, they're just like, well, we just give him a contract and like, well, no,"
05:35,480;05:40,440;"we can't do that anymore. We actually have to like figure out how much he's worth of our salary"
05:40,440;05:41,440;"guy because I don't give a shit."
05:41,440;05:46,240;"So I got this little, little pre me remembering, you know,"
05:46,240;05:48,960;"yeah, like my entire life has been a thing, but I didn't realize"
05:48,960;05:54,200;"that it had sort of started in like 2000 or late 90s, right?"
05:54,200;05:55,960;"That sort of timeframe."
05:55,960;05:56,360;"Yes."
05:56,360;05:56,720;"Yeah."
05:56,720;05:59,640;"It was right around the time the craft bought the Patriots."
05:59,640;06:02,200;"Which is very late 90s."
06:02,200;06:05,160;"I thought it'd been in the sense like, I don't know."
06:05,160;06:09,080;"Early 90s are like, since I've been around, but I guess not."
06:09,520;06:11,440;"No, no, it's been around for."
06:11,440;06:16,400;"Ian, it's about to come in the pages favor again when this coming season."
06:16,400;06:19,360;"It's drops by 15%."
06:19,360;06:22,040;"Everyone has to cut a bunch of really good players and the pages are sitting there"
06:22,040;06:23,080;"with a ton of cap space."
06:23,080;06:23,720;"Yep."
06:23,720;06:25,400;"Chuck is in chess, baby."
06:25,400;06:26,200;"That's right."
06:26,200;06:29,400;"The bill of Picellas is spending his little heart out right now."
06:29,400;06:29,880;"Yeah, right."
06:29,880;06:31,080;"Or he would be."
06:31,080;06:37,880;"Apparently, according to Wikipedia, he is a courtesy consultant with the Cleveland"
06:37,880;06:38,440;"Browns."
06:38,680;06:39,520;"I don't know what that means."
06:39,520;06:40,440;"What?"
06:40,440;06:46,280;"Since 2014, never hear his name come up, but I guess the courtesy"
06:46,280;06:46,840;"consultant."
06:46,840;06:47,800;"They a lot."
06:47,800;06:49,560;"They didn't win one game in two years."
06:49,560;06:50,080;"Right."
06:50,080;06:50,680;"Well, yeah."
06:50,680;06:56,400;"Um, I think I think we also can't miss the opportunity to mention"
06:56,400;07:00,080;"that Bill Parcels is also not named Bill."
07:00,080;07:02,160;"He is doing Charles Parcels."
07:02,160;07:03,040;"Oh, yeah."
07:03,040;07:06,040;"Everybody calls him Bill because why the fuck not?"
07:06,040;07:07,320;"I don't even remember why."
07:08,040;07:09,040;"I'm about that."
07:09,040;07:11,860;"Let's say it's his father, Charles, Chubby Parcells."
07:11,860;07:15,460;"With his tas like nickname was Chubby."
07:15,460;07:16,460;"Chubby."
07:16,460;07:20,400;"I bet he has a real asshole to bill and that's why he was an asshole to everybody else."
07:20,400;07:22,300;"Yeah, just like our dad does."
07:22,300;07:24,700;"He loves to deep down."
07:24,700;07:25,700;"It's our Catholic."
07:25,700;07:26,700;"Yeah."
07:26,700;07:32,080;"We'll never tell you he loves you, but you know, ish sometimes when he's drunk that he"
07:32,080;07:33,080;"loves you."
07:33,080;07:34,080;"Yeah."
07:34,080;07:37,580;"Oh, so while at high school, he was routinely mistaken for another boy named Bill as he"
07:37,580;07:41,340;"always disliked his given name of Dwayne, he decided to adopt Bill as his nickname."
07:41,340;07:44,620;"The rock is like, bro, that's the best you could do."
07:44,620;07:46,540;"Right? I went with the rock."
07:46,540;07:50,300;"Bill, come on, dude."
07:50,300;07:53,980;"Although if you're taking a life lesson from this, don't name a kid Dwayne because they're going"
07:53,980;07:56,860;"to hate it and they're going to change. They're going to hate it so much. They're going to call"
07:56,860;07:57,980;"themselves something else."
07:57,980;08:01,660;"That's true. I can't even think of one Dwayne that I'm like, yeah, that guy is sweet."
08:02,540;08:06,580;"Now, Dwayne Almond. Yeah, not that sweet. Almond."
08:06,580;08:08,940;"Almond, Jesus, there's no deal in that. Almond."
08:08,940;08:18,740;"Yeah. Another bill Parcel, Dwayne Parcel's fact that I found"
08:18,740;08:23,460;"interesting that they shared in this was that his team had only"
08:23,460;08:31,180;"been shut out once before this 2003 season in 1993, which I"
08:31,180;08:33,580;"I believe that was with the Patriots."
08:33,580;08:34,780;"Is that right?"
08:34,780;08:35,740;"No."
08:35,740;08:36,700;"Back job."
08:36,700;08:37,500;"Sounds about it."
08:37,500;08:39,900;"2000, 1993."
08:39,900;08:41,620;"Yeah, it was his first year with the Patriots"
08:41,620;08:45,100;"when they were kind of crapping his dragon amount of that."
08:45,100;08:51,900;"They would this season be shot out twice."
08:51,900;08:53,300;"Including this game."
08:53,300;08:55,140;"Including this game."
08:55,140;08:58,060;"A rolling 12-0."
08:58,060;09:00,120;"- Yep, nice little baseball score"
09:00,120;09:02,620;"to break up the football season."
09:02,620;09:05,220;"- Do you want to give a watchability on this?"
09:05,220;09:06,800;"- Oh yeah, we should, shouldn't we?"
09:06,800;09:15,740;"- Oh, I mean, the game itself, not amazing"
09:15,740;09:20,060;"from like an offensive output,"
09:20,060;09:22,640;"not a lot of scoring, not a lot of big plays."
09:22,640;09:25,880;"- Brady, 15 of 34, 212 yards,"
09:25,880;09:29,880;"which like had three quarters of those came on three plays."
09:29,880;09:30,680;"Yeah. Yeah."
09:30,680;09:32,280;"Like 200 of those yards came on like two."
09:32,280;09:34,780;"No CDs, no interceptions."
09:34,780;09:36,280;"Right."
09:36,280;09:41,080;"But then show a little Quincy Carter's numbers."
09:41,080;09:42,680;"Well, the Quincy Cowboys."
09:42,680;09:44,480;"Quincy fucking Carter."
09:44,480;09:51,880;"20 of 36 to 10 three interceptions and no touchdown spoiler alert."
09:51,880;09:52,880;"Yeah."
09:52,880;09:54,380;"It was actually a touchdown scored."
09:54,380;09:57,580;"Don't let the school score fool. Yes. Yeah."
09:57,580;10:00,260;"This point blocked this game was all over the place. Yeah."
10:00,260;10:03,020;"So like we said, it ended 12."
10:03,020;10:05,660;"Nothing Patriots, but that was not all field goals."
10:05,660;10:07,980;"Antoine Smith scored a touchdown the second quarter,"
10:07,980;10:11,220;"but Adam Vittieri had his extra point blocked."
10:11,220;10:13,860;"He didn't even miss it straight up blocked,"
10:13,860;10:18,300;"kicked it into the armpit of the oncoming defender from the two."
10:18,300;10:22,660;"Must be clear. Yeah. Yeah. This was a chip shot that he got blocked."
10:23,660;10:26,060;"But then still kick two other field goals. So whatever."
10:26,060;10:28,900;"Which were also chip shots."
10:28,900;10:35,620;"Yeah. So the scoring was a 23 yard field goal, a two yard rush,"
10:35,620;10:37,140;"and a 26 yard field goal."
10:37,140;10:41,580;"I'm still going to give this a two and a half out of six."
10:41,580;10:43,260;"That's generous."
10:43,260;10:46,380;"I don't think because I think defensively it was great game to watch."
10:46,380;10:50,060;"And watching Bill Picell get more and more frustrated that"
10:51,500;10:53,380;"His offense couldn't do anything."
10:53,380;10:57,860;"And like the Patriots were basically up nine, nothing for most of the game."
10:57,860;11:02,260;"They scored that last field goal just after the two minute warning at the end of the game."
11:02,260;11:04,580;"After a Quincy Carter interception."
11:04,580;11:05,420;"Right."
11:05,420;11:11,820;"And and just like watching it and and then also comparing that to listening to the"
11:11,820;11:20,020;"the commentators try as hard as they could to be like Quincy Carter, not that bad."
11:20,020;11:25,940;"a quarterback. It's not even true. They thought he was fucking awesome. I gave this like a one"
11:25,940;11:32,580;"Super Bowl most Super Bowl in an AC Championship just from the Parcels factory. If Parcels was"
11:32,580;11:40,740;"not part of this game, it's like an AC Championship at all alone. It was a slog and the commentators were"
11:40,740;11:48,100;"awful. Yeah, I enjoyed them. No, this is the back of the day when they did the Three Man booth,"
11:48,100;11:51,900;"which no one's done that before and no one's done that since good."
11:51,900;11:53,500;"It's a fucking terrible idea."
11:53,500;11:54,820;"I disagree."
11:54,820;11:55,500;"I think they were good."
11:55,500;11:57,980;"Thaisman, Mike Patrick and Paul Maguire."
11:57,980;12:00,820;"Paul Maguire was fucking awful."
12:00,820;12:04,460;"I can never tell the difference between Paul Maguire and Mike Patrick, to be honest."
12:04,460;12:05,420;"They sound the same to me."
12:05,420;12:07,780;"So it sound like a two man, both to me."
12:07,780;12:09,620;"It was so fucking bad."
12:09,620;12:11,900;"And I think Thaisman, we've talked about before."
12:11,900;12:13,860;"Thaisman's kind of that like original."
12:13,860;12:16,820;"Easy original Tony Romo."
12:17,140;12:19,740;"The ex quarterback who actually like knows what he's talking about."
12:19,740;12:20,140;"Okay."
12:20,140;12:20,860;"Yeah."
12:20,860;12:22,420;"So I like listening."
12:22,420;12:23,660;"Yeah, they were so bad."
12:23,660;12:26,020;"I just agree."
12:26,020;12:32,340;"I'll get some quotes while we, uh, while we figure it out, you know, yeah."
12:32,340;12:32,580;"Right."
12:32,580;12:40,380;"There was one thing that did make the game a little better and gave me hope for the future."
12:40,380;12:41,700;"Oh, what was that?"
12:41,700;12:46,180;"Uh, they had a commercial in it for HD."
12:46,180;12:48,100;"Oh, do they really?"
12:48,100;12:48,700;"I missed that."
12:48,700;12:51,460;"Yeah, they had a shot of the camera truck."
12:51,460;12:52,780;"We inside the camera truck."
12:52,780;12:53,380;"Oh, yeah."
12:53,380;12:53,660;"Yeah."
12:53,660;12:55,980;"Like get an HD TV."
12:55,980;12:57,540;"You can see what we see."
12:57,540;12:57,940;"And I--"
12:57,940;12:58,940;"Oh, that's what they were talking"
12:58,940;13:00,660;"because I missed the beginning of that."
13:00,660;13:02,940;"And they kept going on and on about how--"
13:02,940;13:03,940;"well, I've got one now."
13:03,940;13:05,380;"So maybe I'll get a second."
13:05,380;13:08,620;"Yeah, that must be nice."
13:08,620;13:10,540;"OK, here you go."
13:10,540;13:14,060;"An errant pass hits a screen play."
13:14,060;13:15,580;"It hits the page's guy in the head."
13:15,580;13:16,020;"Yeah."
13:16,020;13:18,940;"It's a header. It's no good. It's a soccer game."
13:18,940;13:21,060;"Yeah, that was pretty bad."
13:21,060;13:23,460;"Was he kicking a field goal with his fucking head?"
13:23,460;13:26,020;"Yeah, that's not how soccer works at all."
13:26,020;13:28,020;"Yeah, no, no good in soccer."
13:28,020;13:29,620;"There is not that."
13:29,620;13:32,220;"But I mean, that's a pretty typical American thing, right?"
13:32,220;13:34,740;"That one's soccer. That's like a rite of passage."
13:34,740;13:38,260;"It's like fourth in July and not knowing the rules."
13:38,260;13:41,420;"They use they use horse collar three times"
13:41,420;13:44,900;"by the seven minutes left in the second in the first half."
13:45,540;13:49,120;"He's fucking horse collar, horse collar, horse collar, horse collar, horse collar,"
13:49,120;13:52,140;"horse collar, this is before horse collar was a penalty."
13:52,140;13:55,800;"Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah."
13:55,800;13:59,320;"Look at Quincy Carter read the blitz. It's a four man rush."
13:59,320;14:03,200;"It was a late blitz. They rush the reason."
14:03,200;14:04,480;"Was a four fucking hand-rabbit."
14:04,480;14:07,000;"It was a stunt. It was a delayed blitz."
14:07,000;14:09,880;"Willie McGinnis was all over the field."
14:09,880;14:14,600;"No, then they talk about Charlie White saying, you know,"
14:14,600;14:17,760;"Yeah, this is over coaching because we have a lot of injuries."
14:17,760;14:20,960;"And so, you know, you just kind of like keep a simple leg out there and play it."
14:20,960;14:23,840;"Then they cut to the Irving on the sideline."
14:23,840;14:29,400;"And he's like, Oh yeah, I told the receiver to go into the court back"
14:29,400;14:31,280;"and pour air under the ball."
14:31,280;14:32,960;"And they're like, wow, just like Brady does."
14:32,960;14:33,440;"Yeah."
14:33,440;14:33,840;"Wow."
14:33,840;14:34,280;"Wow."
14:34,280;14:35,120;"Oh, great."
14:35,120;14:35,680;"Oh, great."
14:35,680;14:35,920;"Just."
14:35,920;14:41,240;"And if I go like a lover, though, it's like, listen, you guys are fucking doing this wrong."
14:41,240;14:42,440;"Here's what you got to do."
14:42,440;14:44,240;"It's like, bro, you don't play no more."
14:44,240;14:47,240;"They use the word wonder kid."
14:47,240;14:49,720;"They did."
14:49,720;14:52,480;"Yeah, just automatic fuck you."
14:52,480;14:55,600;"Wonder kid."
14:55,600;14:56,240;"Get fucked."
14:56,240;14:57,320;"Look what I've created."
14:57,320;14:58,760;"I'm enjoying this."
14:58,760;15:02,800;"They said Tom Brady struggled last year because they didn't make the playoffs."
15:02,800;15:05,640;"I'm pretty sure he led the NFL in passing touchdowns."
15:05,640;15:07,320;"He did fucking dicks."
15:07,320;15:10,120;"I think he also struggled, but yeah."
15:10,120;15:13,920;"2002 was not his best year."
15:13,920;15:17,320;"And just like the constant Quincy Carter dick sucking."
15:17,320;15:18,600;"There was a lot of that."
15:18,600;15:20,240;"It was egregious."
15:20,240;15:22,960;"They wanted him to be good so badly."
15:22,960;15:26,320;"But he were trying to will him into at least mediocrity."
15:26,320;15:28,560;"And they could say, yeah, because they kept talking about,"
15:28,560;15:30,120;"let's go in a Quincy car."
15:30,120;15:32,360;"This is a good segue, I think."
15:32,360;15:36,840;"Because for those of you like me who completely forgot about him,"
15:36,840;15:42,600;"he was the starting quarterback for this Cowboys team."
15:42,600;15:45,340;"He's very forgettable for a few years."
15:45,340;15:47,580;"I had to look it up and I remember it."
15:47,580;15:48,660;"Yeah, we played for it."
15:48,660;15:51,660;"I found the worst one before we go deep in Quincy Carter."
15:51,660;15:53,580;"I'm going to bring it back for one last time."
15:53,580;15:54,220;"Give it to me."
15:54,220;15:58,540;"The referee is the one who makes this call of the penalty."
15:58,540;16:01,420;"No fucking shit, Pomegoire."
16:01,420;16:02,780;"Who else is going to make the call?"
16:02,780;16:04,700;"Is the coach going to throw the penalty flag?"
16:04,700;16:07,500;"You know, it's like talking about like the lime and all the lines."
16:07,500;16:08,980;"Point wins a game."
16:08,980;16:11,340;"No, who else is going to make the call?"
16:11,740;16:15,980;"I think he's talking about throwing the flag actually calling the penalty."
16:15,980;16:18,660;"No, he's one of the other referees."
16:18,660;16:22,180;"He meant to say it was like the head judge, the guy all the way in the back"
16:22,180;16:26,140;"is the one who made the holding call, but he just said the referee is the one who makes a call."
16:26,140;16:28,260;"Shit, buddy."
16:28,260;16:31,500;"Good."
16:31,500;16:32,340;"I love this."
16:32,340;16:33,220;"This is great."
16:33,220;16:34,220;"Yeah."
16:34,220;16:40,220;"Speaking of speaking of assholes, Quincy Carter played for the Cowboys for three seasons."
16:41,620;16:43,780;"This is the only season he started all 16 games."
16:43,780;16:48,000;"He started eight games in 2001, seven games in 2002."
16:48,000;16:52,160;"And I think he got benched in 2002 for somebody"
16:52,160;16:54,700;"who's name I didn't recognize, Hutchinson or something like that."
16:54,700;16:56,260;"They talked about."
16:56,260;16:58,360;"Yeah, I didn't care."
16:58,360;17:04,400;"And they're like, oh, he's actually really improved from last year."
17:04,400;17:06,100;"He's cutting down his mistakes."
17:06,100;17:07,640;"So I looked it up this season."
17:07,640;17:11,920;"he would throw 17 touchdowns, 21 interceptions."
17:11,920;17:13,400;"Yeah."
17:13,400;17:16,680;"So not really cutting down mistakes, but in the season before,"
17:16,680;17:21,480;"it, that he didn't actually in his first three seasons, he never"
17:21,480;17:23,360;"threw more touchdowns than interceptions."
17:23,360;17:27,920;"He was five and seven, then seven and eight, and then 17 and 21 in those three"
17:27,920;17:28,920;"seasons."
17:28,920;17:32,200;"And then he played a few games, he played three games with the Jets and was"
17:32,200;17:35,240;"three touchdowns, a one interception, which he played with the Jets."
17:35,920;17:38,620;"Yeah, and 2004 played a couple of games."
17:38,620;17:40,760;"So we may see him again."
17:40,760;17:41,460;"Who knows?"
17:41,460;17:44,160;"We'll have to find that next season."
17:44,160;17:46,060;"I love so."
17:46,060;17:46,800;"So do I."
17:46,800;17:52,580;"Um, yeah, they were the commentators were like, just their"
17:52,580;17:58,380;"draw was dropped by the fact that he was an agile quarterback, which this"
17:58,380;17:59,940;"isn't like the first one we've ever seen."
17:59,940;18:00,480;"No, yeah."
18:00,480;18:03,220;"We've had Michael Vick in the league for a few years now, right?"
18:03,220;18:05,120;"So they compared him to McNabb."
18:05,680;18:08,860;"Yeah. He was not McNabb."
18:08,860;18:13,900;"But yeah, I don't remember which commentator was, but they were like,"
18:13,900;18:18,720;"he threw some like four yard pass on the run, like back across his body."
18:18,720;18:22,500;"And like, this guy could throw a perfect spiral at a full sprint."
18:22,500;18:23,860;"Like, okay."
18:23,860;18:28,600;"And now it's like you have to be Patrick Mahomes throwing"
18:28,600;18:31,980;"underarm, no look passes to get that sort of feeling."
18:31,980;18:35,300;"Well, there was, there was Joe Eisen saying 17 for 30."
18:35,300;18:36,140;"It's pretty good."
18:36,140;18:38,820;"- That's a direct quote."
18:38,820;18:41,180;"- Yeah, well, for Quincy Carter, it probably was."
18:41,180;18:42,980;"- Yeah, it was a good point."
18:42,980;18:44,040;"I mean, that's not pretty good though."
18:44,040;18:46,060;"That's relatively good."
18:46,060;18:47,380;"- Well, okay, that's fair."
18:47,380;18:52,380;"His career completion percentage was 56 and a half percent."
18:52,380;18:55,660;"So 17 for what was it, 30?"
18:55,660;18:56,500;"- Limited."
18:56,500;18:57,420;"- That's above that."
18:57,420;18:59,640;"So that's pretty good."
18:59,640;19:03,940;"So that's not great."
19:03,940;19:10,600;"Um, but they were trying to make this work and it was like they were hanging in there"
19:10,600;19:13,540;"until when did he start throwing his action cell?"
19:13,540;19:22,780;"The third quarter end of the third quarter when, um, like the Dallas, the, the, the"
19:22,780;19:27,900;"way this game went was, uh, Dallas had the number one ranked defense in the league."
19:27,900;19:29,220;"Their defense was legit."
19:29,220;19:31,020;"Even though they didn't have a ton of names."
19:31,020;19:35,460;"No, there was a lot of names, but they held the pages and check for the most part except for"
19:35,460;19:39,040;"when they would bring everybody on the blitz and"
19:39,040;19:44,880;"Brady would read it every time and would complete a long pass and they did it twice and Brady hit"
19:44,880;19:48,780;"Branch deep for one. Yeah"
19:48,780;19:58,820;"That was a huge loud that was a pick that was like 15 yards downfield. It was pretty pretty egregious and the commenters like wow"
19:59,980;20:01,580;"- Oh, he's so open."
20:01,580;20:02,900;"- What a great play."
20:02,900;20:04,780;"What a great play design."
20:04,780;20:07,660;"Like it's an illegal play design, but yes, it was."
20:07,660;20:11,300;"But then the other one was they tried it again."
20:11,300;20:15,020;"I think the next quarter and Bray had Gibbons"
20:15,020;20:16,580;"just running straight down the middle of fields."
20:16,580;20:17,580;"And he was covering Bray's like,"
20:17,580;20:19,700;"fuck, I'm gonna truck us straight up in the air."
20:19,700;20:21,780;"And Gibbons had to like stop and come back for it"
20:21,780;20:22,620;"and made the catch."
20:22,620;20:28,180;"That's what set up the an ant"
20:28,180;20:33,180;"But Dallas kind of did nothing."
20:33,180;20:39,280;"Their whole game plan, I think, on the season was to rely on that great defense, run the"
20:39,280;20:43,600;"ball down people's throats with their massive offensive line."
20:43,600;20:48,200;"And that running back with the hell is a running back's name."
20:48,200;20:49,200;"Troy Hambrick."
20:49,200;20:50,200;"Great."
20:50,200;20:57,220;"Troy Hambrick, yeah, which Hambrick just sounds like a fantastic name for not a running back."
20:57,220;21:05,180;"If he was a fullback or like a road grading tight end, like the, oh, you just got a hand"
21:05,180;21:06,180;"brick."
21:06,180;21:07,860;"You can't run it with hand brick."
21:07,860;21:08,860;"Right."
21:08,860;21:09,860;"Just a brick of hand."
21:09,860;21:10,860;"Like the wall."
21:10,860;21:11,860;"Right."
21:11,860;21:12,860;"Yeah."
21:12,860;21:14,420;"I agree."
21:14,420;21:19,020;"But apparently I would say that he angered people in Dallas that season because he was"
21:19,020;21:23,500;"bitching about not getting enough playing time behind Emmett Smith."
21:23,500;21:25,500;"I don't think he was crap."
21:25,500;21:27,500;"Is Emmett Smith and Tom Brady's careers cross?"
21:27,500;21:28,500;"They do."
21:28,500;21:31,500;"Emmett Smith, they said this season was playing in Arizona."
21:31,500;21:33,500;"I remember him finishing there."
21:33,500;21:34,500;"Huh."
21:34,500;21:35,500;"I did not know that."
21:35,500;21:37,500;"I thought I was put those two as two separate."
21:37,500;21:40,500;"Did Michael Irvin and Tom Brady's careers cross?"
21:40,500;21:42,500;"Probably briefly."
21:42,500;21:44,500;"Let's see."
21:44,500;21:47,500;"Emmett Smith played until 2004."
21:47,500;21:48,500;"Played."
21:48,500;21:59,180;"Let's see. Emmett Smith played until 2004, played 03 and 04 with the Cardinals. Michael"
21:59,180;22:08,300;"Irvin. Michael Irvin's last season was 1999, so no. Just barely missed."
22:08,300;22:12,940;"It's crazy that Smith played five more years in my club."
22:12,940;22:17,220;"Yeah, especially as a running back too. That's pretty unheard of to have that long of a"
22:17,220;22:22,980;"career as a running back. I mean, good for him. Yeah, but Troy"
22:22,980;22:27,620;"Hambrick, the leading rusher on this team with a whopping 972 yards."
22:27,620;22:32,740;"And yet somehow this team went 10 and six and like they were saying"
22:32,740;22:36,900;"the whole their whole game plan was to just like grind it out on"
22:36,900;22:41,460;"offense and then just like suffocate you on defense, which is why"
22:41,860;22:50,500;"They had the first ranked defense in yards and second ranked in points against, but they had the"
22:50,500;22:56,980;"15th ranked defense in your offense in yards and 21st ranked offense in points four."
22:56,980;23:01,940;"Yeah, maybe if the Patriots had had the 20 in 19 defense in the 2020 offense,"
23:01,940;23:06,260;"I mean, I think that formula can work. That's kind of an old school formula, and it seems to"
23:06,260;23:10,020;"where the Patriots were trying to go just with the people they have, you know?"
23:10,020;23:11,020;"Yeah."
23:11,020;23:16,660;"But they didn't run Carter enough either to make that really effective, you know?"
23:16,660;23:27,140;"Yeah, I'm surprised that they didn't use him as a running threat because he did kind of"
23:27,140;23:31,780;"take off a couple times and picked up good yards with his feet, but he was mostly kind"
23:31,780;23:36,180;"of trying to stay in the pocket. And they showed some stat like half or two of the game where"
23:36,180;23:43,540;"when he's in the pocket, he was throwing touchdowns and some interceptions, but when he's out of the"
23:43,540;23:49,780;"pocket, he's only throwing interceptions. So yeah, I guess he was like, and they kept talking about"
23:49,780;23:55,860;"like how much he was studying being a quarterback in like all of this stuff. Yeah, I got there just"
23:55,860;24:01,820;"just trying to snap hits him in the hands and bounces off his hand and goes over his head"
24:01,820;24:03,820;"and I was like, oh, what a bad snap."
24:03,820;24:05,980;"I'm going to hit him right in the head."
24:05,980;24:08,020;"You're fired right back there, Adams."
24:08,020;24:09,460;"Like, I think that's the idea."
24:09,460;24:11,060;"But OK."
24:11,060;24:13,100;"But then he uses athleticism."
24:13,100;24:16,260;"Yeah, throw it in completion."
24:16,260;24:19,500;"To throw it in completion to go three and out."
24:19,500;24:25,460;"Yeah, but this story of this Cowboys team was they allowed 16 points per game."
24:25,460;24:27,660;"which is fucking fantastic."
24:27,660;24:28,660;"Yeah."
24:28,660;24:30,660;"They scored an average of 18 points a game."
24:30,660;24:32,660;"They were shut out twice in the season."
24:32,660;24:37,360;"And even though their defense held six, in six games,"
24:37,360;24:39,360;"they held teams to seven or less points,"
24:39,360;24:41,360;"which is fucking impressive."
24:41,360;24:43,860;"They still won 10 and six."
24:43,860;24:44,660;"No."
24:44,660;24:45,860;"I mean, they didn't have any big names."
24:45,860;24:47,860;"They was Roy Williams in safety."
24:47,860;24:51,660;"He was one of the linebackers I recognized,"
24:51,660;24:52,660;"but that was kind of hit."
24:52,660;24:53,160;"Yeah."
24:53,160;24:57,000;"So they had, let's see, the pro bowlers on defense"
24:57,000;25:01,300;"were Dexter Coakley, LaRoy Glover on the defensive line"
25:01,300;25:03,120;"and safety Roy Williams."
25:03,120;25:08,160;"They also had, I think he was a rookie,"
25:08,160;25:11,120;"Terrence Newman at cornerback."
25:11,120;25:14,360;"- He was a rookie, yeah, he was a starting, I don't think."
25:14,360;25:16,640;"- Oh, he loved the team with four interceptions."
25:16,640;25:20,040;"And then they had Greg Ellis was, I think they're kind of"
25:20,040;25:26,840;"sac specialist who saced Brady in this game. He finished season eight sacks. And then their middle"
25:26,840;25:37,480;"linebacker was kind of the original undersized, I don't know, fragile linebacker that they always"
25:37,480;25:45,960;"have a middle linebacker. Like who do they have now? The white guy, what's his name? Yeah, Van Van"
25:45,960;25:46,960;"and Vander Ash."
25:46,960;25:47,960;"Yeah."
25:47,960;25:50,600;"And before that was like someone similar who couldn't stay on the field."
25:50,600;25:52,560;"You know what I'm talking about?"
25:52,560;25:53,960;"Oh, and they all like their..."
25:53,960;25:55,360;"Oh, Lee, something Lee, right?"
25:55,360;25:56,560;"Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah."
25:56,560;26:01,160;"And they always play like out of control, but they're super smart and super fast and"
26:01,160;26:02,160;"so they can make up for it."
26:02,160;26:08,720;"And this season was DAT Quinn, I believe, is how you pronounce it."
26:08,720;26:13,960;"And he finished the season with 90 solo tackles and 121 combined, which is pretty fucking impressive."
26:13,960;26:14,960;"And he was."
26:14,960;26:21,200;"And they made a big point of this being a very unpar cells like middle linebacker."
26:21,200;26:25,520;"Yeah, it's usually like six, four, like pushing 300 pounds."
26:25,520;26:34,560;"That wins like five, eight or something, but still making plays with stuff for a kind"
26:34,560;26:36,080;"of a no name defense like that."
26:36,080;26:37,600;"Those are some impressive stats."
26:37,600;26:37,960;"Yeah."
26:37,960;26:38,160;"Yeah."
26:38,160;26:43,400;"They, they, they were saying that, um, they allowed an average of six points"
26:43,400;26:44,720;"in the first half of games."
26:44,720;26:53,600;"to teams, which that's I mean, yeah, it's still like pre, you know, passing era, but"
26:53,600;26:58,480;"still allowing six points in a first half of pretty much every game is fucking impressive."
26:58,480;27:02,720;"Yeah, I mean, you're trying out Al Shurmond Singleton out there."
27:02,720;27:07,040;"Yeah, you know, the household name. Yes."
27:07,040;27:08,720;"Al Shurmond, is that what you said?"
27:08,720;27:10,960;"Yes, he's one of their starting linebackers."
27:10,960;27:18,420;"I'm sure he is. But I'm wondering if this helped their defensive coordinator get some coaching jobs because"
27:18,420;27:24,040;"It is the current Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer was a defensive coordinator in this game"
27:24,040;27:28,260;"And they're talking them up a little bit on this. Yeah"
27:28,260;27:36,060;"Also on this coaching staff which I found interesting was Sean Payton was a quarterbacks coach and"
27:36,060;27:40,060;"Like assistant to the head coach or something like that, which sure"
27:40,060;27:47,060;"So he's the, obviously the long time same type coach now who's just lost to Tom Brady."
27:47,060;27:49,060;"Must be, must be nice."
27:49,060;27:55,700;"And then also, I found this funny, the tight ends coach with Tony Sperano, the old Dolph"
27:55,700;27:56,700;"and Ted coach."
27:56,700;27:57,700;"Oh, yeah."
27:57,700;27:58,700;"Yeah."
27:58,700;28:04,700;"It was, is this the, probably the biggest name from the Cowboys in this game was win."
28:04,700;28:05,700;"Yeah."
28:05,700;28:10,020;"So I mean, say what you will about Bell Pardis Ells, but the man can draft."
28:10,020;28:15,020;"Cause in this draft, their first round pick was Terrence Newman,"
28:15,020;28:21,940;"not who made the proval, I think in this year and probably multiple years,"
28:21,940;28:26,580;"I think he had a good career and also Jason Whitten in the third round who was like,"
28:26,580;28:29,420;"yeah, this is Whitten rookie year and you'd have, we had one."
28:29,420;28:32,780;"I mean, it was a nice catch bat throw sort of thing."
28:32,780;28:33,700;"Yeah."
28:34,380;28:38,080;"Yeah, yeah, one of the interceptions was kind of almost his fault, but I mean,"
28:38,080;28:40,880;"he made some plays with his hands early on in the game."
28:40,880;28:42,180;"He made some nice snacks."
28:42,180;28:44,780;"You could tell you could also crazy to think that he's still playing."
28:44,780;28:45,580;"Right."
28:45,580;28:45,880;"Yeah."
28:45,880;28:47,380;"Lordy."
28:47,380;28:50,180;"And that birdie's got two years on him."
28:50,180;28:50,880;"Yeah."
28:50,880;28:52,880;"It was drafted by Bill fucking car cells."
28:52,880;28:53,080;"Yeah."
28:53,080;28:56,880;"But didn't he didn't win in retire for a year and then went in the booth and"
28:56,880;28:57,680;"then wasn't very good."
28:57,680;29:01,880;"So you decided to come back again in 2018 and then came back for the Cowboys"
29:01,880;29:02,380;"again."
29:02,380;29:03,080;"Yeah."
29:03,280;29:05,680;"this past year, he's like, you know what? Raiders."
29:05,680;29:08,000;"That's right. Yes. He did play with the Raiders, isn't he?"
29:08,000;29:09,760;"How did he do?"
29:09,760;29:13,680;"The 13 catches for 69 yards and two touchdowns."
29:13,680;29:15,080;"Nice."
29:15,080;29:17,240;"We got 16 games, though."
29:17,240;29:18,280;"All right. All right."
29:18,280;29:20,120;"Maybe he was more of a blocking role."
29:20,120;29:23,200;"Maybe he's got all at this point."
29:23,200;29:25,720;"Yeah."
29:25,720;29:27,960;"But you know, there's one player"
29:27,960;29:32,360;"that we haven't talked about that I figured we would have gotten to by now."
29:32,360;29:36,560;"on the Cowboys on the Cowboys."
29:36,560;29:40,700;"Oh, a bit of a homecoming, if you will, you can't just call this the"
29:40,700;29:42,140;"bill, Parcells revenge game."
29:42,140;29:42,760;"That's true."
29:42,760;29:49,560;"When you also have star wide out and leading receiver for the 2003"
29:49,560;29:54,480;"Cowboys with 754 yards and five touchdowns wide receiver Terry Glenn."
29:54,480;29:56,040;"Returning."
29:56,040;29:59,160;"Uh, how did you feel about coming back?"
29:59,160;30:01,960;"The fucking shit boot out of him."
30:01,960;30:05,880;"Did you hear what he had to say about coming back?"
30:05,880;30:10,240;"Yeah, I didn't go to the actual newspapers and read the quotes and she..."
30:10,240;30:11,240;"No, me neither."
30:11,240;30:13,760;"But just what the commentator says."
30:13,760;30:22,080;"You couldn't wait to get back here because he hates everything about New England."
30:22,080;30:28,240;"But in truth, he had the Patriots hard hat on, the silver one."
30:28,240;30:34,360;"Yeah, Terry Glenn Jersey and then he put like a piece of masking tape above it like kind of below his chin above the numbers and"
30:34,360;30:37,240;"She on it"
30:37,240;30:39,240;"Yep"
30:39,240;30:41,400;"Tough look, but"
30:41,400;30:44,120;"Okay"
30:44,120;30:49,920;"Ridiculous. Yeah, like he let me like put a piece of duct tape on there on his Terry Glenn Jersey"
30:49,920;30:52,240;"Which you still had and was still wearing yes"
30:52,240;30:57,720;"But I think in kind of true Terry Glenn fashion"
30:57,720;31:04,200;"Um, he didn't exactly show up for this game and he finished with one catch for eight yards"
31:04,200;31:08,040;"Uh and got thoroughly booed when he made that catch"
31:08,040;31:14,040;"Um, I don't even think he had many targets to be honest"
31:14,040;31:17,160;"Like he just had tile on him. I think for the most part"
31:17,160;31:20,760;"I'm actually it was like it was bell checks classic take the best player away and"
31:20,760;31:24,600;"Yeah, it's kind of different loads and coverages item and double um, almost exactly"
31:24,600;31:38,100;"Yeah, they seem to have a guy over the top every time and yeah, what Joey Galloway was injured for the Cowboys. Yeah, so Joey Galloway was their other weapon, but he wasn't playing this game, which opened the door for Antonio Bryant. Remember him?"
31:38,100;31:40,100;"Yeah, he's sucked in this game."
31:40,100;31:54,500;"That I think is almost an understatement. This was I was going to save this as my worst, but he made he had three catches, which is good, except he took a shot."
31:54,500;31:59,500;"took him 12 attempts to get those three catches."
31:59,500;32:01,260;"- He had a couple of just straight up drops."
32:01,260;32:03,340;"And it's like, it's a Quincy Carter."
32:03,340;32:05,740;"You really can't be dropped at ball."
32:05,740;32:06,580;"- Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
32:06,580;32:08,140;"- You're the guy in the hands."
32:08,140;32:10,100;"That's the achievement in and of itself."
32:10,100;32:10,940;"- Yeah, yeah."
32:10,940;32:15,140;"No, I think Antonio Bryant actually had more footballs"
32:15,140;32:17,540;"hit him in the face mask than he did in the hands"
32:17,540;32:19,940;"in terms of catching the ball."
32:19,940;32:22,700;"Like he was just having balls bounce off his face,"
32:22,700;32:24,460;"which is a tough look when you were a wide"
32:24,460;32:25,460;"He was a receiver."
32:25,460;32:32,620;"But yeah, I also think there was some great coverage on him too because they kept, I felt"
32:32,620;32:39,660;"like the Cowboys game plan offensively was run the ball, run the ball, take a deep shot"
32:39,660;32:43,660;"to Antonio Bryant and he was never open."
32:43,660;32:49,660;"He was always like just extremely covered where it, there was actually a few of them where"
32:49,660;32:51,660;"probably he was the one breaking up"
32:51,660;32:53,660;"interceptions instead of"
32:53,660;32:55,660;"the other way around."
32:55,660;32:57,660;"Well to be fair on Quincy Carter"
32:57,660;32:59,660;"he was just running the plays that Bill Parcels"
32:59,660;33:01,660;"called. He had no freedom to change it."
33:01,660;33:03,660;"No, oh no. Yeah."
33:03,660;33:06,660;"Yeah, there was a whole lot of like kind of"
33:06,660;33:08,660;"veiled"
33:08,660;33:11,660;"displeasure I think from"
33:11,660;33:13,660;"Parcels' point of view"
33:13,660;33:16,660;"towards Quincy Carter about how he didn't"
33:16,660;33:18,740;"He didn't consider him a real quarterback. I think"
33:18,740;33:26,160;"Is what it felt like just the way that they were talking about him and how they were talking about his embell checks relationship"
33:26,160;33:30,180;"Like oh, I've never had to study this heart of my life and you know"
33:30,180;33:33,900;"I'm finally starting to feel like a real quarterback and some some coaches"
33:33,900;33:36,540;"so some coaches"
33:36,540;33:42,660;"Well, well only have their quarterback read half the field, but that doesn't happen here in Dallas"
33:42,660;33:46,260;"Hear me out on this one"
33:46,260;33:48,260;"I have a theory all right"
33:48,260;33:55,340;"If Parcels hadn't been a huge douche and left immediately after taking the pages to the Super Bowl"
33:55,340;34:00,620;"It's like around and by some miracle they've dropped, you know Tom Brady anyways"
34:00,620;34:04,620;"He may have stunted Tom Brady's growth by not letting him"
34:04,620;34:08,980;"You know call plays and make audibles and do a lot"
34:08,980;34:13,880;"Possibly Parcels could have been such a control freak because he clearly was a control freak right?"
34:13,880;34:16,560;"is why he left the Patriots is they're like,"
34:16,560;34:18,720;"oh, wow, Jerry Jones is letting him do everything."
34:18,720;34:20,520;"And he's at all the control he wants."
34:20,520;34:23,880;"And it's like, but like that went all the way through"
34:23,880;34:26,400;"to, you know, plays he's calling."
34:26,400;34:28,360;"He doesn't, they don't let the OC call him plays."
34:28,360;34:29,200;"He's calling him plays."
34:29,200;34:30,840;"And he's not on the quarterback change."
34:30,840;34:32,280;"He's calling him Parcels plays."
34:32,280;34:35,040;"And he's doing Parcels thing and Parcels is the,"
34:35,040;34:36,200;"is the end all be all."
34:36,200;34:38,880;"And, you know, maybe you don't let Tom Brady do that"
34:38,880;34:42,320;"then Tom Brady doesn't become as good as he is."
34:42,320;34:47,360;"It's true. And also does that offense look differently if it's a"
34:47,360;34:50,320;"Parcel's offense to where he's more focused on building that"
34:50,320;34:54,040;"suffocating defense and then doing that ground and pound"
34:54,040;34:58,200;"offense with a game manager at quarterback. So maybe it would"
34:58,200;35:01,200;"have worked out still because that's kind of what Brady was in"
35:01,200;35:05,360;"2001 was that game manager for that style of team."
35:05,360;35:09,840;"But yeah, but Parcel's might be like win that Super Bowl and"
35:09,840;35:13,280;"have the heberists, so they're like, this is works, you know."
35:13,280;35:15,920;"I mean, it had before, you'd already won two Super Bowls."
35:15,920;35:17,280;"Definitely my way now."
35:17,280;35:18,180;"Yeah."
35:18,180;35:22,480;"And I had foregone the evolution of Tom Brady into being awesome."
35:22,480;35:30,320;"So what we're really saying here is, Bill Parcel's stubbornness is the root cause of the"
35:30,320;35:31,280;"Patriots dynasty."
35:31,280;35:34,080;"So moral of the story is fuck Bill Parcel's."
35:34,080;35:34,800;"Yeah."
35:34,800;35:37,920;"Well, thank God he was such a dickhead and left."
35:37,920;35:39,280;"Exactly."
35:39,280;35:57,840;"it's a stinky tuna. Can that tune of chicken and the sea. That's right. Oh, another good"
35:57,840;36:02,520;"note after this game was that the Patriots were for the first time, I think wearing their"
36:02,520;36:08,840;"new silver jerseys. Yeah, dry complete forgotten about. I don't know. Yeah, they just look"
36:08,840;36:15,560;"like they're white but dirty especially if it's not in high def like yeah it's"
36:15,560;36:20,360;"just it looks dirty it kind of like the the Rams uniforms now I don't like them"
36:20,360;36:24,800;"you know they're kind of like the the off white kind of cream color there's"
36:24,800;36:28,560;"like dirty and then they have the like puff paint outlines on the numbers"
36:28,560;36:33,160;"yeah oh man come on"
36:33,160;36:34,160;"I don't mind them."
36:34,160;36:38,260;"No, it's so LA that's trying to be trendy."
36:38,260;36:39,460;"It just doesn't come off right."
36:39,460;36:43,160;"Andy, are you the fucking judge of what is trendy or not?"
36:43,160;36:45,900;"I was voted class trendsetter."
36:45,900;36:46,720;"Thank you very much."
36:46,720;36:49,060;"I'm the hoodie and the shirt you made yourself."
36:49,060;36:50,960;"Yeah, that's right."
36:50,960;36:54,500;"Because nobody else can can get on my level style wise."
36:54,500;36:55,800;"So I got to make my own T-shirts."
36:55,800;36:56,300;"Yeah."
36:56,300;36:56,700;"Okay."
36:56,700;36:58,700;"Or maybe your style is so shit."
36:58,700;37:00,720;"No one even bothers to make such a crack clothing."
37:00,720;37:01,420;"It won't sell."
37:01,580;37:04,380;"I'm sorry, were you voted a class trend setter in high school?"
37:04,380;37:05,500;"Because I was."
37:05,500;37:07,620;"That was an ironic award."
37:07,620;37:12,260;"Regardless, it still happened and I can hold it over you."
37:12,260;37:15,100;"Oh boy."
37:15,100;37:17,980;"Speaking of things that I can't read."
37:17,980;37:19,260;"What?"
37:19,260;37:20,820;"I said, I don't know what I was voted."
37:20,820;37:21,860;"I couldn't read the yearbook."
37:21,860;37:23,060;"Well, that makes sense."
37:23,060;37:27,140;"You're at least likely to learn how to read probably."
37:27,860;37:34,160;"Um, I think a big part in this game that nobody really talked about, at least the"
37:34,160;37:39,440;"announcers didn't was, um, I'm coming around to, to your take that they weren't very"
37:39,440;37:46,240;"good was that, um, this Patriots defense was a whole lot less injured than they have"
37:46,240;37:47,560;"been in a while."
37:47,560;37:48,880;"Yeah."
37:48,880;37:49,960;"They're getting guys back now."
37:49,960;37:54,180;"Cause last time we talked, um, last week, who did they play?"
37:54,180;37:55,760;"Uh, oh, the Broncos."
37:55,760;37:55,920;"Yeah."
37:55,920;37:57,400;"And the Broncos ran all over him, right?"
37:57,400;38:00,120;"Yeah. And you kind of almost."
38:00,120;38:04,000;"He was legit and the stretch run game scheme was really good."
38:04,000;38:07,720;"But also they had no, remember Richard Seymour was a late scratch."
38:07,720;38:13,400;"They had no Richard Seymour, no Ted Johnson like their line back and crew was real thin."
38:13,400;38:14,760;"No Ted Washington."
38:14,760;38:18,840;"Right. So you get all three of those guys back here and the Patriots."
38:18,840;38:21,880;"How many rushing yards have they allowed in this game? Any?"
38:23,160;38:27,560;"Let's see Dallas 28 carries 84 yards as a team."
38:27,560;38:29,000;"Ted Washington was legit."
38:29,000;38:32,580;"I mean, he definitely made the changes that whole team inside there."
38:32,580;38:33,480;"He does."
38:33,480;38:38,200;"And they kind of mentioned a bit too, where they were able to switch it up"
38:38,200;38:42,040;"between him and Richard Seymour playing at that nose tackle too."
38:42,040;38:45,800;"So you can have like a lighter guy and whenever Richard Seymour seemed to line"
38:45,800;38:50,280;"up inside the Cowboys guards would get called for holding because he would just"
38:50,280;38:51,480;"below straight pass him."
38:51,480;38:54,760;"There's one play where they actually showed the replay and"
38:54,760;38:57,600;"the ball got snapped and Richard Seymour just kind of stood up."
38:57,600;39:00,840;"And so the guard stood up and he's kind of just kind of like pushing out of the"
39:00,840;39:03,520;"way and ran past him and the guy had to tackle his ass."
39:03,520;39:04,880;"You see what it was?"
39:04,880;39:06,280;"They had no answer for him."
39:06,280;39:06,880;"No."
39:06,880;39:10,880;"And I remember, you know, you think of like good defensive players."
39:10,880;39:15,960;"Like, yeah, Richard Seamway is on that list, but I'd forgotten how much of"
39:15,960;39:19,800;"like a man amongst boys, he actually was, you know what I mean?"
39:19,960;39:23,200;"Yeah, they're all like kind of campaign for his Hall of Fame right now."
39:23,200;39:26,400;"Like Brady's going very hard on a bill of shakas as well and saying, right?"
39:26,400;39:30,520;"You don't have a ton of stats like sacks, but no,"
39:30,520;39:33,760;"played everywhere you played and the inside outside every single thing."
39:33,760;39:34,840;"He played them all really well."
39:34,840;39:38,760;"And he was watching games like these where God was offensive line was like the"
39:38,760;39:39,480;"strength of their team."
39:39,480;39:41,160;"And he's just saying, see you later."
39:41,160;39:44,280;"Just evenly announced like that was the Roy Glover."
39:44,280;39:44,880;"He's like there."
39:44,880;39:47,120;"He's like all pro and he's a massive dude."
39:47,120;39:48,840;"And he's just, yeah, exactly."
39:48,840;39:50,320;"He's just, he's pushing."
39:50,320;39:51,160;"Yeah."
39:51,160;39:55,660;"Leroy Glover was a second team all pro and a,"
39:55,660;40:00,320;"and pro baller this year."
40:00,320;40:01,760;"And he just didn't fucking matter."
40:01,760;40:04,200;"Same with Flowsell Adams and Larry Allen."
40:04,200;40:08,040;"Like this, this, this offensive line was stacked"
40:08,040;40:12,520;"and Seymour was just like, making him look like rookies."
40:12,520;40:15,720;"Yeah, it was, it was a, it's a huge shift"
40:15,720;40:17,000;"when he's in there at first when he's not."
40:17,000;40:21,080;"like they're just not allowing a run game to get going."
40:21,080;40:22,800;"And I like that obviously they had some runs,"
40:22,800;40:25,160;"but they just never kind of got rolling"
40:25,160;40:26,520;"like we've seen in some of these other games."
40:26,520;40:28,600;"- Yeah, they couldn't catch like the four yards of clip"
40:28,600;40:30,120;"so they can just keep running and running and running."
40:30,120;40:31,640;"- Exactly, which is what we saw last week"
40:31,640;40:33,200;"when it wasn't there and the Broncos,"
40:33,200;40:34,160;"especially at the end of the game,"
40:34,160;40:35,760;"they're just like running it and running it"
40:35,760;40:37,600;"and they just can't make the stop."
40:37,600;40:41,840;"And on that note, like last season two,"
40:41,840;40:43,120;"remember there was that big issue"
40:43,120;40:44,240;"where they couldn't stop it."
40:44,240;40:46,800;"Anybody 'cause they didn't have that guy in the middle."
40:46,800;40:50,440;"And I think that was actually in the book too that you started to read."
40:50,440;40:52,440;"Yeah, even, yeah."
40:52,440;40:53,440;"It might be chapter two."
40:53,440;40:56,400;"So yeah, I don't know if we've got that yet, but this season that we just watched in the"
40:56,400;40:59,760;"2020 season was like they couldn't stop the fucking run."
40:59,760;41:00,760;"Very similar."
41:00,760;41:01,760;"Right."
41:01,760;41:06,680;"And so last season, 2002, they were 31st against the run on defense."
41:06,680;41:12,920;"And this year with, you know, the Ted Washington's in the Richard Seymour's, they're now seventh"
41:12,920;41:13,920;"in the league."
41:13,920;41:14,920;"Yeah."
41:14,920;41:15,920;"We couldn't understand."
41:15,920;41:21,800;"Appreciate it. I think he's only here this year because we draft Vince next year. I think you're right"
41:21,800;41:26,700;"Mount Washington doesn't stick around for a long time because then stuff we got one super boring for sure"
41:26,700;41:31,720;"I hear this here. He's got to go next year. Right. Let's see and I said Washington"
41:31,720;41:36,960;"He was yeah, he's only here for 2003 and then after this two years local and two years in Cleveland"
41:36,960;41:41,240;"Man, he started 1991 though. He's been around for a long time. Yeah"
41:41,240;41:44,760;"Yeah, Jesus"
41:45,000;41:50,760;"And I want to mention them before, but like Bobby Hamilton is also sneaky legit."
41:50,760;41:51,960;"Very underrated. Yep."
41:51,960;41:58,680;"Yeah, because he's the one that showed up big in the, uh, in the snowball game and it was just"
41:58,680;42:05,640;"like man handling people. And I think also some, if we're talking underrated defensive players on"
42:05,640;42:10,760;"this, this team Tyrone Poole, who was a free agent pickup too. Yeah, I'd also, I'd always sort of"
42:10,760;42:12,760;"in the town was sucked."
42:12,760;42:18,760;"No, I remember him being good, but it was similar to, like, not quite on the same level as Seymour,"
42:18,760;42:22,760;"but it was one of those things where I forgot why I thought he was good."
42:22,760;42:25,760;"I was like, ""Oh, yeah. No, I'll add him to the list of, like, good players."""
42:25,760;42:31,760;"But, yeah, he's almost -- I mean, he's no Thai law, but he was kind of almost that lockdown corner"
42:31,760;42:35,760;"on the other side of Thai law, especially when he's going up against the number two guy."
42:35,760;42:39,760;"He's kind of a bigger guy than Thai law, so he was able to take the taller receivers,"
42:39,760;42:44,000;"receivers and the way he plays a deep ball is like clinical."
42:44,000;42:50,080;"This is his job probably to what Asante next year."
42:50,080;42:51,680;"Something like that."
42:51,680;42:54,320;"Yeah, I think he was basically just a rental."
42:54,320;42:56,080;"He was here."
42:56,080;42:58,560;"It's two, three, four, five."
42:58,560;42:59,760;"Three years."
42:59,760;43:02,320;"He has me as a good year this year."
43:02,320;43:05,120;"Yeah, this is the only year he starts all 16 games though,"
43:05,120;43:07,920;"and it's four games in 2004 on one game in '05."
43:09,280;43:10,880;"before he gets to go to Oakland."
43:10,880;43:14,480;"Performance, but I never really thought he was awesome."
43:14,480;43:17,480;"No, but I remember him being good right around now."
43:17,480;43:23,760;"Kind of the same way Otis Smith was in 2001, where you had that guy opposite"
43:23,760;43:28,560;"tie law that was shutting down the number two receiver on the opposite team."
43:28,560;43:31,080;"Right. So it felt very similar to that."
43:31,080;43:35,480;"Do we have anything to talk about on offense?"
43:38,080;43:44,060;"It was because they have done wide receivers because Troy Brown is out again this week with a leg injury"
43:44,060;43:47,400;"So no Troy Brown and that I"
43:47,400;43:53,460;"think hurt them in terms of staying in the field and like keeping drives going"
43:53,460;43:59,840;"Because I think even David Gibbons went out of at some point during this game. He just like stopped showing up"
43:59,840;44:03,360;"So they had to rely on people like"
44:03,360;44:06,120;"Daniel Graham"
44:06,120;44:11,180;"Brady was targeting him a lot, especially on third down and wait, wait, I thought his name was David Graham"
44:11,180;44:17,580;"Daniel Graham they called him David Graham like four times did there. Yes"
44:17,580;44:22,400;"No, maybe call them Daniel instead of David who would fucking catch it"
44:22,400;44:28,620;"And Tyson would correct him each time"
44:29,480;44:32,560;"Like that's gonna make a point. I'm saying Daniel Graham and"
44:32,560;44:38,560;"fucking Paul or where the play-by-play guy was would get it wrong every time not gonna stick I"
44:38,560;44:46,620;"Mean who needs to remember their names. It's not like part of the job or anything so whatever it's all good"
44:46,620;44:51,520;"I like them"
44:51,520;44:53,800;"Almost"
44:57,160;44:59,660;"No, no, no, we're definitely not going that far."
44:59,660;45:02,140;"Rain it in steam, Brown."
45:02,140;45:12,740;"Um, yeah, no, I think, uh, if we're talking about the only player who on offense really"
45:12,740;45:14,660;"did anything."
45:14,660;45:22,000;"It was my early dynasty MVP."
45:22,000;45:23,500;"Kevin Faulk again."
45:23,500;45:24,340;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait."
45:24,340;45:25,700;"You're expanding it from this season"
45:25,700;45:27,620;"to the entire early dynasty?"
45:27,620;45:28,980;"- Yep."
45:28,980;45:30,220;"Well, it was last season two"
45:30,220;45:32,900;"and he's continuing with it into this season, I think."
45:32,900;45:33,740;"- No."
45:33,740;45:35,300;"- Yep."
45:35,300;45:38,300;"The engine that keeps the motor of the offense running."
45:38,300;45:42,900;"When they need that yard and Troy Brown's not there"
45:42,900;45:46,020;"or he's actually getting more attention now"
45:46,020;45:48,460;"because of the year he had in 2002"
45:48,460;45:51,340;"and he's battling injuries, who do you go to?"
45:51,340;45:52,180;"Who do you go to?"
45:53,300;45:54,460;"Yeah, that's right."
45:54,460;45:59,100;"You go to my boy Kevin Falk, who had himself,"
45:59,100;46:01,020;"had himself a solid little game."
46:01,020;46:03,900;"Well, I mean, compared to everybody else."
46:03,900;46:07,900;"Let's see, he, eight carats for 11 yards, also maybe not."
46:07,900;46:12,860;"Four catches for 22 yards."
46:12,860;46:15,180;"- Okay, wait, Antoine Smith got 16 carries."
46:15,180;46:18,740;"- Oh, sorry, no, three catches for 22 yards, long as it's 12."
46:18,740;46:22,700;"- So he got 33 yards."
46:22,700;46:24,860;"He was the leading receiver."
46:24,860;46:27,420;"I mean, Christian Forre, both had three catches."
46:27,420;46:30,220;"- Well, yeah, in catches, but not in yards."
46:30,220;46:31,260;"- Well, he's a running bag."
46:31,260;46:32,100;"That's supposed to lead."
46:32,100;46:35,260;"- He's a five-yard 56-yard catch."
46:35,260;46:39,380;"- He also had a huge gain on a screen call back too."
46:39,380;46:40,620;"- Oh, okay."
46:40,620;46:43,620;"- Which probably would have put him close to"
46:43,620;46:45,380;"the team lead in receiving yards,"
46:45,380;46:48,620;"which was D.O. Branch, two catches for 69 yards,"
46:48,620;46:50,020;"along to 46."
46:51,420;46:54,460;"not a great day for uh,"
46:54,460;46:56,540;"page receivers in general."
46:56,540;47:01,420;"David, David Givens two catches, 67 yards long as a 57."
47:01,420;47:02,820;"So."
47:02,820;47:04,420;"It does belong ones."
47:04,420;47:05,340;"Yeah."
47:05,340;47:07,740;"I mean, that's, that's kind of seemed to be, it almost felt like the"
47:07,740;47:10,820;"page was waiting for the Cowboys to blitz."
47:10,820;47:15,380;"And when they did, they take a deep shot and it worked every time."
47:15,380;47:19,340;"But because it worked so well, the Cowboys stopped blitzing and the"
47:19,340;47:24,340;"pages like didn't really. It almost felt like they were content to just like they knew that"
47:24,340;47:28,340;"their defense could handle Quincy Carter. So they're like, we're just not going to take any chances."
47:28,340;47:33,340;"It was definitely a grinded out game for sure. And so I was so fucking boring. Yeah. I enjoy it."
47:33,340;47:41,340;"Cause this, oh yeah. So there were a lot of three and that's so many puns. A lot of puns."
47:41,340;47:52,340;"10 Walter had eight Toby go in had seven. Yeah. Let's see. One, two, three, four, five,"
47:52,340;48:04,940;"six, seven, eight, three and out. The yards per punt was 36 and 34. Yeah. Oh, the punting"
48:04,940;48:16,000;"was a troche. They said that Ken Walter was the 31st ranked right? No, I think it was a worst"
48:16,000;48:21,940;"part, worst ranked punter in the league, either 31st or 32nd ranked punter in the lead. So I had"
48:21,940;48:30,780;"this, I had this question and yeah, that's sort of sparked it. Like nowadays, I mean, we just"
48:30,780;48:35,220;"finished at 2020 season and Jake Bailey is like our best player."
48:35,220;48:37,580;"I mean, he's the only like a"
48:37,580;48:40,780;"Robles scotch in for for in that's a classic loser."
48:40,780;48:43,340;"Bright spot like our punter was really good."
48:43,340;48:46,260;"Yeah, because he was and like we've had like really good"
48:46,260;48:48,980;"punting for a while now, you know, you kind of take it for"
48:48,980;48:51,020;"granted. Just Ryan Allen before that. Yeah."
48:51,020;48:53,340;"Remember he won the Super Bowl against Iran's use."
48:53,340;48:54,620;"So good in that. Yep."
48:54,620;48:57,580;"And it's like when did that flip?"
48:57,580;49:00,180;"Like who was the first of the Patriots punters?"
49:00,180;49:02,260;"We're like, dude, this guy is legit."
49:02,260;49:05,860;"But I want to see if you got one."
49:05,860;49:09,060;"I think it was actually Lee Johnson until he"
49:09,060;49:12,940;"struggled against the charge in 2001."
49:12,940;49:16,380;"And then they had a string of Ken Walters."
49:16,380;49:20,740;"Uh, I don't know who I would put on that list."
49:20,740;49:21,580;"Who do you?"
49:21,580;49:24,100;"You're not talking about Zoltan Mesko, are you?"
49:24,100;49:25,100;"Zoltan."
49:25,100;49:27,620;"I don't think he was as good as his name."
49:28,220;49:35,500;"Yeah, the fucking Z hand thing that thing sweet everyone did. Oh dad. I love so damn. He did have the Z and it's a great name"
49:35,500;49:37,900;"did I mean"
49:37,900;49:40,580;"What a name? I"
49:40,580;49:46,180;"Feel like he was 2010. Yeah, and then who's after that like give me a list of page of punters"
49:46,180;49:50,740;"I'm just punter. I can't I don't know if I can name him. Oh god. Yeah, that's that's a"
49:51,900;49:57,100;"But I feel like he was the first one where like the dude was like good enough to be like to come up with this old"
49:57,100;50:00,260;"Dan, thank you know Lee Johnson and getting a nickname"
50:00,260;50:06,900;"He's not getting any like any cult status or his old ten was like good enough to like you can't you can't do that if he sucks"
50:06,900;50:13,860;"Yeah, I don't I mean he wasn't on like a Ryan Allen level though like he wasn't no"
50:13,860;50:17,180;"He wasn't like awesome awesome. No, he was like middle-of-the-road punter"
50:17,180;50:22,980;"But I remember when like he left New England and he didn't sign on anywhere and I was like happy not sign on because he's good and same thing with"
50:22,980;50:27,540;"With Ryan Allen with Ryan Allen not catch on with anybody because he was good"
50:27,540;50:31,260;"Like he was a solid punter. He wasn't maybe I think we're better off with it"
50:31,260;50:33,460;"Yeah, we have but they're both like they're still good"
50:33,460;50:33,900;"Yeah"
50:33,900;50:38,780;"Yeah, the fact that the pages drafted a punter and then went with the rookie"
50:38,780;50:44,140;"Over Ryan Allen and then Ryan Allen didn't get picked up by anybody was a little little baffling to me too"
50:44,140;50:48,900;"I don't know why that was but yeah, this this I because I remember this being an issue for a while"
50:48,900;50:51,480;"just the punting from the pages in general, which is"
50:51,480;50:55,060;"strange because of how much"
50:55,060;50:58,140;"Focus Belichick puts on"
50:58,140;51:01,320;"Dude, all right on special teams in general"
51:01,320;51:03,660;"Pages career punting average"
51:03,660;51:07,380;"Okay, okay"
51:07,380;51:08,620;"number one"
51:08,620;51:10,620;"That castle"
51:10,860;51:14,340;"All right, yes one punt for like 60 yards"
51:14,340;51:17,540;"57 yeah, yeah, it rolled a lot"
51:17,540;51:21,580;"Where's Tom Brady on that because he's got a few puns"
51:21,580;51:28,760;"Number two is Jake Bailey. Okay, makes up three Ryan Allen for Tom Tupa"
51:28,760;51:32,660;"Wow five Zoltan, okay"
51:32,660;51:36,380;"Josh Miller oh four to oh six. Yep. Yep"
51:36,380;51:39,140;"Yeah, he was probably the first like"
51:40,500;51:44,880;"Solid punter that you had that you didn't think of fuck here. We go again. Yeah"
51:44,880;51:48,720;"And then Lee Johnson is number 10"
51:48,720;51:51,680;"99 in 2001"
51:51,680;51:58,980;"Chris Hanson, I remember him oh 709. Yep. I didn't use him that much. No, no, no 7"
51:58,980;52:07,500;"Hot sauberon is the old panthers guy was the like the beefy one. Yeah 2006. Yep"
52:07,500;52:10,100;"He's 14"
52:10,100;52:12,100;"All right"
52:12,100;52:14,260;"Ken Walters 21"
52:14,260;52:17,900;"For a point of reference Ken Walt is at 38.6"
52:17,900;52:22,140;"You have to upon Jake Bailey's at 46"
52:22,140;52:30,880;"That's I mean I might neither was a good a math, but that seems like a decent difference"
52:30,880;52:33,380;"Yeah"
52:33,380;52:36,780;"See Tom Brady on here"
52:37,460;52:41,780;"35 he has an average of 34 yards per punt"
52:41,780;52:45,940;"With I think two puns to his career yeah"
52:45,940;52:51,140;"Because I remember one I think sparked was against the Jets and it sparked a"
52:51,140;52:55,740;"A scuffle at the end of the game between some Jets players"
52:55,740;52:59,300;"Interestingly Adam Ben Terry's on here. Oh"
52:59,300;53:02,780;"Yeah, number 30. I remember him punting"
53:03,460;53:07,280;"He only ever did it once and it was like there it they set up for a long field goal"
53:07,280;53:11,320;"Oh really and they would like snap it directly to him and he would just pooch it in there"
53:11,320;53:14,180;"Try pin him down"
53:14,180;53:16,500;"Yeah, not great though"
53:16,500;53:21,800;"The worst number 41 Jeff White 73 six-punce 27"
53:21,800;53:23,740;"average"
53:23,740;53:27,920;"I'm pretty sure you and I can probably punt it further than 27 yards. Maybe not very high"
53:28,660;53:36,880;"But it would go more than 27 years. I'm guessing in 73. He wasn't taking for how you guess a preview of what's to come"
53:36,880;53:40,580;"2003 Brooks Barnard"
53:40,580;53:45,100;"Yeah, who okay 10 punts"
53:45,100;53:49,320;"There's six and a half yard half-rangey 31st"
53:49,320;53:56,700;"Spoiler alert. Yeah, they were like fucking Ken while these suck. All right. This guy is even worse"
53:56,700;53:59,700;"- Oh, good."
53:59,700;54:02,980;"- So I'm in for the Brooks Park on the bus."
54:02,980;54:04,580;"- Can't wait, wait, yeah."
54:04,580;54:07,620;"Something to look forward to in these games apparently."
54:07,620;54:09,560;"Oh my God."
54:09,560;54:14,660;"I think there, speaking of 40 yard distances,"
54:14,660;54:18,460;"they showed a stat in this game"
54:18,460;54:21,100;"where Tom Brady this season"
54:21,100;54:24,100;"has as many touchdowns of 40 yards or more"
54:24,980;54:28,100;"as he had 40 yard completions last season."
54:28,100;54:30,980;"- Oh yeah, they saved you, he's already up to there."
54:30,980;54:33,380;"- Yeah, he's had seven completions in three touchdowns"
54:33,380;54:34,940;"of 40 yards more this season"
54:34,940;54:37,220;"and he had three completions total"
54:37,220;54:39,140;"of more than 40 yards last season."
54:39,140;54:42,900;"- I mean, Ken Walter probably doesn't have any 40 yard punts."
54:42,900;54:43,740;"He couldn't even punt it"
54:43,740;54:46,220;"to the first down marker on one and play."
54:46,220;54:49,380;"- Yeah, it was, I think I wrote it down."
54:49,380;54:53,100;"Let's see, it was fourth and 37"
54:53,100;54:55,020;"and Ken Walter had a 34 yard punt."
54:55,020;54:58,100;"- Yeah, I saw the bounce and he was making the first down by."
54:58,100;55:01,800;"- Oh, not a good look."
55:01,800;55:05,500;"- And it wasn't like, you're backed up on your own side too."
55:05,500;55:08,200;"- Yeah, and he punched it to like midfield."
55:08,200;55:09,360;"- Awful."
55:09,360;55:11,260;"- 'Cause they had driven a midfield."
55:11,260;55:12,100;"- Yeah."
55:12,100;55:15,160;"- And then Falk had the screen, like a big screen"
55:15,160;55:18,000;"that got him like, about the 20 yard line of the Cowboys."
55:18,000;55:20,300;"They got called back for a hold."
55:20,300;55:25,300;"And then the next play, it was like a running play."
55:25,300;55:31,780;"And then there was that egregious late hit call"
55:31,780;55:33,340;"on Joe and Drewsy that wasn't."
55:33,340;55:35,500;"Like I think--"
55:35,500;55:39,460;"- The referees in this game were overbearing."
55:39,460;55:40,740;"- They were not good."
55:40,740;55:42,860;"To the point where even the broadcast"
55:42,860;55:44,220;"was criticizing the calls,"
55:44,220;55:45,540;"that's when you know it was bad when they're like,"
55:45,540;55:47,100;"that was bad."
55:47,100;55:47,940;"Oh, oh."
55:47,940;55:49,460;"- There's so many penalties."
55:49,460;55:51,460;"And it was like, it just, that's another reason"
55:51,460;55:52,940;"when I was getting fucking unwatchable"
55:52,940;55:55,460;"because it was just so disjointed"
55:55,460;55:57,580;"'cause they couldn't get in any flow"
55:57,580;55:59,060;"and they're running the ball of shitload"
55:59,060;56:01,060;"and there's a shitload of penalties."
56:01,060;56:04,700;"Maybe sign on the goddamn ref wanted to call a penalty."
56:04,700;56:06,180;"He would do the hand signals"
56:06,180;56:08,260;"so you knew what the fucking was."
56:08,260;56:11,020;"But then it would take him like three minutes"
56:11,020;56:14,300;"to actually like find space in the field and he walks"
56:14,300;56:17,420;"like 20 yards away from everybody to turn on his mic on"
56:17,420;56:19,820;"and say it and you're like, we already know what it is."
56:19,820;56:21,980;"(laughing)"
56:21,980;56:26,980;"- Yeah, and then there was one where"
56:26,980;56:29,540;"there was a penalty on the Cowboys,"
56:29,540;56:32,060;"but they were like within the on third down"
56:32,060;56:35,620;"and it was within like borderline field goal range."
56:35,620;56:38,260;"And so he just assumed that they wanted to decline it"
56:38,260;56:39,660;"to bring up fourth down."
56:39,660;56:41,620;"And so he announced he was like, oh yeah,"
56:41,620;56:46,620;"it's a hands to the face on the offense,"
56:47,220;56:49,260;"penalties a climb brings a fourth down in Bellachix."
56:49,260;56:52,260;"They cut the bell check be like, what the fuck?"
56:52,260;56:53,820;"No, I want to accept the penalty."
56:53,820;56:56,700;"And so that was like another five minutes of that."
56:56,700;56:57,340;"And then he comes back."
56:57,340;57:00,580;"He's like, uh, during the announcement, the pages have changed their mind and we'll"
57:00,580;57:01,420;"accept the penalty."
57:01,420;57:04,260;"And Thuy's one's like, that's not how that works."
57:04,260;57:05,820;"You're not allowed to change your mind."
57:05,820;57:08,860;"He just didn't ask them and just like straight up through one of the bus."
57:08,860;57:14,940;"They also called offensive penalty offensive pass interference on defense."
57:14,940;57:15,940;"Number 82."
57:16,340;57:18,100;"Yeah, which was actually offensive."
57:18,100;57:20,100;"The penalty off on the Patriots."
57:20,100;57:21,620;"Yes."
57:21,620;57:25,380;"On the defense, they called offensive pass interference on 82 Jason Whitten."
57:25,380;57:26,260;"Yeah."
57:26,260;57:27,780;"Part the penalty on the Patriots."
57:27,780;57:29,540;"And everyone was like, wait, what?"
57:29,540;57:30,100;"Yeah."
57:30,100;57:31,940;"And then they're like, oh, shit, our bad."
57:31,940;57:34,220;"We got 20 yards that way."
57:34,220;57:35,700;"Oh, it was brutal."
57:35,700;57:36,740;"In the game."
57:36,740;57:37,060;"Yeah."
57:37,060;57:38,700;"Shit together."
57:38,700;57:41,940;"And then they called like right at the end of the game, second to last play."
57:41,940;57:44,700;"The Cowboys took a deep shot."
57:44,700;57:51,600;"And I think it was Eugene Wilson went and lit the wide receiver up, which at the time was a legal call."
57:51,600;58:02,960;"And they threw a flag for after the play was over, unspores unlike conduct, defensive player launch into the offensive wide receiver."
58:02,960;58:06,740;"And they're like, that's not a penalty."
58:06,740;58:10,700;"Even like by today's standards, it wasn't that it wasn't bad."
58:10,700;58:11,940;"It was like, because he's left with his shoulder."
58:11,940;58:14,180;"It was like a kind of separate the guy in the ball."
58:14,340;58:16,340;"And condoms like square in the chest."
58:16,340;58:18,740;"Maybe the fences are seeper thing, but like..."
58:18,740;58:22,580;"It probably would be now, but even then it would be kind of close."
58:22,580;58:25,340;"Man, now there's so much more egregious shit out there to call."
58:25,340;58:28,100;"And like, they didn't call any past inferences."
58:28,100;58:30,980;"But that's where the commentators got livid."
58:30,980;58:33,780;"Like all of them like that was a garbage call."
58:33,780;58:36,300;"This like, didn't leave with the hand."
58:36,300;58:39,620;"Paul was like, ""Oh my God, that's a great call."""
58:39,620;58:41,180;"And Joe was like, ""No, it's not."""
58:41,180;58:43,780;"And then he fucking argued for like five minutes"
58:43,780;58:47,160;"into the next play about, is this a great call or not?"
58:47,160;58:50,520;"Oh, dude, that three man booth was brutal."
58:50,520;58:51,580;"- And then the next play,"
58:51,580;58:54,940;"Tylor interception in the end zone to end it."
58:54,940;58:57,760;"And then he started running, like he caught it"
58:57,760;59:01,100;"probably five yards in the end zone running backwards"
59:01,100;59:02,960;"like towards the back of the end zone."
59:02,960;59:04,660;"He's like, you know what, nah, fuck this team."
59:04,660;59:06,460;"It decides to run it out."
59:06,460;59:07,860;"- Well, there's no time left either."
59:07,860;59:09,580;"It was like two seconds."
59:09,580;59:10,980;"- So they cut to Belichick."
59:10,980;59:12,740;"Oh, he could just down in the games over, but he's like,"
59:12,740;59:13,580;"you know what?"
59:13,580;59:14,980;"Now fuck this and decide to run it out."
59:14,980;59:18,220;"And Belichick was like, fucking go, let's go."
59:18,220;59:19,780;"Like he wanted that."
59:19,780;59:21,700;"Yeah, but then of course, to your point,"
59:21,700;59:23,720;"the commentary is like, well, you know,"
59:23,720;59:25,660;"Belichick obviously didn't want him running that out."
59:25,660;59:27,940;"He's, they're gonna, 'cause then he tried to like ladder"
59:27,940;59:30,140;"up to somebody and that didn't worry."
59:30,140;59:31,220;"Oh, fuck, whatever."
59:31,220;59:33,220;"Last play of the game that you can't lose this game."
59:33,220;59:34,500;"- I'm not gonna be happy about that."
59:34,500;59:36,900;"Oh, he's gonna get a talking to after the game."
59:36,900;59:38,380;"- Yeah, I got a talking to on Monday."
59:38,380;59:40,420;"- So you cut a VM pointing to the end zone?"
59:40,420;59:43,420;"Yeah. And like celebrated because he knew the game was over already."
59:43,420;59:45,760;"And the play was literally did not matter."
59:45,760;59:46,780;"He was already anywhere."
59:46,780;59:49,420;"Anyways, they're down for 12 nothing with a couple of seconds left."
59:49,420;59:50,740;"I'm throwing the ends on."
59:50,740;59:51,940;"Yeah, there's no there's no second left."
59:51,940;59:54,620;"So I mean, you're just trying to make it close at that point."
59:54,620;59:56,180;"You're just trying not to get shut out."
59:56,180;01:00:00,420;"But yeah, I think that was a pretty fitting end to the game."
01:00:00,420;01:00:03,340;"And then Bell check in."
01:00:03,340;01:00:07,820;"Par cells met in the middle and hugged it out a bit."
01:00:07,820;01:00:09,300;"And then Bell check was like."
01:00:09,300;01:00:12,260;"Legitimately like giddily,"
01:00:12,260;01:00:15,620;"giddily celebrating and hugging his team, hugging his players."
01:00:15,620;01:00:16,300;"Stop."
01:00:16,300;01:00:20,020;"Yeah, he was excited that he won this football game, which is dope."
01:00:20,020;01:00:26,180;"We'll probably saw that ESPN poll that they did during the game."
01:00:26,180;01:00:31,260;"I have a screenshot of it, which I will, if I remember, I will post it to Twitter"
01:00:31,260;01:00:32,300;"when this comes out."
01:00:32,300;01:00:34,460;"Yes."
01:00:36,100;01:00:37,420;"Let me make a note of this."
01:00:37,420;01:00:38,620;"I don't forget."
01:00:38,620;01:00:41,020;"Who is coach of the year?"
01:00:41,020;01:00:42,100;"Yeah."
01:00:42,100;01:00:46,780;"So they did a poll that you could call"
01:00:46,780;01:00:48,380;"and make the sports nation poll."
01:00:48,380;01:00:50,500;"The internet is a thing now."
01:00:50,500;01:00:51,260;"Oh, that's right."
01:00:51,260;01:00:51,500;"Yeah."
01:00:51,500;01:00:52,300;"It's sports nation."
01:00:52,300;01:00:52,980;"That was the ESPN."
01:00:52,980;01:00:53,500;"That's right."
01:00:53,500;01:00:56,980;"Sunday Stud was the name of the poll."
01:00:56,980;01:00:59,340;"Who's the NFL coach of the year?"
01:00:59,340;01:01:05,020;"And the options are Bill Parcells, Marvin Lewis, Dick Vermeil, John Fox and Bill Bellichock."
01:01:05,020;01:01:13,820;"For some context, Dick Vermeil had his chiefs at nine in one and they had only just lost"
01:01:13,820;01:01:16,500;"that first game this week to Marvin Lewis' Bengals."
01:01:16,500;01:01:19,700;"I think we're five and five."
01:01:19,700;01:01:25,260;"But I think this may have been like early Marvin Lewis when the Bengals, they showed some"
01:01:25,260;01:01:28,660;"after the game, they're going to talk about how the Bengals aren't the bungles anymore."
01:01:28,660;01:01:32,040;"But now we know that five and five and eight hundred is"
01:01:32,040;01:01:38,020;"Yeah, that's exactly where he's gonna be he plateaued right there in this poll"
01:01:38,020;01:01:42,900;"Parcells had taken over the Cowboys is his first year with the Cowboys"
01:01:42,900;01:01:47,860;"Had taken over but they already had like some good pieces on defense and"
01:01:47,860;01:01:52,940;"They had those wide receivers in Terry Glenn and Joey Galloway"
01:01:52,940;01:01:56,340;"John Fox with Panthers, I think"
01:01:57,260;01:02:01,860;"This was taking over from member 2001 when we had Bobby on our brother-in-law"
01:02:01,860;01:02:06,360;"The Panthers fan talking about the end of that season. They were one in 15"
01:02:06,360;01:02:10,980;"All right, and they just like gave up on in that game against the Patriots and they just got there"
01:02:10,980;01:02:17,060;"Yeah, they got their shit kicked in and so I think John Fox had taken over that team and he was like rebuilding it here"
01:02:17,060;01:02:19,260;"And they go to Super Bowl this year"
01:02:19,260;01:02:24,360;"They do and then Bill Belichick obviously we talked about last week is the only"
01:02:24,360;01:02:27,020;"team in recent memory to have"
01:02:27,020;01:02:32,020;"have the league lead in number of different starters."
01:02:32,020;01:02:34,420;"I think they had 40 at this point."
01:02:34,420;01:02:38,140;"And it was the only team to actually have a winning record"
01:02:38,140;01:02:39,940;"that he would then."
01:02:39,940;01:02:40,920;"- They talked about it, they,"
01:02:40,920;01:02:43,620;"this also, I mean, that's their like,"
01:02:43,620;01:02:46,300;"wow, Bill Belichick doing so good at all his injuries"
01:02:46,300;01:02:48,020;"and look at Jerry Jones though,"
01:02:48,020;01:02:50,580;"giving up all the control to fucking build"
01:02:50,580;01:02:53,220;"the ourselves like it was the same sentence."
01:02:53,220;01:02:55,500;"- Yeah, as if those two things were the same."
01:02:56,420;01:03:01,300;"For the record, Bill Belichick finished last in his poll out of five with 10.4."
01:03:01,300;01:03:02,740;"Hater feel, that's what I'm saying."
01:03:02,740;01:03:04,700;"He knows he sees that poll."
01:03:04,700;01:03:11,860;"First, the coach that he would beat tonight, Bill Parcells, 34.8%, which of all these guys"
01:03:11,860;01:03:13,900;"I would probably put last, honestly."
01:03:13,900;01:03:19,740;"Yeah, he's got his defense playing well, but I think it's a stacked defense really"
01:03:19,740;01:03:21,540;"from the sounds of it the way they were talking about it."
01:03:21,540;01:03:25,260;"And I think it was Thaisen was kind of disagreeing with the poll."
01:03:25,260;01:03:26,300;"They're like, yeah, Parcels."
01:03:26,300;01:03:29,980;"I mean, we're going to put anybody put like Vermeel or Marvin Lewis up front."
01:03:29,980;01:03:30,540;"Okay."
01:03:30,540;01:03:35,060;"Someone said, though, check just because all the injuries, which it makes sense."
01:03:35,060;01:03:38,100;"I mean, that's the hardest part about coaching is when you're injured and you're"
01:03:38,100;01:03:40,180;"just plugging and playing and still playing very well."
01:03:40,180;01:03:45,700;"And I, and I think, you know, hindsight is also 20, 20, where we know that even"
01:03:45,700;01:03:49,980;"with all these things and these close grinded out games, they don't lose again this"
01:03:49,980;01:03:51,140;"season and they win a Super Bowl."
01:03:51,140;01:03:52,540;"So with all that."
01:03:52,540;01:04:00,500;"Right? Parcels is very like media savvy and everyone in the media loves Parcels and Bell check has the exact opposite"
01:04:00,500;01:04:03,060;"reputation"
01:04:03,060;01:04:05,980;"All opposite you'll be able to like cultivate and I mean"
01:04:05,980;01:04:10,980;"Winning all the same roles allows them to just continue to be that way and just kind of addict everybody wish"
01:04:10,980;01:04:13,740;"Yeah about it. Oh"
01:04:13,740;01:04:16,060;"Yeah, yeah, no me too"
01:04:17,140;01:04:24,440;"But he should probably find an offense because I'd like to read you the Cowboys drive chart and the result of each drive"
01:04:24,440;01:04:26,640;"Yes, you're ready for this"
01:04:26,640;01:04:29,060;"Wait wait before we go there"
01:04:29,060;01:04:33,640;"At the end of the game the announcer said wow this game really lived up to the billing"
01:04:33,640;01:04:36,220;"I agree"
01:04:36,220;01:04:38,220;"But you get it the billing"
01:04:38,220;01:04:43,760;"They try to sneak that bias to you, but he can't sneak a pun by me"
01:04:43,760;01:04:46,360;"No, it's too pissed off."
01:04:46,360;01:04:48,840;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:04:48,840;01:04:51,600;"All right, so Cowboys drives in this game."
01:04:51,600;01:04:53,680;"There were 12 of them."
01:04:53,680;01:04:56,120;"As we know, none of them ended in a score."
01:04:56,120;01:05:01,400;"But here it was, punt, punt, punt, punt, punt, end of half."
01:05:01,400;01:05:06,920;"Punt, punt, interception, downs, interception, interception."
01:05:06,920;01:05:07,920;"Thrilling."
01:05:07,920;01:05:08,960;"Not great."
01:05:08,960;01:05:11,600;"Their longest drive was 48 yards."
01:05:11,600;01:05:13,820;"They did twice to end each half."
01:05:13,820;01:05:15,480;"That's yeah."
01:05:15,480;01:05:16,360;"Not great."
01:05:16,360;01:05:18,860;"And that last drive was literally just like the Patriots playing prevent."
01:05:18,860;01:05:22,280;"Feeling like, yeah, I mean, you're going to take all minute,"
01:05:22,280;01:05:24,760;"56 you have left to score twice and it's not going to happen."
01:05:24,760;01:05:26,600;"And it didn't end up with the interception."
01:05:26,600;01:05:30,620;"Did you never once just know this not great."
01:05:30,620;01:05:34,360;"I mean, that's what you get when you have Quincy Carter not running the ball"
01:05:34,360;01:05:37,880;"and trying to throw instead and throwing it to Antonio Bryant, who was"
01:05:37,880;01:05:40,120;"going to catch three of the 12 passes his way."
01:05:41,140;01:05:42,940;"Yeah, a couple bad interceptions."
01:05:42,940;01:05:45,180;"And I think someone weren't, one of them wasn't in his fault where"
01:05:45,180;01:05:47,940;"yeah, bounce off, bounce off,"
01:05:47,940;01:05:49,540;"wetting into tie loss hands."
01:05:49,540;01:05:53,740;"It was still, I think his fault for making that decision because he tried"
01:05:53,740;01:05:56,500;"to do a bootleg and William McGinnis didn't buy it."
01:05:56,500;01:05:59,220;"And so he basically ran backwards 50."
01:05:59,220;01:06:00,460;"It was very drew blood."
01:06:00,460;01:06:04,040;"So ask almost where he ran backwards 10 yards and tried to kind of side"
01:06:04,040;01:06:06,980;"armored around him to the tight end in the flat who was covered by"
01:06:06,980;01:06:07,500;"tie law."
01:06:07,500;01:06:08,900;"Yeah, it wasn't a great throw."
01:06:08,900;01:06:10,260;"But it was a little unlucky."
01:06:10,660;01:06:13,180;"It was it was behind him, but basically"
01:06:13,180;01:06:15,180;"Whitten kind of knocked it straight up into"
01:06:15,180;01:06:18,340;"Tyler's arms. So in that way, I was"
01:06:18,340;01:06:22,500;"100% his fault where he like just misread the"
01:06:22,500;01:06:24,500;"car. He threw it to Tyrone pool."
01:06:24,500;01:06:25,980;"They were right there. The day was like not"
01:06:25,980;01:06:27,660;"even a receiver around him. Yeah."
01:06:27,660;01:06:31,240;"And I think the last one was just"
01:06:31,240;01:06:33,060;"Tyler running the route better than the"
01:06:33,060;01:06:34,500;"the receiver because he literally caught"
01:06:34,500;01:06:36,220;"it in stride where the receiver probably"
01:06:36,220;01:06:38,580;"should have been and wasn't because"
01:06:38,700;01:06:39,700;"That's not always there instead."
01:06:39,700;01:06:42,200;"Yeah, it was it was perfect one."
01:06:42,200;01:06:45,500;"Do you want to do best and worse?"
01:06:45,500;01:06:47,200;"Yeah, I think we're in that."
01:06:47,200;01:06:51,100;"Yeah, I think I don't think I have any other big old points."
01:06:51,100;01:06:51,800;"You want to go first?"
01:06:51,800;01:06:53,740;"Oh, no, you go first."
01:06:53,740;01:06:54,400;"I have a lot."
01:06:54,400;01:06:55,200;"All right."
01:06:55,200;01:06:57,100;"I'll do a couple."
01:06:57,100;01:06:57,760;"Let's see."
01:06:57,760;01:07:02,200;"The one commercial coming back from the game."
01:07:02,200;01:07:05,300;"They do, you know, or they do like the sponsor by bullshit"
01:07:05,300;01:07:06,500;"when they're showing shots of the fans."
01:07:07,600;01:07:14,640;"There was only one that I remember catching in this game and it was UPS and the tagline was what can Brown do for you?"
01:07:14,640;01:07:20,480;"Which felt appropriate us watching this game. They should bring that back. What what Steve what can Brown do for you?"
01:07:20,480;01:07:28,320;"Maybe that should be our tagline now. We'll just steal it from UPS. No, no, I don't know I don't know over promise"
01:07:28,320;01:07:34,080;"We're not we're just asking because the answer could literally be nothing"
01:07:36,480;01:07:38,960;"I don't even want to set any expectations."
01:07:38,960;01:07:42,160;"You know, I don't even want to ask that question because I'm going to underdeliver it."
01:07:42,160;01:07:44,080;"Whatever the answer is, I'm underdelivering."
01:07:44,080;01:07:46,960;"Good."
01:07:46,960;01:07:54,240;"So I would say my best and worst are kind of the same play."
01:07:54,240;01:08:01,280;"It was Dion Branch getting another catch off of deflection for the second week in a row."
01:08:02,880;01:08:09,240;"Tom Brady through a screamer that Kevin Falk, I'm going to defend and say he decided to"
01:08:09,240;01:08:13,080;"turn into a tip drill on purpose, which I don't think it was, but we're going to go"
01:08:13,080;01:08:18,720;"with that directly into the hands of awaiting Dion Branch, who caught the ball, got tackled,"
01:08:18,720;01:08:22,940;"got up, and then was immediately called for taunting after the catch, which set them back"
01:08:22,940;01:08:23,940;"15 yards."
01:08:23,940;01:08:26,080;"So as if the play didn't happen."
01:08:26,080;01:08:27,080;"He like."
01:08:27,080;01:08:31,440;"Yeah, it was."
01:08:31,440;01:08:38,960;"And then let's see, an honorable mention would be, oh, there's a, there's a, um, an interview,"
01:08:38,960;01:08:41,200;"a sideline interview with a young Robert Kraft."
01:08:41,200;01:08:42,200;"Yeah."
01:08:42,200;01:08:45,200;"Oh, I've decided."
01:08:45,200;01:08:49,760;"I'm trying to like, figure out who his voice reminds me of."
01:08:49,760;01:08:51,920;"It's only a fucking goober."
01:08:51,920;01:08:54,920;"So yeah, but I, I think I've, I've come close."
01:08:54,920;01:08:55,920;"Okay."
01:08:55,920;01:08:57,920;"I'm interested in this because he sounds like he's like congested."
01:08:57,920;01:08:58,920;"He's kind of a goober."
01:08:58,920;01:08:59,920;"Yeah."
01:08:59,920;01:09:08,460;"Yeah, not a great interview like voice wise. I think what he says is fine. Yeah, but so I think it is"
01:09:08,460;01:09:13,200;"Right you wolf"
01:09:13,200;01:09:15,960;"Alright, she heard"
01:09:15,960;01:09:19,520;"Good joke man"
01:09:19,520;01:09:24,040;"Like this"
01:09:26,840;01:09:32,760;"he sounds like the doopy the dog. Do you remember droopy dog? He's like, oh he's a"
01:09:32,760;01:09:39,240;"little but he has that same like, yeah, that same voice. Oh, that sort of thing."
01:09:39,240;01:09:46,160;"Alright, you know, I can definitely see it. So I'm gonna, I just figured out like"
01:09:46,160;01:09:48,640;"right before we started recording this, I just found like the first clip I"
01:09:48,640;01:09:52,480;"could but I'm gonna say I can find some and see I can put together a Robert"
01:09:52,480;01:09:56,600;"craft first droopy the dog got it in his offense. He at least he"
01:09:56,600;01:10:00,360;"always thinks the fans every time. Oh my god. Tom Brady always"
01:10:00,360;01:10:04,160;"says hi mom. Hi dad. Actually in the Broncos interview he said hi"
01:10:04,160;01:10:06,840;"mom hi dad. Hi sisters because they say never say hi to them."
01:10:06,840;01:10:12,080;"Yeah. That's right. Okay. Always think the fans. Yeah. I"
01:10:12,080;01:10:16,160;"appreciate that. He does. But he was like super awkward in this"
01:10:16,160;01:10:19,440;"too because they just ask him like softball questions. He's"
01:10:19,440;01:10:22,040;"like, oh, yeah, no, we're big fan of Jerry Jones."
01:10:22,040;01:10:23,200;"Our family's really close."
01:10:23,200;01:10:25,320;"We get dinner together all the time."
01:10:25,320;01:10:28,920;"And so it's like, oh, so, well, the winner of this game"
01:10:28,920;01:10:30,680;"be the one to buy dinner next time."
01:10:30,680;01:10:33,280;"And he just like blanked."
01:10:33,280;01:10:36,040;"He's like, I'm sure we'll have dinner."
01:10:36,040;01:10:37,920;"Yeah, okay."
01:10:37,920;01:10:40,000;"Just like trying to get out of the interview."
01:10:40,000;01:10:41,440;"Like, oh, you poor bastard."
01:10:41,440;01:10:44,080;"That's exactly how, 'cause that's exactly how it'd be."
01:10:44,080;01:10:45,800;"If I was the owner of the Patriots"
01:10:45,800;01:10:48,360;"and you try to interview me on live television."
01:10:48,360;01:10:50,680;"Yeah. I eat dinner."
01:10:50,680;01:10:53,200;"You mean who's going to buy it?"
01:10:53,200;01:10:54,840;"We're both fucking millionaires, lady."
01:10:54,840;01:10:55,160;"Geez."
01:10:55,160;01:10:55,660;"Right."
01:10:55,660;01:10:58,080;"Drop in the bucket, baby."
01:10:58,080;01:10:58,840;"All right."
01:10:58,840;01:11:00,480;"So what's your best and worst?"
01:11:00,480;01:11:01,440;"All right."
01:11:01,440;01:11:03,920;"You know, deep down, happy,"
01:11:03,920;01:11:05,480;"part tells in every part of the page."
01:11:05,480;01:11:06,120;"It's Hall of Fame."
01:11:06,120;01:11:10,160;"Oh, I know that guy on the inside."
01:11:10,160;01:11:11,920;"I mean, both we all told him don't do it."
01:11:11,920;01:11:12,760;"Right."
01:11:12,760;01:11:12,920;"Right."
01:11:12,920;01:11:17,440;"This game, all that confirms my feelings there."
01:11:17,560;01:11:19,640;"Sometimes we'll have a little validation there."
01:11:19,640;01:11:20,640;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:11:20,640;01:11:24,000;"- I learned that back in the day, I guess,"
01:11:24,000;01:11:26,520;"hitting the offensive lineman with a pass as a penalty."
01:11:26,520;01:11:28,720;"- It is. It still is."
01:11:28,720;01:11:30,760;"It's illegal touching."
01:11:30,760;01:11:31,760;"- Yeah."
01:11:31,760;01:11:34,240;"- I don't know. I feel like if you just inadvertently hit"
01:11:34,240;01:11:37,160;"the offensive lineman with a pass, it's not a penalty."
01:11:37,160;01:11:40,720;"- No, I think it still is."
01:11:40,720;01:11:42,160;"At least as far as I know, but yeah,"
01:11:42,160;01:11:43,500;"I mean, you might be right, maybe they've changed it."
01:11:43,500;01:11:44,900;"- Backjack."
01:11:44,900;01:11:46,560;"Because it was weird, because it wiped out"
01:11:46,560;01:11:48,900;"an opponent on the page's defense."
01:11:48,900;01:11:50,280;"- It did, yeah."
01:11:50,280;01:11:51,780;"- Is that a brain fart?"
01:11:51,780;01:11:53,180;"And they offset."
01:11:53,180;01:11:54,100;"- Let's see."
01:11:54,100;01:11:55,960;"I'm not quite sure how to--"
01:11:55,960;01:11:59,780;"- Probably my worst is like a little combination"
01:11:59,780;01:12:05,820;"of Antoine Smith and Field"
01:12:05,820;01:12:09,460;"because they both looked awful."
01:12:09,460;01:12:10,660;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:12:10,660;01:12:13,300;"- And like they also like contribute to each other"
01:12:13,300;01:12:14,820;"looking awful because like Antoine Smith"
01:12:14,820;01:12:15,660;"couldn't get footage."
01:12:15,660;01:12:16,660;"He's falling down."
01:12:16,660;01:12:17,780;"- There was that one plan."
01:12:17,780;01:12:19,980;"I think it was like, I don't think it was third."
01:12:19,980;01:12:22,220;"I might have been like second in short."
01:12:22,220;01:12:24,740;"And Antoine Smith got the handoff and had like"
01:12:24,740;01:12:27,940;"days of open space and just like fell over the dirt."
01:12:27,940;01:12:29,060;"Like two yards in the back."
01:12:29,060;01:12:30,660;"He was like, ""Ugh."""
01:12:30,660;01:12:31,500;"- I haven't done yet."
01:12:31,500;01:12:32,780;"Has he broken a tackle yet this year?"
01:12:32,780;01:12:37,020;"Like he's definitely out like, he's running on fumes."
01:12:37,020;01:12:38,980;"- Yeah, because there were some plays where it started off"
01:12:38,980;01:12:41,300;"and they had like a couple of pulling guards."
01:12:41,300;01:12:43,540;"It looked really good and there's like nobody out there"
01:12:43,540;01:12:45,100;"and it goes for like three yards."
01:12:45,100;01:12:46,300;"like, how did you get quite a goal?"
01:12:46,300;01:12:50,100;"- We redo the grass to let, I don't remember when that is,"
01:12:50,100;01:12:52,380;"but they just--"
01:12:52,380;01:12:55,700;"- I think it's after all of the cult teams"
01:12:55,700;01:12:58,340;"come to visit in the playoffs."
01:12:58,340;01:13:02,440;"'Cause that was on purpose to slow down those faster teams"
01:13:02,440;01:13:05,300;"was creating garbage feel because of the conditions."
01:13:05,300;01:13:07,380;"- It was garbage, I mean, this is early in,"
01:13:07,380;01:13:09,460;"only a week 11 and it looked."
01:13:09,460;01:13:11,500;"- Well, they talked about how it was because"
01:13:11,500;01:13:14,700;"they shared the stadium with the New England Revolution."
01:13:14,700;01:13:17,200;"So they're like the revolution in Terence of bits too."
01:13:17,200;01:13:19,840;"Which I'm having from high school."
01:13:19,840;01:13:21,200;"We weren't as a soccer team,"
01:13:21,200;01:13:22,920;"we weren't allowed to play on the football field"
01:13:22,920;01:13:26,080;"because soccer games tear up the-"
01:13:26,080;01:13:28,200;"- In your bunch of foot fairies."
01:13:28,200;01:13:29,440;"- Go ahead and write a bunch of foot fairies."
01:13:29,440;01:13:32,400;"But at least we know that a header it doesn't-"
01:13:32,400;01:13:33,400;"- No good."
01:13:33,400;01:13:35,320;"- It's a header it's no good."
01:13:35,320;01:13:36,600;"- Can't be no good."
01:13:36,600;01:13:37,680;"- What?"
01:13:37,680;01:13:38,520;"- Oh my God."
01:13:38,520;01:13:42,080;"- And not a worse for the Patriots,"
01:13:42,080;01:13:44,520;"but I'm sure if he has built myself,"
01:13:44,520;01:13:47,360;"they had an off sides of a field goal attempt."
01:13:47,360;01:13:48,720;"- Oh, that was a good one."
01:13:48,720;01:13:49,640;"- That was going on the pages to burn"
01:13:49,640;01:13:51,800;"like another two minutes a clock."
01:13:51,800;01:13:54,960;"- By their first round, Strathpick,"
01:13:54,960;01:13:59,760;"Terence Newman, who on, it was like a fourth and three,"
01:13:59,760;01:14:02,320;"pages to kick a field goal with like just over two minutes"
01:14:02,320;01:14:03,640;"left so they would have got the two minute warring"
01:14:03,640;01:14:05,240;"everything. - Every thing, yard line."
01:14:05,240;01:14:10,000;"- Yeah, and so the pages do a hard count"
01:14:10,000;01:14:12,860;"on the field goal, get him to jump."
01:14:12,860;01:14:14,080;"Adam kicks the field goal anyway,"
01:14:14,080;01:14:17,640;"but then they run, get to run three more plays before he kicks in and"
01:14:17,640;01:14:18,400;"then they should call."
01:14:18,400;01:14:20,240;"It was like, Hey, maybe you take the points."
01:14:20,240;01:14:21,240;"Yeah."
01:14:21,240;01:14:21,680;"Right."
01:14:21,680;01:14:27,600;"Now, I think it's Thizeman and everyone's like, no, he's like, well, to be fair,"
01:14:27,600;01:14:28,240;"I'm an idiot."
01:14:28,240;01:14:32,440;"So I was just thinking a, a thinking it throughout loud for all the other"
01:14:32,440;01:14:33,920;"idiots out there listening with me."
01:14:33,920;01:14:36,520;"Like, well, all right, at least he's honest."
01:14:36,520;01:14:38,200;"And my best."
01:14:38,200;01:14:41,440;"And then I have a bonus football and football."
01:14:41,440;01:14:42,080;"We're done here."
01:14:43,880;01:14:47,340;"The best though, and I can't believe we didn't mention this as the, um, it's"
01:14:47,340;01:14:52,340;"I don't know, half time age or first half or, you know, it was, when I was still pretty close."
01:14:52,340;01:14:57,620;"Cowboys had a 31, fourth in one and the fourth in one played Teddy just"
01:14:57,620;01:14:59,260;"Crushes it."
01:14:59,260;01:15:00,080;"Oh, yeah."
01:15:00,080;01:15:03,280;"Blows a blocker by hits him like four yards deep."
01:15:03,280;01:15:06,020;"So it was like a loss of three on fourth and one."
01:15:06,020;01:15:06,640;"It was a four."
01:15:06,640;01:15:08,600;"It wasn't for like fourth inches."
01:15:08,600;01:15:09,640;"It was short."
01:15:09,640;01:15:10,420;"Yeah."
01:15:10,420;01:15:13,640;"But yeah, it wasn't like it wasn't like, ooh, where's the spot going to be?"
01:15:13,640;01:15:16,760;"It was like, maybe he got the hand off and he got hit."
01:15:16,760;01:15:17,200;"Yeah."
01:15:17,200;01:15:17,800;"Awesome."
01:15:17,800;01:15:20,280;"No, that's one of the highlights on the on the website."
01:15:20,280;01:15:22,280;"Is that risky for us to stop?"
01:15:22,280;01:15:23,560;"It was it was huge."
01:15:23,560;01:15:23,720;"Yeah."
01:15:23,720;01:15:26,040;"Because they blew up that full play."
01:15:26,040;01:15:29,800;"Like it didn't have a chance from the get go because it the"
01:15:29,800;01:15:33,400;"comment here is talking about how, oh, well, of course you go for here because you"
01:15:33,400;01:15:36,800;"have Quincy Carter and he's so good with his legs and he'll convert the"
01:15:36,800;01:15:38,440;"the QB sneak no problem."
01:15:38,440;01:15:41,400;"But then the pages lined up with like three guys over the center."
01:15:41,520;01:15:43,860;"They say run literally anything else."
01:15:43,860;01:15:45,480;"Anything on the edges."
01:15:45,480;01:15:46,020;"Yeah."
01:15:46,020;01:15:47,760;"And so they tried it and it didn't fucking work."
01:15:47,760;01:15:50,320;"They tried to run up the gut, whatever."
01:15:50,320;01:15:52,120;"Not a great play call."
01:15:52,120;01:15:55,920;"And then my football or not football helped me out here."
01:15:55,920;01:16:00,480;"He just slides in the hole."
01:16:00,480;01:16:01,760;"All you need is eight inches."
01:16:01,760;01:16:05,120;"Each."
01:16:05,120;01:16:06,520;"Oh God."
01:16:06,520;01:16:10,080;"Well, I well, I'm about to disappoint whatever hole that is."
01:16:10,080;01:16:14,080;"Well, it's a good car."
01:16:14,080;01:16:19,160;"So they were actually talking about that on his QB sneaker early in the game."
01:16:19,160;01:16:21,440;"That kind of set up that fourth to one play."
01:16:21,440;01:16:23,840;"You know, he just slides in the hole."
01:16:23,840;01:16:29,680;"He steps back, waits for him, and then slides in the hole."
01:16:29,680;01:16:32,680;"He needs an interest."
01:16:32,680;01:16:35,600;"Oh my goodness."
01:16:35,600;01:16:36,600;"All you need is a--"
01:16:36,600;01:16:38,000;"I thought the commentators were awful."
01:16:38,000;01:16:44,240;"I am really not looking forward to any more polymer wire. How do I get a fucking job in here? Who is I mean?"
01:16:44,240;01:16:47,440;"Yeah, I don't know much about polymer wire. I"
01:16:47,440;01:16:57,200;"Can't find anything about the offensive players so if any if any of you know the rule about"
01:16:57,200;01:17:03,120;"Forward pass hitting an offensive lineman in the back of the head and that being called"
01:17:04,240;01:17:07,160;"ineligible man, ineligible receivers, not like that."
01:17:07,160;01:17:09,800;"I don't know exactly what the call was because they didn't do"
01:17:09,800;01:17:10,720;"good job explaining it."
01:17:10,720;01:17:12,080;"It was something like that."
01:17:12,080;01:17:12,280;"Yeah."
01:17:12,280;01:17:15,280;"Um, let us know."
01:17:15,280;01:17:20,840;"So hit us up on Twitter, Facebook or wherever, or, or great"
01:17:20,840;01:17:22,080;"segue like this, D Brown."
01:17:22,080;01:17:25,720;"Uh, you can text us on the Dinesley hotline."
01:17:25,720;01:17:26,560;"Do you remember the number?"
01:17:26,560;01:17:30,560;"Uh, 505 Troy Brown for three."
01:17:30,560;01:17:31,480;"Yes."
01:17:31,880;01:17:35,800;"603. 505. 804. 3."
01:17:35,800;01:17:39,040;"The Dising Hall. You just shoot us the text and"
01:17:39,040;01:17:44,040;"let us know. Let us know what that rule is or let us know"
01:17:44,040;01:17:46,080;"anything else about this game that we have missed."
01:17:46,080;01:17:50,240;"I don't think there's anything but who we decide."
01:17:50,240;01:17:52,520;"What's important about this game?"
01:17:52,520;01:17:56,080;"We're the host. That's what our job is."
01:17:56,080;01:17:58,600;"Well, you know what?"
01:17:58,600;01:18:01,720;"I'm not going to take that out of the the listeners hands."
01:18:01,720;01:18:03,560;"If they have something that they think's important,"
01:18:03,560;01:18:04,560;"they can let us know."
01:18:04,560;01:18:08,360;"And maybe we even have them on to discuss it"
01:18:08,360;01:18:10,400;"in a future episode."
01:18:10,400;01:18:15,240;"But speaking of future episodes, what is next week Steven?"
01:18:15,240;01:18:16,640;"- I don't know."
01:18:16,640;01:18:18,120;"- Of course you don't fucking know."
01:18:18,120;01:18:22,160;"- Well, Patriots are, I was gonna say staying in Texas,"
01:18:22,160;01:18:25,000;"but they're actually traveling to Texas this time"
01:18:25,000;01:18:29,040;"to take on the use in Texans, in Texas,"
01:18:29,040;01:18:30,440;"at Relian Stadium."
01:18:31,280;01:18:32,680;"Houston Texans first year."
01:18:32,680;01:18:34,780;"I don't believe it's their first year."
01:18:34,780;01:18:36,560;"No, but it is very early on in there."
01:18:36,560;01:18:38,040;"Is it their first year?"
01:18:38,040;01:18:42,760;"No, I think they came after."
01:18:42,760;01:18:45,160;"Didn't they?"
01:18:45,160;01:18:49,080;"Houston Texans started in 2020, 2002."
01:18:49,080;01:18:50,400;"This is their second year."
01:18:50,400;01:18:52,280;"They went 4 and 12 in their first year."
01:18:52,280;01:18:53,840;"This year, they were going 5 and 11."
01:18:53,840;01:18:56,280;"But I remember this game, I think."
01:18:56,280;01:18:57,760;"I don't."
01:18:57,760;01:19:00,760;"Only because I believe I was"
01:19:00,760;01:19:06,440;"extremely hungover at Ryan's Story's house and we're watching it today and the game was uh it felt like a hangover"
01:19:06,440;01:19:10,760;"So I guess we'll find out then we sure will on"
01:19:10,760;01:19:13,720;"the patreon's dazie barcast"
01:19:13,720;01:19:16,120;"Yeah"

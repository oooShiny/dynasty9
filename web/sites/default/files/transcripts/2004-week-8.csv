00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:22,120;"I am not your mother."
00:22,120;00:24,280;"Welcome back to the Patreon Stylancy Podcast."
00:24,280;00:26,480;"I am your host Andy Brown."
00:26,480;00:31,520;"the podcast is going back and rewatching every Patriots game starting in 2001."
00:31,520;00:37,040;"Recurrently 2004 week eight match up against the Steelers with me today."
00:37,040;00:43,680;"Steve Brown made on Steve. Good. We have Gus here doing just as much work as Greg."
00:43,680;00:50,480;"Nice work. Yeah. Greg is not here because what was his excuse this time?"
00:50,480;00:55,120;"He's at a concert with mom and dad. Yeah. So I'm sure that's a great time."
00:55,680;00:56,680;"Oh yeah."
00:56,680;00:58,680;"The revolution, I believe."
00:58,680;00:59,680;"Oh, all right."
00:59,680;01:01,680;"I can get into some some reggae."
01:01,680;01:09,960;"But we figured we'd replace him with a professional as we well as more."
01:09,960;01:12,800;"Well, if you'd met Greg, you'd understand that it's a low bar."
01:12,800;01:14,520;"So all right, good."
01:14,520;01:15,520;"He's our fact checker."
01:15,520;01:19,280;"But this week we have with us Mike just so do."
01:19,280;01:20,280;"Thanks for joining us."
01:20,280;01:21,280;"Yeah, guys."
01:21,280;01:22,280;"Happy to be here."
01:22,280;01:23,280;"Yeah."
01:23,280;01:24,280;"All right."
01:24,280;01:29,880;"We're going to talk about you for a little bit first because otherwise having you here wouldn't make a lot of sense."
01:29,880;01:33,280;"Yeah, and we have to talk about this Steelers game."
01:33,280;01:37,280;"Yeah, so we're going to avoid that for as long as possible because that's a right."
01:37,280;01:40,280;"I don't need another Patriots loss to talk about right now."
01:40,280;01:47,280;"Right. Yeah, I mean, it does feel fitting though this week and this current game for some reason it just matched up well."
01:47,280;01:52,520;"well. So I'm in a mood this week and this game did not help"
01:52,520;01:58,400;"watching it. So yes, so right now you work for pages.com."
01:58,400;02:07,320;"Yes. So I have to I've been asked to ask you is Andy Hart as"
02:07,320;02:10,840;"insufferable in person as he is on the radio? Well, I actually"
02:10,840;02:14,200;"replaced Andy Hart. So I've never actually worked with Andy"
02:14,200;02:18,920;"hard. But from the reaction I received when I arrived there, I get the impression that"
02:18,920;02:24,280;"yes, he is in fact. Okay, all right. No, he's a good guy. I get along well with him."
02:24,280;02:28,280;"I thought he's been nice enough to have me on his radio show a couple times. But, but"
02:28,280;02:33,000;"no, I know Andy, he is, I mean, he's one of the kind, what can you say? Yeah. So is this"
02:33,000;02:38,880;"Andy? Yeah, it's very, very worse. Tell us definitely anything. I'm pretty sure. I'm"
02:38,880;02:42,400;"on the other end of the spectrum, though. I'm Mr. Positivity. How are we supposed to"
02:42,400;02:48,960;"place you Andy, you're a freaking brother. Right. No replace in this. Yeah. Also then"
02:48,960;02:52,960;"you'd have to do some work. So yeah, don't know any of that. None of that. Yeah, this"
02:52,960;03:00,720;"whole thing will fall apart and immediately. Right. Absolutely. So, page.com, that's a"
03:00,720;03:06,520;"hell of a job. How did you kind of luck into something like that? Oh, well, it's a long,"
03:06,520;03:13,480;"not that illustrious story, but I started a Patriots blog myself back in 2007 was"
03:13,480;03:18,320;"when I really first started watching and not watching, I should say, thinking about"
03:18,320;03:21,800;"blogging, I actually, you guys don't get there for another three years, but the"
03:21,800;03:27,320;"'07 I was living in California and I had to come back and see the '07 team and"
03:27,320;03:31,760;"came back for the Pittsburgh game and my sister and I were standing in the"
03:31,760;03:37,520;"parking lot and somebody had paid to actually have a banner flown around the stadium with"
03:37,520;03:44,160;"you know three super bowl trophies with asterisks next to them. And so I was very angry by that."
03:44,160;03:49,760;"And so when I flew back while living in California at the time, I am going to write a blog about it."
03:49,760;03:58,000;"That started the blog and so I you know blog for different places early in the mid- to mid-2000s"
03:58,000;04:06,000;"And about 2009, I believe I started tweeting under a handle called Pats Propaganda, which I thought sounded edgy, kind of cool."
04:06,000;04:11,920;"And that kind of evolved into a tumbler blog, and then that became a regular blog."
04:11,920;04:17,520;"And so basically after writing for a lot of different outlets for a while, I just said, I just want to write about the Patriots on my terms."
04:17,520;04:23,760;"And so I wrote Pats Propaganda of the blog, and part of that became the Bill Bell Check Hoodie database."
04:23,760;04:27,280;"So I started tracking all of Bill Bell and Chex Hoodies."
04:27,280;04:31,120;"That got me some attention for its ridiculousness."
04:31,120;04:33,240;"And yeah, it just kept plowing away."
04:33,240;04:37,040;"I had it, loved it, and moved back to Boston here in 2017"
04:37,040;04:40,360;"and saw this job when Andy left, opened up,"
04:40,360;04:42,200;"and New Fred Kershaw tiny bit."
04:42,200;04:43,840;"Just, I wouldn't even say I knew him."
04:43,840;04:45,720;"I had email with him a couple of times."
04:45,720;04:48,880;"Senator Minnie Mouse said, hey, I'm an idiot that loves"
04:48,880;04:50,800;"the Patriots and loves blogging about the Patriots"
04:50,800;04:53,320;"and I have experience in TV and all these things."
04:53,320;04:55,600;"and you know, it was podcasting and making T-shirts"
04:55,600;04:57,200;"and hustling and everything."
04:57,200;04:59,120;"And they said, great, come on in"
04:59,120;05:00,360;"and be on Patriots unfiltered."
05:00,360;05:02,240;"So it was kind of like a crazy audition."
05:02,240;05:05,200;"I just got thrown into the fire with Eric Scalavino"
05:05,200;05:07,000;"and Paul Perrello and Fred."
05:07,000;05:09,360;"And yeah, that was crazy."
05:09,360;05:11,080;"I mean, I know how lucky I am"
05:11,080;05:13,000;"and you know, I come from blogging roots"
05:13,000;05:13,960;"and that's why I always, you know,"
05:13,960;05:15,800;"I'm happy to go on with passionate Patriots fans."
05:15,800;05:17,680;"Like you guys have a totally unique podcast."
05:17,680;05:18,520;"This is awesome."
05:18,520;05:20,320;"So I know the grind, I love it."
05:20,320;05:22,080;"And that's kind of a long story."
05:22,080;05:26,080;"in their two seasons now and in my third season and they just kind of let me keep doing what"
05:26,080;05:30,240;"I did. That's propaganda. So I guess that's a short version. It's kind of long though."
05:30,240;05:32,800;"No, that's not bad. The CC there is hope for me."
05:32,800;05:34,720;"Yeah, there is."
05:34,720;05:41,280;"That feels like my origin story except for the end part where I get to work for the Patriots."
05:41,280;05:45,920;"No, hey, I'm in there man. I'm in my mid 40s when I got this. So I was"
05:49,440;05:50,280;"really cool."
05:50,280;05:52,160;"- I'm reading graphic Andy, just got a bunch of"
05:52,160;05:53,000;"- That's true."
05:53,000;05:53,840;"- Read tweets or whatever the internet does"
05:53,840;05:55,240;"with things like that."
05:55,240;05:56,240;"They've come down once,"
05:56,240;05:57,800;"all the different size jerseys."
05:57,800;05:58,800;"- That's true, yeah."
05:58,800;06:01,240;"- Well, am I wasting you?"
06:01,240;06:02,080;"Is that what you're saying?"
06:02,080;06:03,880;"- That's my hoodie database."
06:03,880;06:05,240;"- A boy can do that."
06:05,240;06:07,640;"- Yeah, you're gonna find some piece of stupidity"
06:07,640;06:10,200;"that only you care enough about to document"
06:10,200;06:12,760;"and then you'll get to be on ABC Nightly News"
06:12,760;06:14,080;"and they call you."
06:14,080;06:15,320;"But this man has the answer"
06:15,320;06:17,520;"to what hoodie Bill Belichick should wear."
06:17,520;06:18,360;"That's me."
06:18,360;06:21,600;"Well, so yeah, I cast about every single goddamn game"
06:21,600;06:30,500;"But he drags his brothers through that's perfect. Yeah, it's a good fit. So yeah, well, I guess we should probably ask you then"
06:30,500;06:33,960;"The hoodie for this upcoming big game"
06:33,960;06:38,620;"I mean you guys are on the cutting edge right now. I mean, it's funny. I"
06:38,620;06:42,400;"Yesterday I was sitting there and I'm like, oh man"
06:42,400;06:48,260;"I probably for this game should figure out what he should wear, you know, because I mean I don't I just kind of tweet"
06:48,260;06:52,260;"out now, like I keep track of it, but there's not a lot of old stuff anymore. So there's not"
06:52,260;06:57,540;"that much interest to it. So I dove into it. And I wish I had my notebook. Had I known you guys"
06:57,540;07:00,580;"were going to ask me this. I was like, I'm going to compose a tweet tomorrow because God knows"
07:00,580;07:05,940;"if you can write it on Patriots.com, right? Like, no, that's not going. Maybe I'll go back to I"
07:05,940;07:09,300;"let some guys write past, probably get it now. So maybe I'll go back and write it there. But"
07:09,300;07:15,380;"I went and I thought, I mean, you guys can weigh in on this because my criteria were games that"
07:15,380;07:19,620;"Brady played terrible, but then the Patriots still won."
07:19,620;07:24,620;"So that was kind of the general I had."
07:24,620;07:25,860;"So I not only dove into those,"
07:25,860;07:29,060;"I also dove into some of the playoff games as well."
07:29,060;07:32,200;"And just a couple of Brady's just all time"
07:32,200;07:34,020;"terrible, terrible games."
07:34,020;07:35,860;"And so I think what I came up with,"
07:35,860;07:38,740;"and I think you guys are gonna concur with this"
07:38,740;07:40,380;"being the fans that you are,"
07:40,380;07:43,180;"I came back to it and a great majority of them,"
07:43,180;07:48,780;"go belt check had the classic gray hoodie on with no sleeves like his like iconic look,"
07:48,780;07:53,780;"which he really isn't worn much of. So he can't wear the reblock anymore. So I'm thinking"
07:53,780;07:58,780;"it's going to be here it is. I'm going to drop it here first. I think it's 27 or 2018"
07:58,780;08:02,220;"great cut hoodie. And if he wears that, I mean, and I don't know if he's listening"
08:02,220;08:07,700;"to me, I am I am the building. They won't let me within 50 feet of him. But maybe this"
08:07,700;08:09,700;"restraining. So this will somehow get to him."
08:09,700;08:13,220;"The great hoodie. It's a great cut off, hoodie."
08:13,220;08:18,900;"It makes, I think it just makes sense. Like visually and everything, just like the whole."
08:18,900;08:23,300;"He's going against Tom. He's got to wear his all time classic. Look, regardless of what the"
08:23,300;08:27,620;"record was, but you know, games like the, and again, you guys are going to be here for seven"
08:27,620;08:33,620;"years now, but the 2011 AFC Championship game, you know, kind of an all time Brady clunker that"
08:33,620;08:35,100;"that they've managed to pull out."
08:35,100;08:39,140;"So that's one right there that he had."
08:39,140;08:42,140;"So I think that's what, you guys got ahead of the curve."
08:42,140;08:43,620;"I'll have to put some out tomorrow there."
08:43,620;08:44,940;"(laughing)"
08:44,940;08:46,740;"- I will keep a climb for it."
08:46,740;08:48,780;"(laughing)"
08:48,780;08:50,540;"And bar go on that until tomorrow."
08:50,540;08:51,380;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
08:51,380;08:52,940;"(laughing)"
08:52,940;08:56,300;"So yeah, I mean, there's not many games"
08:56,300;08:59,420;"that Brady plays poorly that they still win."
08:59,420;09:02,140;"And usually they win because Brady does something"
09:02,140;09:07,300;"the end. If we refer along, that'd be the perfect segue into this game."
09:07,300;09:11,860;"Yeah, but he doesn't even play well in this game. No, well, that's what we're saying."
09:11,860;09:14,880;"You don't want to be ready to play well, but you still want the page to win. That's the"
09:14,880;09:19,340;"hoodie that you're going to wear, right? Yeah. That doesn't happen this week."
09:19,340;09:23,580;"That was my criteria. Yeah. And I think it's kind of you to say that we're going to get"
09:23,580;09:26,020;"to 2007 and three years. It's going to take us a while."
09:26,020;09:31,840;"You see what he got the dedication for it. Oh, yeah. Oh, this pocket is going to go"
09:31,840;09:34,640;"forever, but it's going to take us for like 20 years to finish all that."
09:34,640;09:42,000;"Once every other week. Yeah, we're heading like eight weeks a year,"
09:42,000;09:45,840;"and there's like 300 gains to go. Yeah, so we'll get there."
09:45,840;09:51,680;"Okay. Yeah. Plenty to, yeah, I'll get there. You can come along if you want."
09:51,680;09:56,320;"But the more interesting thing that I'm"
09:56,320;10:00,320;"patient on filter that I want to talk to you about is the new podcast that I think it's just you"
10:00,320;10:03,480;"you're doing, right? Your name is on the box."
10:03,480;10:06,960;"Yeah, kind of. I mean, being producer Matt Morel, who's really"
10:06,960;10:09,080;"my the sound guy that put it all together."
10:09,080;10:13,320;"Nice. And it's called 2001, a Super Bowl sound Odyssey."
10:13,320;10:18,360;"And the first six episodes, six ones not out yet, right?"
10:18,360;10:21,040;"There's four. Yeah, there's four out right now, actually."
10:21,040;10:23,480;"And the fifth one will be out a week from tomorrow."
10:23,480;10:27,160;"So the Friday before the Texans game, and then two weeks from"
10:27,160;10:30,520;"that will be the final episode, which will be the Rams game."
10:30,520;10:35,040;"Just I guess I should, I'm getting ahead of myself a little bit, just a, it's six episodes."
10:35,040;10:38,920;"The first episode is basically free agency training camp building the team."
10:38,920;10:43,000;"The first, the second episode is then essentially Drew Bledsoe getting hurt and"
10:43,000;10:46,160;"nine 11. The third episode is Brady begins."
10:46,160;10:49,640;"It's Tom Brady, the regular season, kind of the ups and downs of that season."
10:49,640;10:51,720;"And then one episode each for the playoff games."
10:51,720;10:52,400;"Yeah."
10:52,400;10:54,800;"And then you're going to do season two, right?"
10:54,800;10:55,720;"2002."
10:55,720;11:03,720;"Well, it's funny how it all kind of came about is this was kind of an idea that they had."
11:03,720;11:07,320;"Obviously, you guys are in the area as well."
11:07,320;11:12,320;"They had kind of the general area that they had wanted to do for a while."
11:12,320;11:16,240;"It's all part of the 20 year celebration in 2001, but it was nice because they just kind"
11:16,240;11:18,800;"of gave me carte blanche to do it."
11:18,800;11:24,600;"For me, hearing Gil Santos and Geno Capaledi and their calls in the radio, that stuff was"
11:24,600;11:25,600;"awesome."
11:25,600;11:38,600;"producer, Remmeral, he went through a lot of that stuff. A lot of it was, you know, just finding random sound and that was, it was like, we came up with the name 2001, a Super Bowl sound Odyssey, but the whole time we were doing it, it was like, I really hope this lives up to the Odyssey part of it."
11:38,600;11:52,600;"I don't know if this is going to be an Odyssey or what, but based on the sound we were able to get and then the Patriots PR staff was awesome lining up interviews for me so I was able to talk to just, I mean, you know, I was going to have some big names in there."
11:52,600;11:56,600;"Yeah, I mean, Scott Pioli. That was one of the first ones I did, which I was just like,"
11:56,600;12:01,180;"you know, I mean, again, I would like pass propaganda with the database guy and I'm talking"
12:01,180;12:04,240;"to Scott Pioli asking him about the 01 season."
12:04,240;12:07,680;"My favorite was the Chris Berman stuff on there because I mean, he's been the voice"
12:07,680;12:13,600;"of our childhood growing up with the Patriots. You watch them on NFL prime time after the"
12:13,600;12:16,480;"game, every week, seven, seven, 30."
12:16,480;12:19,520;"He was so awesome. And it was, it was one where, you know, as you were kind of going"
12:19,520;12:25,280;"long I really wanted to cover it from all angles which was obviously players and management and"
12:25,280;12:29,680;"all that and then it was like well I had some local media I'd really love a national media and"
12:29,680;12:34,720;"Aaron Salkin one of the guys who works in Patriots PR knows Chris Berman so I was like hey can we"
12:34,720;12:41,360;"just ask him and Aaron's like yeah he'll do it and and the cool thing was was he was one of the"
12:41,360;12:46,320;"like he called and you know I'm totally nervous to talk to him and everything and he started asking"
12:46,320;12:50,080;"me about it. So what do you, so this is like a part, but it's going to be edited. It's not live,"
12:50,080;12:54,160;"right? Like you're going to put it like he instantly kind of got what we were going for."
12:54,160;12:57,600;"And usually I try to get people in and out, you know, 20 minutes, you don't want to take"
12:57,600;13:02,480;"a people's time heat. I couldn't get them off. I mean, I got, I got one more story for you, Mike."
13:02,480;13:06,400;"I got one more story for you. I mean, and just to, you know, like a little, a little sample of it was"
13:06,400;13:11,760;"from the most these recent episode, we released episode four, which was the Raiders. And the story"
13:11,760;13:16,280;"he tells us, I used to call Bill after the games. And so after that game, I was, you know,"
13:16,280;13:21,640;"had finished taping prime time. I gave him Patriots a call and he said, you know, one"
13:21,640;13:25,440;"ring and burnt Patriots, don't bell check answers to the phone. He said, Bill, what are"
13:25,440;13:28,960;"you doing? You know, he said, well, Chris, if you boomer, have you seen the weather,"
13:28,960;13:32,040;"I'm not going anywhere. And so they, you know, ended up chatting at about 2 a.m. after that"
13:32,040;13:35,840;"game. So, you know, a lot of really cool stories. This is another story he tells before the"
13:35,840;13:40,640;"Rams Super Bowl game about, you know, he cleared the room before the game and the media availability"
13:40,640;13:45,040;"talk to Bill Belichick and you know shared those stories with me as well. So it was just you know"
13:45,040;13:49,520;"super cool. We also got Joey McIntyre from New Kids on the Block which randomly kind of came"
13:49,520;13:54,480;"about that he was like hey I sang the anthem for the Raiders game. I'd love to do something and I"
13:54,480;14:00,480;"go this idiot here's got a podcast. You want to talk to him? Yeah so there I am you know sitting"
14:00,480;14:08,000;"with Joey McIntyre the new kids in the Patriots studio. So it was super fun and I mean as you know"
14:08,000;14:12,320;"as you guys probably shared the same passion that I had that drove the whole thing. And so for me,"
14:12,320;14:17,440;"it was just so exciting to be able to spend the off-season and kind of try to contribute something"
14:17,440;14:23,360;"to that season and a new perspective here 20 years later. So very proud of it. It's definitely"
14:23,360;14:28,560;"one of the biggest things that ever done. So just really a love letter to the fans and the people"
14:28,560;14:33,200;"that love it. And being able, just for me as a fan, being able to hear those calls again,"
14:33,200;14:37,600;"to hear those plays unfold from when you're not quite sure what's going to happen. I mean,"
14:37,600;14:41,560;"Everybody kind of knows the big moment calls from everything that's been put out"
14:41,560;14:45,220;"But you know when you come in a little bit early to the play and you start to hear it unfold"
14:45,220;14:48,000;"And it's like you know alright Brady back to what's gonna happen"
14:48,000;14:51,000;"So I think that's been a lot of fun even just hearing"
14:51,000;14:53,600;"America's killer Geno"
14:53,600;14:55,840;"just talking through what the"
14:55,840;14:59,160;"Like the offensive lineup was you know"
14:59,160;15:03,360;"We're talking about he's got two to the far side left to one to the deer shot"
15:03,360;15:07,040;"And it just like it brought me right back to exactly where I was."
15:07,040;15:09,320;"It's like, you can hear the atmosphere."
15:09,320;15:11,560;"You know, I think that was one of the things was cool."
15:11,560;15:15,920;"I mean, there's, you know, many moments just as I was editing it and going through it with Matt,"
15:15,920;15:18,680;"where it's just, you know, I'm like, I get, I'm getting chills again."
15:18,680;15:22,000;"Just those moments that the sound especially."
15:22,000;15:23,320;"So that was, it was cool."
15:23,320;15:27,320;"A lot of it came out, you know, how I was hoping, especially I think in episode four with the Raiders."
15:27,320;15:31,480;"That was, I think when I, you know, we got Amy Trask from, from the Raiders,"
15:31,480;15:34,840;"who was just awesome and really funny and sweet"
15:34,840;15:37,640;"and just really, really great interview."
15:37,640;15:39,880;"And I think she and Michael Lombardi as well,"
15:39,880;15:41,160;"it was kind of the perfect connection"
15:41,160;15:45,160;"between Belichick and Pioli and their Cleveland days"
15:45,160;15:46,560;"and then working for the Raiders."
15:46,560;15:48,040;"So you kind of knew the Patriots,"
15:48,040;15:50,400;"knew what the Patriots were and all that."
15:50,400;15:52,320;"- Yeah."
15:52,320;15:55,400;"So if you listen to this little podcast,"
15:55,400;15:58,080;"I highly recommend listening to the 2001 Super Bowl"
15:58,080;15:59,680;"sound Odyssey because it's--"
15:59,680;16:02,480;"- Basically what we would do if we were professionals"
16:02,480;16:06,360;"with access to all the audio and the interviews,"
16:06,360;16:07,920;"it's fantastic, yeah."
16:07,920;16:09,120;"- Yeah, when I was in your spot,"
16:09,120;16:11,160;"I would have insisted on talking to Troy Brown."
16:11,160;16:12,400;"(laughing)"
16:12,400;16:14,240;"- I know, I know, well he's there all the time"
16:14,240;16:15,960;"and so, I mean, you know, the funny thing is,"
16:15,960;16:18,200;"is it makes you guys probably have a pretty good idea"
16:18,200;16:19,240;"of how things roll there,"
16:19,240;16:21,080;"with how it's run and everything."
16:21,080;16:23,200;"And, you know, so I was just laughing that,"
16:23,200;16:25,360;"""Hey, it's easier for me to get Mike Vrable"
16:25,360;16:28,440;"""from the Titans than it is to get Troy Brown,"
16:28,440;16:33,720;"the receivers. I really wanted, I mean, one of the ones I was disappointed about was just"
16:33,720;16:37,000;"trying to get Josh Mateans. We just couldn't quite work it out as we got kind of down."
16:37,000;16:42,600;"And you know, as he was a first year kind of low level assistant, you know, I was like,"
16:42,600;16:45,960;"why is he want to talk to me? I'm like, that's exactly why I want to talk to you, you know,"
16:45,960;16:50,120;"you were here to kind of see the ground floor of it. So that was one that got away. But I think"
16:50,120;16:53,800;"overall we got some good, some good people who kind of covered it all."
16:53,800;16:59,720;"Nice. Yeah, I've enjoyed the, uh, especially the most recent one because it's a shame Greg's"
16:59,720;17:06,520;"out here. That's his, uh, did he say that's his favorite ever Patriots game? Nothing said non playoff."
17:06,520;17:12,360;"No, it was the playoff game was the, uh, yeah, I don't think it matter. I thought he said that"
17:12,360;17:17,880;"was his best ever. Just because of the atmosphere and it being the last game in old"
17:17,880;17:22,120;"Fox Rose stadium and everything in the snow and he said, if you could go to one"
17:22,120;17:23,680;"on pages game, it'll be that way."
17:23,680;17:24,760;"Let's see if you can all agree to."
17:24,760;17:27,000;"- Yeah, if you agree, if you go back in time,"
17:27,000;17:28,840;"that's where to be."
17:28,840;17:31,400;"- And it's, I mean, we had the problem with the episode"
17:31,400;17:35,520;"because it's like, so two legendary never to be forgotten,"
17:35,520;17:38,200;"plays at least, I mean, maybe three with both kicks,"
17:38,200;17:40,200;"but you know, happened within the last few minutes"
17:40,200;17:41,440;"of the game and it's like now, you know,"
17:41,440;17:44,480;"and then I'm now trying to edit the Pittsburgh the next week"
17:44,480;17:47,400;"and you're like, nobody cares about special teams,"
17:47,400;17:50,240;"but like, I mean, obviously,"
17:50,240;17:55,460;"Bled so coming in plays plays a big part in it, but but you know, it's just it's I mean such an epic game and obviously"
17:55,460;18:01,320;"The people was epic too. So it's just you know, it's that I don't think anything can ever really top that that Raiders win in the snow"
18:01,320;18:03,160;"Yeah, thank you, right"
18:03,160;18:05,160;"so do you have"
18:05,160;18:12,360;"Let's say outside of that well, let's say regular season do you have a favorite Patriots game or favorite Patriots?"
18:12,360;18:13,840;"Oh, I mean right like that"
18:13,840;18:15,360;"That's a good one"
18:15,360;18:20,040;"You know, I'd have to probably go with games that I went to because I lived in California"
18:20,040;18:25,400;"I grew up around here in New England and then I lived in California for 18 years and then I moved back the last"
18:25,400;18:27,320;"four or five years so"
18:27,320;18:30,040;"Going to games was always a special occasion for me"
18:30,040;18:34,360;"So so some of the games that I went to that were great experiences were the oh six"
18:34,360;18:37,720;"Chargers playoff game. I drove down to San Diego for that"
18:37,720;18:42,400;"Had a lot of it's a whole lot. Sorry. I'll tell the quick because it's good"
18:42,840;18:46,240;"So you live in California, live in Los Angeles,"
18:46,240;18:48,920;"and the Patriots beat the Jets,"
18:48,920;18:51,200;"and all of a sudden it dawns on the idiot."
18:51,200;18:53,240;"The, oh, she's the Patriots are coming out here."
18:53,240;18:55,520;"They're gonna have to play the friggin' Chargers"
18:55,520;18:56,720;"with Tom and Sin and Rivers,"
18:56,720;18:58,240;"and I mean, they were a wagon that year."
18:58,240;18:59,080;"- Yeah, they were."
18:59,080;19:02,280;"- So you get word that they're gonna release some tickets"
19:02,280;19:04,400;"to California residents only."
19:04,400;19:06,720;"So, you know, like, oh, hell yeah."
19:06,720;19:08,120;"So get on Ticketmaster, and this is like,"
19:08,120;19:10,360;"you know, the olden days I had all these windows open"
19:10,360;19:11,800;"to Ticketmaster, I mean, I guess it's not the old days."
19:11,800;19:13,760;"It's probably still a perfect day to say."
19:13,760;19:16,200;"I got all these windows open and I wanted to all,"
19:16,200;19:18,000;"and some tickets come up."
19:18,000;19:21,120;"I get them all nice, and I go to check out"
19:21,120;19:22,640;"and the site crashes."
19:22,640;19:24,560;"So I'm probably everybody's been there."
19:24,560;19:25,840;"You think you got them?"
19:25,840;19:28,120;"I go back, I'm looking, no tickets,"
19:28,120;19:30,200;"all the tickets have sold out within five minutes."
19:30,200;19:31,040;"I'm so mad."
19:31,040;19:32,800;"I had them, the computer crash, I lost them."
19:32,800;19:36,200;"So few minutes go by and I'm fuming."
19:36,200;19:37,640;"And I say, all right, you know what?"
19:37,640;19:39,640;"If it happened to me, and my tickets got returned,"
19:39,640;19:42,760;"Maybe I'm just gonna take one more shot."
19:42,760;19:45,040;"So put it in, there's one ticket available."
19:45,040;19:46,840;"I don't even look where it is."
19:46,840;19:47,800;"I just put it in there."
19:47,800;19:49,040;"I'm like, I'm buying it."
19:49,040;19:51,520;"Like, you know, every click is like completely slow,"
19:51,520;19:53,960;"delivered, like trying to get through."
19:53,960;19:55,200;"I get it, I get the tickets."
19:55,200;19:56,800;"You know, I'm like, wait for the email confirmation."
19:56,800;19:58,680;"It comes through and I'm like, all right, well,"
19:58,680;20:00,120;"where am I sitting?"
20:00,120;20:01,200;"Go to look at the ticket."
20:01,200;20:04,000;"I'm nine rows and back of the Patriots bench."
20:04,000;20:06,400;"Like a solo ticket."
20:06,400;20:09,320;"Actually, I think you can see it over my shoulder"
20:09,320;20:11,800;"right here, right there."
20:11,800;20:14,240;"- Oh, right, right."
20:14,240;20:16,640;"- My wife made me a nice thing with like the cover,"
20:16,640;20:19,040;"my ticket, the picture from the game, but I mean,"
20:19,040;20:20,880;"it was, I went solo, I was in the middle"
20:20,880;20:22,680;"of a bunch of Patreon fans, you all know."
20:22,680;20:25,520;"Well, you guys will get there in about what, two years."
20:25,520;20:26,360;"You don't know how that came."
20:26,360;20:27,200;"- Give or take."
20:27,200;20:28,520;"(laughing)"
20:28,520;20:29,520;"- But it was awesome."
20:29,520;20:31,720;"So that game, and then also, I came back once"
20:31,720;20:33,720;"for the 2014 game against the Broncos,"
20:33,720;20:37,440;"and my buddy Fitsi and Peyton Manning,"
20:37,440;20:38,600;"they ran him off the field."
20:38,600;20:40,360;"It was the, you know, the Gronk one-handed catch,"
20:40,360;20:42,320;"the Edelman part return that we've seen so much of."
20:42,320;20:44,600;"And that was just from the blog stuff,"
20:44,600;20:46,000;"we had some giveaways."
20:46,000;20:47,960;"They gave us a bunch of stuff to give away in the parking lot."
20:47,960;20:51,880;"So it was like me, Nick, Fitzy Stevens, his buddy,"
20:51,880;20:54,680;"George, who he does all the, the Pats fans' videos with"
20:54,680;20:55,520;"and Jerry Thorin."
20:55,520;20:57,680;"And we were running around the parking lot,"
20:57,680;20:59,880;"just spreading Patriot joy to tailgaters,"
20:59,880;21:00,760;"giving stuff away."
21:00,760;21:02,800;"And then we went in and watched the Patriots beat up"
21:02,800;21:03,640;"on paid manning."
21:03,640;21:06,440;"So it was, those are the two, I think that come to mind"
21:06,440;21:08,440;"as random favorites of my own."
21:08,440;21:09,560;"Yeah, those are good ones."
21:09,560;21:10,280;"I like that."
21:10,280;21:11,080;"Yeah."
21:11,080;21:14,440;"Yeah, being a one of those playoff games, those comebacks,"
21:14,440;21:15,800;"speaking of Troy Brown, right?"
21:15,800;21:16,360;"Mm."
21:16,360;21:17,880;"Chase from Marlon McCrae."
21:17,880;21:19,080;"That's a round game right there."
21:19,080;21:20,440;"Yeah, exactly."
21:20,440;21:21,240;"Thought it was over."
21:21,240;21:22,120;"Thought it was over."
21:22,120;21:23,160;"Yep."
21:23,160;21:24,520;"Never over when you got Troy Brown out there."
21:24,520;21:26,760;"I was like, hey, when you see Troy, tell him we said, hey."
21:26,760;21:27,720;"Yeah."
21:27,720;21:29,800;"I've never said a word to him."
21:29,800;21:31,160;"I've been there two and a half years."
21:31,160;21:33,160;"You should say, love, all right."
21:33,160;21:34,840;"You know, these guys who have a podcast say."
21:34,840;21:36,280;"Yeah."
21:36,280;21:37,600;"Yeah, that's our goal for this part."
21:37,600;21:39,480;"I think the last thing is also Brown."
21:39,480;21:40,480;"Yeah, got you."
21:40,480;21:41,880;"You got to get them on great."
21:41,880;21:43,200;"Brother from another mother."
21:43,200;21:43,960;"That's right."
21:43,960;21:49,240;"All right, Steve, you got any questions?"
21:49,240;21:50,920;"I'm good."
21:50,920;21:51,760;"You're good."
21:51,760;21:52,240;"All right."
21:52,240;21:53,720;"How do you guys feel about the game?"
21:53,720;21:55,560;"So let me ask you one question before I get out of here."
21:55,560;21:57,760;"That was going to be my next question."
21:57,760;21:58,840;"You got any questions for us?"
21:58,840;22:01,560;"Yeah, how you feel about the game this weekend?"
22:01,560;22:04,800;"Where your allegiances lie right now is to crazy"
22:04,800;22:08,680;"Patriot fans because I'm in a weird position, you know, I work for the team."
22:08,680;22:12,600;"So I have to be kind of positive, but a lot of people there that I work with, you know,"
22:12,600;22:14,440;"are also very like argumentative."
22:14,440;22:17,600;"It's like I'm going to deal with all that, but it's been a rough week."
22:17,600;22:20,440;"And I mean, I guess I'll just throw out what I'm where I'm at."
22:20,440;22:22,000;"I've just tried to appreciate it."
22:22,000;22:23,600;"Everybody wants to talk about how it ended."
22:23,600;22:25,400;"I want to remember the good times."
22:25,400;22:28,400;"It's crazy that we're going to get to see these guys play against each other."
22:28,400;22:31,720;"For me, it's going to be the last time I'm probably ever going to see them in person,"
22:31,720;22:34,600;"which I've been incredibly lucky to do a bunch of times now."
22:34,600;22:36,680;"So that's how I'm trying to go into it."
22:36,680;22:39,120;"And whatever happens, patriots are one in three,"
22:39,120;22:40,120;"it is what it is."
22:40,120;22:47,120;"- Yeah, I think I echo Julian Elegman's sentiments"
22:47,120;22:50,720;"about how this is, it feels like a divorce"
22:50,720;22:52,760;"and like having to go to a picnic with both parents"
22:52,760;22:54,080;"or something like that."
22:54,080;22:59,880;"Like it just feels, part of it just feels really awkward,"
23:00,880;23:04,660;"especially 'cause you know how much pressure"
23:04,660;23:05,780;"the media's gonna put on it."
23:05,780;23:09,800;"Like isn't like the morning shows are all showing up."
23:09,800;23:11,700;"Like the national morning shows are doing this show"
23:11,700;23:14,520;"from Gillette Stadium or something like it's--"
23:14,520;23:16,440;"- I can confirm, I can confirm that."
23:16,440;23:22,360;"- It's like Super Bowl levels of just like attention"
23:22,360;23:25,320;"which I think I actually thought of about this"
23:25,320;23:26,540;"in the shower this morning."
23:27,960;23:37,320;"The one good thing about this is that Mac Jones will get that sort of environment and that"
23:37,320;23:41,960;"sort of like playoff atmosphere against a really good team."
23:41,960;23:45,360;"And in the end of the day, it doesn't really matter that much in the standings because"
23:45,360;23:49,920;"losing the game early in the season to an NFC team is like, who the fuck cares?"
23:49,920;23:51,720;"Week four against the NFC South, right?"
23:51,720;23:52,720;"Right, exactly."
23:52,720;23:53,720;"Yeah."
23:53,720;23:54,720;"So I mean, it's fine."
23:54,720;24:00,880;"Mac will show us something and maybe he will be the next Tom Brady or even the next True Bloodsoe or"
24:00,880;24:03,840;"Hey, I'll just take the next four years"
24:03,840;24:08,160;"He's a solid quarterback that maybe win you some games and I mean I'll just say too like I mean it"
24:08,160;24:11,520;"It's been really cool getting to watch him develop and I mean from the"
24:11,520;24:15,120;"In the spring just the progress he's made has been"
24:15,120;24:22,800;"Amazing and you know just instantly having kind of pocket presence and you know delivering accurate throws under pressure"
24:22,880;24:28,080;"I mean, it's, you know, obviously he's getting a super crash course right now, but, um,"
24:28,080;24:31,520;"but just having, you know, seen him a lot this summer. So I'm, you know, we've done"
24:31,520;24:34,960;"affiliate. So I'm in the joint practices there. So I'm against the Giants, which he had, you know,"
24:34,960;24:39,760;"a great day when Cam was out. So I, I, I continue everything that's kind of happened the first"
24:39,760;24:44,160;"three weeks. I'm just excited about that Jones and getting, you know, see what, what happens."
24:44,160;24:47,280;"I don't know if he's going to be the next 20 year quarterback here, but I think he's shown"
24:47,280;24:50,960;"enough. He'll be the next few years. He's somebody we can be excited about watching."
24:50,960;25:01,160;"And even just watching the 2001, 2, 3, 4 seasons, like there's the, I mean, Tom Brady back then isn't Tom Brady who he is now, you know?"
25:01,160;25:08,900;"So I mean, he's still even in the game we're going to talk about after this is making very unbrady like mistakes sort of thing."
25:08,900;25:20,160;"So I mean, you kind of have to remember that like he hasn't always been this infallible football God and that like there's going to be some bumps in the road for whoever the new guy is."
25:20,280;25:22,200;"Even if he does end up being that Tom Brady."
25:22,200;25:24,400;"Yeah, we just love to see that clutch gene."
25:24,400;25:26,120;"I think that's what was cool about Brady"
25:26,120;25:28,440;"was that he always had the ability down the stretch"
25:28,440;25:29,480;"to make the big plays."
25:29,480;25:31,280;"And then that showed up right away."
25:31,280;25:34,120;"It wasn't 2007 Brady, right out of the gate."
25:34,120;25:38,480;"But, you know, he had, I think, right, the next week,"
25:38,480;25:40,480;"it'll be, I think, the anniversary of the Chargers,"
25:40,480;25:42,440;"or maybe two weeks from now, be the Chargers game,"
25:42,440;25:44,280;"that they won an overtime where he threw the ball"
25:44,280;25:46,000;"like 50 times in like week four."
25:46,000;25:50,000;"So, yeah, it's, I'd love to see Matt get that kind of opportunity"
25:50,000;25:54,480;"to pull a win out, maybe in the last moments, I don't know about this weekend, but maybe"
25:54,480;25:55,480;"next weekend."
25:55,480;25:56,480;"Yeah, you're right."
25:56,480;26:00,840;"It's going to be interesting to see him in that situation and in this high pressure situation"
26:00,840;26:01,840;"do."
26:01,840;26:02,840;"Yeah."
26:02,840;26:04,960;"I think it's close, but Brady wins."
26:04,960;26:07,920;"And I can love the Patriots and I can love Tom Brady."
26:07,920;26:10,600;"I don't see why these are mutually exclusive."
26:10,600;26:12,600;"Because I go against each other, Steve."
26:12,600;26:14,560;"So I want the Patriots to win, but I don't want to."
26:14,560;26:15,560;"Pick a side."
26:15,560;26:16,560;"Yeah."
26:16,560;26:18,280;"Tom, my thing is that I just don't care about the box."
26:18,280;26:20,280;"Like I just like I watched how Brady play in the box."
26:20,280;26:21,280;"It's great."
26:21,280;26:22,280;"I just don't care."
26:22,280;26:23,280;"I can't move to the box."
26:23,280;26:24,280;"I don't feel anything."
26:24,280;26:25,280;"Yeah."
26:25,280;26:26,280;"Yeah."
26:26,280;26:27,280;"I feel the same way."
26:27,280;26:31,280;"Like it's, it's like rooting for like the Arizona Diamondbacks."
26:31,280;26:34,280;"It's like they, are they even a real team?"
26:34,280;26:36,280;"Like I don't even, are they triple A?"
26:36,280;26:37,280;"I'm not sure."
26:37,280;26:39,280;"That's kind of how the bucks feel."
26:39,280;26:43,280;"They feel like a, like a Disney ride that turned into a football team to me."
26:43,280;26:44,280;"Right."
26:44,280;26:46,280;"To be over soon."
26:46,280;26:47,560;"soon. No, no watch though."
26:47,560;26:49,040;"It is."
26:49,040;26:50,040;"It's good."
26:50,040;26:52,760;"But it's just Tom Brady that you watching, you're not watching it for the box."
26:52,760;26:53,040;"Are you?"
26:53,040;26:56,680;"Now I get Tom Brady on my fantasy team and I can put bets on him because"
26:56,680;27:00,840;"I used to not do any of that shit because I don't need to be all the way in, you know?"
27:00,840;27:02,360;"That's a good coping mechanism."
27:02,360;27:03,680;"I deal with it through Madden."
27:03,680;27:07,200;"I just I sack Tom Brady a bunch of times."
27:07,200;27:08,600;"Like the Patriots in it."
27:08,600;27:10,960;"And I feel that she can get to him in Madden."
27:10,960;27:13,400;"Well, we can put on easy otherwise."
27:13,400;27:13,880;"No, it's not."
27:13,880;27:15,580;"- Yeah, I'll have to."
27:15,580;27:16,420;"And even then."
27:16,420;27:19,100;"- All right, Mike."
27:19,100;27:21,140;"Well, thank you for, for giving us your time."
27:21,140;27:22,420;"This has been fantastic."
27:22,420;27:23,260;"- Yeah, guys."
27:23,260;27:27,300;"- Can't wait to hear the rest of the 2001 Super Bowl sound"
27:27,300;27:28,340;"Odyssey."
27:28,340;27:29,420;"So look forward to that."
27:29,420;27:31,180;"- Appreciate it guys."
27:31,180;27:33,620;"And yeah, hey, hit me up when you get to the '06 Chargers"
27:33,620;27:34,460;"game."
27:34,460;27:35,300;"I'll come back, I'll do that."
27:35,300;27:37,220;"I'll be happy to do that game with you guys."
27:37,220;27:39,980;"I'll give you my whole live drunken perspective."
27:39,980;27:41,740;"It was awesome."
27:41,740;27:42,580;"- Perfect."
27:42,580;27:45,900;"like to hear. All right, Mike, we'll talk to you soon, then."
27:45,900;27:46,980;"All right, guys, thanks for having me."
27:46,980;27:48,060;"All right, see you later."
27:48,060;27:52,540;"Tune in next week to see how much of a blubbering little bitch"
27:52,540;27:56,380;"Greg is on the Patriots dynasty podcast."
27:56,380;27:58,420;"Well, that was the wrong button I meant to do."
27:58,420;28:02,780;"But also, they bought work."
28:02,780;28:07,820;"They do. All right, so there's hope for us yet, Steve."
28:07,820;28:11,380;"If Mike just so can get himself into one Patriots place,"
28:12,060;28:15,660;"We should be able to get a word with Troy Brown."
28:15,660;28:21,100;"I think that's where you know the strategy is just work as many angles as you can find Andy."
28:21,100;28:23,740;"Right. And this is what we're doing. So so far so good."
28:23,740;28:28,460;"Pumping every every person who comes on with you know, yo, yo, let me not let him know."
28:28,460;28:31,820;"Yo, it's just how I do it."
28:31,820;28:37,260;"I love how blunt you are by with literally every single person that comes on to like,"
28:37,260;28:41,020;"Hey, do you know Troy Brown? What's his phone number? I need to text him."
28:41,020;28:42,720;"- But it did, dude."
28:42,720;28:45,380;"- So I guess, I mean, it hasn't worked yet,"
28:45,380;28:46,980;"but you do you."
28:46,980;28:48,420;"- Doesn't mean I won't."
28:48,420;28:49,260;"- That's true."
28:49,260;28:53,620;"All right, we should probably talk about these 2004 Patriots"
28:53,620;28:58,620;"because it's put me in a very current game mood."
28:58,620;29:02,500;"I think we may have to release this episode"
29:02,500;29:05,300;"a little earlier than our normal Tuesday"
29:05,300;29:07,020;"because I feel like it should be released"
29:07,020;29:08,960;"before the Buccaneers game."
29:09,900;29:10,740;"- Sure."
29:10,740;29:16,680;"So because this is the end of like a streak of its own,"
29:16,680;29:19,980;"that we're coming to you."
29:19,980;29:24,980;"This is the first loss that we have watched in 21 weeks"
29:24,980;29:30,180;"of doing a podcast, one episode."
29:30,180;29:31,540;"- I only watched the first quarter"
29:31,540;29:34,580;"and then the highlights."
29:34,580;29:38,220;"- I mean, so let's talk about a watchability score"
29:38,220;29:39,900;"I feel like that's inappropriate."
29:39,900;29:41,820;"Uh, very low."
29:41,820;29:44,140;"Maybe I will give it one and a half."
29:44,140;29:45,100;"I'm parties."
29:45,100;29:46,420;"Oh, not even a half."
29:46,420;29:48,140;"There's there's no redeeming futures on this."
29:48,140;29:55,860;"I I was actually I was looking for, um, for highlights to put on the website for this."
29:55,860;30:00,860;"And outside of the two touchdowns that happened that there aren't any."
30:00,860;30:01,860;"Come on, dude."
30:01,860;30:03,940;"Put every one of David given sketches up there."
30:03,940;30:04,620;"He was a beast."
30:04,620;30:07,580;"He had eight catches, two touchdowns over on yards."
30:08,100;30:10,740;"He did, but I mean, sweet catches too."
30:10,740;30:17,140;"He had one, but they, but once he started making the catches, it was almost garbage time."
30:17,140;30:17,620;"So they stopped."
30:17,620;30:18,180;"So replays."
30:18,180;30:19,540;"His hat touchdown wasn't good."
30:19,540;30:20,580;"It was good."
30:20,580;30:23,380;"No, I'm saying, but I'm saying by the time he scored it,"
30:23,380;30:29,780;"the coverage, the TV coverage has decided it was garbage time."
30:29,780;30:30,980;"And so they weren't showing replays."
30:30,980;30:34,500;"So he had this one like super catch on the sideline."
30:34,500;30:36,180;"That was his first catch."
30:36,180;30:37,380;"First down."
30:37,380;30:39,660;"Yeah. And why wasn't it for a first down?"
30:39,660;30:43,300;"Because it was like fourth or third or second and 40 or whatever."
30:43,300;30:45,540;"It was second in 24 and it went for 12."
30:45,540;30:46,140;"Yeah."
30:46,140;30:47,940;"I'm ready to get it back all the time."
30:47,940;30:48,540;"Yeah."
30:48,540;30:53,180;"And it was a toe tap catch in double coverage over Troy"
30:53,180;30:55,980;"Paul Amalu and they didn't show replay."
30:55,980;30:59,500;"So just like they didn't even like mention that he actually caught it."
30:59,500;31:02,260;"Like, oh, we're not sure if you caught that one."
31:02,260;31:04,500;"And then like a referee's place the ball down."
31:04,500;31:06,020;"Yeah."
31:06,020;31:08,020;"And so they just like kept on talking like, okay."
31:08,020;31:10,720;"So that play will be on there, Steve, just for you."
31:10,720;31:11,820;"All right, good."
31:11,820;31:14,520;"I'm saying there was very, very little break."
31:14,520;31:16,120;"That was the only little bit."
31:16,120;31:20,020;"I'd say there was one other bright spot for the Patriots in this game."
31:20,020;31:27,220;"And that would be Bethel Johnson who was literally the only person not having a nightmare day"
31:27,220;31:32,220;"because he fumbled that kick return the long when he broke, he fumbled it right as he went out of bounds."
31:32,220;31:34,320;"Hey, he did it out of bounds."
31:34,320;31:34,820;"It's fine."
31:34,820;31:36,300;"- That is fucking up though."
31:36,300;31:38,940;"He also had that illegal substitution penalty"
31:38,940;31:41,140;"because he didn't come, when he substituted,"
31:41,140;31:43,420;"he didn't come inside the numbers."
31:43,420;31:45,740;"So wiped out like a seven yard rod because."
31:45,740;31:47,060;"- Yeah."
31:47,060;31:47,900;"- Which."
31:47,900;31:49,660;"- That's the dumbest rule of all time."
31:49,660;31:50,500;"- Yeah."
31:50,500;31:53,780;"But let's actually talk about the caveats to this game"
31:53,780;31:57,340;"before we like get into all the bad stuff that happened"
31:57,340;32:01,820;"because the pagers came in with,"
32:01,820;32:04,420;"could we call it a skeleton crew?"
32:04,420;32:06,180;"They're just injured there out."
32:06,180;32:08,060;"Dion branch that I'm a one wide receiver."
32:08,060;32:08,780;"He's out with injury."
32:08,780;32:12,900;"Troy Brown is back, but it has not"
32:12,900;32:14,500;"looking his same self quite yet."
32:14,500;32:16,540;"This is his first game back in a while."
32:16,540;32:18,660;"I think maybe the first game we've seen in the season."
32:18,660;32:20,900;"Yes, I don't remember."
32:20,900;32:21,740;"It's been a while."
32:21,740;32:25,940;"I think we may have seen like early on, but he's been out for quite a few games."
32:25,940;32:30,060;"Tom Ashworth, they're starting right tackle."
32:30,060;32:31,060;"He's out."
32:31,300;32:35,540;"And the big one is Corey Dillon is not playing in this game because"
32:35,540;32:40,500;"he suffered an injury in practice practice."
32:40,500;32:44,420;"I think I said, yeah, like a leg injury, but he played last week on a leg injury too."
32:44,420;32:47,380;"So I'm wondering if he just kind of like re aggravated something because they've"
32:47,380;32:51,100;"been talking about him in an injury past couple of weeks, but"
32:51,100;32:54,500;"which if you think about it, I'm assuming he plays next week."
32:54,500;32:59,900;"I believe so, but he has like 1600 yards this year and he does it on one last game."
33:00,580;33:05,380;"Yeah. Yeah. And I think there was another game where he went out early too."
33:05,380;33:08,300;"So he kind of did it. And yeah, he did. Yeah."
33:08,300;33:11,500;"So it's the first game, I think. Yeah. I think it was. Yeah."
33:11,500;33:13,700;"It was first. It was early in the season. Yeah."
33:13,700;33:18,140;"So tough. We start. And then on defense,"
33:18,140;33:24,500;"the Patriots decided that going up against a red hot rookie Ben Roth"
33:24,500;33:27,940;"as perger without a defensive backfield was the way to go."
33:29,180;33:31,980;"The Tyrone pool was out injured to begin with,"
33:31,980;33:36,220;"and then Ty Law went down on the second drive of the game,"
33:36,220;33:38,180;"like pulled up hurt and tried to like limp off the field"
33:38,180;33:39,780;"and couldn't even like get all the way off,"
33:39,780;33:41,020;"had to get crowded off."
33:41,020;33:43,660;"- I believe that is Ty Law's last map"
33:43,660;33:44,820;"in a Patriots uniform."
33:44,820;33:47,180;"- What?"
33:47,180;33:48,020;"- Isn't he done after?"
33:48,020;33:50,060;"He's not on the Patriots next year,"
33:50,060;33:52,100;"'cause he's hurt the rest of this year."
33:52,100;33:54,180;"- Is he? He's done for the season?"
33:54,180;33:56,940;"- This isn't a single injury that he heard some pretty good."
33:56,940;33:58,540;"- You might be right."
33:58,540;34:00,540;"Oh, I didn't even put that together, but shit."
34:00,540;34:05,820;"That sucks because it will get into it in a little bit more detail,"
34:05,820;34:08,500;"but that was the beginning of the end for this game."
34:08,500;34:09,020;"Yeah."
34:09,020;34:11,340;"It was just not a seamless first start, I think."
34:11,340;34:13,900;"Asante's"
34:13,900;34:14,820;"I run pools out."
34:14,820;34:15,540;"Yeah."
34:15,540;34:17,500;"So he may, yeah, he may be getting his first start."
34:17,500;34:18,500;"And I know he's played before."
34:18,500;34:20,460;"This one is our top corner with Tyla."
34:20,460;34:21,740;"Right."
34:21,740;34:27,700;"And Tyla's replacement is Randall Gay, who got absolutely torched in this game."
34:27,740;34:32,220;"I felt like every time there was a completion, number 21 was there behind the receiver."
34:32,220;34:35,740;"Well, the very next play after Tyler went out there through that bomb, the"
34:35,740;34:36,500;"practical burrows."
34:36,500;34:39,340;"Well, yeah, yeah, I want to get into that in a second, but, uh,"
34:39,340;34:39,900;"I want to get into it."
34:39,900;34:43,260;"We just after that, but, but Randall Gay also went out injured."
34:43,260;34:46,780;"So they were, they were talking about the only defensive backs that the"
34:46,780;34:49,620;"pages had left were Dexter Reed and Gerard Cherry."
34:49,620;34:50,100;"Yeah."
34:50,100;34:51,420;"See, that's what I didn't watch this game."
34:51,420;34:51,980;"Yeah."
34:51,980;34:53,620;"And I wrote down Dexter Reed."
34:53,620;34:55,100;"I don't even know if I spelled his last name right."
34:55,780;35:00,120;"I couldn't tell you because I don't remember a Dexter read on this team, but he was out"
35:00,120;35:03,300;"there in the end of the game."
35:03,300;35:07,340;"But this game, I mean, for all it was, it started out."
35:07,340;35:09,940;"All right, the page is four, so three and out and then get a field goal."
35:09,940;35:18,020;"But the Pittsburgh offense, I think it had been playing pretty well, mainly Ben Rothsberger."
35:18,020;35:23,100;"This is rookie season where he goes a bunch of games undefeated because they were talking"
35:23,100;35:30,540;"even at the beginning of this one where the winning streaks to open your like rookie career"
35:30,540;35:34,780;"is six games going six and oh before your first loss."
35:34,780;35:43,100;"This is fantastic. It was Mike Cruise-Check, who was a Steelers quarterback in 1976."
35:43,100;35:48,700;"Who's the guy that went six and oh. And then Phil Sims and Ben Ross' burger, I think,"
35:48,700;35:51,420;"I think we're both at four game win streaks at this point."
35:51,420;35:57,100;"But Mike Cruz-Jack in his six game win streak"
35:57,100;36:02,100;"to start his career had a touch down reception differential"
36:02,100;36:04,620;"of zero to three."
36:04,620;36:08,020;"So zero touchdowns, three interceptions."
36:08,020;36:11,140;"And he'd be writing of 67.9 in those six games"
36:11,140;36:12,380;"and they went six and out."
36:12,380;36:16,460;"- They need like not ever start more than that either."
36:16,460;36:18,260;"Like that's like his entire record."
36:18,260;36:19,260;"I think it might be. Yeah."
36:19,260;36:20,900;"When they implied I didn't look it up."
36:20,900;36:21,980;"Yeah, I didn't either."
36:21,980;36:26,420;"Because I spent as little time on this game as I possibly could after the first quarter."
36:26,420;36:30,660;"Like you said, Steelers don't lose again until they lose to us."
36:30,660;36:36,660;"Correct. Yeah. This is the time when Seals go 15 and one, which is their best ever record."
36:36,660;36:41,140;"Big Ben must not have been starting for their first loss of receiving whenever that was."
36:41,140;36:46,500;"No. So yeah, Big Ben came in for an injured."
36:46,500;36:51,460;"really how was it? No, it was it was after Cordell Stewart."
36:51,460;36:57,460;"Um, Tom and Alex down here. Someone like that. Yeah. Uh,"
36:57,460;37:01,780;"what's that check, Greg? Yeah, well, the fuck is Greg. Goddamn it."
37:01,780;37:10,420;"Deliberate. It is Tom and Maddox. Oh, yeah. So it is Tom and Maddox."
37:10,420;37:14,900;"Yeah, he started season two, one, and then Ben Rossburg came in and went 13 and no,"
37:14,900;37:21,780;"the regular season. Didn't know it was a game. I think he came halfway through one of those games"
37:21,780;37:30,420;"too. So he came in and the Steelers are actually the first AFC team ever to go 15 and 1."
37:30,420;37:36,900;"Obviously not the best ever record in the AFC and then I get broken in 2007-ish."
37:39,700;37:42,900;"But they were actually talking about this last week"
37:42,900;37:47,020;"in last week's broadcast where the Steelers were watching"
37:47,020;37:48,580;"the Jets Patriots game last week"
37:48,580;37:49,740;"'cause both teams were undefeated"
37:49,740;37:52,120;"and they were rooting for the Patriots"
37:52,120;37:55,340;"'cause they wanted to be the ones to end the streak."
37:55,340;37:59,420;"So it was that kind of Steelers team back with the chin."
37:59,420;38:00,260;"What's his name?"
38:00,260;38:02,060;"- Everyone wants the champs Andy."
38:02,060;38:03,500;"- Bill Cowan. - They want the champs."
38:03,500;38:04,500;"- That's true. - Really, that's true."
38:04,500;38:06,460;"- They thought they wanted the champs"
38:06,460;38:08,140;"and then they got the champs in the playoffs."
38:08,140;38:10,660;"So they ask him for that too, because it didn't work out for him."
38:10,660;38:13,300;"I don't think they were, but maybe they were."
38:13,300;38:14,740;"We'll find out what we get there."
38:14,740;38:19,700;"But yeah, so Bill Cowar and his team were rooting for the Patriots because they wanted"
38:19,700;38:22,260;"to be the ones that end this."
38:22,260;38:26,100;"And they are actually coming off a bi-week this week too."
38:26,100;38:28,100;"So everybody's healthy."
38:28,100;38:33,900;"Playing this beat up Patriots team who just had a brawl with the Jets the week before."
38:33,900;38:35,500;"You know, difficult shit."
38:35,500;38:42,200;"So started off all right, Paige just led this game three nothing believe it or not."
38:42,200;38:47,980;"And deep as him looking good, Ben Ross burger getting chased around not getting sacked"
38:47,980;38:53,820;"because second Ben Ross is burgers like sack in a Mac truck."
38:53,820;38:57,760;"But getting harassed enough so they went three out the first two drives."
38:57,760;39:03,600;"And then they almost had a chance to pin the Steelers at their own three yard line."
39:03,600;39:09,440;"But that's when the issues started and the ball got kind of the whoever the gunner was"
39:09,440;39:12,760;"there tried to doubt it, but accidentally booted into the end zone."
39:12,760;39:14,640;"So it's a touch back."
39:14,640;39:20,560;"And even then, so here's I actually printed out the drive sheet for what happened."
39:20,560;39:27,040;"Because we're talking five minutes and 43 seconds left in the first quarter."
39:27,040;39:31,480;"And Ross Burger just completed a pass of Boris, Plexico Boris."
39:31,480;39:34,080;"What he was called for offense pass interference."
39:34,080;39:37,720;"So it's first and 20 Pittsburgh on their own 28."
39:37,720;39:40,840;"And then Ross Burger hits Hines Ward,"
39:40,840;39:47,200;"who was open because Ty Law injured his ankle"
39:47,200;39:49,200;"and might never play up in pages again."
39:49,200;39:56,040;"Two plays later, Ross's Burger hits Plaxco"
39:56,040;39:59,960;"for 47-yard touchdown over Ty Law's replacement,"
39:59,960;40:03,640;"Randall Gay, Paige get the ball back."
40:03,640;40:07,200;"First play from scrimmage after the kickoff."
40:07,200;40:08,760;"Tom Brady is sacked by Joey Porter,"
40:08,760;40:13,760;"hit from behind, ballswords out and steals recover."
40:13,760;40:20,240;"And then like four plays later, Ben Ross-Burger hits"
40:20,240;40:22,760;"Plaxco Barris again for a four year touchdown."
40:22,760;40:23,800;"So that's two touchdowns."
40:23,800;40:24,960;"Yeah."
40:24,960;40:27,240;"We're still in the first quarter by the way."
40:27,240;40:32,400;"Pays get the ball back with 22 seconds left in the first quarter."
40:32,400;40:34,080;"Gonna try and make something happen."
40:34,080;40:38,440;"Brady gets intercepted by Deshae Townsend."
40:38,440;40:40,880;"And that is return for touchdown."
40:40,880;40:42,520;"Why are you making me relive this in yet?"
40:42,520;40:45,680;"Told you I already watched the first quarter and that's why we're doing this."
40:45,680;40:47,040;"We're doing this for the listeners."
40:47,040;40:49,200;"They need to either."
40:49,200;40:51,240;"They need to wallow in our misery."
40:51,240;40:52,240;"A body bag."
40:52,240;40:55,480;"And the pages were in by the end of the first quarter."
40:55,800;40:57,820;"The steals have now scored three touchdowns"
40:57,820;41:00,820;"in three minutes and 33 seconds to end the first quarter."
41:00,820;41:03,820;"Except the first quarter is not over."
41:03,820;41:06,220;"There's still nine seconds left."
41:06,220;41:09,060;"So the pace of the ball back, kick return."
41:09,060;41:13,920;"The first play is called dead because it's a false start."
41:13,920;41:18,300;"And then they run the last play of the first quarter,"
41:18,300;41:22,360;"which is Kevin Falk firm, negative two yards."
41:22,360;41:23,820;"And then Tom Brady gets sacked"
41:23,820;41:29,740;"the first play of the second quarter, a Joey Porter for 10 yards, it's now third and 27."
41:29,740;41:36,220;"So that is how this game turned. And that's kind of all you really need to know. Like"
41:36,220;41:37,220;"that was it."
41:37,220;41:40,860;"The ball game too. First play of the second half, they get the ball. Oh yeah."
41:40,860;41:46,860;"They got it within like two touchdowns and Kevin fault strip of the ball after it catches"
41:46,860;41:48,780;"it and they get it and."
41:48,780;41:52,300;"Second play of the half. Exactly. Then they turn around and score another touchdown and"
41:52,300;41:54,300;"And it's 34."
41:54,300;41:55,580;"Now worth watching."
41:55,580;41:56,580;"10."
41:56,580;41:57,580;"Yeah, game over."
41:57,580;41:58,880;"3110, game over."
41:58,880;42:05,220;"So there are two Brady to give us touchdowns in this."
42:05,220;42:08,780;"The second one is an absolute dime, like you said."
42:08,780;42:10,220;"Givens a suit."
42:10,220;42:14,300;"So if you want to catch that on past.c.com, just watch those highlights."
42:14,300;42:17,300;"Like don't even, I think we link to the YouTube highlights."
42:17,300;42:18,300;"Don't even bother."
42:18,300;42:21,540;"Yeah, just watch the given touchdowns."
42:21,540;42:24,600;"I did actually go to the full game and then go watch"
42:24,600;42:26,880;"the Dippin's touchdowns in the entire day."
42:26,880;42:29,880;"- Yeah, they're sweet to the second one."
42:29,880;42:32,760;"The second one reminded me of the one Greg was talking"
42:32,760;42:36,440;"about with David Patton against the Bears"
42:36,440;42:38,880;"and that huge comeback in '02."
42:38,880;42:42,760;"- Even those highlights on YouTube don't even have them though."
42:42,760;42:45,080;"So you have to go actually and begin to watch it."
42:45,080;42:46,480;"- Right, right, yeah."
42:46,480;42:48,160;"- The only place you can find is"
42:48,160;42:50,240;"patreetsdynesthe.info."
42:51,200;42:54,080;"past.nc.com now, easy to remember."
42:54,080;42:55,600;"Yeah, they both work, but yes."
42:55,600;42:58,760;"past.nc.com is easier to remember."
42:58,760;43:00,200;"- Past.com still work?"
43:00,200;43:01,320;"'Cause that's what I tell people."
43:01,320;43:02,920;"- Yeah, past.com still works."
43:02,920;43:05,160;"That's how you get to the podcast page on the website."
43:05,160;43:06,000;"- Yeah."
43:06,000;43:08,360;"- Still tell people that it's the same website."
43:08,360;43:10,400;"- I don't even put it, I just do it like using my voice."
43:10,400;43:11,360;"I tell people."
43:11,360;43:13,160;"- Yeah, past.com, baby."
43:13,160;43:19,120;"So I think we should probably"
43:21,120;43:22,880;"get a sense of what."
43:22,880;43:25,920;"Bell check thought of this game."
43:25,920;43:29,120;"That was on the prime time highlight his interview."
43:29,120;43:34,040;"Sounds like him now."
43:34,040;43:34,960;"Doesn't sound any different."
43:34,960;43:36,920;"Right. So."
43:36,920;43:39,840;"Well, Bill Bell check, think about that."
43:39,840;43:42,720;"They are coaches."
43:42,720;43:43,520;"They outplayed us."
43:43,520;43:46,200;"They did a lot of things right."
43:46,200;43:47,680;"And they certainly deserve to win."
43:47,680;43:49,400;"And they won convincingly."
43:50,600;43:52,360;"We weren't very good in any phase of the game."
43:52,360;43:54,480;"Didn't do much anything right."
43:54,480;43:59,160;"Anytime to give up 34 points, especially on the road."
43:59,160;44:00,960;"It may be hard to win in those."
44:00,960;44:04,760;"How is this about to cry?"
44:04,760;44:11,080;"Can you imagine if like you had a bad day at work, then your boss comes out and"
44:11,080;44:14,520;"says that to the media, like you are toast tomorrow."
44:14,520;44:19,520;"I mean, I'm, I'm sure he's actually somewhat glad that the streak ended."
44:19,800;44:22,840;"A, that it ended so people would stop talking about it and asking questions about it."
44:22,840;44:23,920;"Maybe."
44:23,920;44:28,840;"And B, that ended in such a blow up way where they made a million mistakes, right?"
44:28,840;44:30,840;"That he can just say, well, they're not perfect."
44:30,840;44:31,560;"Yeah."
44:31,560;44:33,280;"And that could be one of those, yeah, rest show."
44:33,280;44:33,800;"Yeah."
44:33,800;44:41,640;"Where it's one of those games where you kind of like the 2001 game that David"
44:41,640;44:46,080;"Pat talked about in his past from the past podcast."
44:46,880;44:54,120;"And he's talking about the thing that stuck with him in 2001 the most was when they got blown out by Miami. Remember that game?"
44:54,120;44:56,680;"I think it was like right after the"
44:56,680;45:03,720;"either right before or right after. Oh, no, it was right after the Brady's first start. It's his second start."
45:03,720;45:07,440;"Yeah. And they had beaten the the Colts in his first start."
45:07,440;45:16,600;"And then they got their doors blown off in Miami in 2001 and Belichick when everybody like they, you know, torn a bits in the film room."
45:16,600;45:24,600;"But then when it went out to the field, there was a, like a whole dug at the end of one of the practice fields."
45:24,600;45:29,600;"And Balletrek took the football, was like, this was the game ball from last game."
45:29,600;45:32,600;"And they just fucking buried it. It's like, so it's all done."
45:32,600;45:36,600;"Like we're done talking about, we're done thinking about it, we're moving on next week."
45:36,600;45:38,600;"Like it sucked moving on."
45:38,600;45:43,600;"And Pat's like, that was the moment I realized that like, we're going to be alright this year."
45:43,600;45:46,160;"this year because we could bounce back from something like that."
45:46,160;45:48,800;"I fuck yeah."
45:48,800;45:53,800;"Maybe we'll do that after this Brady at Pat's game."
45:53,800;45:55,400;"Why don't you can you though?"
45:55,400;45:56,960;"They're synthetic fields now."
45:56,960;46:00,680;"Oh, maybe the practice fields are somewhere in the West Stadium"
46:00,680;46:01,480;"with action there."
46:01,480;46:01,960;"Maybe."
46:01,960;46:04,640;"Yeah, you got to find like, oh, in the parking lot there, you know,"
46:04,640;46:06,400;"Barry in front of TV 12 fitness."
46:06,400;46:09,600;"Oh, that's not bad."
46:09,600;46:11,160;"Like we're under the sign or something."
46:13,520;46:18,620;"I like it. I like it. Yeah. I mean, don't watch this game is that's basically what"
46:18,620;46:21,920;"we're telling you. And if you do, it's your own goddamn fault because we've warned you"
46:21,920;46:22,820;"multiple times."
46:22,820;46:25,220;"Yeah, it's very unwatchable."
46:25,220;46:27,420;"Well, I did talk to a stealer fan today."
46:27,420;46:30,020;"And he's like, oh, I would watch that game."
46:30,020;46:31,120;"Like I fucking bet you would."
46:31,120;46:34,820;"So if you're a stealer fan, you listen to this one, why?"
46:34,820;46:37,120;"And to feel free to watch this."
46:37,120;46:38,820;"You'll probably really, really enjoy this game."
46:38,820;46:42,020;"I think that's a good way to watch the playoff game between these two teams."
46:42,020;46:45,060;"You know, it looks like there's a point A point B sort of thing."
46:45,060;46:46,820;"He's so salty."
46:46,820;46:48,300;"Fuck. I love it."
46:48,300;46:50,460;"I mean, they play him again."
46:50,460;46:52,580;"They do. Yeah. Same personnel."
46:52,580;46:56,020;"Well, in page, it's all I think will be a bit healthier."
46:56,020;46:58,660;"And at that point, the Steelers are on a big one street."
46:58,660;47:01,220;"This is true. Yeah. Yeah."
47:01,220;47:02,700;"So return the favor."
47:02,700;47:04,660;"That's a great point, Steve."
47:04,660;47:06,620;"That is a great point."
47:06,620;47:09,420;"Man."
47:11,460;47:14,740;"I'm thinking about best and worse in the back of my head here and I don't know if I have"
47:14,740;47:15,740;"any."
47:15,740;47:17,740;"There is another best besides David Givens."
47:17,740;47:19,380;"Well, here's the best."
47:19,380;47:20,980;"I saw Plaxxyl Barris."
47:20,980;47:27,140;"I wrote down, is that a gun in his waistband or is he just excited to score touchdowns?"
47:27,140;47:28,140;"I hate Plaxxyl Barris."
47:28,140;47:29,780;"This guy's game is also awful."
47:29,780;47:30,940;"Yeah, but come on."
47:30,940;47:31,940;"That's a pretty good one."
47:31,940;47:32,940;"Is it?"
47:32,940;47:33,940;"Yeah."
47:33,940;47:34,940;"I thought I thought I was pretty good."
47:34,940;47:35,940;"It's a pretty good burn."
47:35,940;47:36,940;"It's cheap."
47:36,940;47:37,940;"Exactly."
47:37,940;47:40,940;"That's why it's good because it's salty, just like you."
47:40,940;47:42,420;"- No. - Yeah."
47:42,420;47:43,260;"- No, it's not."
47:43,260;47:45,820;"- Yep."
47:45,820;47:48,900;"They did show a stat of a few with rushing yards"
47:48,900;47:50,300;"per rush touchdown."
47:50,300;47:51,140;"- Yeah, you know."
47:51,140;47:52,540;"- Since 1980."
47:52,540;47:55,020;"- No one cares about the stick game, Andy."
47:55,020;47:55,860;"- It's a role balance."
47:55,860;47:57,780;"- We can bury it in the backyard."
47:57,780;47:59,620;"Take this episode and bury that."
47:59,620;48:00,460;"- So how about this?"
48:00,460;48:02,220;"Oh, no, no, that's awkward."
48:02,220;48:03,060;"Anyway."
48:03,060;48:08,100;"- I got my numbers mixed up, no biggie."
48:08,100;48:13,100;"So this marks the end of the win streak, which is fine."
48:13,100;48:15,900;"Everything good comes to an end,"
48:15,900;48:17,820;"which we're learning this week with the Patriots"
48:17,820;48:18,660;"and everything."
48:18,660;48:26,740;"It was 399 days since the Patriots last loss."
48:26,740;48:28,700;"So we've had a pretty good year on this podcast"
48:28,700;48:31,060;"and as Pats fans in general."
48:31,060;48:33,420;"So one loss is a bit of a blimp"
48:33,420;48:34,980;"'cause these Patriots in 2004"
48:34,980;48:37,100;"don't exactly lose a lot of games today."
48:37,100;48:40,100;"My favorite was on the prime time highlights."
48:40,100;48:41,420;"They were talking about their last loss"
48:41,420;48:44,540;"and they said, ""It was in the Redskins back in 2002."""
48:44,540;48:46,540;"And Steve Spurrier and they're both like,"
48:46,540;48:47,940;"""Oh yeah."""
48:47,940;48:48,780;"(laughing)"
48:48,780;48:50,540;"I heard it because I already had afterthought."
48:50,540;48:51,380;"- Great."
48:51,380;48:53,180;"Well, that's where they showed a stat"
48:53,180;48:56,140;"where the last two coaches to beat New England"
48:56,140;49:00,180;"are no longer head coaches in the NFL."
49:00,180;49:03,300;"'Cause one like you said was Steve Spurrier"
49:03,300;49:05,500;"who was just like not a coach anymore."
49:05,500;49:06,340;"And the other one."
49:06,340;49:11,580;"was Greg Williams, who was the Buffalo head coach, who was now like a defensive coordinator"
49:11,580;49:21,300;"or somebody because he got demoted. So, so maybe that that's the decimal for, for your"
49:21,300;49:24,380;"boy, Bill Cowar, because he doesn't last much longer, does he?"
49:24,380;49:31,740;"Maybe he goes out on his own court. Does he? Yeah. I don't remember how he did. Did he"
49:31,740;49:33,340;"leave after you won that Super Bowl?"
49:33,340;49:36,860;"I don't know if that's after that, but he definitely doesn't get fired."
49:36,860;49:42,820;"No, but he will go two more years."
49:42,820;49:47,060;"2005, the steals win the Super Bowl."
49:47,060;49:51,300;"And probably should have gone out on top because the next year, 2006, the steals go 8 and 8"
49:51,300;49:53,220;"missed playoffs."
49:53,220;49:59,900;"So yeah, and then he doesn't coach again."
49:59,900;50:01,300;"That was it."
50:01,300;50:07,380;"So when I was on a court, but one year too late, like all good Steelers things."
50:07,380;50:09,380;"I don't know."
50:09,380;50:11,380;"I'm still salty."
50:11,380;50:14,300;"He's dragging this episode out to punish me right now, aren't you?"
50:14,300;50:15,300;"Yes, that's exactly right."
50:15,300;50:16,300;"The worst."
50:16,300;50:19,300;"I don't want to think about Bill Cowden's stupid fucking mustache."
50:19,300;50:22,300;"And the mustache one is not the chin."
50:22,300;50:24,300;"All the whole look."
50:24,300;50:26,300;"Yeah, that's fair."
50:26,300;50:27,300;"All right."
50:27,300;50:33,900;"Well, if you don't like his mustache, I think you'll probably not like..."
50:33,900;50:38,300;"...this."
50:38,300;50:42,400;"Where is it? There it is. The fans?"
50:42,400;50:45,900;"I just want to get your reaction because I don't think you could make it this far in the game."
50:45,900;50:50,000;"What? What are they doing?"
50:50,000;50:52,800;"Served!"
50:52,800;50:53,700;"Bands!"
50:53,700;50:55,200;"Get your helmet game!"
50:55,200;50:56,500;"Let's go!"
50:56,500;51:03,680;"that's a good power here on how we know that a dead ringer for them there now I couldn't"
51:03,680;51:07,560;"be a cow because he would have spent a lot more in a chin you know he just wasn't enough"
51:07,560;51:11,020;"there but I was pretty good though yeah I saw a little spray coming up he's like me it's"
51:11,020;51:19,940;"nice what are you doing let's go but exciting stuff here so far today and let. So bad he's"
51:19,940;51:25,740;"fucking Steelers fair. That was actually a pretty good impersonation and costume. I"
51:25,740;51:29,740;"fucking knew you'd be positive. I should have known you'd be positive about that. I'm just trying to"
51:29,740;51:35,140;"take the opposite side of you. It was awful. It was it was a half ass approach. You put a fucking"
51:35,140;51:40,380;"Steelers head on and a headset. I want you to not and had a laminated piece of paper. Yeah, and"
51:40,380;51:45,300;"they had the nice impression. It wasn't that good. That's so good. The TV cameras still and then put"
51:45,300;51:49,560;"on national broadcast. So they should answer and we can't get Nashie broadcast for all"
51:49,560;51:50,560;"our hard work."
51:50,560;51:54,160;"I think it's missing you. Please so you can tell his kids he was on TV. You got nothing"
51:54,160;51:58,480;"in this podcast. No one listens to it anyways."
51:58,480;52:04,880;"Oh god damn it. All right. So the only thing that sucks more in the fans and the field"
52:04,880;52:08,920;"in this game is Steve Brad apparently. No, it's all right. Give me your best and worst"
52:08,920;52:14,380;"than you know, I don't have any. You've got nothing. No, it's a stupid exercise. We"
52:14,380;52:17,740;"All we're doing is harping on the bad things that there are a million in this game."
52:17,740;52:20,540;"There's nothing good outside of David Gibbons."
52:20,540;52:22,140;"Should have been a two-minute conversation."
52:22,140;52:24,700;"She has cool touchdowns, everything else."
52:24,700;52:25,420;"That's shit sucked."
52:25,420;52:26,140;"All right."
52:26,140;52:26,940;"See you next week."
52:26,940;52:28,700;"Steve."
52:28,700;52:31,500;"No, you got it."
52:31,500;52:32,300;"You got it."
52:32,300;52:36,220;"Suffered through the bad so that you can appreciate the good."
52:36,220;52:38,940;"Because now that we've watched this game, we suffered through it."
52:38,940;52:42,460;"That AFC Championship game is going to feel orgasmic."
52:43,660;52:45,900;"And take records, so it's gonna be like, ""It's another win."""
52:45,900;52:47,580;"But like, no, but we actually watched that."
52:47,580;52:49,100;"- I got a lot of character."
52:49,100;52:50,380;"- You don't have enough character."
52:50,380;52:51,180;"- No, I don't know."
52:51,180;52:52,460;"- You have the bad kind of character, Steve."
52:52,460;52:54,060;"- Yeah, so I don't need any more, so let's--"
52:54,060;52:55,500;"- Oh, you need the good kind of character."
52:55,500;52:56,300;"- No."
52:56,300;52:57,140;"- Yes."
52:57,140;52:59,020;"- Character, it's no such different."
52:59,020;52:59,860;"- There is."
52:59,860;53:04,940;"All right, give me your best and worst."
53:04,940;53:05,940;"- Are you for real?"
53:05,940;53:06,780;"- Yeah."
53:06,780;53:07,820;"- I already went down the throat."
53:07,820;53:08,660;"- Give me something."
53:08,660;53:11,980;"- No, no, we can't end this podcast until we do best and worst."
53:11,980;53:12,940;"This is stupid."
53:12,940;53:14,020;"There is no best."
53:14,020;53:15,700;"Every, everything sucks."
53:15,700;53:16,580;"This whole game sucked."
53:16,580;53:17,460;"Why are we doing this?"
53:17,460;53:18,220;"This is stupid."
53:18,220;53:19,820;"And I guarantee you,"
53:19,820;53:20,660;"what's your worst?"
53:20,660;53:23,660;"They're nodding saying he's given that answer before on the dinner table"
53:23,660;53:24,660;"about best and worst."
53:24,660;53:28,420;"Bet you have."
53:28,420;53:30,220;"Definitely."
53:30,220;53:33,700;"She knows better than to keep asking the Andy, you don't."
53:33,700;53:38,620;"All right."
53:38,620;53:39,820;"I'll do my best and worst."
53:39,820;53:40,940;"OK, great."
53:41,220;53:42,060;"Let's see."
53:42,060;53:47,780;"Oh, my best is learning where Ted Johnson got all his anger"
53:47,780;53:48,620;"from."
53:48,620;53:51,140;"- Because you watch this whole game with some of the"
53:51,140;53:53,420;"commentators all the time, you're just ridiculous."
53:53,420;53:54,900;"- I watch all the thing."
53:54,900;53:58,340;"I was kind of skipping like the middle of plays"
53:58,340;54:00,940;"by the end of it, 'cause it was fucking garbage time."
54:00,940;54:06,420;"But they were talking about how all of Ted Johnson's"
54:06,420;54:10,900;"injury issues started when he tried to tackle Jerome"
54:10,900;54:11,980;"bet is the last time they met."
54:11,980;54:17,460;"And Ted Johnson go downhill fast from here."
54:17,460;54:20,420;"So I think we will now know why Ted Johnson has such an"
54:20,420;54:24,100;"axe to grind against the Patriots and Bill Belichick specifically."
54:24,100;54:28,420;"But maybe it should be partially because of Jerome"
54:28,420;54:30,540;"bet is not being so hard to tackle."
54:30,540;54:33,060;"So he has a bunch of head issue, right?"
54:33,060;54:35,620;"Bet is? No, Johnson."
54:35,620;54:38,860;"Oh, yeah, Ted, well, he's on the radio now."
54:40,220;54:45,100;"So I don't know. He just he's very comes across as very anti"
54:45,100;54:49,100;"Patriots and anti-ballad check in what the fuck are they doing? But I"
54:49,100;54:52,860;"mean, so to all Boston sports media these days. So who knows?"
54:52,860;54:56,380;"Maybe it's real. Maybe it's a maybe just an act like it is with"
54:56,380;55:01,100;"other videos. All right, what's your worst? My best is at Troy Brown"
55:01,100;55:06,460;"is back. Is that your balls? Is that your you have multiple"
55:06,460;55:13,300;"bests. Yeah. Well, I'm making up for you not having any. Oh, and also, Bethel Johnson,"
55:13,300;55:17,000;"were you you talked about he had that one bone head play, but you didn't talk about the"
55:17,000;55:22,460;"fact that he did that awesome. Like the Steelers kicked it almost out of bounds, but it wasn't"
55:22,460;55:25,920;"going to go out of bounds. So he like jumped. So he was standing out of bounds and then"
55:25,920;55:29,900;"picked up the ball. So therefore, technically out of bounds, we've seen what Walker do before"
55:29,900;55:34,020;"too. Didn't see well, we will didn't watch a game didn't see it. Yeah. So Bethel Johnson"
55:34,020;55:35,100;"- Next. - Awesome."
55:35,100;55:39,940;"Let's see, do you want any more best?"
55:39,940;55:41,340;"I could probably find another one for you."
55:41,340;55:42,180;"- I would get."
55:42,180;55:43,940;"- Kevin Falk, leading receiver."
55:43,940;55:46,180;"That's not necessarily a good sign, but it happened."
55:46,180;55:47,860;"- Yeah, and a fumble."
55:47,860;55:49,100;"- Yeah."
55:49,100;55:54,100;"All right, so worst, David Gibbons streak ending, that sucks."
55:54,100;55:59,060;"I don't know what I got up to, it was 25 or..."
55:59,060;56:01,980;"His first catch in the game was 25th."
56:03,340;56:07,140;"So it was right, it was almost 30, which is pretty fucking impressive."
56:07,140;56:12,900;"I asked Twitter and apparently there's some like receivers from 1970s who all"
56:12,900;56:14,460;"they did were deep balls."
56:14,460;56:15,980;"So every catch was a first down."
56:15,980;56:17,020;"And I was like hundreds."
56:17,020;56:27,660;"So so they might be the highest players with the most catches for first downs in a row."
56:27,660;56:29,700;"With these guys, that's literally all they did."
56:29,700;56:30,340;"They did."
56:30,340;56:31,900;"Give ins was to start a season."
56:31,900;56:32,500;"Yeah."
56:32,500;56:35,500;"Well, I mean, these guys started every season that way because all they did was"
56:35,500;56:39,060;"catch first downs because every past two of them was like 40 or sound field."
56:39,060;56:41,740;"Doesn't sound like football to me."
56:41,740;56:44,060;"Sounds like it should be a David Gibbons record anyways."
56:44,060;56:44,500;"Yeah."
56:44,500;56:45,300;"So we're going to give it today."
56:45,300;56:46,260;"So yeah, let's do it."
56:46,260;56:47,300;"We'll give it to David Gibbons."
56:47,300;56:51,220;"Um, if you design a banner, I'll print it up and we'll see if you can find"
56:51,220;56:52,180;"out where he lives on mail to him."
56:52,180;56:53,620;"That'll be creepy at all."
56:53,620;56:54,620;"No."
56:54,620;56:55,380;"Okay."
56:55,380;56:57,580;"We'll ask her out."
56:57,580;57:02,460;"We'll, we'll get you to ask people if they know where David Gibbons lives."
57:02,460;57:05,420;"- Let's start with Troy Brown,"
57:05,420;57:06,580;"then we'll get to David Givens."
57:06,580;57:07,420;"- All right, all right."
57:07,420;57:10,060;"Well, maybe Troy, I mean Troy obviously knows David Givens."
57:10,060;57:11,140;"- Of course, they're boys."
57:11,140;57:11,980;"- So they'll be like,"
57:11,980;57:14,420;"""Hey, would you give him this banner from us?"""
57:14,420;57:15,260;"- Okay, yeah."
57:15,260;57:18,380;"- This championship belt, this WWF championship belt,"
57:18,380;57:24,260;"it's most first down receptions to start a career."
57:24,260;57:27,500;"- Just not even in it, but all right, come on, next,"
57:27,500;57:28,340;"whatever."
57:28,340;57:29,180;"- Whatever."
57:29,180;57:32,900;"this stupid game in the whole barrier."
57:32,900;57:34,700;"- So you want a worst?"
57:34,700;57:35,540;"- No."
57:35,540;57:36,380;"- That's what you're looking for?"
57:36,380;57:37,380;"'Cause I did my best."
57:37,380;57:42,700;"The worst is the fact that the Steelers are so good."
57:42,700;57:46,100;"They were, after this, they would go on to beat"
57:46,100;57:49,900;"the other last undefeated team and the Eagles"
57:49,900;57:51,100;"in back-to-back weeks."
57:51,100;57:54,020;"So they, as Mike Dusseil was saying,"
57:54,020;57:56,460;"are a wagon, they're fucking wagon."
57:56,460;57:57,780;"- Feeling pretty good."
57:57,780;57:58,900;"- Yeah."
57:58,900;58:00,620;"And they're backing up their talk about one"
58:00,620;58:03,580;"to be the ones that break the streak and all that garbage."
58:03,580;58:07,980;"Garbo, Patriots halftime rushing stats."
58:07,980;58:09,720;"That's probably in the bad column."
58:09,720;58:12,700;"They had allowed 81 rushing yards"
58:12,700;58:14,980;"and they had rushed for a total of negative one."
58:14,980;58:16,900;"The great start."
58:16,900;58:18,860;"- No, Corey Dillon."
58:18,860;58:21,300;"- Nope."
58:21,300;58:23,620;"Oh, here's another good worst."
58:23,620;58:28,260;"The fans in Pittsburgh, they had the worst signs hanging."
58:28,260;58:33,060;"that I took a screenshot one is literally just says big Ben number seven black"
58:33,060;58:39,540;"letters yellow background that's it. That's wrong. Like yeah we we know we can see"
58:39,540;58:43,940;"he's he's out there he's the guy in the number seven like like put some sort of"
58:43,940;58:47,580;"creativity like I don't want the names of people in the numbers of the jerseys"
58:47,580;58:50,920;"they wear. Hey Andy they're big enough to get it on TV smart enough to get it on"
58:50,920;58:55,860;"TV. You have been stupid. You make a fun all these fans. I've been on TV. I've been on TV."
58:55,860;59:01,220;"I was on TV because I brought a rubber chicken to Wimbledon."
59:01,220;59:02,900;"I was on TV."
59:02,900;59:04,020;"- Prove it."
59:04,020;59:06,540;"- Ask County Pollan. She was there with me."
59:06,540;59:07,540;"- No, yeah."
59:07,540;59:11,300;"- And the rush breeze, the rush breeze have it on VHS somewhere, I think."
59:11,300;59:12,460;"- And then you go, ""Prove it."""
59:12,460;59:14,260;"- Yeah, so you'll have to ask them."
59:14,260;59:16,940;"- No, you have to. You have a burden of proof, Andy."
59:16,940;59:18,740;"You don't want to claim it to be on Wimbledon."
59:18,740;59:20,140;"- No, I told you where the proof is."
59:20,140;59:22,820;"You'll find it yourself. Do your own research, Steve."
59:22,820;59:23,820;"- No."
59:23,820;59:25,140;"Let's get Greg on it."
59:25,140;59:30,140;"He's a stat check. Oh, yeah, that's true. Yeah, we'll get him to do it whenever he decides to ever show up again"
59:30,140;59:36,780;"So the lat so they showed some pages winning ways this was a best"
59:36,780;59:42,620;"21 straight wins including playoffs is the longest streak in NFL history"
59:42,620;59:47,740;"18 straight regular season wins longest streak in NFL history"
59:47,740;59:52,460;"seven straight road wins also long as streak and franchise history and"
59:53,860;59:57,700;"And then like we said, it was 399 days since the page is last loss."
59:57,700;01:00:01,620;"It's four days since the Red Sox won the World Series."
01:00:01,620;01:00:02,260;"Fucking right."
01:00:02,260;01:00:11,220;"And it's two Britney Spears marriages worth of days is how they decided to"
01:00:11,220;01:00:14,100;"measure, apparently."
01:00:14,100;01:00:14,980;"That's terrible."
01:00:14,980;01:00:17,620;"They haven't lost in two Britney Spears marriages."
01:00:17,620;01:00:18,900;"So cool."
01:00:18,900;01:00:21,460;"All right."
01:00:21,460;01:00:23,620;"Do you guys think I'll Steve?"
01:00:23,620;01:00:28,620;"No, I got a commentator thing for you."
01:00:28,620;01:00:32,180;"Yeah, but you've got to talk about the rest too."
01:00:32,180;01:00:33,220;"I can talk about the refs."
01:00:33,220;01:00:34,660;"Yeah, I got one refs thing."
01:00:34,660;01:00:36,500;"I got one refs thing and one commentary thing."
01:00:36,500;01:00:38,700;"They got commentary things that we got playing more to go."
01:00:38,700;01:00:39,540;"Come on."
01:00:39,540;01:00:40,380;"All right, okay."
01:00:40,380;01:00:41,220;"All right, the referee."
01:00:41,220;01:00:43,540;"Oh, also this game was played in Halloween,"
01:00:43,540;01:00:46,820;"which makes sense because it was such a fucking nightmare."
01:00:46,820;01:00:48,740;"So that's very fitting."
01:00:48,740;01:00:51,180;"And then for referees,"
01:00:51,180;01:00:57,180;"you bribed and see this play because you were a coward and you dipped out early."
01:00:57,180;01:01:00,180;"But it was a play on..."
01:01:00,180;01:01:02,180;"I'm cuddling on the bed and guess."
01:01:02,180;01:01:03,180;"I know, I can see that."
01:01:03,180;01:01:06,180;"I'm still going to talk to you from here though."
01:01:06,180;01:01:12,180;"So the referee, the play was, it was like one of those quick passes to David Patton."
01:01:12,180;01:01:16,180;"You know, like the defensive backs playing too far off."
01:01:16,180;01:01:19,180;"And they just like chucked to him right up the snap."
01:01:19,180;01:01:25,780;"but it was kind of low so he scooped up off the top of his toes and then ran and"
01:01:25,780;01:01:29,820;"then at the end of the play there was a 15 yard face mask because the defender"
01:01:29,820;01:01:34,620;"like literally ripped his helmet off by the face mask so the play got challenged"
01:01:34,620;01:01:43,360;"and the referees reviewed the play overturned the reception but just because"
01:01:43,360;01:01:53,600;"the play is incomplete, the 15 yard face mask still applies. So after all that, even though the"
01:01:53,600;01:01:59,840;"Steelers won their challenge, they only got like one yard back on the drive. It was stupid."
01:01:59,840;01:02:06,720;"And then for commentators, this was perfect Chris Sims talking about like he knows what's"
01:02:06,720;01:02:11,840;"going on and decides that on the pages first drive that where they square their touchdown,"
01:02:12,640;01:02:16,640;"He literally, as he's saying, now's the time to run it."
01:02:16,640;01:02:19,080;"The page is run a play action and immediately is where Tushion"
01:02:19,080;01:02:19,840;"has."
01:02:19,840;01:02:23,840;"So nice to know that he's still got it and knows what he's"
01:02:23,840;01:02:29,440;"talking about and can predict games in the same way that better"
01:02:29,440;01:02:31,080;"commentators can do."
01:02:31,080;01:02:32,760;"Like what's his name, Steve?"
01:02:32,760;01:02:37,720;"Oh, Tony Romo, the QB Whisper, who actually calls those plays."
01:02:37,720;01:02:39,800;"So there you go."
01:02:39,800;01:02:42,200;"That's what I got for Referees and commentators."
01:02:42,200;01:02:48,160;"Oh, another note that they pointed out the Panthers from last year's Super Bowl"
01:02:48,160;01:02:51,320;"that the Patriots beat are currently one in six on the year."
01:02:51,320;01:02:52,760;"They've lost again."
01:02:52,760;01:02:57,160;"And so struggling mightily after Super Bowl, unlike this Patriots team."
01:02:57,160;01:02:58,760;"So it could be worse."
01:02:58,760;01:03:01,200;"We could be watching a lot more losses, but we're not."
01:03:01,200;01:03:02,000;"So that's great."
01:03:02,000;01:03:06,120;"And I think that's it."
01:03:06,120;01:03:08,720;"Are you sure?"
01:03:08,720;01:03:09,720;"I think so. Yeah."
01:03:09,720;01:03:12,280;"So I'm taking a quick look."
01:03:12,280;01:03:13,680;"Yeah, and it's the bubble checking."
01:03:13,680;01:03:15,880;"We don't want you to forget."
01:03:15,880;01:03:18,680;"Most Cedric Cobb's, there was a Cedric Cobb sighting"
01:03:18,680;01:03:20,720;"who was a street free egg getting carries in this game"
01:03:20,720;01:03:22,400;"because of the injury to Corey Dillon."
01:03:22,400;01:03:23,520;"I doubt we'll see him again."
01:03:23,520;01:03:28,520;"Yeah."
01:03:28,520;01:03:34,400;"Oh, they talked about what Bill Coward did on his bi-week."
01:03:34,400;01:03:35,600;"And he decided he went--"
01:03:35,600;01:03:36,080;"All right."
01:03:36,080;01:03:37,240;"You know what this--"
01:03:37,240;01:03:39,360;"I gotta go. I get some stuff to do."
01:03:39,360;01:03:46,720;"I believe you, but to do next week to see how much of a blubbering little"
01:03:46,720;01:03:47,920;"bitch Greg is."
01:03:47,920;01:03:49,680;"I'm very naughty."
01:03:49,680;01:03:53,320;"You're an idiot, bro."
01:03:53,320;01:03:58,680;"All right. Well, hopefully next week is"
01:03:58,680;01:04:02,680;"something a bit more upbeat. What is next week, Steve?"
01:04:02,680;01:04:03,520;"I don't know."
01:04:04,400;01:04:11,440;"Oh, pages playing the St. Louis Rams in the Edward Jones"
01:04:11,440;01:04:13,360;"dome. What a terrible name for stadium."
01:04:13,360;01:04:17,920;"Super Bowl rematch from 2001."
01:04:17,920;01:04:20,560;"Mike March looking to get revenge."
01:04:20,560;01:04:21,760;"Will he get it, Steve?"
01:04:21,760;01:04:27,120;"Find out next week on the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
01:04:27,120;01:04:28,800;"Hey, oh, yeah."
01:04:28,800;01:04:29,360;"Hey, yeah."
01:04:29,360;01:04:30,360;"Oh, hello."

00:00,000;00:06,800;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,800;00:08,240;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,240;00:12,680;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,680;00:16,000;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:16,000;00:17,240;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,240;00:18,240;"Go right ahead."
00:18,240;00:23,200;"I am not your mother."
00:23,200;00:25,200;"You're welcome."
00:25,200;00:28,280;"Episode 11 of the pages dies the podcast"
00:28,280;00:33,000;"We're gonna start this before Michael and I come to Fisticuffs"
00:33,000;00:40,080;"You guys are wondering we're discussing the intro music as if nothing else could be talked about right now"
00:40,080;00:43,600;"so well, I think because we haven't addressed this yet and"
00:43,600;00:49,280;"Because we've actually just figured it out on our end, but it'll have been in every episode since"
00:49,280;00:53,360;"So we should probably take the time to thank mama Brown for her"
00:54,240;00:56,100;"disclaimer at the beginning of all of these."
00:56,100;00:57,320;"- Momma Brown, woo!"
00:57,320;00:58,160;"- Yeah."
00:58,160;01:03,880;"In full transparency, she was not the first choice."
01:03,880;01:08,880;"We did try to get a cameo from their website"
01:08,880;01:10,840;"of Jonas Gray to do it for us,"
01:10,840;01:14,840;"but he doesn't know how to use the cameo website"
01:14,840;01:17,200;"or he just decided not to, didn't tell us."
01:17,200;01:19,560;"So we tried a couple times, didn't get him."
01:19,560;01:24,000;"A mama Brown, it felt right to have her apologize for us"
01:24,000;01:25,920;"before you even started listening to this."
01:25,920;01:28,160;"So thanks to her."
01:28,160;01:29,000;"- Thanks for all."
01:29,000;01:32,960;"- So as you can tell, we have both Mike and Steve here."
01:32,960;01:36,320;"No Greg this week because he is heading to Miami"
01:36,320;01:37,260;"for the Super Bowl."
01:37,260;01:41,480;"That was some poor, poor planning, I suppose,"
01:41,480;01:43,960;"on his part buying it."
01:43,960;01:48,080;"Although I understand why you would buy tickets"
01:48,080;01:50,400;"to wherever the Super Bowl is every year,"
01:51,280;01:55,400;"just because the last time the pages weren't in it was"
01:55,400;01:57,360;"four years ago, is that right?"
01:57,360;02:00,280;"- I think so."
02:00,280;02:04,520;"- I'm terrible with time, so we're gonna go with that."
02:04,520;02:06,440;"- But to be clear, even if they weren't in the Super Bowl,"
02:06,440;02:08,580;"he did not have tickets to the game."
02:08,580;02:10,480;"- No, no, I just go to Miami."
02:10,480;02:11,840;"- Just say, even if I didn't go to the game,"
02:11,840;02:12,880;"even the Patriots are in it,"
02:12,880;02:14,960;"he couldn't afford that anyways."
02:14,960;02:18,320;"- Well, he probably could afford it"
02:18,320;02:20,000;"because if the Patriots are in it,"
02:20,000;02:21,760;"the tickets would have been cheap again."
02:21,760;02:23,520;"They were cheap last time, weren't they?"
02:23,520;02:25,000;"That's why all the patience fans were there."
02:25,000;02:27,760;"- What's cheap is their $5,000?"
02:27,760;02:29,520;"- No, so much they are this year, I think."
02:29,520;02:30,640;"Maybe they're $9,000."
02:30,640;02:32,240;"They were pretty expensive this year"
02:32,240;02:33,760;"'cause the Chiefs haven't been in like 100."
02:33,760;02:37,280;"But we're not here to talk about the Chiefs"
02:37,280;02:40,280;"or the 49ers, we're here to talk about the Saints"
02:40,280;02:42,240;"because the Saints are coming to town,"
02:42,240;02:47,240;"2001, week 11, to the wet and windy Foxboro,"
02:47,240;02:49,120;"Massachusetts."
02:49,120;02:54,000;"Apparently, everybody was pissed because during the day, it was like 60 degrees and sunny."
02:54,000;02:59,000;"But this is a late game and the rain and wind started late."
02:59,000;03:00,360;"So it was fun."
03:00,360;03:03,840;"About Saints."
03:03,840;03:07,840;"The Saints team, they seemed like they were pretty good."
03:07,840;03:09,360;"They were good the year before."
03:09,360;03:15,280;"But this year, they would actually finish seven and nine, third in the NFC West."
03:16,120;03:20,120;"behind obviously the Rams on a bit of the 49ers were a bit of a power house this year too."
03:20,120;03:22,720;"Head coach was Jim Haslett."
03:22,720;03:24,640;"You boys remember Jim Haslett."
03:24,640;03:25,600;"Oh yeah."
03:25,600;03:29,400;"Wait, who else is the US back then?"
03:29,400;03:32,280;"Because this is before they realigned the divisions, right?"
03:32,280;03:33,480;"When the Colts are still in ours."
03:33,480;03:40,040;"It is by the end of this podcast, people will definitely remember how these divisions were broken up."
03:40,040;03:42,200;"Yeah, because we asked this question literally."
03:43,400;03:46,960;"NSC West was a Rams 49ers Saints Falcons and Panthers."
03:46,960;03:48,560;"I believe you touched on this last week."
03:48,560;03:49,760;"I've got a powerhouse."
03:49,760;03:51,440;"Rams like now."
03:51,440;03:55,440;"Yeah."
03:55,440;03:56,640;"Rams win Super Bowl last year."
03:56,640;03:59,120;"Niners in Super Bowl this year."
03:59,120;04:02,040;"Saints have been the NSC Championship game."
04:02,040;04:04,520;"Well, I've been at least 11 wins last couple of years."
04:04,520;04:07,320;"I think the Falcons were in Super Bowl recently too, weren't they?"
04:07,320;04:09,240;"No, they got-- they worked-- don't they"
04:09,240;04:10,600;"think up big in a Super Bowl?"
04:10,600;04:11,320;"Something like that."
04:11,320;04:12,240;"Yeah, I don't remember."
04:12,240;04:14,840;"I'm sure well, we'll probably find out of 20 years from now."
04:14,840;04:17,480;"He's listening."
04:17,480;04:19,280;"It'll be 40 years."
04:19,280;04:19,760;"You can."
04:19,760;04:27,000;"So Jim has a pretty good defensive coordinator."
04:27,000;04:30,440;"It was a defensive coordinator for the Steelers before this for a few years when"
04:30,440;04:31,160;"they were pretty good."
04:31,160;04:34,720;"Um, and that's, I think how he got his head coaching gig."
04:34,720;04:38,400;"So it's a coach from 2008."
04:38,440;04:42,160;"Most of those years were with the New Orleans Saints."
04:42,160;04:45,120;"Didn't do so great."
04:45,120;04:46,520;"He only had two winning seasons."
04:46,520;04:49,880;"One was that first 2000 season and then 2002."
04:49,880;04:53,000;"The rest of the season, he was either eight and eight or worse."
04:53,000;04:58,680;"He finished with a 47 and 61 record overall, which is not great."
04:58,680;05:01,680;"But the fact that he lasted for, what was it, eight years?"
05:01,680;05:06,920;"Yeah, even with such a bad record is, you know, testament to being able to stick around."
05:07,800;05:14,120;"Jeff Fisher was Jeff Fisher. Yeah, pretty much what about Garrett Jason Garrett?"
05:14,120;05:21,480;"This guy did worse than that guy and he held his job, so that's true. Um, props to him."
05:21,480;05:27,160;"We can, uh, I think there's other connections to Jason Garrett too, which we'll get to in a second, but"
05:27,160;05:32,200;"against Haslett coach teams, the Patriots were undefeated. They went 3-0."
05:33,000;05:37,160;"They beat the Saints twice in 01 and 05 and then again"
05:37,160;05:43,560;"When has almost coaching the Rams in 2008 so we like seeing his teams"
05:43,560;05:46,280;"none of the games were particularly close really"
05:46,280;05:49,320;"the average score was"
05:49,320;05:56,120;"27 17 paths one of the games. Yeah, most of the games were about 24 to 17 16 to 23"
05:56,120;05:58,600;"24 to 17 so they were very"
05:58,600;06:01,800;"Calling them out for not wanting to play in this game"
06:02,600;06:05,160;"Yeah, they were definitely a dome team for sure."
06:05,160;06:07,480;"Because all three of those games were at were in Fox."
06:07,480;06:08,200;"Dome team."
06:08,200;06:09,880;"Dome team."
06:09,880;06:11,560;"Oh, dome team got you."
06:11,560;06:15,600;"Yeah, you haven't been a new umbrella for a while."
06:15,600;06:18,160;"My accent, it's tripping you up."
06:18,160;06:19,840;"It is. Sorry."
06:19,840;06:23,800;"But yeah, so to come back to the, the clapper."
06:23,800;06:29,640;"That I said before, the other notable coach in this offensive coordinator, Mike McCarthy,"
06:30,320;06:34,080;"who is currently the new Dallas Cowboys head coach"
06:34,080;06:37,240;"after turning this offensive coordinator job"
06:37,240;06:41,360;"into the Green Bay head coaching job"
06:41,360;06:46,360;"in 2006 and coach forever up until last season."
06:46,360;06:49,520;"Right? He was through 2018 season."
06:49,520;06:50,360;"Didn't coach."
06:50,360;06:53,040;"Yeah, this is just gotten higher."
06:53,040;06:56,560;"What's your take on his relationship with all Aaron Rodgers?"
06:56,560;06:57,600;"I don't really have a take."
06:57,600;06:59,840;"I've kind of ignored that, to be honest."
06:59,840;07:04,400;"Really? Yeah, Aaron Rodgers seems kind of like a dingleberry. So"
07:04,400;07:10,680;"that's a man. That's a funny way to put it. But he, I don't know. I"
07:10,680;07:13,480;"think I would respect it up early on. I think he's become a"
07:13,480;07:16,320;"little bit of a her hermajan on Aaron Rodgers. That is"
07:16,320;07:19,400;"Yeah, that's what it feels like. And he's kind of like the"
07:19,400;07:24,280;"boss. Yeah, the early success seems to have maybe gone to his"
07:24,280;07:28,600;"head a bit. Right. It's also kind of interesting to see that I"
07:28,600;07:32,120;"I mean, he was hands down across the board known as the, you know, the most"
07:32,120;07:32,960;"athletic quarterback."
07:32,960;07:34,680;"And now that's definitely not the case."
07:34,680;07:39,440;"So it's interesting to see the passing of torch and he never really won another"
07:39,440;07:40,200;"championship."
07:40,200;07:42,640;"So it is what it is."
07:42,640;07:43,280;"Yeah."
07:43,280;07:47,040;"I think it kind of puts what Brady has accomplished into perspective when you"
07:47,040;07:51,880;"see somebody with that sort of ability and that sort of talent and all the"
07:51,880;07:52,840;"success that he's had."
07:52,840;07:54,240;"And he's only won one Super Bowl."
07:54,240;07:55,120;"Right."
07:55,120;07:55,880;"And for a while."
07:55,880;07:57,120;"Right."
07:58,160;07:59,840;"I think that's not what it's been to as well."
07:59,840;08:00,800;"- Right."
08:00,800;08:04,000;"- So to only ever get to one Super Bowl,"
08:04,000;08:08,320;"what's the fact that Brady's gotten to nine and one sixth of them,"
08:08,320;08:11,240;"it's the whole different level."
08:11,240;08:12,800;"- But remember when it was Aaron Rodgers,"
08:12,800;08:14,960;"Pete Manning and Brady."
08:14,960;08:15,800;"- Yeah."
08:15,800;08:17,640;"- For goat status, yeah."
08:17,640;08:19,280;"- Yep."
08:19,280;08:20,760;"And now it's--"
08:20,760;08:22,200;"- Pete Manning."
08:22,200;08:26,280;"- Tom Brady and Drew Brees is now enter the conversation."
08:26,280;08:28,040;"Wait, Drew Brees isn't for goat."
08:28,040;08:32,960;"- Yeah, this year you heard it when he,"
08:32,960;08:34,140;"when he passed,"
08:34,140;08:35,400;"- He talked. - He paid Manning's"
08:35,400;08:37,060;"touchdown record, well,"
08:37,060;08:39,720;"regular season touchdown passing record."
08:39,720;08:41,900;"People say. - I mean, if you're talking"
08:41,900;08:43,340;"just regular season, then yeah,"
08:43,340;08:45,440;"maybe it is between Manning and Brees."
08:45,440;08:49,820;"- The thing is Brady's up there in all those numbers,"
08:49,820;08:53,520;"but he has the whole playoff on top of it."
08:53,520;08:55,720;"You know, all those playoff records where he's,"
08:55,720;08:59,720;"head and shoulders above everybody in every statistic."
08:59,720;09:01,720;"I know, it's kind of a silly argument."
09:01,720;09:03,720;"It's outrageous, yeah."
09:03,720;09:11,720;"You could actually put together a full season of Tom Brady playoff games,"
09:11,720;09:14,720;"and I think he still finishes 12 and 4."
09:14,720;09:17,720;"I guess playoff teams and Super Bowl teams,"
09:17,720;09:24,720;"teams like the Legion of Boom and the greatest show on turf and all these teams."
09:24,720;09:30,360;"these teams. It's and what can we think for all this? The"
09:30,360;09:30,960;"flake gate."
09:30,960;09:35,520;"That was Bell check selling a soul."
09:35,520;09:38,940;"No, I mean, there's a lot of stuff. There's Brady selling a"
09:38,940;09:42,600;"soul after like I think oh seven or maybe oh six. There's"
09:42,600;09:47,160;"obviously we've talked about when Bell check sold his soul. We've"
09:47,160;09:49,200;"talked about Bell check's cheating ways and his"
09:49,200;09:51,000;"opportunistic getting caught."
09:51,000;09:54,560;"Well, you talked about that. Well, let's call it spade a"
09:54,560;10:00,880;"spade my friend. So with the flate gate that happened and they went on a run, you list to say."
10:00,880;10:05,440;"So without the flate gate, we probably don't have the second part of the dynasty and it probably"
10:05,440;10:09,680;"gets capped. So, Bowak check again, freaking genius."
10:09,680;10:13,680;"You think so though? Yeah, absolutely. You think the Patriots weren't going to win"
10:13,680;10:17,520;"the game against Seattle, the Super Bowl against Seattle?"
10:17,520;10:24,240;"Well, yeah, but like, but the flake gate sort of like created that that aura that like, oh,"
10:24,240;10:28,080;"screw this, everybody's against us. Because if you remember, after the flake gate, they still"
10:28,080;10:36,800;"had two weeks or whatever of like answering BS questions. And then the the year after, you know,"
10:36,800;10:42,800;"what was that the suspension year was the year after that, whatever Brady was suspended. I mean,"
10:43,840;10:49,760;"That brought up the whole Garoppolo thing. So everyone was looking at him Brady had a chip on his shoulder"
10:49,760;10:52,560;"He hadn't probably had that chip on a shoulder for a long time"
10:52,560;10:55,760;"And he just rattled off super ball after super ball after super ball"
10:55,760;11:00,720;"So I think deflate gave play the hand in this run. Yes, I do"
11:00,720;11:04,080;"Yeah, but Mike you also thought 9/11 played a hand in this"
11:04,080;11:10,240;"Look, I didn't say all I said was the dynasty happened because of molluis's hit. Okay"
11:11,440;11:16,200;"He said you know, so we're adding that to the list. Okay, indirectly"
11:16,200;11:22,500;"The people don't start on this episode listen to all this and you to see the"
11:22,500;11:26,600;"Filth of these guys are spewing and I'm right"
11:26,600;11:33,280;"Solid spin zone considering it's all right good Lord"
11:33,280;11:36,280;"Anyways"
11:36,280;11:42,600;"Man, they're just real takes. See I like I like doing this because all these hot takes get us through this cold"
11:42,600;11:46,840;"New England winter. They just it just keeps me warm. I wouldn't know I wouldn't know"
11:46,840;11:51,480;"It's right here. Do you still have the the fires to keep you warm?"
11:51,480;11:56,080;"Now it's just sunny man. It's just good"
11:56,080;12:01,240;"Yeah, it's a tough life you leave there's a couple of earthquakes here and there but other than that"
12:02,840;12:07,460;"Alright, well that's it must be nice. It was nice today because it got into the 30s"
12:07,460;12:14,460;"Up to 36 this afternoon like sweatshirts on there outside and fucking sounds lovely fucking lunatics"
12:14,460;12:19,320;"All right, the Saints speaking lunatics. How about some of these Saints players?"
12:19,320;12:22,720;"Quarterback Aaron Brooks remember him"
12:22,720;12:26,780;"I do because I actually had his jersey if you recall"
12:26,780;12:31,360;"Jersey I went through a phase. Yes, that's my stop man. That's my"
12:31,920;12:35,560;"Mike and I talked about this maybe just been the two of us. I think like"
12:35,560;12:42,040;"We go shopping at that place in Lawrence. Oh hell. Yeah, so so the Steve you remember that place"
12:42,040;12:45,480;"No, no Greg used to love it too. They had"
12:45,480;12:49,280;"Like when I was like filings based on like TJ max sort of place"
12:49,280;12:55,120;"I just had a bunch of random stuff, but they always had one rack of oh, yeah, I do random like crap jerseys"
12:55,120;12:57,640;"so they had one with"
12:58,360;13:03,660;"Like names sewn on upside down and like stupid things like that. I think it's pureless price was the one that I had"
13:03,660;13:08,040;"Oh, yeah, I see right. Yeah, mine was Dave Megan off center 22"
13:08,040;13:10,920;"Right, but one of them I had Aaron Brooks"
13:10,920;13:16,020;"And then I also my my crown jewel was Maurice Colorette Bronco's jersey. Oh"
13:16,020;13:19,400;"Yeah, those were cheap"
13:19,400;13:21,720;"There was also Tim couch one I think"
13:21,720;13:27,680;"Who's the big defensive lineman for Green Bay with the great name?"
13:27,680;13:35,560;"game. Gababia Mila, that guy. I don't remember him. Yeah, had one of those. So I would give"
13:35,560;13:39,800;"those away in college for like Christmas presents and stuff. I told my roommates and"
13:39,800;13:46,560;"things. Warren? Oh yeah, of course. Oh boy. Yeah, they weren't new. They were used. Well,"
13:46,560;13:50,560;"I used to worry about like house pies and stuff and get a bit. I see what you do with"
13:50,560;13:54,200;"them. So that's why I'm surprised. Oh, I'd wear nothing."
13:54,200;13:56,980;"No surprise that Aaron Brooks on the reject pile though."
13:56,980;13:58,600;"He fucking socks."
13:58,600;14:00,680;"Yeah."
14:00,680;14:02,740;"He is fast as hell, man."
14:02,740;14:03,200;"Yeah."
14:03,200;14:05,540;"He was not as bad as I remember him being."
14:05,540;14:07,220;"Oh, he was worse."
14:07,220;14:08,260;"And I thought he was that."
14:08,260;14:09,080;"I thought it."
14:09,080;14:10,820;"I mean, are you basically not this game, man?"
14:10,820;14:13,940;"Cause this game, like they were bringing the heat."
14:13,940;14:17,340;"They were and he couldn't handle it."
14:17,340;14:20,940;"Like he had to get out of the kitchen, but I mean, he put up these"
14:20,940;14:24,300;"as you had 3800 yards, 26 touchdowns,"
14:24,300;14:25,420;"and 22 interceptions."
14:25,420;14:27,700;"- Didn't you have like 350 yards in this game passing,"
14:27,700;14:29,100;"which was weird, 'cause I don't think"
14:29,100;14:30,580;"I saw him complete a pass."
14:30,580;14:31,780;"(laughing)"
14:31,780;14:33,140;"- Oh, he did, but there was--"
14:33,140;14:33,980;"- Pass appearances."
14:33,980;14:36,380;"- The only passes he completed were 60 yards downfield."
14:36,380;14:38,820;"- Yeah, there's a couple of nice ones."
14:38,820;14:39,660;"- Yeah."
14:39,660;14:43,060;"But he was also second on the team in rushing yards"
14:43,060;14:44,700;"with 358."
14:44,700;14:49,700;"He was sacked 50 times, that is five zero, 50 times."
14:50,140;14:54,420;"Let's see is is that I that's usually in the upper region, right?"
14:54,420;14:56,860;"But like 15 high you hear that."
14:56,860;14:58,700;"I mean, what about car?"
14:58,700;15:01,500;"Remember the Texans didn't he set records for being sad?"
15:01,500;15:06,900;"I have no idea how many times, although for running quarterback,"
15:06,900;15:09,900;"that is a lot of sex."
15:09,900;15:11,620;"You think you'd escape?"
15:11,620;15:12,740;"Well, you think that"
15:12,740;15:17,860;"because of the second this game was where he was scrambling and then he ran"
15:17,860;15:19,620;"and kind of like tripped over himself."
15:19,620;15:20,620;"Right."
15:20,620;15:23,360;"Yeah. Oh, here we go."
15:23,360;15:25,620;"Here's the leader of time sacks in the season."
15:25,620;15:29,020;"Was it you see that said David Carr?"
15:29,020;15:31,220;"Yeah, I was very."
15:31,220;15:31,900;"Oh, Mike."
15:31,900;15:32,700;"Sorry."
15:32,700;15:37,540;"Yes, it was him in 2002 care to guess how many times he was sacked that year."
15:37,540;15:39,700;"I remember it was like in the 70s."
15:39,700;15:42,300;"I think 76."
15:42,300;15:43,780;"Oh, damn."
15:43,780;15:45,300;"Second place though,"
15:45,300;15:49,000;"- Oh, not Randall Cunningham in '86 with '72."
15:49,000;15:50,500;"- Wow. - That was surprising."
15:50,500;15:51,660;"- Yeah."
15:51,660;15:55,500;"A lot of these, it seems to be either"
15:55,500;15:59,420;"white quarterbacks on bad teams,"
15:59,420;16:02,900;"like immobile quarterbacks on bad teams"
16:02,900;16:06,180;"or mobile quarterbacks who like"
16:06,180;16:09,860;"Deshawn Washins on here, 2018 with '62."
16:09,860;16:12,980;"Randall Cunningham's on here a lot."
16:15,220;16:17,220;"four guy. He's in the hall of fame."
16:17,220;16:20,420;"Three. Drew bloods was on here."
16:20,420;16:22,500;"1999 55 sacks."
16:22,500;16:25,620;"Time for 18th with Blake Bortles."
16:25,620;16:26,940;"2014."
16:26,940;16:27,940;"Bortles on here."
16:27,940;16:29,500;"Bortles was on here again."
16:29,500;16:31,900;"2002 with Buffalo with 54 sacks."
16:31,900;16:34,100;"This is not guy sound like a Pokemon."
16:34,100;16:36,540;"I mean, I don't know what you think about Pokemon."
16:36,540;16:39,260;"Every time I hear Bortles, I just picture his face."
16:39,260;16:40,260;"A Bortle, Bortle."
16:40,260;16:43,300;"I think you're right."
16:43,300;16:44,300;"Yeah."
16:44,620;16:50,500;"So yeah, Aaron Brooks is he's he's on this list, but he's got some good, good company."
16:50,500;16:53,300;"Aaron Rodgers, 51 sacks."
16:53,300;16:55,020;"He also have 50 sacks in the year."
16:55,020;17:02,020;"So it does seem to be kind of mostly the more mobile guys and David Carr."
17:02,020;17:03,740;"Huh?"
17:03,740;17:06,140;"Who is first and also third on this list."
17:06,140;17:07,420;"Oh, that guy."
17:07,420;17:09,180;"That's pretty well."
17:09,180;17:11,700;"My boy, Tim couches on here, 56 sacks."
17:11,700;17:14,420;"It's a lot of car crashes."
17:14,420;17:20,540;"That's a lot of car crashes, but now cars bringing it in the announcing game. I think is he I don't know"
17:20,540;17:22,540;"He's a reporter of some sort. I don't know"
17:22,540;17:26,620;"Man, yeah, I don't I haven't come across. Oh, there he is"
17:26,620;17:31,220;"It's like the most Tom Bray there have been sac was 41 times"
17:31,220;17:35,740;"Guess what season that was this one this one. Oh, really?"
17:35,740;17:41,740;"Yeah, well, yeah, he doesn't have his like supernatural awareness. He got blown up blindsided in this game. Yeah"
17:41,740;17:47,400;"Yeah, yeah, a couple of fumbles that is offensive lineman recovered one of those like you got the lines"
17:47,400;17:53,140;"I did it was real bad. So like the one where you're next snaps back. Yeah, it's a wonder why"
17:53,140;17:56,840;"Belichick allowed him to keep his job. But again"
17:56,840;17:59,660;"Bledso didn't have the greatest"
17:59,660;18:05,160;"History as well and I mean he got a pretty good view of him the year before when they went five with love it"
18:05,160;18:08,980;"so right and from what it sounded like is"
18:10,420;18:14,300;"Belichick chose to on rage based on the decisions he was making more so than"
18:14,300;18:16,740;"Really the numbers I think"
18:16,740;18:23,560;"Yeah, that's a good point. I also read and this is you know perspective that you get after the fact"
18:23,560;18:28,060;"I don't remember any of this stuff like, you know when I was watching these games live, but"
18:28,060;18:36,520;"It came down to a lot of like a practice snaps between blood zone and Brady and I guess in the previous game against the Rams"
18:36,520;18:39,500;"Belichick basically blamed"
18:39,820;18:41,820;"Brady's performance so to speak on"
18:41,820;18:47,100;"On the limited practice opportunities because Bledso kind of took some away"
18:47,100;18:49,020;"I don't know if that's like true or not"
18:49,020;18:52,140;"But that that's sort of what he went with and if you look at it from that perspective"
18:52,140;18:54,300;"You have a quarterback who's been you know"
18:54,300;19:00,540;"He was a starter for two games gets hurt and then you have a guy who's a starter for eight games you sort of like gear the"
19:00,540;19:07,700;"the whole team philosophy towards what's happening with that quarterback the terminology, etc play calling"
19:07,700;19:11,380;"So it doesn't actually make sense that you know you're this far into the season"
19:11,380;19:14,600;"Regardless of even if he thought Brady was the better quarterback"
19:14,600;19:19,500;"It probably is a setback to kind of like restart it again with some guy that's"
19:19,500;19:27,040;"That for two months, right? Especially with Brady's like still winning games during that stretch too like he was five and three going into this game"
19:27,040;19:34,340;"I had heard somewhere some Belichick clip talking about this specific Saints game"
19:34,340;19:37,900;"where he said Brady played like crap the game before and this game"
19:37,900;19:42,700;"Kind of showed him that he needed to stick with Brady and it kind of proved him right"
19:42,700;19:46,420;"I'm just gonna ride him for the rest of the year. What's this specific Saints game?"
19:46,420;19:53,100;"Yeah, and that's actually what all the the Boston Globe articles were kind of before and after he's exactly that"
19:53,100;19:59,100;"Kind of dichotomy where the funny thing though is is that like he made not the hard decision"
19:59,100;20:04,380;"But he made the decision that Brady was going to be the starter barring like injury before this game"
20:04,380;20:08,140;"So I wonder if he didn't play like lights out which he he did"
20:08,140;20:14,340;"I wonder if it would have been a different outcome. I mean, he probably still would have stuck stuck within the rest of the year"
20:14,340;20:20,700;"But yeah, I mean who really knows I don't want to battle check but and he's never gonna fucking tell you"
20:20,700;20:23,140;"He'll tell me that the"
20:24,060;20:31,620;"Once we have them on this podcast in 30. But yeah, I mean, there was there was a bunch of stuff in the papers about how"
20:31,620;20:35,260;"Bella check just made the decision and"
20:35,260;20:42,540;"Took the full responsibility for it too even back then in typical bell check fashion talking about how"
20:42,540;20:47,820;"It's his decision and it is what it is and nobody else"
20:47,820;20:51,260;"Has anything to do with it?"
20:52,140;20:56,900;"The line was there's no sense in being wishy washy. That's not what I'm paid to do"
20:56,900;21:00,500;"Bill Belichick"
21:00,500;21:07,460;"true, but then there were also players quoted saying that you know exactly where you stand with them which I thought was interesting"
21:07,460;21:12,240;"Except for the fact when he chooses not to to be up front"
21:12,240;21:18,220;"He is wishy washy because he told Bledso that he would be allowed to practice and earn those reps and earn the"
21:18,700;21:25,500;"starting status again, that was never the case. And as recently as I think Mike Penel this past"
21:25,500;21:29,580;"year was coming out and saying that Belichick was never up front with him and it was just you"
21:29,580;21:35,660;"know sort of a guessing game until he was cut and whatever. So it is funny that Belichick stands"
21:35,660;21:40,860;"but he's not what she watched unless he has three. Well, I mean,"
21:40,860;21:45,740;"that I did that here, Mike. I don't know if I agree with that because they also had"
21:47,820;21:54,540;"Wasn't a uh, Michael Bennett on and he said exactly obviously like now. I knew exactly right. So it was complete transparent"
21:54,540;21:58,860;"And well, I didn't say every time did I I said when he wants it to be the case"
21:58,860;22:01,500;"I mean maybe strategic"
22:01,500;22:05,500;"Or is it just that it's up to the player to decide"
22:05,500;22:11,980;"How to react to bell checks demeanor? Maybe I don't know the right word there would be"
22:11,980;22:17,500;"I don't know. I mean, I'm just repeating what blood so said he said that get a conversation with bell check"
22:17,500;22:23,160;"That would check said that he would give him the opportunity to win his job back and then the next week"
22:23,160;22:28,680;"He named Brady starter. So I'm just looking at it from Pletso's perspective now"
22:28,680;22:31,120;"Maybe he was a little but heard about it. Maybe"
22:31,120;22:37,700;"You know his feelings were heard. I mean I player said that he was very angry. That's all understandable"
22:37,700;22:45,500;"But I'm just saying what he said man. This is what happens when we read these articles. That's true. Yeah, I bring you the news"
22:45,920;22:51,600;"But it is kind of funny to look back at some of these articles that these"
22:51,600;22:55,720;"People were writing at the time knowing what we know now"
22:55,720;22:58,760;"I can ramboy a Bob Duffy"
22:58,760;23:05,160;"Getting super pissy about it before the game and then afterwards having to kind of like eat their own words"
23:05,160;23:08,920;"I can't dance on a C being invisible prick about it"
23:08,920;23:10,920;"No"
23:10,920;23:12,920;"Yeah, yeah shocking right?"
23:13,400;23:17,240;"I will say I was reading another article that you put up and"
23:17,240;23:22,920;"It said again, this is in line with wishy washi or not. I don't know"
23:22,920;23:27,280;"We're being upfront with players or maybe them having to interpret what he says"
23:27,280;23:31,400;"But it's not that the Patriots have had more grievances filed against them than any other team"
23:31,400;23:35,800;"They're gonna film the past few years and that was like before all of this recent stuff"
23:35,800;23:38,560;"This is going back to 2001 baby. I"
23:38,560;23:42,160;"Mean that yeah"
23:42,680;23:50,180;"Belchak was installing his system and people weren't happy about it. Although I do wonder how many of those grievances were just from Terry Glenn."
23:50,180;24:01,980;"I mean, probably a few. He popped up a couple of times. So yeah, I mean, there was one article after the game about basically Glenn's done."
24:01,980;24:08,680;"Terry Glenn's done in New England because he said anything with a smart to write one of those on my angle hurts or whatever."
24:08,960;24:15,160;"Yeah, I have the card right here. So it's the wider Seaberts that he came back to the team ready to play against San Diego."
24:15,160;24:19,960;"Quote, ""But the other side didn't give an inch and his hamstring started hurting."""
24:19,960;24:24,160;"So do you want to play again this season? The guy interviewing him asked."
24:24,160;24:31,260;"And his response was, ""I did want to play for them again."" He said, ""That's D-I-D, but I don't think I'll be here next season."""
24:31,260;24:33,260;"""I don't care if I'm still on this football team."""
24:33,260;24:38,200;"asked directly if he was if he wasn't playing because he wasn't getting his money. Glenn said"
24:38,200;24:43,040;"Maybe I'm not getting paid and my hamstring hurts smile. So yeah"
24:43,040;24:46,000;"Yeah, shit. So definitely"
24:46,000;24:48,560;"a little bit but"
24:48,560;24:54,440;"It is funny to as we go through this season to kind of see how that whole scenario played out"
24:54,440;24:59,200;"Yeah, this feels like officially because we were talking about it earlier that you know"
24:59,200;25:04,720;"Remember the whole saga, but we don't remember how it ended and this feels to me like this week specifically"
25:04,720;25:08,840;"This is the beginning of the index like we haven't actually heard about him in the past couple of weeks"
25:08,840;25:12,140;"Past few episodes like they just hasn't been any news on him"
25:12,140;25:17,080;"Everything was pretty quiet. I thought oh, maybe that's how it goes out. It's just like do you think that anymore?"
25:17,080;25:19,480;"We asked that question - we don't know"
25:19,480;25:26,320;"What was the question if if Terry Glenn go to Super Bowl? I gotta think that he probably did"
25:26,320;25:28,320;"I don't know craft"
25:28,320;25:32,040;"on the team, although a quick Google search now."
25:32,040;25:33,240;"- If you just shut up, he would have got him"
25:33,240;25:36,680;"like a $100,000 ring at the end of the year."
25:36,680;25:37,520;"- Here we go."
25:37,520;25:38,920;"- I think you might have still come to us."
25:38,920;25:39,760;"- You had to get."
25:39,760;25:40,600;"- What?"
25:40,600;25:44,160;"- For episode, this I found an article"
25:44,160;25:47,920;"from February 8th, 2002, entitled,"
25:47,920;25:51,360;"""Glenn says he would take Super Bowl ring if offered."""
25:51,360;25:53,160;"Controversial wide receiver Terry Glenn said"
25:53,160;25:55,320;"he probably does not deserve a ring"
25:55,320;25:56,920;"from Super Bowl champion New England Pages,"
25:56,920;25:58,120;"but would accept one if offered."
25:58,120;25:59,800;"That's ridiculous."
25:59,800;26:02,920;"Where was the server ring compared to the guys who are out there and want to"
26:02,920;26:03,400;"Zoopball?"
26:03,400;26:04,120;"Of course not."
26:04,120;26:05,320;"Glenn told the Boston Globe."
26:05,320;26:08,240;"And I was happy for those guys."
26:08,240;26:11,320;"They're my friends, but I felt like I was still part of that organization."
26:11,320;26:12,560;"I did play some of this year."
26:12,560;26:16,600;"Yeah, but it was that before the rings were handed out or after."
26:16,600;26:21,000;"What was it? February, February to the February 8 2002."
26:21,000;26:23,080;"Yeah, they have handed them up then."
26:23,080;26:24,760;"No, I don't think so."
26:25,840;26:29,840;"Super Bowl would have been like February 2002 right? Yeah, it would have been"
26:29,840;26:33,840;"Yeah, but the rings are usually like the ceremonies like way down the line, isn't it?"
26:33,840;26:37,200;"In the summer. Yeah. Yeah. So I wonder if"
26:37,200;26:44,000;"Wonder if he did it, huh? Now that they've won the Super Bowl. Why bother with me? He said just reach a settlement"
26:44,000;26:47,840;"I don't even care about the money. Let's just break it off poor guy"
26:47,840;26:51,200;"What's up with the wide receivers?"
26:51,520;26:52,880;"I think there's different breed."
26:52,880;26:56,680;"They've always been kind of that me first diva mentality."
26:56,680;26:58,800;"That's always been the stereotype, right?"
26:58,800;27:00,520;"The whole quiche on Johnson, right in a book"
27:00,520;27:02,520;"called Throw Me the Dam Ball."
27:02,520;27:03,320;"Right."
27:03,320;27:06,120;"Terrell Loehl is working out in his driveway"
27:06,120;27:07,080;"during the off season."
27:07,080;27:10,200;"I mean, we follow the Antonio Brown thing up until now,"
27:10,200;27:14,880;"but I guess now looking a little bit worse than--"
27:14,880;27:16,880;"I mean, we sort of alluded to the fact"
27:16,880;27:17,960;"that it could go either way."
27:17,960;27:22,960;"But Serentonia Brown has gotten into some trouble."
27:22,960;27:25,760;"- Yeah, it's not looking great."
27:25,760;27:27,640;"- So again, for those that are listening,"
27:27,640;27:29,240;"you probably know the outcome."
27:29,240;27:32,640;"- We don't, don't spoil it for us."
27:32,640;27:37,600;"- Speaking of troubled players,"
27:37,600;27:40,240;"the star of this offense of this ain't seen"
27:40,240;27:41,920;"was Ricky Williams."
27:41,920;27:42,760;"- Love it."
27:42,760;27:44,560;"- Ricky Williams, yeah."
27:44,560;27:46,080;"Definitely a fun dude."
27:46,080;27:56,400;"I did love how the commentators commented on his small hands and how that contributed"
27:56,400;28:01,360;"to him not being able to catch the ball or how many funnels he had."
28:01,360;28:02,360;"Poor guy."
28:02,360;28:03,720;"Of all the things he has tiny hands."
28:03,720;28:07,880;"But after the game, the page actually did a good job of stopping him, which I don't"
28:07,880;28:12,900;"know if it was a surprise to me or what, but I just feel like I had this reaction every"
28:12,900;28:17,860;"time I saw him get the ball of like the clenching that we talked about every time I'd see Drew"
28:17,860;28:24,140;"blood so drop back on third down where you just I feel like he kind of tore the pages"
28:24,140;28:28,460;"to bits but I don't know if that was when he was with the dolphins the other few remember"
28:28,460;28:32,020;"hmm I just I had lives like bad the hour"
28:32,020;28:37,460;"the same day oh shit one day huh what did you say Steve?"
28:37,460;28:39,900;"probably when he is with the dolphins."
28:39,900;28:41,980;"- Yeah, yeah, it's probably when he is with the dolphins."
28:41,980;28:44,220;"- Was he the part of that dolphins team"
28:44,220;28:45,380;"that ran the wildcat?"
28:45,380;28:47,980;"That's what I couldn't remember."
28:47,980;28:50,180;"- That was with the running around."
28:50,180;28:51,740;"- Yeah, okay."
28:51,740;28:52,580;"- Our cousin."
28:52,580;28:54,900;"(laughs)"
28:54,900;28:56,660;"- I'm gonna go out on a limb and say probably not."
28:56,660;28:58,980;"- Um, yeah."
28:58,980;29:02,140;"I mean, Ricky Williams though had an interesting career."
29:02,140;29:05,420;"So that guy was fun to keep tabs on."
29:05,420;29:06,500;"- He was, he was."
29:06,500;29:10,900;"other than that on offense, there was Joe Horn, went to the Pro Bowl."
29:10,900;29:13,100;"Yeah, the decent year didn't do much."
29:13,100;29:15,100;"That's a Mr. Cell phone, right?"
29:15,100;29:16,540;"Oh, that's right."
29:16,540;29:17,100;"That was him."
29:17,100;29:18,100;"Yeah."
29:18,100;29:19,100;"Yeah."
29:19,100;29:23,140;"Where he only had one cell phone stashed in the goal post."
29:23,140;29:26,140;"So if he scored in the opposite end, that wouldn't have worked."
29:26,140;29:29,940;"Yeah, it wouldn't have happened, which is great."
29:29,940;29:34,540;"That's got to be the best TD celebration of all time, right?"
29:34,540;29:38,860;"I'm partial to Randy Moss pretending to moon the crowd personally."
29:38,860;29:42,180;"Yeah, which I don't know why was it Joe Buck that was like,"
29:42,180;29:44,740;"I can't believe he did that."
29:44,740;29:46,060;"It was. Yeah."
29:46,060;29:49,180;"Come on. Don't get me started on Joe Buck, Michael."
29:49,180;29:50,380;"All right."
29:50,380;29:51,340;"You got that."
29:51,340;29:55,700;"They made rules after after Joe Horn pulled that cell phone out right there."
29:55,700;29:56,820;"Like no props."
29:56,820;29:58,780;"That's like, I think it was between that."
29:58,780;30:01,660;"That was the season, I think, because it was him and Chad."
30:01,660;30:02,980;"You know, it was a go. Yeah."
30:02,980;30:04,020;"Yeah. Yeah."
30:04,020;30:07,540;"'cause he was pulling, he pulled a sign out of the snow and said, ""NFL, please don't find me."""
30:07,540;30:08,380;"So they find him for it."
30:08,380;30:09,300;"Right."
30:09,300;30:10,740;"Who's the one for you?"
30:10,740;30:11,500;"Yeah."
30:11,500;30:12,140;"T.O."
30:12,140;30:14,100;"Neilin on the Cowboys star."
30:14,100;30:14,780;"Yeah."
30:14,780;30:17,940;"Or be like him just like posing there and gets taffled."
30:17,940;30:18,660;"That was for you."
30:18,660;30:19,300;"All right."
30:19,300;30:20,660;"That's that's why I do number one."
30:20,660;30:22,260;"That was that was great."
30:22,260;30:24,460;"He had the proposing to the cheerleader."
30:24,460;30:25,660;"He had the popcorn."
30:25,660;30:27,460;"He was pretty good."
30:27,460;30:27,780;"Right."
30:27,780;30:30,300;"Yeah, he was he was he was on his game."
30:30,300;30:35,600;"to do some good, no, it's good anymore. It's a shame. I don't know. I mean, some"
30:35,600;31:00,160;"coordinated ones are okay, but I don't know. Oh, I think even T. Yeah, I think T.S. still on his game, man. Oh, he's awesome. I'm sure he's still got some good one. To be. I'm like, I'm not making the cowboy solid. Just like feasting on his tears. Yeah. See to be fair that season, the celebrations, we're getting a little weak. Like, I think you know, Joe Cinco had like the the robo thing where he's paddling like,"
31:00,160;31:01,160;"Oh yeah."
31:01,160;31:02,740;"- Just resuscitate like a football,"
31:02,740;31:05,600;"like things weren't making sense after awhile."
31:05,600;31:06,720;"- I mean, you're running out of ideas,"
31:06,720;31:08,480;"but you gotta like keep doing something, right?"
31:08,480;31:09,320;"- I know."
31:09,320;31:10,640;"- You can score and bury Sanders"
31:10,640;31:13,200;"and just give the ball back like you've been there before."
31:13,200;31:14,320;"- But I feel that Joe Horns"
31:14,320;31:16,680;"- Don't forget all this with his cell phone, you know?"
31:16,680;31:18,520;"That's gotta be like first up there."
31:18,520;31:19,860;"- Yeah."
31:19,860;31:24,860;"And in recent news, he also got caught in his scam."
31:24,860;31:28,760;"Do you guys hear about that?"
31:28,760;31:30,120;"The healthcare scam?"
31:30,120;31:31,520;"Oh, he was part of that."
31:31,520;31:32,680;"He was part of that."
31:32,680;31:34,080;"Yeah, I feel like we touched on that reason,"
31:34,080;31:36,320;"those couple of other players as well."
31:36,320;31:36,820;"I don't know."
31:36,820;31:38,000;"Clinton Portis was in there, I think."
31:38,000;31:39,880;"Yes, yes, yes, that's who it was."
31:39,880;31:43,920;"And Rachey Caldwell, that's what it was."
31:43,920;31:46,680;"Well, that is a collection of names."
31:46,680;31:47,560;"Yeah, you know."
31:47,560;31:48,640;"He's shit."
31:48,640;31:50,880;"It's just-- it's the news."
31:50,880;31:51,880;"Yeah."
31:51,880;31:54,440;"That's sure it is."
31:54,440;31:56,440;"Let's see."
31:56,440;31:57,600;"Who else was on this team?"
31:57,600;31:59,440;"Did you know, Rick, any other names?"
31:59,440;32:03,520;"Sammy Knight was on this team and apparently he was the playmaker."
32:03,520;32:04,540;"I don't remember him."
32:04,540;32:09,380;"I don't really remember him, but as a strong safety, he led the team in both"
32:09,380;32:14,800;"interceptions, fumble returns, fumble recoveries and tackles from the strong"
32:14,800;32:15,540;"safety position."
32:15,540;32:17,260;"That would never happen anymore."
32:17,260;32:21,040;"Although if you're leading your team in tackles from the safety position,"
32:21,040;32:25,360;"that's usually not a good sign for a, which is weird because has it supposed"
32:25,360;32:27,040;"to be like the defensive coordinator guy."
32:27,040;32:30,600;"So you think his defense would be the strong point of his team, but it wasn't."
32:30,600;32:34,160;"I had no idea who their quote unquote lockdown corner was."
32:34,160;32:38,400;"Yeah, they kept talking about him through the whole game, but who was it?"
32:38,400;32:40,320;"I remember his name."
32:40,320;32:41,200;"Yeah."
32:41,200;32:43,680;"I don't remember the name because they talked about him early."
32:43,680;32:46,840;"You're like, Oh, they picked him up from somewhere and he was supposed to be"
32:46,840;32:51,320;"this really good defensive back."
32:51,320;32:53,600;"He was, he wasn't that great before."
32:53,600;32:54,240;"I don't know."
32:54,240;32:56,880;"It's going through injuries or something, but this year he"
32:56,880;33:03,880;"really step it up. He's become a shut down corner. Let's see. Was it Fred Thomas?"
33:03,880;33:14,880;"And my various. So let's see. Sammy Knight and Jay Bellamy were the safeties. Kevin Mathis and Fred Thomas were the..."
33:14,880;33:24,880;"Yeah, it's Fred Thomas. I think it's Fred Thomas. And he's gonna cover Troy Brown in this game and Troy Brown's gonna have a tough time with him and he didn't."
33:24,880;33:26,880;"Or did he?"
33:26,880;33:28,680;"No, he had seven."
33:28,680;33:30,880;"Find out. Hey, what's going on?"
33:30,880;33:32,880;"91 yards in a touchdown."
33:32,880;33:34,880;"Or we could just ruin the whole game for everybody."
33:34,880;33:37,880;"Well, I mean, with this far in, we haven't actually done it."
33:37,880;33:38,880;"The rain, Troy Brown game."
33:38,880;33:41,880;"Yeah, this was this was quality Troy Brown game."
33:41,880;33:46,880;"I will say LaRoya Glover on the Saints, by the way, I remember him and he was kind of a beast."
33:46,880;33:48,880;"I remember him just for his name."
33:48,880;33:52,880;"It was LaRoy with the apostrophe and Glover, which sounds like a glove."
33:52,880;34:03,100;"like a glove and then I remember 100% willy rof willy rof yeah I remember that"
34:03,100;34:10,400;"too but sickening for a big fat offensive lineman guy I mean like meat rof yeah"
34:10,400;34:14,880;"surprise there wasn't those jokes in there actually they they had one pun about"
34:14,880;34:19,620;"rof but I don't remember what it was it wasn't very good so did you touch on"
34:19,620;34:25,260;"Bo Williams then because he wrote it down. I wrote down Bo Williams but the the note that I had on here if we're gonna"
34:25,260;34:31,160;"Pull the the kimono aside is a great name mediocre Titan. Did you know who he was before I wrote his name down?"
34:31,160;34:39,020;"Well, no, there was that time that I didn't know yeah, that's what I thought"
34:39,020;34:46,820;"All right get the game. How did what do you think of the game? I thought it was a strong start"
34:47,260;34:54,100;"For sure for the Patriots. I feel like the Patriots have had strong stars this season kind of generally"
34:54,100;34:59,700;"And then they fade at the end which is very unpatriot like these days. Well, funny you mentioned that because"
34:59,700;35:06,180;"They were mentioning that the Patriots scored first nine out of 11 times"
35:06,180;35:09,260;"So far that season pretty impressive"
35:09,260;35:14,600;"It is I don't know I thought they kind of put it away in the end of the third beginning of the fourth quarter drive for that touchdown"
35:14,600;35:17,360;"It is rain. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. That's true."
35:17,360;35:21,480;"Jeez. You're talking about the journey, guys."
35:21,480;35:26,000;"Bro, we're like 45 minutes into this podcast."
35:26,000;35:29,080;"The journey just on its way settles down."
35:29,080;35:31,000;"We got to talk about the first drive, baby."
35:31,000;35:32,480;"All right. Talk about that first drive."
35:32,480;35:34,880;"Uh, you can do it if you want."
35:34,880;35:38,440;"Oh, what? Like four or five plays of it."
35:38,440;35:42,120;"It wasn't very long because it, uh, yeah."
35:42,120;35:46,040;"- I mean, it ended with the 41 yard screen pass"
35:46,040;35:48,760;"to Antoine Smith, which is safe."
35:48,760;35:51,720;"- That play call was tremendous."
35:51,720;35:53,240;"- Oh, great timing."
35:53,240;35:55,800;"- Great call, Mount Aftert, on a waste."
35:55,800;36:00,040;"- It's one of those plays that I feel you don't see enough"
36:00,040;36:03,000;"that kind of everybody rolls out to one side"
36:03,000;36:05,080;"and then it's the kind of the throwback screen"
36:05,080;36:07,640;"to the other side, to the empty side of the field."
36:07,640;36:11,040;"And on this play, it was Antoine Smith"
36:11,040;36:15,440;"and two offensive linemen on one half the field."
36:15,440;36:18,440;"There's just them and there was nobody else out there."
36:18,440;36:21,280;"I think the two blockers got what,"
36:21,280;36:23,840;"20, 30 yards down the field before they hit anybody?"
36:23,840;36:24,680;"- Yeah."
36:24,680;36:25,720;"- And it was like both safeties,"
36:25,720;36:28,600;"where they had to come all the way back across."
36:28,600;36:30,440;"The only one that had any sort of angle on the play"
36:30,440;36:33,320;"and they won't go blown up by one of the offensive linemen"
36:33,320;36:34,160;"who were down the field."
36:34,160;36:36,240;"- It didn't really like throw a block on that play as well."
36:36,240;36:38,000;"Was that the play?"
36:38,000;36:39,400;"No, he was on the opposite side of the field,"
36:39,400;36:40,900;"He did throw blocks sometime."
36:40,900;36:41,800;"He did."
36:41,800;36:45,060;"Um, it was when they tried to run a reverse."
36:45,060;36:46,400;"Oh, that's right."
36:46,400;36:50,420;"And they had him out there as a lead blocker, but it got blown up in the backfield."
36:50,420;36:53,800;"So Antoine Smith just ate the ball and didn't pitch it."
36:53,800;36:54,360;"That's right."
36:54,360;36:54,800;"That's right."
36:54,800;36:56,200;"I thought that which I thought was smart."
36:56,200;36:59,120;"Uh, I would have liked to see him toss it."
36:59,120;37:03,640;"I thought, yeah, he was hemmed him, but I thought, uh, Patton had."
37:03,640;37:04,480;"Yeah."
37:04,480;37:06,160;"Then you know they would have fucked that up though."
37:06,160;37:08,040;"And so prime fucking up spot."
37:08,560;37:14,140;"Not this game and in the same fence on that first touchdown like how many balls that Antoine Smith catch"
37:14,140;37:17,440;"He's like Sony"
37:17,440;37:23,200;"Yeah, he wasn't a big pass catcher just in general like if you've been Kevin Falk and they got burnt on that"
37:23,200;37:28,280;"You like come on guys. What are you doing? Of course, it's gonna be a screen of Kevin Falk. Yeah. Yeah, but you don't expect"
37:28,280;37:31,960;"Spanish Inquisition or the screen pass to"
37:32,480;37:37,480;"I will say, Venetary and the ensuing kickoff and every kickoff probably this entire year"
37:37,480;37:44,120;"Sucked at getting it past what the 20-yard line. Yeah, I mean"
37:44,120;37:48,320;"I mean, I know what he was never really known for that. Yeah"
37:48,320;37:55,240;"I feel like he was never really known for his booming kickoff and the Patriots always seem to try to"
37:55,240;38:00,080;"Not kick-touchbacks unless it's a really dangerous. Yeah, but at least with"
38:00,880;38:03,920;"gaskowski there's like he puts it at the one"
38:03,920;38:06,720;"V sanitary puts it at like the 15"
38:06,720;38:09,760;"That is true. Yeah, and gives them a running start right"
38:09,760;38:12,400;"Further back"
38:12,400;38:14,400;"Oh, you're right"
38:14,400;38:21,440;"That's a little something yeah good at all so yeah, and I think there was an article in one of the the globes"
38:21,440;38:29,440;"Days about how you can't really blame out of vin and terry because his kick courage team is is got awful"
38:30,160;38:36,080;"was the gist of it. And I don't know if fully agree with that because I think it's all into play,"
38:36,080;38:42,640;"but I am surprised how bad this kick, but just the special teams in general are in that season."
38:42,640;38:49,120;"No, just because Belichick hasn't got his scheme fully implemented or what's going on, but it is"
38:49,120;38:57,840;"kind of surprising because last game there was a comment about how the Rams and the Patriots were"
38:57,840;39:06,000;"the two worst kick coverage teams in the league. And yet somehow they both end up going to the"
39:06,000;39:13,920;"Super Bowl. Spoiler alert. I couldn't stop that one guys. Sorry. I had no idea. Do some"
39:13,920;39:19,200;"Calistard turn kicks either. He was super good in this game. Yeah, well, that's kind of all he"
39:19,200;39:27,160;"did on this Saints team. He was the third leading rush on this team behind obviously really"
39:27,160;39:30,560;"Ricky Williams and so I think you have like under 100 yards, wasn't"
39:30,560;39:35,880;"Yeah, he did. Yeah, his stat line was actually pretty legit. He finished"
39:35,880;39:39,400;"season 91 rushing yards, but had a long 54."
39:39,400;39:43,800;"Doesn't he like that? He must be good later on in his career, then,"
39:43,800;39:47,240;"because I remember deuce being pretty solid. Yeah, I think you're right."
39:47,240;39:51,280;"Yeah, I think so too. I think, uh, didn't he go on to play with"
39:51,280;39:55,080;"he was with another back. He goes, yeah, the Eagles, I think."
39:55,280;39:56,280;"No, maybe not."
39:56,280;39:58,280;"We're thinking of Brian Westbrook."
39:58,280;40:03,280;"Mark Ingram and Camara with Deuce McAllister and somebody else in New Orleans."
40:03,280;40:04,280;"Let's see."
40:04,280;40:05,280;"Yeah."
40:05,280;40:06,280;"Yeah."
40:06,280;40:10,280;"I mean, actually I just want to put it out there that we're not experts on any of this."
40:10,280;40:13,280;"So anything that we say could potentially be completely inaccurate."
40:13,280;40:16,280;"No, Steve Brown nailed it after this season."
40:16,280;40:23,280;"Deuce McAllister ran for 1300 1600 and then just over a thousand yards in three seasons."
40:23,280;40:25,280;"Hey, and your fucking face Mike"
40:25,280;40:31,220;"Oh my Lord, it's claim round after I said oh, yeah, because he said"
40:31,220;40:34,800;"Well that we've already covered that"
40:34,800;40:37,280;"Let me rephrase"
40:37,280;40:42,460;"Anything that Andy says it's probably bullshit because he doesn't know what he's talking about is that better Steve?"
40:42,460;40:45,400;"No"
40:45,400;40:49,480;"Good answer. Oh boy. This is starting off well"
40:51,800;40:53,800;"We're in our in 15 in"
40:53,800;41:00,680;"We're not now in 15 where you guys getting these numbers. Oh, yeah, I showed up way late. Sorry"
41:00,680;41:04,240;"Yeah, my monitor was broken guys. Sorry"
41:04,240;41:08,280;"God you're late one time a half hour. Everybody loses their shit"
41:08,280;41:16,440;"Well, you were so late that my headphones. What is happening? You're on Bluetooth. I was oh boy"
41:16,440;41:18,600;"This is a great conversation. Oh, yeah"
41:20,040;41:22,040;"All right, so"
41:22,040;41:28,400;"The other thing I think we talk about is the kicker which we didn't touch on before because"
41:28,400;41:30,960;"John Carney on the season"
41:30,960;41:36,000;"Missed three field goals the entire season two of them were in the first quarter of this game"
41:36,000;41:41,640;"One he missed it was a longer kick. I think on the the team is three or four Andy"
41:41,640;41:47,440;"We ain't professionals"
41:48,080;41:50,080;"Don't do math"
41:50,080;41:56,720;"Anyways, yeah, you're right to miss field walls. Yep, and one of them was blocked by our boy, but you'd see more"
41:56,720;42:02,920;"Caught him right. That's right. Although if an attorney missed one as well. So rough day for the kicking game"
42:02,920;42:06,040;"Yeah, I feel like we can chalk this one maybe up to the"
42:06,040;42:08,920;"the weather with the wind and the rain but"
42:08,920;42:15,920;"I feel like Benetarian hasn't been as automatic this season as I remember him being you know you remember him just like never missing a kick"
42:15,920;42:22,240;"Yeah, but he's actually misgride a few in this season. I don't I think it happened after the 2001 season for some reason"
42:22,240;42:28,800;"Cuz I mean didn't we say that is like career number before this was like 79% or something like that. Yeah, they weren't great"
42:28,800;42:33,260;"Yeah, so something something clicks eventually steroids"
42:33,260;42:38,360;"Allegedly allegedly"
42:38,360;42:44,680;"But anyways the rest of this game we could pretty much fast forward to"
42:45,600;42:48,800;"Right before halftime because it was seven nothing Pat's"
42:48,800;42:52,400;"But for like a seven nothing game they look really good"
42:52,400;42:59,340;"Wasn't 13 oven well I'm saying before the half so before that drive it was seven nothing until about like"
42:59,340;43:01,460;"You know a minute and a half left in the game. I"
43:01,460;43:03,240;"mean a"
43:03,240;43:05,240;"minute and a half left in the half and"
43:05,240;43:08,480;"Paths up seven nothing"
43:08,480;43:13,680;"Yeah, they want to live up in the house. I'm saying I'm saying up until that drive guys"
43:14,800;43:18,480;"Seven nothing game. Oh, they went into the half up 20 to nothing"
43:18,480;43:22,120;"You're right my notes are fucked up. All right. Well"
43:22,120;43:30,060;"Fast forward to that driver. It's 13 nothing. No, I don't know what you guys take over you guys have flustered me"
43:30,060;43:36,400;"Yeah, I mean you missed the the Brady touchdown pass Detroit Brown"
43:36,400;43:42,120;"Where afterwards the I thought that was the one but it wasn't your boy Ken Walter"
43:43,320;43:47,440;"I was holding the extra point. You're you're punter there and he kind of"
43:47,440;43:51,200;"When he the snap was high so he caught it like in his chest"
43:51,200;43:56,040;"we kind of fumbled a little bit putting it down and then Adam and Terry didn't get them quick enough"
43:56,040;44:02,320;"Like fuck it and just like pulled it and ran all by himself. Yeah, I don't know what that was and got lit the fuck up"
44:02,320;44:04,520;"You're right. I apologize guys"
44:04,520;44:12,360;"You're right because then you know there there was a a bunch of like back and forth here like everybody going three and out"
44:12,360;44:17,780;"I just had to note that like the game was like there wasn't a lot of action"
44:17,780;44:21,740;"But the paths look like they were dominating for some reason. Yeah, it did. Yeah, cuz the"
44:21,740;44:24,340;"the paths were"
44:24,340;44:27,620;"Winning the battle of field position even when they weren't scoring like they were"
44:27,620;44:33,260;"Even they're punting they were they were downing the ball inside like the five-yard line every time"
44:33,260;44:36,140;"Hmm the Saints would get out of their own ends"
44:37,060;44:43,300;"With either of some random amazing catch on a deep pass or something they get to like the 15 then like sputter"
44:43,300;44:45,940;"You can miss a field or pun to back or whatever"
44:45,940;44:48,940;"But then like you said right at the end of the half"
44:48,940;44:53,020;"The first play of the drive Brady"
44:53,020;44:56,780;"This is the one that Steve was talking about earlier Brady gets hit from behind"
44:56,780;45:01,860;"And gets like is that snap back of your head that you used to see and all the"
45:01,860;45:04,100;"those"
45:04,100;45:06,100;"NFL's greatest hits"
45:06,340;45:07,820;"VHS tapes, you remember those?"
45:07,820;45:08,660;"I know."
45:08,660;45:12,100;"And it was just all of those like quarterback getting blinds as all they were."
45:12,100;45:16,460;"And it was that type of hit and Brady lost the ball, but somehow the past recovered."
45:16,460;45:17,740;"It didn't even look like they should have."
45:17,740;45:22,860;"Um, and then they run a couple of plays and that was at their own."
45:22,860;45:23,860;"Yeah."
45:23,860;45:29,340;"Antoine gets like a bunch of yards on both plays, like 10, 15 yards on each place."
45:29,340;45:30,260;"I guess I'm like midfield."
45:30,260;45:34,340;"So they're like, all right, there's, there's, I think 30 seconds left at this point."
45:34,340;45:35,500;"they're just gonna start airing it out,"
45:35,500;45:37,680;"try going for the touchdown."
45:37,680;45:42,680;"And Brady finds, what was his name, Charles Johnson?"
45:42,680;45:43,760;"Is that right?"
45:43,760;45:44,600;"- Yeah."
45:44,600;45:47,420;"- Yeah, I think Charles Johnson's only touchdown"
45:47,420;45:52,420;"from Tom Brady, but it was an absolute fucking laser."
45:52,420;45:55,100;"- That was one of the best throws braids ever made,"
45:55,100;45:57,260;"I feel like over the mine backer"
45:57,260;45:59,020;"in between the safety and the cornerback."
45:59,020;45:59,860;"- Yep."
45:59,860;46:02,700;"- The window was minute."
46:02,700;46:03,980;"- Yeah, it was an amazing throw."
46:03,980;46:09,780;"See, maybe I wanted to jump the gun here because, so yeah, so I guess that made it 20 nothing."
46:09,780;46:10,940;"So it was 13 nothing."
46:10,940;46:20,220;"But what I did want to point out about that drive outside of that like crazy, you know, laser to Johnson was on that drive."
46:20,220;46:23,180;"Brady was rolling out to the left."
46:23,180;46:25,300;"He was rolling out to the right at one point."
46:25,300;46:31,540;"He was diving for first downs, the long past David Patton and then the touchdown to Johnson."
46:31,900;46:36,060;"So I felt like that was a statement drive for the year and I called it the"
46:36,060;46:38,460;"drive of the year up to this point."
46:38,460;46:40,900;"I would agree with that."
46:40,900;46:46,580;"Uh, cause I think that the only other one that I can think of off the top of my"
46:46,580;46:52,100;"head would be the one against San Diego, the tie it at the end of the game."
46:52,100;46:54,020;"But that was like his first comeback win."
46:54,020;46:54,700;"Right."
46:54,700;46:58,220;"I think this was his like statement of not fucking around here."
46:58,220;46:59,300;"I'm not overwhelmed."
46:59,300;47:02,300;"I belong in the NFL. I am a starting quarterback."
47:02,300;47:03,100;"So that thing."
47:03,100;47:05,900;"Yeah, I know it was amazing with eight seconds left."
47:05,900;47:09,100;"As we call the drive of the whole season, right?"
47:09,100;47:10,300;"Up to this point, yeah."
47:10,300;47:12,500;"Up to this point. I don't know what's to come."
47:12,500;47:13,100;"All right."
47:13,100;47:14,700;"I mean, turning point."
47:14,700;47:16,500;"Yeah, I'll give you that."
47:16,500;47:19,900;"I mean, it was pretty amazing for anybody who has access to that drive."
47:19,900;47:21,800;"It is pretty textbook."
47:21,800;47:22,900;"Yeah, it is."
47:22,900;47:25,400;"And Tom Brady had that one long run, too."
47:25,400;47:27,400;"I was I feel like I"
47:27,400;47:32,260;"Was surprised at how active Brady was in the run game in this game"
47:32,260;47:37,240;"Like he was taken off if there's nothing open. It wasn't getting very far because he's not fast"
47:37,240;47:39,160;"but"
47:39,160;47:42,600;"At one point I caught it. They called a design quarterback draw"
47:42,600;47:46,260;"Yeah, I have on here Brady looks like a baby deer running"
47:46,260;47:52,840;"It looks like a newborn deer running. It just hasn't quite figured out how his legs work yet. Yeah, yeah"
47:53,160;47:58,280;"And one of the plays that we was like rolling out he must have ran like 40 yards before gaming like eight"
47:58,280;48:02,700;"I think as one of the longest runs of his career. Yeah, it was amazing"
48:02,700;48:07,880;"But I think because of that"
48:07,880;48:11,000;"All and I think both"
48:11,000;48:16,720;"Antoine Smith had a really good running game - in this game. Oh, yeah, he crushed him and"
48:16,720;48:19,680;"that opened up the"
48:21,240;48:25,860;"Tom Brady patented play action. Mm-hmm. I think my favorite one that I forget"
48:25,860;48:27,860;"I don't think they run it much anymore"
48:27,860;48:34,060;"But that they faked the pitch and then he kind of spins around real quick and throws a quick slant to whoever it is"
48:34,060;48:40,300;"That play. That's right. That used to be a staple. I thought I remembered it"
48:40,300;48:42,660;"I saw it in this game like oh, I love that play"
48:42,660;48:47,900;"But I don't remember that and they don't run that really anymore at least not that way"
48:49,100;48:52,260;"I read a letter to Charlie Weiss telling to bring it back."
48:52,260;48:53,300;"Yeah."
48:53,300;48:59,900;"But the one play that they did run, which I think has been kind of the bread and butter"
48:59,900;49:03,860;"was the direct snap play to Kevin Falk."
49:03,860;49:04,460;"Mm-hmm."
49:04,460;49:05,420;"Did you see that one?"
49:05,420;49:06,140;"Yeah."
49:06,140;49:13,500;"And the favorite part of that play was Tom Brady dropping back to pass without the ball in his hands."
49:13,500;49:16,700;"And it fooled like the entire defensive line."
49:16,900;49:18,780;"Like they're all rushing up field to get to them."
49:18,780;49:22,180;"And Kevin Fox, like four or five yards downfield already."
49:22,180;49:25,900;"Is that the one where the announcers were like freaking out at how much he sold that?"
49:25,900;49:26,980;"Yes."
49:26,980;49:29,620;"I'd never seen it before."
49:29,620;49:30,980;"Yeah. Like, look at this kid."
49:30,980;49:33,220;"He's actually he's pretending to hold the ball."
49:33,220;49:37,300;"What gumshade?"
49:37,300;49:38,540;"I don't also do."
49:38,540;49:41,100;"Have any of you heard of either of these commentators?"
49:41,100;49:43,020;"No, but they were fine."
49:43,020;49:46,180;"They were fine, but they did leave me very confused."
49:46,180;49:50,940;"And, you know, what was that?"
49:50,940;49:52,140;"Are we going to do this?"
49:52,140;49:53,740;"Yeah, we're going to do it, man."
49:53,740;49:59,940;"Again, I try not to every week, but these guys, I mean, Bill Moss, especially was fantastic."
49:59,940;50:01,700;"Yeah, so let's introduce him first."
50:01,700;50:05,620;"Sam Rosen and Bill Moss, who I've never heard of."
50:05,620;50:13,220;"Me neither, but he had some pizzazz, apparently, in one of the articles that you had posted,"
50:13,220;50:20,660;"were not happy with him because the article said the PC police was out to get him because"
50:20,660;50:27,380;"he said that the line was winning in the trenches and they thought that that was a military"
50:27,380;50:34,580;"reference and that was too risque. So he had flack about that. So it's interesting because"
50:34,580;50:39,740;"we think that everything's incendiary now but he was getting flack for making a military"
50:39,740;50:45,300;"reference, which I thought that was like common terms. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But again, I don't know"
50:45,300;50:52,140;"anything. The amount of military terms in football lingo is like 80% of all football terms."
50:52,140;50:58,820;"Yeah, so bomb all of it. That wasn't even part of my football or not football, because I figured"
50:58,820;51:06,780;"in the trenches was just a sort of metaphor. Yeah, pretty easy to figure out. Okay. He also said"
51:06,780;51:10,580;"this or did that was funny. But he goes ever since they said Kyle Turner of the"
51:10,580;51:14,500;"Saints to anger management. The whole team has gotten a little softer and he"
51:14,500;51:19,460;"starts laughing and then the other announcer just goes maybe."
51:19,460;51:26,900;"I got to freak out in the game before when they were playing the Rams in the"
51:26,900;51:31,340;"locker room and like throwing a bunch of shit and it beat on the team."
51:31,340;51:35,620;"Yeah, he was talking to somebody. I didn't quite follow what he was talking"
51:35,620;51:39,300;"about, but yeah, somebody was like breaking shit in the at half"
51:39,300;51:41,060;"time or something like that. And they came back and won the"
51:41,060;51:43,020;"game or something. I think we were talking about."
51:43,020;51:47,300;"Wow. Yeah. I don't know. But Bill Moss is very close to"
51:47,300;51:51,260;"Brent Jones in my opinion. But we do that same thing for sure."
51:51,260;51:56,740;"We can go down my list if you guys want. Yeah. I guess the"
51:56,740;52:01,380;"first question would be so he said, see Bruce key number 54 at"
52:01,380;52:03,860;"the bottom of the pile down there. There's a lot of banging"
52:03,860;52:08,420;"going on. What is that? Is that football or not football?"
52:08,420;52:14,460;"I think it's football. And I think the banging they're talking"
52:14,460;52:17,820;"about is banging their pads together probably, banging their"
52:17,820;52:18,620;"bodies together."
52:18,620;52:22,900;"Oh, wait, yeah, but if you're in the bottom of if you're at the"
52:22,900;52:26,620;"bottom of the pile, though, like, hasn't the collision already"
52:26,620;52:27,820;"happened? I'm confused about that."
52:27,820;52:30,180;"Yeah, I think I think that's why he's at the bottom of the pile"
52:30,180;52:31,700;"is because he did a lot of banging."
52:31,820;52:34,260;"Oh, he's talking about the process of the pile happening."
52:34,260;52:35,340;"I think so."
52:35,340;52:37,460;"Now, wouldn't he's actually down there?"
52:37,460;52:39,180;"I'm guessing yes."
52:39,180;52:40,420;"I don't want to speak for it."
52:40,420;52:43,540;"I don't want to put words in his mouth, but that's my assumption."
52:43,540;52:45,580;"OK, Steve."
52:45,580;52:46,220;"Yeah, I don't know."
52:46,220;52:48,220;"It could be either way."
52:48,220;52:49,860;"OK, thank you for that."
52:49,860;52:52,460;"The next one, he wants it all the time."
52:52,460;52:54,100;"And if you don't give it to him often enough,"
52:54,100;52:55,980;"he kind of gets his dober down a little bit"
52:55,980;52:58,340;"and then becomes ineffective."
52:58,340;52:59,500;"His dober."
52:59,500;53:00,500;"Yeah."
53:00,500;53:08,500;"I think I remember it. It was all I know is about Joe Horn. Yes, it was about Joe. So Joe Horn getting his dober down."
53:08,500;53:10,500;"Yeah, what does that mean?"
53:10,500;53:14,500;"I don't know what a dober is. If I'm being honest that that might be a dick joke."
53:14,500;53:16,500;"Really?"
53:16,500;53:25,500;"I'm not about dober being that. I mean he was because he was talking about like you need to feed him footballs or else he turns into Randy Moss and gets his dober down."
53:26,500;53:30,700;"And so I think he's like he's probably just gets a hard on forgetting catches"
53:30,700;53:33,300;"See because that's weird because it's like he wants it all the time"
53:33,300;53:37,600;"If you don't give it to him often enough he kind of gets his dober down right which is that kind of makes sense"
53:37,600;53:39,600;"And then he becomes ineffective"
53:39,600;53:45,660;"Yeah, well see there you go. So I think I think the first part is about getting footballs"
53:45,660;53:51,580;"And so the second part you think is is a big joke. I think so"
53:51,580;53:54,180;"All right. Yeah, I mean"
53:54,180;53:56,380;"Bill Moss out of the hell of a game"
53:56,380;54:01,420;"Um, next one, uh, maybe now that you guys said that halftime thing, maybe it makes a"
54:01,420;54:02,580;"little bit more sense."
54:02,580;54:06,700;"Uh, this quote, but he said about this game, I wish we had a camera in the"
54:06,700;54:07,980;"Saints locker room at halftime."
54:07,980;54:10,260;"I'd like to see that, you know, it would have to be one of those"
54:10,260;54:11,740;"cable review channels to watch."
54:11,740;54:13,240;"What the hell?"
54:13,240;54:15,980;"Now I guess I kind of get it, but at the time I did."
54:15,980;54:18,580;"Maybe he's talking about the swearing."
54:18,580;54:19,140;"Yeah."
54:19,140;54:21,700;"Duff is, you can't swear on network television."
54:21,700;54:21,980;"Can you?"
54:21,980;54:23,200;"Okay."
54:23,200;54:25,020;"So that's what he wanted to see in the locker room."
54:25,280;54:28,840;"Maybe, or maybe, maybe it thinks it's like WWE sort of style."
54:28,840;54:30,320;"But like shipping thrown around."
54:30,320;54:31,560;"That's that's pay per view, right?"
54:31,560;54:32,880;"I think so."
54:32,880;54:33,400;"Usually."
54:33,400;54:33,800;"I don't know."
54:33,800;54:35,000;"It was back then, for sure."
54:35,000;54:35,520;"Yeah."
54:35,520;54:37,280;"So all right."
54:37,280;54:38,520;"So I guess that's football."
54:38,520;54:42,640;"And then the last one, again, I don't know, two men coming hard,"
54:42,640;54:47,360;"Bruce G and Maloy, two men coming hard, Bruce, Bruce G and Maloy."
54:47,360;54:49,840;"I feel like we've been over this with coming hard and telling the whole."
54:49,840;54:51,720;"No, filling the whole."
54:51,720;54:53,440;"No, we've talked about filling the whole, which I get."
54:53,440;54:58,120;"We've talked about putting juice in the hole, which I forget, like too many coming hard."
54:58,120;54:59,120;"I haven't heard that one yet."
54:59,120;55:01,360;"Well, they're coming hard to fill the hole."
55:01,360;55:03,840;"They're running very quickly to come fill that hole."
55:03,840;55:05,480;"Oh, because they're defenders."
55:05,480;55:06,480;"Yes."
55:06,480;55:07,480;"Got him."
55:07,480;55:08,480;"All right."
55:08,480;55:09,480;"It's all good."
55:09,480;55:10,480;"Yeah."
55:10,480;55:11,480;"Yeah."
55:11,480;55:12,480;"That makes sense."
55:12,480;55:13,480;"But yeah, I think that's pretty much it."
55:13,480;55:15,480;"Thank you guys for helping me out there."
55:15,480;55:16,480;"Very welcome."
55:16,480;55:17,480;"Yeah."
55:17,480;55:18,480;"Bill Mazira."
55:18,480;55:19,480;"He did have himself quite the game."
55:19,480;55:22,720;"It was one part where he was legitimately arguing with the referees."
55:22,720;55:29,500;"Yeah, I love that on the because I also like anti PI he was like that's not bad"
55:29,500;55:30,300;"interference"
55:30,300;55:38,360;"Like I'm not stupid ass refs. Yeah, but yeah, cuz one of them was it was on a punt and I think it was Gerard Cherry"
55:38,360;55:39,620;"step on the"
55:39,620;55:44,520;"Like got back into the field of play and down the ball to one"
55:44,520;55:49,200;"And the refs like as he as the ref is explaining that he got a bit"
55:49,600;55:56,480;"No, no, he did not reestablish him. So like literally yelling at the TV as if he's me watching the TV"
55:56,480;56:04,240;"I literally show the replay afterwards where he got like you have to get two feet and you got like four steps in like well"
56:04,240;56:07,200;"maybe"
56:07,200;56:12,440;"I hope we get him again"
56:12,440;56:16,680;"It was exciting he did also have he went on a rant about"
56:18,160;56:23,960;"The defense having 12 guys on the field you see that it's like that should be a penalty even if they get off in time"
56:23,960;56:29,100;"Even the 12th guy gets off the field in time because the defense isn't gonna the offense isn't gonna know who's blitzing"
56:29,100;56:32,800;"One you don't blitz every play and"
56:32,800;56:36,140;"Two the offense like well"
56:36,140;56:38,960;"I mean he's at a point if you have 12 men in the huddle on offense"
56:38,960;56:41,840;"That's an automatic penalty before you can even break the huddle. It's true"
56:41,840;56:46,480;"But defenses don't have huddles so doesn't quite count and the reason he was to stop you from"
56:46,840;56:48,840;"Putting everybody on the field and then having"
56:48,840;56:54,320;"Enough guys run off so that the defense can't adjust and put their personnel on right"
56:54,320;56:57,760;"It's the offense that's dictating the personnel on the field"
56:57,760;57:01,840;"Chances are the guy running off the field is not blitzing"
57:01,840;57:07,040;"Pretty sure I think you're right"
57:07,040;57:10,360;"But hey, let's give it up to to go mosh"
57:10,360;57:15,440;"Yes, all right, great clapping on a podcast. That's that's gonna sound really good"
57:15,440;57:18,520;"(laughing)"
57:18,520;57:21,360;"All right, you guys have anybody else you wanna talk about?"
57:21,360;57:24,360;"Man, thank you."
57:24,360;57:29,160;"- I mean, you know, after drive of the year,"
57:29,160;57:30,600;"it's all downhill from there."
57:30,600;57:31,440;"- Yeah, nothing."
57:31,440;57:34,520;"- I mean, I would say that New Orleans made a pretty good push."
57:34,520;57:37,720;"And it was 27, 17 at one point."
57:37,720;57:41,240;"- Yep, yep, they, yeah, at the end of the third quarter,"
57:41,240;57:42,120;"it was 20 to 10."
57:42,120;57:44,840;"They pulled it back within 10 a couple times."
57:44,840;57:46,260;"But every time they did the pace"
57:46,260;57:47,760;"we were just driving on the field and just got touched."
57:47,760;57:50,200;"- Well there's that last touchdown with Antoine Smith"
57:50,200;57:51,680;"that he just ran it the whole time."
57:51,680;57:52,680;"- Yeah."
57:52,680;57:54,120;"- And then if you notice, right,"
57:54,120;57:57,240;"when he scored from like two yard line or whatever it was,"
57:57,240;57:58,680;"like the entire offensive line,"
57:58,680;58:01,240;"then all at the same time put up their arms."
58:01,240;58:02,080;"- Yeah."
58:02,080;58:03,720;"- Like that O line was so stoked on that."
58:03,720;58:06,200;"I mean, they had like a hundred and,"
58:06,200;58:07,920;"no, they had 193 or something like that,"
58:07,920;58:09,320;"yards running."
58:09,320;58:10,600;"They were pounding it out."
58:10,600;58:12,600;"- Yeah, and Brady almost had 300 yards"
58:12,600;58:13,600;"passing in four touchdowns."
58:13,600;58:16,280;"So they were firing all offensive cylinders there."
58:16,280;58:19,320;"- They had 191 yards rushing"
58:19,320;58:25,320;"and 258 yards passing for touchdown."
58:25,320;58:26,920;"- I did like the stat that,"
58:26,920;58:31,160;"I like the stat that they basically said"
58:31,160;58:35,240;"that New Orleans allowed 45 yards of, you know,"
58:35,240;58:37,560;"whatever run games, run plays up the middle,"
58:37,560;58:39,040;"the entire season up to that point."
58:39,040;58:40,400;"So 45 yards up the middle."
58:40,400;58:43,800;"And then that game Antoine Smith got,"
58:43,800;58:47,000;"I think it was 75 yards up the middle."
58:47,000;58:48,920;"So he almost doubled that."
58:48,920;58:49,920;"- He's crushing him."
58:49,920;58:52,320;"- All right, let's do some best and worst."
58:52,320;58:55,040;"Mike, you wanna go first?"
58:55,040;58:55,880;"- Oh, good."
58:55,880;58:57,040;"- I'm about this game."
58:57,040;58:57,960;"- Yeah, it was great."
58:57,960;58:59,440;"I mean, the first half was unbelievable."
58:59,440;59:02,360;"So, and that drive really pumped me up."
59:02,360;59:04,680;"I mean, it was definitely a taste of what was to come."
59:04,680;59:05,520;"- Absolutely."
59:06,600;59:10,360;"Let me see, let me see best and worst here."
59:10,360;59:14,640;"I'll start off with my worst."
59:14,640;59:17,680;"The announcers were having trouble telling the difference"
59:17,680;59:20,520;"between David Patton and Troy Brown, the entire game."
59:20,520;59:22,520;"- They were blaming on the dirty jerseys."
59:22,520;59:23,760;"- I don't know."
59:23,760;59:25,720;"I just don't know if I like that."
59:25,720;59:28,800;"Kind of bothered me."
59:28,800;59:30,880;"So that was my worst."
59:30,880;59:32,840;"And then my best wasn't actually from the game,"
59:32,840;59:35,680;"but I was hearing that Brian Cox was running at warmups"
59:35,680;59:37,920;"after breaking his leg earlier in the season."
59:37,920;59:39,560;"- Yes."
59:39,560;59:40,720;"- So that's pretty amazing."
59:40,720;59:42,800;"I don't know what he was taking, probably steroids,"
59:42,800;59:45,160;"but yeah."
59:45,160;59:49,240;"Remember it is an earlier episode,"
59:49,240;59:51,280;"we mentioned something to the fact of,"
59:51,280;59:52,880;"we didn't remember what happened to Cox"
59:52,880;59:54,560;"and he probably would not return."
59:54,560;59:59,120;"But here we are, six games left, I believe, five games"
59:59,120;01:00:02,440;"and they're talking about him coming back"
01:00:02,440;01:00:03,920;"and playing against the Jets."
01:00:03,920;01:00:04,760;"- I know."
01:00:04,760;01:00:10,760;"No, that was that was exciting to see actually that ties into mine, but Steve you go you go do yours first"
01:00:10,760;01:00:13,560;"Um"
01:00:13,560;01:00:19,480;"Best was the best was that Brady throw on that third touchdown. Yeah, that was awesome and"
01:00:19,480;01:00:22,200;"I have like a worst for the saints"
01:00:22,200;01:00:28,600;"Yeah, that's what was that pick that Aaron Brooks threw where like for somehow he didn't see loramol"
01:00:28,600;01:00:30,840;"I literally standing like three yards in front of him"
01:00:31,960;01:00:35,960;"And he just throws it right at me to deflect set up in the air if he wasn't gets it."
01:00:35,960;01:00:37,640;"Yeah, it wasn't great."
01:00:37,640;01:00:40,120;"Like I don't know why."
01:00:40,120;01:00:43,000;"How do you know he's literally standing right in front of me just"
01:00:43,000;01:00:44,840;"flexing at his face."
01:00:44,840;01:00:50,280;"It's like trying to like stop the ball with the face and just I ended up deflecting it up."
01:00:50,280;01:00:51,560;"We did that a couple times."
01:00:51,560;01:00:53,480;"He hit a he hit."
01:00:53,480;01:00:57,160;"Raibel right between the five and the zero of Jersey."
01:00:57,160;01:00:59,160;"That should have been a pick."
01:00:59,160;01:01:01,640;"And Vrable wasn't even like, he wasn't even coverage."
01:01:01,640;01:01:03,560;"He was coming around on like a stunt."
01:01:03,560;01:01:05,960;"Just got hit right in the chest."
01:01:05,960;01:01:08,360;"And then my Patriots, where it was,"
01:01:08,360;01:01:11,800;"Taiwan, just getting absolutely torched by Joe Horn on that long"
01:01:11,800;01:01:13,160;"beat ball when they were back up."
01:01:13,160;01:01:15,120;"He, our line is best game."
01:01:15,120;01:01:15,960;"You're right."
01:01:15,960;01:01:19,040;"Jordan just ran straight and just absolutely burned."
01:01:19,040;01:01:22,160;"And if like Brooks had not under thrown it terribly,"
01:01:22,160;01:01:25,520;"he probably got six out of it."
01:01:25,520;01:01:26,080;"Yeah."
01:01:26,080;01:01:27,920;"But he made the catch and"
01:01:28,520;01:01:30,520;"the call for PI anyway."
01:01:30,520;01:01:34,520;"Oh, I was on him while he caught the ball."
01:01:34,520;01:01:36,120;"So that was an incredible catch regardless."
01:01:36,120;01:01:40,400;"But yeah, yeah, but if I remember looks didn't blow,"
01:01:40,400;01:01:43,040;"he just puts more air into that ball than Joe Horn's gone."
01:01:43,040;01:01:44,200;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
01:01:44,200;01:01:45,680;"Steps on tie."
01:01:45,680;01:01:47,680;"That's true."
01:01:47,680;01:01:49,240;"All right."
01:01:49,240;01:01:56,720;"So my best was Brian Cox talking to the media after the game"
01:01:56,720;01:02:00,200;"of before the game."
01:02:00,200;01:02:04,880;"Talking about the quarterback controversy."
01:02:04,880;01:02:07,960;"And so the quote in the Globe was,"
01:02:07,960;01:02:09,360;"according to the injured linebacker,"
01:02:09,360;01:02:11,720;"there's no quarterback controversy in New England."
01:02:11,720;01:02:15,200;"Only a media corps looking for trouble in capital letters."
01:02:15,200;01:02:16,680;"There would never be a controversy"
01:02:16,680;01:02:20,600;"like this in any other town, according to Frank Cox."
01:02:20,600;01:02:23,480;"Oh no, this is fucking gorgeous writing this, of course."
01:02:23,480;01:02:25,760;"Oh no, quarterback controversies exist."
01:02:25,760;01:02:30,040;"only in Foxborough, never in places like New York or Chicago, which were among Cox's previous"
01:02:30,040;01:02:31,580;"playing addresses."
01:02:31,580;01:02:32,880;"Not like this, Cox said."
01:02:32,880;01:02:34,280;"This is real foolish."
01:02:34,280;01:02:35,840;"You guys are trying to undercut Bill."
01:02:35,840;01:02:38,160;"He's trying to make a decision that's best for the team."
01:02:38,160;01:02:39,640;"You guys don't know the situation."
01:02:39,640;01:02:41,720;"I don't think it would be this bad in New York."
01:02:41,720;01:02:45,120;"Some of the media up here are not capable of making the choice of who should be the quarterback."
01:02:45,120;01:02:46,120;"They don't know."
01:02:46,120;01:02:47,120;"They don't see the tape."
01:02:47,120;01:02:51,120;"So, if I can, Brian Cox coming out here and he's got Bill Balcek's back."
01:02:51,120;01:02:56,420;"Plus I'd say in a lot because he did come from those places. So if he thinks the media is even worse"
01:02:56,420;01:03:01,240;"That's a little"
01:03:01,240;01:03:03,080;"Better than the boss me is saying something"
01:03:03,080;01:03:10,880;"And Troy Brown also I this isn't this kind of tight and he kind of handled it similarly where"
01:03:10,880;01:03:18,800;"In the article it's similar article to say Troy Brown the Patriots senior and top receiver rolled his eyes when he looked up from his locker"
01:03:18,800;01:03:20,800;"And saw a media posse swarming him"
01:03:20,800;01:03:23,800;"wanting to talk a wide bell of check shows."
01:03:23,800;01:03:27,320;"- They were kind of all on the same page it seemed like."
01:03:27,320;01:03:30,000;"The only people that were up in arms about it were media,"
01:03:30,000;01:03:32,640;"which is still playing out to this day"
01:03:32,640;01:03:34,640;"with the blood so decision making stuff,"
01:03:34,640;01:03:36,960;"which again, probably sorted out by the time you listen"
01:03:36,960;01:03:39,400;"to this, but don't spoil it for the rest of us."
01:03:39,400;01:03:45,800;"Let's see, my worst was Ricky Williams after the game,"
01:03:47,840;01:03:54,580;"talking about how he thought he had a good game and how the he didn't think the"
01:03:54,580;01:04:04,240;"the pages even stopped him so he only ran for Ricky was like leading in yards I"
01:04:04,240;01:04:10,400;"think I think he was third in the NFL yeah first in the NFC right right yeah"
01:04:10,400;01:04:13,520;"in rushing yards and he was like up there in totally yard as well he was like"
01:04:13,520;01:04:15,520;"second in total yard, some scrimmage."
01:04:15,520;01:04:20,640;"So they're talking about asking him about, you know, he,"
01:04:20,640;01:04:26,440;"the Patriots held him to 50, 60 yards and a touchdown on 15"
01:04:26,440;01:04:29,560;"carries. So like, not great, especially for the leagues,"
01:04:29,560;01:04:34,040;"where the NFC is leading rusher, right? So this is the quote from"
01:04:34,040;01:04:36,600;"the article. So naturally, Williams was asked if this was the"
01:04:36,600;01:04:39,400;"toughest defense he'd encountered all season. He looked so"
01:04:39,400;01:04:42,240;"incredulous that his Saints cap almost spun around frontwards"
01:04:42,240;01:04:44,640;"and the tidy gold stud nearly fell out of his nose."
01:04:44,640;01:04:47,440;"""Are you being serious?"" he said, his eyes wider,"
01:04:47,440;01:04:50,280;"and any of the holes he tried in vain to find."
01:04:50,280;01:04:51,840;"They're not even close."
01:04:51,840;01:04:57,120;"And it goes on and on about how"
01:04:57,120;01:05:00,760;"he doesn't think that the Patriots did anything special."
01:05:00,760;01:05:04,800;"And he basically, his, his whole argument was that"
01:05:04,800;01:05:08,280;"because the Patriots so far ahead, he just didn't get enough"
01:05:08,280;01:05:11,160;"carries to do anything, which I mean, he only got 15 carries, but still,"
01:05:11,160;01:05:18,060;"He didn't do much, but he was also talking shit about Willie McGinnis, who was like one"
01:05:18,060;01:05:22,440;"of the main reasons that he wasn't running."
01:05:22,440;01:05:27,320;"So it was for instance, there was the way he and fullback Terrell Smith positively manhandled"
01:05:27,320;01:05:31,800;"linebacker Willie McGinnis, who really anchored the bottleneck for three quarters before leaving"
01:05:31,800;01:05:32,800;"with a leg injury."
01:05:32,800;01:05:36,280;"""Meginnis is 270 pounds,"" said Williams."
01:05:36,280;01:05:39,480;"""Terrell and me are a lot smaller, but we stood up to the challenge."
01:05:39,480;01:05:41,480;"We smash his mouth."
01:05:41,480;01:05:42,480;"Ooh."
01:05:42,480;01:05:47,800;"For a whole 50, what was it, 50, 70 yards?"
01:05:47,800;01:05:48,800;"50, 60 yards."
01:05:48,800;01:05:50,000;"But they were tough yards, man."
01:05:50,000;01:05:52,000;"He was coming hard at him."
01:05:52,000;01:05:53,000;"He was."
01:05:53,000;01:05:55,600;"Yeah, the defense was coming hard at him."
01:05:55,600;01:06:00,440;"So I enjoy, I forgot how entertaining he was."
01:06:00,440;01:06:02,800;"But I think not a great look after getting."
01:06:02,800;01:06:06,080;"Well, again, he was smoking a lot of pot of this time in his life, so you got to give"
01:06:06,080;01:06:07,080;"him a little leeway here."
01:06:07,080;01:06:12,340;"So yeah, but you think you'd be a little bit more laid back about it, you know, yeah, maybe he's seen things"
01:06:12,340;01:06:17,120;"That way we don't know what you smoke weed. See about what kind of weed are you smoking?"
01:06:17,120;01:06:21,380;"I mean not as good weed as Ricky Williams can afford. I guess not Jesus"
01:06:21,380;01:06:26,420;"Talk to Greg about that. He's the he literally quit the NFL to go around the world smoking weed"
01:06:26,420;01:06:32,840;"Yeah, he's living in the mountains with some gurus or something. Hey, you're fucking affordable. It couldn't me got to respect that"
01:06:32,840;01:06:35,640;"Yeah, until until that ran out if you remember you had to come back"
01:06:35,640;01:06:37,360;"- That's right, yeah."
01:06:37,360;01:06:39,840;"- Vicki made immense to Willie after he got"
01:06:39,840;01:06:41,280;"like super high with Buddha and stuff,"
01:06:41,280;01:06:42,120;"and he's like, ""Came back."""
01:06:42,120;01:06:43,880;"I was like, ""William's hard, dude."""
01:06:43,880;01:06:44,720;"- Oh, definitely."
01:06:44,720;01:06:46,440;"- I didn't mean that."
01:06:46,440;01:06:47,280;"- I think so."
01:06:47,280;01:06:48,920;"- It seemed like the forgiving type,"
01:06:48,920;01:06:50,320;"so I'm sure it was good."
01:06:50,320;01:06:53,840;"- All right, a lot about wraps up for this one."
01:06:53,840;01:06:57,720;"Next week, we have to look forward to the pages traveling to,"
01:06:57,720;01:07:00,760;"what is officially called Giant Stadium,"
01:07:00,760;01:07:03,200;"to visit the New York Jets."
01:07:03,200;01:07:04,040;"- Big bucks."
01:07:04,040;01:07:05,800;"I don't even have their own home."
01:07:05,800;01:07:08,600;"But New York Jets that started this whole thing really."
01:07:08,600;01:07:10,160;"So would this be a revenge game?"
01:07:10,160;01:07:13,240;"Well, we will find out next week."
01:07:13,240;01:07:14,440;"- We'll find out."
01:07:14,440;01:07:18,640;"I just wanna say, you know, I apologize"
01:07:18,640;01:07:21,000;"for being out of hand earlier guys."
01:07:21,000;01:07:27,160;"My notes got a little jostled and I was incorrect again."
01:07:27,160;01:07:32,160;"And I just wanna apologize for taking it out on you guys."
01:07:32,360;01:07:34,960;"And I'm sorry."
01:07:34,960;01:07:36,600;"- You know what, apology accepted."
01:07:36,600;01:07:38,320;"We still love you, Mike."
01:07:38,320;01:07:40,680;"- Don't throw me in there with that, Andy."
01:07:40,680;01:07:41,520;"- That's fair."
01:07:41,520;01:07:44,520;"- I'll talk about we as in me and the listeners."
01:07:44,520;01:07:45,640;"- Oh, okay."
01:07:45,640;01:07:46,480;"- For himself."
01:07:46,480;01:07:48,360;"- I can't, I'm throwing them in there with you."
01:07:48,360;01:07:50,440;"- It was uncalled for, apologize."
01:07:50,440;01:07:56,480;"- Hey, we're a positive, positivity podcast here."
01:07:56,480;01:07:58,320;"- I'm working on it."
01:07:58,320;01:07:59,840;"- We're not showing anybody."
01:07:59,840;01:08:01,200;"Except for Greg, 'cause he's not here."
01:08:01,200;01:08:02,040;"Fuck Greg."
01:08:02,040;01:08:04,040;"Yeah, Greg"
01:08:04,040;01:08:09,140;"Take him or leave him maybe he'll be here next week and we can say it to his face until then"
01:08:09,140;01:08:11,840;"fuck Greg Brown"
01:08:11,840;01:08:17,320;"Like Greg Brown no fuck Greg Brown from you Steve. I don't know. I love Greg Brown. Fuck Mike. Wow"
01:08:17,320;01:08:21,680;"Holy crap, I take my apology back"
01:08:21,680;01:08:25,680;"I'm going on that now, Jesus Christ."

00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,920;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,920;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:20,240;"I am not your mother."
00:20,240;00:30,040;"This is episode four, I suppose, of the Patriots Dynasty podcast."
00:30,040;00:35,400;"Today we're doing the 2001 season, week four, against the Miami Dolphins."
00:35,400;00:38,320;"We have a pared-down crew today."
00:38,320;00:41,480;"It's myself and Mr. Mellow."
00:41,480;00:45,520;"The brothers are off gallivanting somewhere."
00:45,520;00:47,520;"I was thinking gallivanting."
00:47,520;00:48,520;"Yeah."
00:48,520;00:49,680;"I mean, it's Greg's birthday."
00:49,680;00:52,120;"So him, I'll give a pass."
00:52,120;00:56,240;"Steve is probably on a plane somewhere for work."
00:56,240;00:58,840;"Not that he really works because he golfs."
00:58,840;01:03,880;"So yeah, that's just, just to you and me, Mike."
01:03,880;01:05,480;"- That's right."
01:05,480;01:08,760;"Greg didn't respond to my birthday wish."
01:08,760;01:11,160;"- I called him right before this."
01:11,160;01:14,600;"And he's hanging out with the residents,"
01:14,600;01:15,440;"with Danny and Maral."
01:15,440;01:16,520;"- Oh, nice."
01:16,520;01:17,680;"Love that guy."
01:17,680;01:22,780;"Yes, he's Danny flew down for a bro week, I think they called it."
01:22,780;01:23,860;"Oh, no."
01:23,860;01:24,640;"Yeah."
01:24,640;01:26,060;"Exactly."
01:26,060;01:30,580;"I thought it was a nice birthday wish."
01:30,580;01:31,340;"Did you enjoy it?"
01:31,340;01:34,020;"No, no, I didn't."
01:34,020;01:34,740;"Oh, okay."
01:34,740;01:37,540;"There's something to the effect of a happy birthday."
01:37,540;01:40,420;"Congratulations to your parents on, uh,"
01:40,420;01:41,940;"phoning fluids."
01:41,940;01:42,620;"I believe."
01:42,620;01:43,620;"I believe."
01:43,620;01:44,020;"I believe."
01:44,020;01:44,540;"Yes."
01:44,540;01:47,100;"I mean, it wasn't that disgusting."
01:47,380;01:49,780;"You have a way with words."
01:49,780;01:53,220;"It's the way my brain functions."
01:53,220;01:56,380;"It's a bad way, but it is away with words."
01:56,380;01:59,420;"But happy birthday to Mr. Gregory Brown."
01:59,420;02:00,580;"Yes."
02:00,580;02:02,660;"31 today."
02:02,660;02:04,140;"Wow."
02:04,140;02:04,620;"Yeah."
02:04,620;02:09,620;"And also happy birthday to our niece Audrey, who is also well, she's one."
02:09,620;02:12,020;"So she's got some catch enough to do."
02:12,020;02:13,540;"But they should birthday Audrey."
02:14,460;02:21,980;"But yeah, I think I'm still number one favorite uncle so far out of our nieces."
02:21,980;02:23,180;"Thanks."
02:23,180;02:26,580;"Which annoys the other two brands, so hopefully they don't listen to this episode."
02:26,580;02:27,780;"They won't."
02:27,780;02:29,300;"No, they definitely won't."
02:29,300;02:32,260;"Luckily, nobody else."
02:32,260;02:33,340;"We can say whatever the hell we want."
02:33,340;02:34,740;"Boom."
02:34,740;02:37,220;"Until they do."
02:37,220;02:37,900;"And then."
02:37,900;02:40,780;"Yeah, and then we'll get canceled."
02:40,780;02:42,020;"That's right."
02:42,020;02:43,220;"Yeah."
02:43,220;02:43,740;"I don't mind."
02:43,780;02:45,700;"I don't want to do this shit anyway, I'm tired."
02:45,700;02:47,900;"- Yeah, it's a lot of work, so being canceled"
02:47,900;02:49,780;"might actually be a blessing in this guy's."
02:49,780;02:51,020;"- That's right."
02:51,020;02:53,100;"- All right, so week four,"
02:53,100;02:54,760;"Patriots at the Dolphins."
02:54,760;02:59,780;"Let's touch on this Dolphins team."
02:59,780;03:02,180;"What did you think of them, first of all?"
03:02,180;03:03,500;"- The Dolphins team,"
03:03,500;03:07,020;"I mean, I guess it was a bit refreshing, dare I say,"
03:07,020;03:09,020;"on a Patriots podcast."
03:09,020;03:13,460;"Because the AFCs has been so bad for so long,"
03:13,460;03:18,460;"that I couldn't remember a team being even above mediocre."
03:18,460;03:20,780;"- I'll fight against it later, but okay."
03:20,780;03:21,620;"- All right, fine."
03:21,620;03:23,380;"And if you bring up the Bills,"
03:23,380;03:26,060;"I can't co-sign on that."
03:26,060;03:28,660;"But yeah, I don't know."
03:28,660;03:31,100;"I think they looked, I mean, they have,"
03:31,100;03:34,340;"they've always needed a quarterback."
03:34,340;03:36,060;"I mean, I guess that's their biggest problem at this point,"
03:36,060;03:38,660;"but their defense is solid, their run game is all right."
03:40,980;03:43,580;"What's the quarterback, Jay Fiedler?"
03:43,580;03:48,580;"- Yes, so this is, Jay Fiedler was the,"
03:48,580;03:53,100;"I feel like heir apparent to Dan Marino is too strong,"
03:53,100;03:56,820;"but he was their first shot at replacing Dan Marino."
03:56,820;03:57,660;"- Mm."
03:57,660;03:59,100;"- I'm retired a couple of years earlier,"
03:59,100;04:01,340;"I wanna say '98 or '99."
04:01,340;04:06,140;"So Fiedler was the next in line to take over."
04:06,140;04:10,480;"I don't think anybody was expecting a Marino-esque"
04:10,480;04:17,200;"sort of replacement. Right. Because I don't think there is or maybe even ever will be."
04:17,200;04:22,360;"Just the numbers he was putting up are what good quarterbacks put up now. And he was doing"
04:22,360;04:27,160;"an age where it wasn't quarterback friendly. Like he's thrown for 5,000 yards back when"
04:27,160;04:35,360;"the average was like half that. Yeah. Yeah. No. But this was still a good team. They were"
04:35,360;04:42,100;"are still running the AFC East at this point. They had, I think won the division the year"
04:42,100;04:49,060;"before in 2000. And this year they finished second in the AFC East at 11 and five, like"
04:49,060;04:56,180;"so they were still spoiler alert right there. We ain't spoiling nothing. This is history,"
04:56,180;05:02,380;"but there's no spoilers in history. Nobody's googling this stuff. Do you listen to World"
05:02,380;05:06,820;"war two podcast, bro. No, I don't. And you should. It's awesome."
05:06,820;05:08,980;"Could you imagine that it sounds depressing?"
05:08,980;05:14,780;"Depends on who's talking about it. Okay. But is it only about"
05:14,780;05:19,980;"World War two? No, actually, hardcore history. We're gonna"
05:19,980;05:24,140;"plug this right now, because that's how we do by Dan Carlin. He"
05:24,140;05:27,780;"talks about a bunch of different historical things. The my"
05:27,780;05:33,640;"favorite is he goes through the entire World War one from start to finish."
05:33,640;05:37,540;"And I think there's like four or five episodes."
05:37,540;05:43,460;"Each one is between three and four hours long."
05:43,460;05:46,580;"Oh, my lord of him monologuing."
05:46,580;05:49,740;"And it's fascinating."
05:49,740;05:51,780;"That sounds pretty cool."
05:51,780;05:53,260;"Yeah."
05:53,260;05:55,980;"I mean, it's no, I mean, it does."
05:56,020;05:58,460;"I mean, it changed their own, right?"
05:58,460;06:02,860;"It just seems like a dreary topic, obviously."
06:02,860;06:04,340;"- Yeah, but he's so excited about it"
06:04,340;06:07,220;"and he's a very good storyteller."
06:07,220;06:09,740;"And so he tells kind of the human side of things"
06:09,740;06:12,980;"and it's a very well done podcast."
06:12,980;06:15,980;"I never thought I'd be listening to a history podcast of--"
06:15,980;06:17,460;"- Yeah, I can see it."
06:17,460;06:19,340;"I've known you for a while, I can see it."
06:19,340;06:22,860;"- You almost knew very well."
06:22,860;06:25,060;"What else is-- - I don't know."
06:25,060;06:26,740;"the Patriots in this game."
06:26,740;06:28,220;"Yeah."
06:28,220;06:29,020;"See that segue."
06:29,020;06:30,020;"That's pretty good."
06:30,020;06:31,740;"That's a."
06:31,740;06:35,500;"That was a fantastic segue."
06:35,500;06:38,180;"That's what's let's let's finish up on the dolphins real quick, though."
06:38,180;06:38,740;"All right."
06:38,740;06:41,540;"So yeah, they finished second the AFC East."
06:41,540;06:45,940;"They made the playoffs this year along with both the past and the jets."
06:45,940;06:51,460;"Cause, um, you know, how's that week AFC East for you now, Mr."
06:51,460;06:51,820;"Mella."
06:51,820;06:53,860;"Hey, I said 20 years, man."
06:54,900;06:57,140;"I mean, 20 years ago is formidable."
06:57,140;06:58,860;"Yeah."
06:58,860;07:01,260;"And they've always had a challenger."
07:01,260;07:04,060;"The Page's have always had at least one challenger in the AFC East."
07:04,060;07:09,860;"But we'll get to that a different episode because we can do an entire"
07:09,860;07:11,780;"episode on that with or without you."
07:11,780;07:13,020;"Oh, wow."
07:13,020;07:15,460;"Well, I will take that one off then."
07:15,460;07:15,980;"Thank you."
07:15,980;07:16,860;"Right."
07:16,860;07:21,460;"So yeah, so they lost to the Ravens in the wildcard."
07:24,540;07:27,940;"But I think it's probably a successful season."
07:27,940;07:33,020;"Their head coach was Dave Wonstadt, the man, the myth,"
07:33,020;07:34,060;"the mustache."
07:34,060;07:35,220;"The mustache, yes."
07:35,220;07:36,700;"Yeah, that was--"
07:36,700;07:40,380;"Yeah, he does look like a janitor from a porn studio,"
07:40,380;07:42,900;"I think."
07:42,900;07:46,100;"Janitor is very specific."
07:46,100;07:46,860;"I would say."
07:46,860;07:47,780;"I think it's a good janitors."
07:47,780;07:48,300;"I feel like the--"
07:48,300;07:48,860;"Yeah, I don't know."
07:48,860;07:51,180;"I don't even know what a janitor specifically would"
07:51,180;07:52,940;"look like at a porn studio."
07:52,940;07:56,740;"What I would say is he probably looks like the stand in if they do have"
07:56,740;07:58,940;"stand ins for some foreign studio."
07:58,940;07:59,420;"Maybe."
07:59,420;08:00,500;"Yeah, I can see that too."
08:00,500;08:02,140;"I don't know what that means though."
08:02,140;08:04,300;"It looks like do's big a little maybe."
08:04,300;08:08,060;"And I don't really know what well enough porn is."
08:08,060;08:17,620;"But yeah, so one stat was a decent coach."
08:17,620;08:22,540;"He spent six years with the bears before coming to Miami and kind of was"
08:22,540;08:26,540;"like mediocre, you know, kind of like a nine and seven sort of coach."
08:26,540;08:33,340;"Uh, but when he took over the dolphins in 2011, they were both, or excuse me,"
08:33,340;08:38,320;"2000, 2001, uh, there were 11 and five, both years kind of taken over from,"
08:38,320;08:43,160;"I don't think it was, it wasn't Don Shula, then Jimmy Johnson, then"
08:43,160;08:44,420;"wants that."
08:44,420;08:45,820;"I wasn't this directly."
08:45,820;08:47,380;"Sounds about right."
08:47,380;08:48,320;"Yeah."
08:48,320;08:48,860;"Either way."
08:49,180;08:55,260;"He took over that well-built team, took him to 11 or 5 records and made the playoffs both"
08:55,260;08:58,540;"years, and then kind of like trailed off a little bit."
08:58,540;09:03,980;"They went 9 and 7, 10 and 6, and then he didn't make it through the 2004 season because they"
09:03,980;09:10,380;"were 1 and 8 at the time, and he was relieved of his duties."
09:10,380;09:13,920;"Um, yeah, it's, it's the dolphins."
09:13,920;09:20,080;"Um, and when one step was a coach of them, they played the Pats tough."
09:20,080;09:28,300;"Uh, the dolphins were four and five against the Pats, but they did lose their last four games."
09:28,300;09:36,500;"So they're actually four and one at one point against the Patriots, like early when he had those teams that were built by his predecessor."
09:37,940;09:41,940;"And then the Patriots became the dynasty"
09:41,940;09:46,220;"that everybody knows them as now and it didn't get it."
09:46,220;09:47,520;"- I never thought about this before,"
09:47,520;09:51,580;"but do you think, right, obviously Patriots are our team"
09:51,580;09:52,860;"and we root for them."
09:52,860;09:54,980;"But if you think about it, an evil empire side"
09:54,980;09:58,340;"and all that stuff, how many jobs have the Patriots"
09:58,340;10:03,960;"basically gotten rid of over the years"
10:03,960;10:05,620;"because of their dominance?"
10:05,620;10:08,580;"Like you just said that once they probably do"
10:08,580;10:11,940;"to the Patriots losses job and I bet a thousand other people"
10:11,940;10:13,180;"have done so as well."
10:13,180;10:15,180;"So how do you feel about that?"
10:15,180;10:16,900;"- I'm fine with it."
10:16,900;10:18,980;"But yeah, I wonder what that number would be"
10:18,980;10:21,700;"'cause I think you have to count head coaches"
10:21,700;10:23,500;"'cause they're not a last."
10:23,500;10:26,420;"Starting quarterbacks, I think you could add in there."
10:26,420;10:27,260;"- Oh, definitely."
10:27,260;10:31,420;"- I'm sure as general managers, yep."
10:31,420;10:34,220;"And I think like the rest of the players"
10:34,220;10:36,780;"and personnel and stuff, maybe less so,"
10:36,780;10:38,180;"because that's so fluid."
10:38,180;10:40,660;"- Yeah, they get rotated, right?"
10:40,660;10:42,220;"- Yeah, but I think if you can't it up"
10:42,220;10:47,220;"all the different GMs, coaches, and starting quarterbacks,"
10:47,220;10:50,620;"I bet you could put together quite a list."
10:50,620;10:52,620;"- That's interesting."
10:52,620;10:54,460;"- Maybe we can only think about that."
10:54,460;10:56,100;"- Yeah, we'll do some fact checking,"
10:56,100;10:58,860;"and we'll bring it back for next week."
10:58,860;11:00,460;"Figure out how to do one of the fact checking."
11:00,460;11:04,180;"- I'm assuming it's me because it's not gonna be,"
11:04,180;11:07,180;"the brothers or yeah."
11:07,180;11:12,180;"Okay, cool. Yeah, definitely get that info and get back to me on that because I'm interested."
11:12,180;11:15,180;"We'll do."
11:15,180;11:17,180;"Yes, shit."
11:17,180;11:18,180;"Yes."
11:18,180;11:31,180;"All right, so I had, usually I have a section on our show notes page outlining the star players for these teams, but I cross out star players and just put guys I've heard of."
11:31,180;11:40,940;"Because there wasn't a lot of big names on this dolphins team for them finishing 11 and five there were guys I kind of you know"
11:40,940;11:45,840;"Recognized but they're not ones you're gonna see in the annals of the history books at the NFL"
11:45,840;11:48,940;"I don't think I beg to differ. I thought their defense was stacked"
11:48,940;11:55,840;"I I thought there was two names on the defense and then outside of that it was like"
11:55,840;11:58,500;"Okay, all right"
11:59,500;12:03,780;"- Big names and then like a couple like solid ones."
12:03,780;12:06,060;"- All right, give me some names."
12:06,060;12:11,060;"- Clearly, Jason Taylor and Zach Thomas are freaking amazing."
12:11,060;12:16,420;"And I remember that Jason Taylor was like, you know,"
12:16,420;12:19,220;"I think Brady recently said that Ed Reed was his crypto night."
12:19,220;12:23,220;"Well, Jason Taylor was up there causing problems."
12:23,220;12:25,700;"- Yeah, I think for the first half of Brady's career,"
12:25,700;12:28,260;"it was Jason Taylor in the second half it was Ed Reed."
12:28,260;12:29,260;"Yeah, it's fair."
12:29,260;12:30,260;"Yeah."
12:30,260;12:32,740;"So, and there was always, there was always rumors about both those guys that they would"
12:32,740;12:33,740;"be on the Patriots."
12:33,740;12:36,740;"So it was kind of sad that I never saw that happen because Jason Taylor and like a Patriots"
12:36,740;12:38,660;"uniform, that'd be sick."
12:38,660;12:39,660;"Yeah."
12:39,660;12:40,660;"Yeah."
12:40,660;12:47,060;"It was him and who was the defensive end for the Panthers for all those years?"
12:47,060;12:48,060;"Peppers."
12:48,060;12:49,060;"Oh, peppers."
12:49,060;12:50,060;"Yeah."
12:50,060;12:51,060;"He's so funny, right?"
12:51,060;12:52,060;"Always rumors."
12:52,060;12:53,220;"Is he still?"
12:53,220;12:54,900;"I think he's still playing."
12:54,900;12:55,900;"Maybe he's not."
12:55,900;12:56,900;"I think he is."
12:56,900;13:05,060;"this. I think he is. I'm going to fill in the space while you're googling this. I vaguely"
13:05,060;13:12,420;"remember it was a couple of weeks ago, it was raining, you know, Frank Sinatra was on the radio"
13:12,420;13:18,580;"and I was flipping through the channels when I saw his sparkly eyes on TV and I thought"
13:18,580;13:24,100;"fermented as that Julius Pepper is and it wasn't. Then I kept on changing the channels,"
13:24,100;13:28,660;"switching through and eventually I throw the TV off because"
13:28,660;13:31,260;"I love the way I'm on time."
13:31,260;13:34,460;"So you were not far off."
13:34,460;13:38,940;"He the last career history list he has he played."
13:38,940;13:41,180;"So started with the Panthers."
13:41,180;13:47,740;"Oh, two, no nine went to the Bears 2010 to 2013 Packers, 2014, 2016."
13:47,740;13:53,020;"Back to the Panthers, 2017 through 2018 retired last year."
13:53,260;13:56,200;"Oh, okay. Man, it's a hell of a career."
13:56,200;13:58,260;"Right for a defensive end."
13:58,260;13:59,740;"Yeah."
13:59,740;14:01,060;"He was a beast."
14:01,060;14:02,260;"Pretty monstrous."
14:02,260;14:07,860;"Yeah. So Jason Taylor, Zach Thomas, I believe those Patrick"
14:07,860;14:09,860;"Sir Tan, which is pretty OK."
14:09,860;14:13,580;"Yeah, I had him in Sam Madison."
14:13,580;14:14,660;"Yeah."
14:14,660;14:16,220;"You saw two quarterbacks."
14:16,220;14:20,180;"I mean, like I said, they're their names."
14:20,180;14:21,380;"I recognize guys."
14:21,380;14:26,140;"I know but they're not like I mean I feel like Zach Thomas was like a Bruce key type"
14:26,140;14:32,320;"You know he wasn't flashy, but he was he was in every play. Yeah, he was a he but he was a name brand"
14:32,320;14:33,740;"You know, right?"
14:33,740;14:35,740;"He was he was one of his that"
14:35,740;14:39,340;"Lunch pale"
14:39,340;14:46,100;"White no next man or lack her or exactly exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's early I got Bruce key and"
14:46,660;14:50,100;"Thomas were the guys, you know"
14:50,100;14:57,020;"But nothing good yeah, the only other name I recognize least on the defense was Brock Marion"
14:57,020;15:01,940;"I don't know why I recognize him probably just because his name is Brock Marion"
15:01,940;15:07,260;"And it's one I don't really recognize that guy too much. I don't remember him being good"
15:07,260;15:11,660;"I was maybe I had his football card right up or something, but Brock Marion was the name that stuck with me"
15:11,660;15:13,660;"I did remember only name"
15:13,660;15:15,860;"Mar a"
15:15,860;15:16,700;"- Yes."
15:16,700;15:20,420;"- Who apparently was an absolute weapon."
15:20,420;15:21,260;"- Right."
15:21,260;15:22,660;"- Which I didn't realize, you know,"
15:22,660;15:25,620;"I mean, you don't think of kickers much, but."
15:25,620;15:27,220;"- I think about them all the time."
15:27,220;15:29,380;"- I bet you, what you do this year."
15:29,380;15:30,220;"- Well."
15:30,220;15:31,660;"- There aren't any kickers who can kick a field."
15:31,660;15:36,060;"- Yeah, which funny how we all complained about"
15:36,060;15:37,780;"our kicking situation until we've--"
15:37,780;15:39,500;"- Speak for yourself."
15:39,500;15:41,300;"- Hey, I complained about everything."
15:41,300;15:42,140;"- Well, that's true."
15:42,140;15:44,140;"I didn't complain about it at all."
15:44,140;15:45,700;"- All right."
15:45,700;15:49,420;"I still complain about trading Jimmy G even though the Patriots don't want to"
15:49,420;15:51,100;"Super Bowls a bit than the rest of them."
15:51,100;15:52,620;"That's besides the point, dude."
15:52,620;15:53,020;"Okay."
15:53,020;15:56,300;"Pay the guy whatever he wants to keep him in the bench until like radio"
15:56,300;15:57,260;"retires when he's 50."
15:57,260;15:57,820;"I don't care."
15:57,820;15:58,860;"Make it happen, Bella."
15:58,860;15:59,260;"Check."
15:59,260;16:01,660;"Stick on the Patriots doing whatever they want all the time."
16:01,660;16:02,740;"What about me?"
16:02,740;16:04,540;"Counterpoint."
16:04,540;16:09,940;"When has Gus Tkowski ever lost a game by missing a field goal?"
16:09,940;16:13,860;"I can think of the Broncos."
16:14,140;16:16,640;"It wasn't to miss the game, but he definitely affected it."
16:16,640;16:19,180;"Where then they needed to go for two points at the end."
16:19,180;16:20,740;"Gronk couldn't make it happen."
16:20,740;16:23,360;"And it was potentially some defense, a pass in the variance."
16:23,360;16:25,000;"And that's the way it went."
16:25,000;16:25,920;"Correct."
16:25,920;16:26,720;"Name another."
16:26,720;16:29,560;"Another time."
16:29,560;16:33,560;"Well, I was thinking about this about five weeks ago."
16:33,560;16:36,420;"It was raining and I had Frank Sinatra on the radio."
16:36,420;16:36,960;"Funny enough."
16:36,960;16:40,120;"I, you know what?"
16:40,120;16:42,000;"Like he's missed pretty."
16:42,460;16:45,940;"I want to say frequently by his standards in the recent years, but I guess that's a good"
16:45,940;16:48,340;"point. I don't really remember any big ones."
16:48,340;16:52,080;"There's, there's one other that I can think of and it was way back in the day when they"
16:52,080;16:54,140;"were playing the Cardinals early in the season."
16:54,140;16:55,140;"Mm hmm."
16:55,140;17:00,300;"And it was just one of those games where shit was just going wild where the Cardinals had"
17:00,300;17:06,940;"the ball like late and they were up by a couple of points and they were trying to run the"
17:06,940;17:10,220;"clock out and I think Vince Wilfork forced the fumble."
17:10,220;17:15,180;"recovered it, but then they couldn't drive anywhere. So they tried to kick a game winning"
17:15,180;17:19,820;"field goal at the end and they missed. That's kind of a missed game. They lost that game."
17:19,820;17:25,660;"Well, I'll counter and ask you, do you remember when you won the game? Oh, yeah."
17:25,660;17:32,620;"What? This most recent Super Bowl against the Rams. He won that one."
17:32,620;17:38,060;"Okay, that's fair. And I would say the Giants game where he kicked the 50s"
17:38,060;17:41,440;"some odd yard feel goal as time expired. He won that one."
17:41,440;17:44,300;"I remember that one. That was regular season you're talking about."
17:44,300;17:49,140;"Yeah, he did it again against the Jets and overtime. I think a couple"
17:49,140;17:52,540;"of times actually to beat the Jets and overtime in the regular season."
17:52,540;17:57,460;"So like under 10 times that you remember, big whoop."
17:57,460;18:05,380;"No, to be to be serious for a second. You're right. He was pretty"
18:05,380;18:11,920;"good. Uh, Vinitari was awesome. So now to go from those two guys to Nick Folk and all"
18:11,920;18:16,120;"that stuff is pretty disappointing. So I got like Olinda Maray. I don't even know how to"
18:16,120;18:22,140;"say his freaking name. Oh, Linda. Oh, Linda Maray. Yeah. All right. Well, he is great."
18:22,140;18:29,740;"I think, I think that's on par with, um, dolphins wide receiver, Arande Gadson. Oh, yeah. Man,"
18:29,740;18:34,180;"that guy was like, he just looked like a beast. I don't think he was a beast, but he was like,"
18:34,180;18:35,940;"He just looked vicious."
18:35,940;18:36,780;"- He did, yeah."
18:36,780;18:42,860;"But like, so I mean, this dolphin's offense"
18:42,860;18:44,160;"to segue to that."
18:44,160;18:47,820;"- Wasn't a great segue, but I'll give it to you."
18:47,820;18:49,020;"- Yeah, all right, thanks."
18:49,020;18:50,540;"- Yeah, that was all right."
18:50,540;18:51,460;"- We'll workshop it."
18:51,460;18:57,500;"Was basically Lamar Smith at running back,"
18:57,500;19:00,380;"who the year before had over 1,000 rushing yards,"
19:00,380;19:03,700;"this year had almost that, they had nine 68."
19:03,700;19:11,500;"Um, it was basically kind of that typical run first heavy set offense with some play"
19:11,500;19:15,900;"action and some guys who were, I guess burners down the field."
19:15,900;19:19,020;"So you had to look for the long play action almost."
19:19,020;19:24,540;"It felt similar to like the later Baltimore Ravens with Joe Flacco."
19:24,540;19:28,340;"They're more like a run first team, but then they were going to try and chuck it down the"
19:28,340;19:31,700;"sideline playoff Joe Flacco or regular season Joe Flacco."
19:31,700;19:33,260;"Well, this was definitely regular season."
19:33,260;19:35,500;"Yeah, I know what you're going to do."
19:35,500;19:37,940;"Whether to try to chuck it deep and get the pass in for his call."
19:37,940;19:42,500;"But yeah, so I mean, like we talked about for J."
19:42,500;19:47,500;"Fielder, the quarterback had a decent year, I guess, for quarterbacks."
19:47,500;19:50,620;"And running quarterback too, which is kind of weird."
19:50,620;19:51,700;"Yeah, like that."
19:51,700;19:55,660;"You wouldn't think it, but it came up a lot in the analysis as well,"
19:55,660;20:01,100;"talking about how they were deploying the, uh, what they call the, the dog flutey defense."
20:01,460;20:07,860;"Yeah, which I thought was an interesting choice of rushing quarterback, but I guess this is pre"
20:07,860;20:15,460;"Michael Vick. So it makes sense. Mm hmm. Well, and flu is probably on a different level. I would say"
20:15,460;20:21,620;"than Michael Vick. So I'm sure Michael Vick created, uh, you know, issues for the defense of the point"
20:21,620;20:27,620;"where they had to create game plans just for him, but oh, yeah. Feed their probably not"
20:27,620;20:31,320;"out of that caliber, but he's all right for, you know, a little guy running around."
20:31,320;20:32,120;"Yeah."
20:32,120;20:37,380;"Um, he definitely got his ass lit up a bunch of times though."
20:37,380;20:40,420;"The man has no feeling for somebody coming up behind him."
20:40,420;20:47,180;"Like I feel like he's the first guy to die in a screen movie because he just"
20:47,180;20:49,820;"had no spatial awareness."
20:49,820;20:50,620;"So he would take off."
20:50,620;20:54,000;"I got caught from behind multiple times by."
20:54,000;20:55,220;"I counted that."
20:55,220;20:56,760;"50 pound line."
20:57,220;20:58,780;"And I hate to feel passionate about this,"
20:58,780;21:00,660;"but I'm gonna go at you hard."
21:00,660;21:01,500;"- Amen."
21:01,500;21:03,140;"- Amen, a screen movie or something like that."
21:03,140;21:05,020;"You would think that the most unaware guy"
21:05,020;21:07,620;"who doesn't know what the hell is going on would get slashed,"
21:07,620;21:09,340;"but that would be too obvious."
21:09,340;21:10,820;"He's probably also the comedic relief"
21:10,820;21:12,940;"because he's just running around like a maniac."
21:12,940;21:17,220;"So I would say that you would probably,"
21:17,220;21:20,780;"you'd probably kill off some well-known person"
21:20,780;21:22,180;"just to kind of give the audience shock"
21:22,180;21:24,660;"and to scare them a little bit to the stakes or reason."
21:24,660;21:26,620;"Then you'd probably go after maybe like a couple"
21:26,620;21:30,220;"like decide characters but like one to fan favorite, you know, you're like, damn it,"
21:30,220;21:34,740;"you know, how that happened. Then it would be JF probably in some sort of like, you're"
21:34,740;21:41,140;"sexy or something where he's like warming up and then boom, down goes Jay. That is how"
21:41,140;21:42,140;"I feel about this."
21:42,140;21:50,020;"Where he's really left on a third log. Right. Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. He's like reciting poetry"
21:50,020;21:52,660;"and boom. He capacitated."
21:52,660;21:56,820;"Uh, I didn't mean to attack you"
21:56,820;21:58,060;"there, but that's how it felt."
21:58,060;22:00,100;"Moving there. All right. Fair enough."
22:00,100;22:01,900;"Hey, this one is."
22:01,900;22:04,360;"All right. So."
22:04,360;22:07,600;"With that being said, let's actually talk about this game."
22:07,600;22:09,340;"Let's do it."
22:09,340;22:11,180;"Our recording."
22:11,180;22:15,340;"I know you called this out to me because you thought it was a glitch as well."
22:15,340;22:19,260;"Like I did started halfway through"
22:19,780;22:21,380;"the second drive of the game."
22:21,380;22:27,940;"Um, and looking at the, um, the Boston globe,"
22:27,940;22:30,780;"think that I don't know if you saw it too, but on the, the front page,"
22:30,780;22:35,700;"I could talk about how it was because the, um,"
22:35,700;22:43,460;"the United States had launched a, uh, an attack on Afghanistan."
22:43,460;22:44,380;"Right."
22:44,380;22:46,140;"It was the first day of that, I believe."
22:46,140;22:46,740;"Yeah."
22:46,740;22:48,820;"As the airstrikes on Bin Laden."
22:49,140;22:52,380;"And so it was kind of like a special report talking about that."
22:52,380;22:59,340;"And so a lot of the, a lot of networks actually covered that, which kind of went into the,"
22:59,340;23:00,420;"the beginning of the game."
23:00,420;23:06,420;"So, which again, created more controversy because I read a few things where it was talking about,"
23:06,420;23:11,900;"I guess some networks decided to not show any games and just show the coverage and speak and"
23:11,900;23:18,380;"everything and then switched over and then some decided to cover the games and not address that."
23:18,460;23:24,700;"Yeah, or they would like push it off to assist the station, the speech and show the game on the regular station. Yeah, it was all big."
23:24,700;23:26,700;"Crefuffle. Yes."
23:26,700;23:31,860;"Over that, which you know, typical. Can you imagine if Twitter was around back then? If that had happened?"
23:31,860;23:42,580;"I mean, no, I, yeah, that, I mean, we were talking off air about the wonders of Twitter and the world as it is today and with information."
23:42,580;23:46,100;"Yeah, I mean, something like that. I cannot imagine."
23:47,620;23:56,020;"Which I also wonder what it would do for information because I mean, I'm sure everybody at that point as far as I can remember was just curious about what was going on."
23:56,020;24:00,340;"We were afraid what might happen over here, what was going on to people over there."
24:00,340;24:07,820;"And if you just had a barrage of voices coming at you and in the middle of all that, what would you take from it?"
24:07,820;24:11,420;"I mean, that might even be a scary time looking back if that was right."
24:11,420;24:11,820;"I don't know."
24:11,820;24:13,220;"Yeah, no, I agree."
24:13,220;24:14,620;"Just because of."
24:16,100;24:23,100;"I mean, I feel like nowadays news isn't so much who's the most correct."
24:23,100;24:25,000;"It's who gets the information out first."
24:25,000;24:29,860;"So I think there would probably be a lot more."
24:29,860;24:39,500;"I don't say fear mongering, but just kind of unnecessary fear coming up from all these."
24:41,460;24:46,580;"maybe unreliable stories coming out of like people trying to be the first but not getting"
24:46,580;24:52,420;"all the information or getting incorrect information out. Right. But then the devil's advocate would say"
24:52,420;24:58,340;"and it's also I think an interesting point where you would definitely have some sort of vehicle to"
24:58,340;25:02,900;"hear people outside of the US and how they were viewing things and maybe some of the people that"
25:02,900;25:06,900;"were going through things that we weren't seeing and we definitely didn't have that voice. I'm"
25:07,460;25:12,660;"you know, I'd travel to Europe and heard some things around that time and you know, you'd have"
25:12,660;25:18,580;"to sort of do that to to hear it. But I guess social media and internet the way it is now"
25:18,580;25:23,540;"probably would provide us with different voices and people trying to reach out to kind of explain"
25:23,540;25:28,900;"what they were going through, which is another interesting point. Yeah, that is true."
25:32,020;25:33,020;"But that did happen."
25:33,020;25:34,020;"And yes."
25:34,020;25:41,620;"So we, yeah, so the game started with the Patriots on the Dolphins like inside their"
25:41,620;25:49,740;"20, which turns out was because the Patriots actually kicked off and the first pass from"
25:49,740;25:54,100;"Jay Feadler was Mike Rebel's first career interception."
25:54,100;25:55,100;"That's right."
25:55,100;25:59,460;"It was a beautiful one just because of how ridiculous it was."
25:59,460;26:03,220;"I mean, the fact that Jay Fiedler was, as he announced,"
26:03,220;26:06,180;"was pointed out, throwing into triple coverage"
26:06,180;26:10,220;"before the variable dropback into coverage."
26:10,220;26:14,100;"- Right, so there's four guys on the one that he was"
26:14,100;26:15,460;"tossing into. - Yeah, which tells you"
26:15,460;26:18,420;"a bit about Jay Fiedler as a replacement"
26:18,420;26:19,540;"for Dan Marino."
26:19,540;26:23,340;"But, you know, he had something Dan Marino didn't,"
26:23,340;26:26,220;"which was the ability to run."
26:26,220;26:27,060;"- That's right."
26:27,060;26:28,420;"(laughs)"
26:28,420;26:33,240;"So yeah, so you turn it on in the first play you got to see of this game was a"
26:33,240;26:38,420;"Patriots rushing TD by Anton Smith, which was a great start."
26:38,420;26:41,940;"Not."
26:41,940;26:48,740;"I think that would have been really uplifting had you been watching it live."
26:48,740;26:52,900;"But knowing what the score was going in, knowing the page, we're going to lose this."
26:52,900;26:54,540;"See, I didn't even lose."
26:54,540;26:55,740;"I forgot."
26:55,740;26:57,180;"I didn't even check the score, man."
26:57,180;27:00,800;"I went in it cold. I experienced the game brand new."
27:00,800;27:03,300;"So we'll have different takeaways."
27:03,300;27:03,900;"Yeah."
27:03,900;27:06,880;"We'll have different takeaways of this then because I knew going in,"
27:06,880;27:08,300;"this is going to be 30 to 10."
27:08,300;27:12,620;"Now the Patriots one touchdown couple minutes into this game."
27:12,620;27:13,580;"Right."
27:13,580;27:19,000;"Well, and then like soon after, uh, feedler, so the dolphins were kind of"
27:19,000;27:22,160;"making their way towards Patriots territory and, uh,"
27:22,160;27:25,760;"Gadson actually like broke free."
27:25,760;27:30,720;"He was probably one of the most wide open wide receivers in an end zone. I've ever seen ever and"
27:30,720;27:33,480;"or tight ends and"
27:33,480;27:39,720;"What he missed them wide open? I don't know if I think it was like overthrown or whatever"
27:39,720;27:43,400;"I don't know how it happened, but I was like, oh man, maybe this is a win for the Patriots"
27:43,400;27:48,320;"I forget like we'll see how he goes and then a couple plays later. That was pretty much destroyed"
27:48,320;27:52,840;"So that was as far as I got with the hope on this one. I think that was in the first quarter"
27:53,200;27:55,600;"Yeah, I mean, I think it was still pretty close"
27:55,600;28:02,800;"Even like I have time was like 1710 or so. Yeah deep deep into the"
28:02,800;28:09,080;"Into the second quarter the Patriots were they were tied at 10. They were hanging in there the dolphins had that"
28:09,080;28:13,580;"Last drive right at the end where they scored touchdown to go into the half up"
28:13,580;28:16,520;"1710 like we said and"
28:16,520;28:20,000;"That's like all right. Well, you know, they're hanging in there and then the third quarter started and"
28:20,440;28:27,060;"Well, I fell off. We also have to address and this is something I I've I guess subconsciously thought about this"
28:27,060;28:32,760;"But I never really pieced it together as to why until this year when I was watching the Patriots"
28:32,760;28:38,860;"Early on and then after watching this game it was sort of solidified but like so it was 90 degrees"
28:38,860;28:42,000;"there's a hundred twenty on the field. Yeah, and I"
28:42,000;28:49,680;"Also didn't I guess I somehow missed this information before but the dolphins were white at home"
28:49,680;28:56,060;"to sun issues and so they want their opponents to kind of wear the dark colors and stuff"
28:56,060;28:57,060;"sun in."
28:57,060;28:58,060;"Exactly."
28:58,060;29:04,840;"And the way the stadium faces now apparently the dolphins are the sideline is in the shade"
29:04,840;29:08,600;"whereas their opponents is in full sun the entire game."
29:08,600;29:13,120;"Which is interesting because I mean the Patriots always have trouble at mile high and they obviously"
29:13,120;29:16,000;"have their own unique circumstances for that stadium."
29:16,000;29:18,120;"So, so that was interesting."
29:18,120;29:23,880;"So it makes a lot more sense why the Patriots have some issues over there."
29:23,880;29:26,680;"But yeah, I think that definitely played a little bit into it."
29:26,680;29:31,200;"And I think the dolphins, Jay Fiedler, especially after the game was commenting that the defense"
29:31,200;29:33,120;"looked slow."
29:33,120;29:36,800;"And I was saying it was kind of like the most lackluster performance I've seen from the"
29:36,800;29:38,360;"Patriots defense that I can remember."
29:38,360;29:40,880;"Like it looked like their spirit was broken by the third quarter."
29:40,880;29:43,560;"Yeah, they were just getting the ball run down the throat."
29:43,560;29:48,360;"I think there's actually a quote from Belichick in the paper the next day."
29:48,360;29:52,960;"Um, one of the reporters after the game said to him, like, what do you,"
29:52,960;29:56,560;"how do you feel about the fact that they ran it on you 44 times?"
29:56,560;30:01,320;"And he said, then typical Belichick fashion, I'm surprised they didn't run it"
30:01,320;30:01,680;"more."
30:01,680;30:03,760;"Yeah, that's pretty good too."
30:03,760;30:05,000;"Cause yeah, they work."
30:05,000;30:05,160;"Yeah."
30:05,160;30:07,880;"I mean, well, they, it was, they ran 40 something time."
30:07,880;30:12,040;"They had 44 times, but they had like close to 200 yards rushing,"
30:12,040;30:14,680;"like a hundred and sixty hundred seventy hours rushing all in."
30:14,680;30:16,440;"I think because, um,"
30:16,440;30:17,640;"I mean,"
30:17,640;30:20,680;"yeah, I'm looking self-had one forty four."
30:20,680;30:21,640;"Yeah."
30:21,640;30:25,880;"So that's, I mean, it's a hell of a game and a touchdown."
30:25,880;30:28,920;"Yeah."
30:28,920;30:31,680;"Oh, they finished with a two oh nine total between."
30:31,680;30:32,640;"Damn."
30:32,640;30:36,800;"I mean, I suppose with, um, Jay Fiedler rushing as well, he had,"
30:36,800;30:37,840;"how many hours rushing do you have?"
30:37,840;30:38,280;"Yeah."
30:38,280;30:39,440;"Thirty seven years rushing."
30:40,040;30:52,160;"87 years. That's insane. I mean, I guess it could, it was shades of the, the Ravens game in the 2019 season."
30:52,160;30:57,800;"Yeah. Yeah. It felt very similar to the fact that we watch both of those in the same week. Right."
30:57,800;31:04,440;"Felt, I don't know, a little telling. I'm not quite sure why, but it was."
31:04,440;31:08,880;"Hey, but if it ends the same way, I mean, it's a teaching point."
31:08,880;31:11,800;"And that was obvious from now on the bell check used it."
31:11,800;31:13,360;"Cause I mean, I was also looking at it."
31:13,360;31:15,960;"I mean, the Patriots were one in three after this game."
31:15,960;31:16,920;"Yeah."
31:16,920;31:18,560;"Baffling."
31:18,560;31:19,280;"Right."
31:19,280;31:19,840;"Yeah."
31:19,840;31:23,320;"Cause you look at the end of this and you think page one of three, they've"
31:23,320;31:27,560;"lost like all the articles to after the game and talking about how, well, it's"
31:27,560;31:30,480;"obviously not Brady, like quarterback controversies ended."
31:30,480;31:31,640;"It's obviously any bloods."
31:31,640;31:37,600;"And the Ron Borges thing where he wrote the quarterback controversy ended after Brady's"
31:37,600;31:38,600;"first fumble."
31:38,600;31:42,000;"So I'm like, wow, what a bold statement."
31:42,000;31:43,000;"So typical."
31:43,000;31:44,000;"He's wrong."
31:44,000;31:45,000;"Yeah."
31:45,000;31:47,440;"How that's another thing on its head here."
31:47,440;31:50,240;"What's the point of listening to like sports stuff when like anybody could say whatever"
31:50,240;31:52,320;"the hell they want, nobody's held accountable for anything?"
31:52,320;32:00,520;"I mean, you know, between Max Kellerman, you know, the first take guys, you know, skip"
32:00,520;32:02,520;"Bayless and Shannon"
32:02,520;32:08,840;"What's the point because you could say anything and then"
32:08,840;32:12,880;"If you're wrong you're wrong gives a crap because that's a pretty bold statement"
32:12,880;32:18,000;"And I wonder if you've been like Ron Borges remembers it because there's so much other crap that he said over the years that"
32:18,000;32:23,640;"Doesn't really matter. Oh, don't you worry? I'll make sure he remembers it because I'm a tweeted Adam"
32:23,640;32:28,840;"Down with this show do it. Yeah, he can get fucked and I'm gonna sign up for Twitter"
32:28,840;32:35,360;"And then I'll do that too. Oh, yeah, because I know we're gonna run some Sean to see articles too, and we'll tweet them at"
32:35,360;32:43,000;"Cold takes exposed. Oh, okay. Yeah, I love that account. So we'll we'll make sure they know about it"
32:43,000;32:49,600;"All right, but yeah, no, I think there's actually it it almost feel like there's a cottage industry about hating the pages"
32:49,600;32:55,240;"And I was thinking about this earlier because I've heard this kind of come up in other places where"
32:55,240;32:57,560;"the"
32:57,560;33:06,680;"Boston sports teams before, you know, 2000 ish, were kind of the lovable losers. So the sports"
33:06,680;33:16,600;"writers of the day kind of made their names being the negative of these teams and like pointing out,"
33:16,600;33:21,800;"like, you know, well, here we go again. It's time for, you know, the red socks to bungle it away or"
33:21,800;33:25,800;"or the pages to be the Patriots or, you know, all of that stuff."
33:25,800;33:31,800;"And then since like '01, and the page became a dynasty,"
33:31,800;33:35,800;"the rest of the teams have kind of followed."
33:35,800;33:46,800;"And so there's been this level of success, but the sports media in Boston has kind of tried to keep that negative attitude towards it."
33:46,800;33:53,960;"But now it just feels forced because like the pages have won two of the last three Super Bowls and they've been to all three of them"
33:53,960;33:56,680;"Why are we shooting over how?"
33:56,680;33:59,680;"Bill Belichick drafts in the second round"
33:59,680;34:07,780;"Over the past 10 years because honestly doesn't fucking matter does it there's it's obviously working because they're still winning Super Bowls at"
34:07,780;34:11,920;"66% clip"
34:11,920;34:15,500;"So yeah, I feel like"
34:15,500;34:27,060;"Like the negativity is by design and I feel like they're almost trying to play this caricature"
34:27,060;34:33,500;"of like the page so good so we're going to hate them so that people will hate watch us"
34:33,500;34:35,300;"and we'll go viral because of it."
34:35,300;34:40,540;"Doesn't that like make sports time away though because we know it's a gimmick and of course"
34:40,540;34:43,460;"they have to because somebody has to play the counterpoint."
34:43,460;34:47,980;"So you have Max kind of running his mouth for four straight years, kind of the same"
34:47,980;34:50,980;"the same thing and somehow he gets paycheck for that."
34:50,980;34:52,500;"But I mean, we know that it's an act."
34:52,500;34:57,100;"So I guess like part of it is that he's trying to sell that act so good for him."
34:57,100;35:03,620;"But yeah, it just seems like I don't know how sports talk exists when nothing matters."
35:03,620;35:04,820;"I mean, this is what I mean."
35:04,820;35:10,300;"This is how it existed because they come out with these ridiculous hot takes like, but"
35:10,300;35:13,220;"why do we listen to it, man?"
35:13,220;35:18,260;"we hate ourselves, Mikey. Okay, that's what I wanted to talk about. Why do we hate ourselves?"
35:18,260;35:26,820;"Because we weren't hugged enough as children. That is beyond my pace."
35:26,820;35:31,220;"That's a good start, I think. Speaking of other things I hate."
35:31,220;35:36,580;"We'll touch on that later because I feel like we're going in a pretty good spot there."
35:36,580;35:40,420;"All right. Yeah, no. We'll get back to that. We've got a whole season's worth of episodes,"
35:40,420;35:42,720;"So we'll we'll peel that onion."
35:42,720;35:52,060;"Um, other things I hate the stupid fucking baseball dirt baseball field in the middle of the old Miami."
35:52,060;35:52,980;"Oh, yeah."
35:52,980;35:53,420;"Yeah."
35:53,420;35:54,620;"That was a stable."
35:54,620;35:56,420;"It was awful."
35:56,420;35:59,420;"Like trying to watching kickers kick from the dirt."
35:59,420;36:00,020;"Yeah."
36:00,020;36:06,420;"The stereo watching like lime and trying to like, like line up in the dirt and trying to like get a jump on things."
36:06,780;36:11,100;"It was something like some kind of like fun like backyard football type of thing to that."
36:11,100;36:15,820;"Well, I mean, yeah, between that and the fact that all the grass was dead,"
36:15,820;36:17,100;"really, like it on."
36:17,100;36:20,340;"I mean, a couple of like rolled ankles aside."
36:20,340;36:24,140;"It made me feel better looking out the window and be like, Oh, my grass is brown, too."
36:24,140;36:24,780;"This is perfect."
36:24,780;36:25,620;"And half of it's dirt."
36:25,620;36:26,420;"I love it."
36:26,420;36:28,700;"I am my Emmy football field."
36:28,700;36:32,740;"Not to play counterpoint after just saying what I just said about everybody else,"
36:32,740;36:35,940;"but I will say that that was probably my favorite field of all time."
36:36,300;36:37,620;"Oh, fucking course it was."
36:37,620;36:42,300;"So take that and we could debate that all all day long."
36:42,300;36:44,380;"Cause I would give it to me."
36:44,380;36:45,540;"Why is that your favorite field?"
36:45,540;36:47,300;"Cause it's different."
36:47,300;36:48,900;"Cause it's wrong."
36:48,900;36:50,380;"And because it's wrong."
36:50,380;36:52,020;"Okay."
36:52,020;36:54,100;"Cause it's socially unacceptable."
36:54,100;36:55,460;"It's socially unacceptable."
36:55,460;37:00,020;"No, dude, don't don't attack me over that."
37:00,020;37:02,660;"Or are you playing me attacking you?"
37:02,660;37:04,780;"No, I'm attacking you in that case."
37:04,780;37:05,100;"Oh, yeah."
37:05,100;37:05,380;"I know."
37:05,380;37:08,940;"I don't like that and I was gonna attack you I was gonna say I have a lot of beautiful"
37:08,940;37:13,620;"childhood memories about that that field there are a lot of times"
37:13,620;37:16,300;"where I"
37:16,300;37:18,300;"Remember watching Dan Marino"
37:18,300;37:23,900;"Destroy us on that field and I remember like man that guy has some crazy stats and I keep track of those stats"
37:23,900;37:26,380;"Because I had no friends in no time"
37:26,380;37:30,420;"with anybody outside of my parents and"
37:30,420;37:34,900;"It got me through those days, okay, I remember there are journals"
37:34,900;37:40,900;"When I was a kid in school that talked about Dan Marino's stat lines, okay?"
37:40,900;37:43,260;"So I've got damn it. I love that field."
37:43,260;37:51,100;"All right. I mean, I can't argue that because I'm pretty sure I introduce you to the"
37:51,100;37:53,620;"unnecessary roughness computer game."
37:53,620;37:58,340;"I did. And by the way, that still might be the best game ever. If anybody can get,"
37:58,340;38:00,580;"what was it, running on DOS or something? I don't know."
38:00,580;38:01,740;"Yeah, though you could find this game."
38:01,740;38:04,940;"It's online. There's an online emulator of it"
38:04,940;38:12,540;"Then if I remember I'll get it if anyone's listening right now and all you take from life or this podcast is this"
38:12,540;38:15,260;"Download this game. What is it again?"
38:15,260;38:21,140;"Unnessay roughness. I want to say 93, but it didn't have the date, right?"
38:21,140;38:26,140;"There's no no there was a couple of them, but yeah, whatever the earliest one was"
38:26,140;38:30,020;"and if I remember I'll post the"
38:30,780;38:34,040;"The link to where you can play online for free, but you could"
38:34,040;38:38,500;"Literally design your own plays so you could there's a chalkboard"
38:38,500;38:44,500;"You can drag and drop different players into the positions and then click and draw literally draw"
38:44,500;38:47,480;"the routes for where everybody's supposed to run and"
38:47,480;38:52,840;"I would draw the most ridiculous plays, but yeah, so that game I think"
38:52,840;38:57,460;"Before I obsession over numbers. Oh"
38:58,220;39:01,700;"But I can't even begin to tell you how bad it was."
39:01,700;39:04,820;"Before I put us in the game, once I finally met you"
39:04,820;39:11,820;"and made a friend, I think I played as the '94, '95,"
39:11,820;39:13,860;"whatever it was, Patriots."
39:13,860;39:17,140;"So I would put Drew Bledsoe in and make sure he would throw"
39:17,140;39:19,900;"for 500 yards a game and then put Scott Zolak in"
39:19,900;39:21,380;"and try to get him another 500."
39:21,380;39:24,660;"And at the end of the season,"
39:24,660;39:27,660;"I literally printed out all the stats that I had."
39:27,660;39:34,220;"I remember I think I had my own book too and I put him in I put him in a binder and I would highlight all the ones that were"
39:34,220;39:39,420;"NFL records and I was super proud of the fact that I had"
39:39,420;39:44,780;"True blood so throw for more passing yards than damn Reno cuz it's over the five thousand"
39:44,780;39:51,740;"And in a video game that I had on easy by the way, I beat damn Reno by like 200 passing yards"
39:51,740;39:55,180;"Well"
39:55,260;39:57,260;"And yeah, that game was awesome."
39:57,260;39:59,420;"I mean, it's right up there with a technical Super Bowl,"
39:59,420;40:00,700;"which is one of my favorites."
40:00,700;40:03,060;"Yeah, I'm Jim Harbaugh on that was awesome."
40:03,060;40:06,060;"And I mean,"
40:06,060;40:07,860;"I would have pronounced that with a hard G at the end."
40:07,860;40:08,900;"Harbaugh."
40:08,900;40:09,900;"Good."
40:09,900;40:12,940;"Or Harbaugh as he likes to be called."
40:12,940;40:15,300;"Even better."
40:15,300;40:17,180;"Only when he's playing in London."
40:17,180;40:19,180;"That's right."
40:19,180;40:22,780;"But yeah, no, that that that game was definitely awesome."
40:22,780;40:28,140;"And I don't know if you remember the NFL coaches game that came out for a couple of years,"
40:28,140;40:31,100;"where it was like you would coach the team and like you're super weird."
40:31,100;40:37,260;"And I like the idea of it because I'm a stat nerd, but it was sort of like that, but you could play the game."
40:37,260;40:43,660;"Yeah, it was. Yeah, that game was a great idea, but the execution was horrendous."
40:43,660;40:45,340;"Yes. Yeah."
40:45,340;40:51,260;"And I don't know how much of a market there is for that type of game per se, but, you know,"
40:51,260;40:53,500;"And it was a console game and it didn't work."
40:53,500;40:54,540;"It should have been a game."
40:54,540;40:56,300;"But yeah, we were so psyched about that."
40:56,300;40:57,060;"I remember that."
40:57,060;40:57,740;"Yeah."
40:57,740;41:04,180;"So anyways, that dolphin stadium somehow is connected to that."
41:04,180;41:08,500;"And I know we finished measuring our NFL nerd bonus."
41:08,500;41:11,860;"It is what it is, man."
41:11,860;41:14,220;"I mean, Dan Marino was like my best friend growing up."
41:14,220;41:15,660;"Wow."
41:15,660;41:18,220;"I didn't know that you and then you."
41:18,220;41:19,660;"But something is weird."
41:19,660;41:20,060;"All right."
41:20,060;41:21,820;"Well, you already did, but that's okay."
41:21,820;41:22,660;"I know."
41:22,660;41:27,540;"Uh, did you, did you happen to catch the, uh, the Ray Lucas appearance?"
41:27,540;41:33,780;"Yeah, man, I wrote down backup Ray Lucas, which I mean, he was on and off starter backup throughout his career."
41:33,780;41:34,220;"Yeah."
41:34,220;41:34,220;"Yeah."
41:34,220;41:36,260;"The poor man, Michael Bishop, I wrote down."
41:36,260;41:40,300;"Um, yeah, they were bringing him in on third and shorts and he would immediately"
41:40,300;41:44,700;"get a false start and they pull him back out again and then put me back in to convert the third along."
41:44,700;41:46,700;"It's good to see him though."
41:46,700;41:47,500;"Yeah."
41:47,980;41:50,780;"I didn't realize he was a former Patriot Ray Lucas."
41:50,780;41:53,700;"Oh, I noticed that in that."
41:53,700;41:55,620;"He played for the judges too, right?"
41:55,620;41:56,300;"I think so. Yeah."
41:56,300;42:01,460;"But I think what happened was when because it was in the, it was in the, one"
42:01,460;42:08,060;"of the pay of the articles, I think, if I read it correctly, that when Bledso"
42:08,060;42:14,860;"went down, the Patriots either traded for or signed John Fries from the dolphins."
42:15,300;42:19,140;"And so the dolphins picked up Ray Lucas because the pages dropped him"
42:19,140;42:21,580;"to be their backup."
42:21,580;42:23,420;"So they basically swap quarterbacks."
42:23,420;42:25,380;"When where does a Damon Heward fit in all that?"
42:25,380;42:28,020;"Oh, no, sorry."
42:28,020;42:28,580;"You're right."
42:28,580;42:29,820;"John free was on the page."
42:29,820;42:30,380;"So I read it."
42:30,380;42:31,500;"They picked up a new year."
42:31,500;42:31,980;"Yeah."
42:31,980;42:32,820;"Yes."
42:32,820;42:34,300;"I get those two confused."
42:34,300;42:37,060;"I don't know why I'm doing it."
42:37,060;42:38,620;"Five and one starter."
42:38,620;42:41,420;"How is John freezes a starter?"
42:41,420;42:44,500;"He's two and 17."
42:44,500;42:47,340;"Wow, you just had that off the top."
42:47,340;42:48,460;"Yeah, I love it."
42:48,460;42:49,700;"Did you make that up?"
42:49,700;42:50,940;"I might have."
42:50,940;42:53,140;"I don't know."
42:53,140;42:55,220;"I don't even know if it was ever started."
42:55,220;42:55,740;"No, no, it's good."
42:55,740;42:58,900;"I don't know if you ever was, but that was, that was very well done."
42:58,900;43:00,900;"Thank you."
43:00,900;43:03,620;"The match up of this game, I thought,"
43:03,620;43:07,620;"was Matt Light for Jason Taylor."
43:07,620;43:10,140;"Yeah, not much of a matchup, but it was a."
43:10,140;43:11,380;"Yeah, what did you think?"
43:11,380;43:12,700;"Sort of foreshadowing."
43:12,700;43:19,060;"I mean, I think Matt Laid was in over his head and he obviously got tweaked by the end of the game."
43:19,060;43:20,300;"So that was an issue."
43:20,300;43:26,380;"But it's probably great exposure that early in the season to go up against somebody like that."
43:26,380;43:30,300;"Yeah, because I don't think Matt Laid even played the first game because he was injured."
43:30,300;43:34,140;"So this is his third game as a NFL starter."
43:34,140;43:38,460;"He's going up against Jason Taylor in his prime."
43:38,460;43:39,340;"Yeah."
43:39,340;43:41,500;"Who would eat people alive."
43:41,540;43:46,660;"And I did I did notice I think they actually called it out too early in the game where"
43:46,660;43:52,820;"Matt Light was all about finishing the fucking play and he would block Jason Taylor"
43:52,820;43:58,980;"like even after the whistle was done. He's like right trying to set the tone and it didn't work."
43:58,980;44:02,260;"Hey, but that's like that's a solid check attitude right there."
44:02,260;44:04,820;"No, it was a great idea to have and I think"
44:04,820;44:07,540;"it's that attitude"
44:07,540;44:08,820;"is why"
44:08,820;44:11,700;"Matt Light played left tackle for as long as he did."
44:11,700;44:12,660;"- Right."
44:12,660;44:15,420;"- 'Cause he just was, you kinda need that,"
44:15,420;44:18,700;"that mean streak as just like an offensive lineman in general."
44:18,700;44:19,540;"But."
44:19,540;44:22,700;"- Right, which I mean, I wouldn't say that he was like amazing,"
44:22,700;44:26,020;"but he was consistently good throughout his career."
44:26,020;44:27,100;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
44:27,100;44:28,700;"Yeah, I mean, he was a solid left-act similar"
44:28,700;44:30,900;"to Nate Silver, I think, who."
44:30,900;44:31,820;"- Yeah, yeah."
44:31,820;44:33,820;"- Would have trouble every once in a while,"
44:34,900;44:40,180;"but you could usually count on him to quiet most rushes off that edge."
44:40,180;44:41,020;"You're right."
44:41,020;44:42,820;"If not, shut them down completely."
44:42,820;44:50,580;"Oh, we also failed to talk about Troy Brown's fumble."
44:50,580;44:56,580;"I was, I was really just looking at that line in my notes thinking, do I want to"
44:56,580;44:57,100;"bring this up?"
44:57,100;44:58,260;"But I feel like we have to."
44:58,260;44:59,300;"Yeah."
44:59,300;45:04,860;"That's probably the, at least in this stretch of games that we've watched recently."
45:04,860;45:08,860;"I would say that's his only mistake that I can do."
45:08,860;45:15,100;"Yeah, I don't think like just literally in general, I don't think I've seen him make any other"
45:15,100;45:21,980;"mistakes. At least not that I can remember. So yeah, I think this much we may have actually seen"
45:21,980;45:26,540;"and uncovered the one mistake Troy Brown has ever made."
45:26,540;45:30,860;"Let's have a moment of silence."
45:32,300;45:34,460;"Well, did you see his quote about it in the paper too?"
45:34,460;45:39,020;"No, in this post game, they were telling him about how"
45:39,020;45:44,140;"the broadcast getting cut off at the beginning."
45:44,140;45:51,740;"He was like, ""Did they miss my muff punt? Did anybody see that?"""
45:51,740;45:53,740;"They were like, ""Yeah, no, it was on by then."""
45:53,740;45:54,460;"He was like, ""Oh, damn it."""
45:54,460;45:56,220;"That's pretty funny."
45:56,220;45:57,980;"Good old Troy, Brian."
45:57,980;46:00,540;"And I'm not saying that the events were funny."
46:00,540;46:06,380;"I'm saying that Troy Brown's reaction to his fumble is what's funny for the record."
46:06,380;46:07,380;"Simmerdow."
46:07,380;46:08,380;"Jesus."
46:08,380;46:09,380;"You canceled."
46:09,380;46:10,380;"You canceled."
46:10,380;46:14,180;"Hey, Troy Brown fumbling though at the Patriots two yard line."
46:14,180;46:15,180;"No less."
46:15,180;46:20,140;"Yeah, it was a bad fumble, but it only resulted in a field goal."
46:20,140;46:21,140;"And why is that?"
46:21,140;46:26,420;"Andrew, because they had an amazing potentially best moment of the game."
46:26,420;46:27,900;"Gold line stand."
46:27,900;46:28,900;"Yes."
46:28,900;46:33,520;"I think I think if they had won it that would have been the thing you'd see on turning points"
46:33,520;46:36,500;"I mean, it was still early in the game"
46:36,500;46:42,840;"But with the you know the the fable interception with the touchdown run with the goal line stand"
46:42,840;46:46,260;"This was looking pretty good in the beginning like you see yeah, they would definitely hang in there"
46:46,260;46:49,960;"Even but this was right around the time at the"
46:49,960;46:56,160;"Patriots sideline. We're having heads at issues to do you notice that? Oh, yeah, and Bella check was"
46:56,820;47:02,340;"Live it. Oh, he was he was complaining the whole game pretty much it felt like where he wanted the other team to"
47:02,340;47:07,380;"Remove their headsets. I mean, I don't know why why that didn't happen though"
47:07,380;47:10,940;"Yeah, it didn't seem to and"
47:10,940;47:15,820;"But there was nothing those I mean obviously we don't have access to the postgame"
47:15,820;47:21,220;"Videos or anything so I mean but there's anybody out there is listening and has a"
47:21,780;47:28,580;"Please email. Oh, man. I don't know if I need anything else for my spank bank, but yeah, that would be awesome to have"
47:28,580;47:32,780;"Right, but yeah, I mean in the in the papers. There was no mention of it whatsoever"
47:32,780;47:37,500;"There's no like mention Bell check even talking about it which as we know"
47:37,500;47:44,060;"Further down the line in this dynasty that the opposite would happen quite often"
47:44,060;47:46,740;"Muji from"
47:46,740;47:51,720;"Was there ever anybody other than Mike Tomlin that would bitch about it? I feel like he would do it. We didn't show up"
47:51,720;47:56,000;"Yeah, he's the biggest proponent of that whole argument."
47:56,000;48:01,800;"I was thinking though, and this is again, partly sell a soul."
48:01,800;48:03,520;"You know, my views on Belichick."
48:03,520;48:07,240;"Love, very suspicious."
48:07,240;48:16,880;"So I was thinking, could this have been the first time that gave Belichick the idea to"
48:16,880;48:18,360;"really fuck with that."
48:18,360;48:24,680;"I mean because I mean it obviously affected him to the point where he was living right so how funny would it be and just like now"
48:24,680;48:28,820;"We see Tom on right let's say hypothetically and let's agree that he did"
48:28,820;48:35,460;"Fuck with those head headsets intentionally every time imagine like Tom when I'm a sideline losing his mind and"
48:35,460;48:42,120;"Bell checks not showing like anything. No poker face is like on strong and that guy's losing his mind inside"
48:42,120;48:44,240;"That dude is grinning. Yeah, oh"
48:45,480;48:49,820;"And you see like the you know the the bug eyed look, you know the anger"
48:49,820;48:56,240;"That's really hilarious. Do you think that it started with this game kind of giving in that idea? I?"
48:56,240;49:02,040;"Think here's how far I'll go. I think this game with that happening is"
49:02,040;49:05,480;"one of those things where"
49:05,480;49:09,240;"Bell check adds that to his little piece of paper that he's always scribbling on"
49:09,240;49:11,760;"of the"
49:11,760;49:13,760;"yeah of the of the"
49:14,160;49:21,200;"Of the things they're they're gonna take care of for now until ever like it's one of those things that they're gonna be prepared for"
49:21,200;49:26,320;"It's one of those little things that they prepare for right? That's now on the list and that will never happen again"
49:26,320;49:28,320;"Would you say it's a cheat sheet or a cheater sheet?"
49:28,320;49:33,240;"Bella cheat sheet"
49:33,240;49:41,840;"I don't know it's something to table for now, but we can oh man, you know we need to sell those now we should tally"
49:42,720;49:49,680;"How many little things could be considered like in the cheat sheet or cheater sheet, right?"
49:49,680;49:56,240;"Tell you them up at the end of each season and then just by the end see what the score is on if"
49:56,240;49:58,800;"Belichick is in fact a cheater"
49:58,800;50:04,880;"That's something that the experience might be interested in I think you're right now. They'd love that"
50:04,880;50:09,760;"You're gonna be their favorite person. I'll I'll toss it to Steve and Greg and Steve"
50:10,320;50:14,060;"Oh, Steve will definitely all about that. He loves being hated"
50:14,060;50:18,200;"All right, so we've blamed the"
50:18,200;50:22,600;"Page going behind on the muff pun and the"
50:22,600;50:24,680;"headsets"
50:24,680;50:26,720;"so not their fault even though they had the"
50:26,720;50:29,560;"the"
50:29,560;50:31,560;"defensive hold on the goal line"
50:31,560;50:34,000;"right"
50:34,000;50:40,200;"So that I think I think it was an ensuing drive patrons are moving the ball again"
50:40,200;50:47,320;"I don't know if you saw this but there was one play I think like a third and fourish"
50:47,320;50:53,120;"like near midfield Brady goes on a bootleg and there's a Russia right in his face immediately"
50:53,120;50:54,600;"so he just takes off up field."
50:54,600;50:55,600;"Yes, sir."
50:55,600;51:01,920;"And he goes for the slide and gets lit the fuck up like forearm right to like right across"
51:01,920;51:02,920;"the eyebrows."
51:02,920;51:08,400;"This is one of my best moments of the game and not because he got lit up but no."
51:08,400;51:15,480;"Yeah, no, that's bad timing on my part, but I know what you can say. Yeah, yeah, and you just gets in the face of a walker"
51:15,480;51:20,520;"I believe it was and he's just like yeah picture a guy like his what second start"
51:20,520;51:26,720;"Just like yeah now pen just going on a talking in the chest like screaming out of that was a good move"
51:26,720;51:30,200;"It was yeah, but I mean that's the"
51:30,200;51:35,760;"That's the old-school brave that you kind of remember that that fire in his belly"
51:36,440;51:41,960;"Just like not gonna take shit from me. I think you fuck that is he just gets up. He's like how the how dare"
51:41,960;51:45,760;"You try to hit me in the head try to take my head off when I'm sliding"
51:45,760;51:50,800;"And he didn't even get the call for it. No, yeah, I know it was a lot more lax back then"
51:50,800;51:58,920;"Which also like I also made a note where the shoulder pads bigger back then I know we've talked about oh"
51:58,920;52:06,100;"Dude or was everybody like on steroids and I know that in the 70s everybody was so everybody was in the freakin early 2000"
52:06,100;52:09,100;"I don't know, but they were massive people running around that field."
52:09,100;52:11,940;"So I had something slightly different than that."
52:11,940;52:12,580;"Um,"
52:12,580;52:19,660;"there was some story this year about how Brady has been wearing the same shoulder"
52:19,660;52:23,020;"pads since like high school or college, wherever it was."
52:23,020;52:23,620;"Yeah."
52:23,620;52:27,580;"But you look at shots of him on the sideline of these games and his shoulder"
52:27,580;52:30,660;"pads are like six inches out past like corner of his arms."
52:30,660;52:31,620;"Okay."
52:31,620;52:35,180;"There's no way they're the same shoulder pads unless they just have shirts that"
52:35,180;52:38,380;"fit differently or something. Yeah, I don't know. Everybody was looking like a"
52:38,380;52:42,460;"jacked up monster out there. Yeah, they do. They look like, um,"
52:42,460;52:48,100;"basically what the guys in the black hole at Raiders games, which they look like."
52:48,100;52:51,020;"Right. Yeah. Like, like,"
52:51,020;52:57,060;"extra large shoulder crats sticking out. Yeah. I just thought that was funny, uh,"
52:57,060;53:02,140;"which, um, I also wrote down, uh, cause you had mentioned it, uh,"
53:02,180;53:05,900;"before we got on here, but we can tie it into the steroid talk."
53:05,900;53:13,060;"But on this day, I believe Barry Bons also broke the home run record."
53:13,060;53:14,660;"Yes. Yeah."
53:14,660;53:17,060;"The same Mateo alum."
53:17,060;53:19,020;"That's right. That's right."
53:19,020;53:21,820;"One in the same. Yeah."
53:21,820;53:30,140;"So I vaguely remember, I mean, because I believe we, yeah, we were in high school."
53:30,140;53:32,880;"I remember this happening."
53:32,880;53:34,740;"We would kind of play pick up football games"
53:34,740;53:37,000;"and kind of romanticize this whole like home run thing."
53:37,000;53:38,320;"Everyone would kind of like be talking"
53:38,320;53:39,920;"about a week after week."
53:39,920;53:42,280;"And then obviously the steroid stuff came out"
53:42,280;53:44,480;"and that whole era was tainted."
53:44,480;53:47,960;"And you know, looking at these guys,"
53:47,960;53:51,960;"I'm pretty sure a lot of these guys were on something"
53:51,960;53:53,880;"throughout football."
53:53,880;53:56,360;"I mean, obviously now it's HGH or whatever,"
53:56,360;53:57,760;"but and guys are running faster,"
53:57,760;53:59,720;"but they were pretty jacked back then."
53:59,720;54:04,720;"So what are your thoughts on steroid use?"
54:04,720;54:08,160;"- I think that, I agree with you,"
54:08,160;54:10,280;"I think there were a lot of people on steroids."
54:10,280;54:14,880;"I think football is a game back then."
54:14,880;54:19,040;"They would, was just a game for bigger people in general."
54:19,040;54:20,960;"There wasn't as much of focus on speed"
54:20,960;54:25,040;"as there was on size in hitting"
54:25,040;54:27,000;"because it was more run first,"
54:27,000;54:30,820;"the the offense and the rules of the league"
54:30,820;54:33,720;"hadn't been tailored towards the passing game yet."
54:33,720;54:34,560;"- Right."
54:34,560;54:39,000;"- And so I'm sure there were pressures"
54:39,000;54:43,460;"on getting bigger than the guy across from you on the field."
54:43,460;54:46,960;"But yeah, and I think also the equipment"
54:46,960;54:47,840;"probably played into that too,"
54:47,840;54:50,440;"like you're talking about like these master shoulder pads"
54:50,440;54:53,160;"and kind of baggier jerseys as well."
54:53,160;54:54,000;"- Yep."
54:54,000;54:55,400;"- This makes everybody look like,"
54:55,400;55:00,320;"I bet like Frankenstein costs me now."
55:00,320;55:06,160;"Now I'll toss this out to you because I mean I'll go on the record and this is a hot take."
55:06,160;55:07,400;"I'll go on the record."
55:07,400;55:10,480;"I say that steroid use is extremely bad for your body."
55:10,480;55:16,160;"It's poor sportsmanship for those that are not on steroids, not a level playing field."
55:16,160;55:21,080;"And you know obviously if you're doing that and you're getting an advantage, I mean I"
55:21,080;55:23,880;"I wouldn't necessarily feel like I'm the better person"
55:23,880;55:26,080;"or the better athlete because obviously I'm assisted."
55:26,080;55:29,280;"But you've like you said, other people were taking it too."
55:29,280;55:32,120;"And so how do you compete with those people is the question."
55:32,120;55:36,000;"But so Barry Bonds, and I've thought about this"
55:36,000;55:39,560;"and it's sort of like everyone likes to play the safe answer,"
55:39,560;55:40,400;"which is fine."
55:40,400;55:43,880;"Safe is keeps you alive for the most part."
55:43,880;55:48,800;"But Barry Bonds was, he was a household name"
55:48,800;55:50,280;"and he was great."
55:50,280;55:54,920;"You know, he was probably gonna be considered a great"
55:54,920;55:56,360;"after he was done."
55:56,360;56:00,360;"But I would say that once the steroid use started happening,"
56:00,360;56:04,640;"he became a very much a household name nationwide,"
56:04,640;56:06,160;"and he became a star, right?"
56:06,160;56:09,560;"So he broke this record for the rest of his career."
56:09,560;56:11,840;"I mean, he became the type that was feared"
56:11,840;56:13,200;"and they would walk them every time."
56:13,200;56:15,480;"It was like this whole war that was being created"
56:15,480;56:16,640;"around this guy."
56:16,640;56:20,360;"And, you know, whatever, it came out."
56:20,360;56:22,000;"Same thing with a lot of these guys, you know,"
56:22,000;56:23,560;"Clemens and whatever."
56:23,560;56:27,300;"And now they're like the pariah of society, you know,"
56:27,300;56:30,120;"Lance Armstrong, all that stuff,"
56:30,120;56:31,960;"which of course, Lance Armstrong,"
56:31,960;56:34,080;"I mean, it seemed a little iffy"
56:34,080;56:36,560;"that the guy would be so dominant with no peers,"
56:36,560;56:39,720;"but we all want to--"
56:39,720;56:41,400;"- 'Cause he has no balls, Mike."
56:41,400;56:42,720;"- Well, okay."
56:42,720;56:45,160;"- Well, so you're saying he has to compensate for that,"
56:45,160;56:47,740;"which I, I, it's his choice."
56:47,740;56:49,260;"I have made a more streamlined."
56:49,260;56:49,940;"That's all."
56:49,940;56:50,260;"Right."
56:50,260;56:50,740;"Exactly."
56:50,740;56:53,500;"So he's leveling the playing field by doing that."
56:53,500;56:54,500;"He was at his advantage."
56:54,500;56:57,500;"And he was being humble and slightly scared"
56:57,500;57:00,580;"to reveal that information for being judged."
57:00,580;57:08,220;"But anyway, so all these guys, so people love heroes, right?"
57:08,220;57:10,220;"They love larger than life characters."
57:10,220;57:12,580;"They love big numbers."
57:12,580;57:15,380;"Hopefully people like Brady and Mahomes are clean"
57:15,380;57:18,340;"and we can kind of cherish them as their careers are over."
57:18,340;57:22,420;"But yeah, so these guys are like cartoon characters"
57:22,420;57:24,780;"or superheroes where they're a little bit different"
57:24,780;57:25,620;"than everybody else."
57:25,620;57:26,460;"And so we praise them."
57:26,460;57:29,260;"And then when we find out all this stuff, it crumples."
57:29,260;57:31,580;"And then they become brides and we like shit on them."
57:31,580;57:37,380;"But we sort of had a hand in it because we wanted it so badly."
57:37,380;57:41,740;"So my question to you is, so Barry Bonds now"
57:41,740;57:43,060;"and Clendons and all those guys,"
57:43,060;57:45,540;"they're starting to be talked about Hall of Fame"
57:45,540;57:47,660;"and all that stuff and people are coming around to them"
57:47,660;57:48,940;"because of the era, right?"
57:48,940;57:52,180;"So as with time, everything sort of gets rewritten slightly."
57:52,180;57:56,860;"So he might be in the Hall of Fame,"
57:56,860;57:58,340;"he would like people loved one day."
57:58,340;58:00,900;"Would you as Barry Bonds, right?"
58:00,900;58:04,620;"Actually, no, as Andy Brown, fucking Barry Bonds."
58:04,620;58:07,540;"Andy Brown, you start off on the pirates,"
58:07,540;58:09,380;"you end up being on the red socks,"
58:09,380;58:11,140;"or I will change history a little bit."
58:11,140;58:18,140;"And you're on the, you're just about to become like David Ortiz, right?"
58:18,140;58:22,140;"And I don't know what the deal is with that guy."
58:22,140;58:25,140;"Things have been tossed around, never proven, whatever."
58:25,140;58:28,140;"I just bring him up because he's the most recent Red Sox hero."
58:28,140;58:33,140;"So basically I'm stalling here, but what I want to ask is,"
58:33,140;58:38,140;"would you, knowing that you'd be one of the greats, take steroids,"
58:38,140;58:42,420;"Knowing that it'll also increase your brand and probably give you a shit ton of money"
58:42,420;58:45,960;"And it would guarantee that you would be one of the greats"
58:45,960;58:54,140;"And then whatever happens after happens or would you play it safe play by the book knowing that other people do this and then just be a good player"
58:54,140;58:56,220;"That's eventually forgotten. I"
58:56,220;59:02,300;"Would probably do steroids if I knew it would make me the greatest"
59:03,220;59:09,880;"Okay, so it has to have that stipulation. I think so. So I think I but I think that's why everybody doesn't"
59:09,880;59:15,520;"Right, so but I mean you would have to have that thought if you were gonna start doing it. So"
59:15,520;59:25,800;"Let's say you're one of these guys where you have your ego sort of plays into that realm because that's your that's your industry, right?"
59:25,800;59:31,820;"I mean, that's all me. Yeah, okay. Yeah, so if you if you thought like somebody sold it on you"
59:31,820;59:35,020;"where it was like, yeah, man, like you'll knock out over 70"
59:35,020;59:38,500;"home runs or whatever it is, whatever sport you think you"
59:38,500;59:41,900;"might consider it if it would bring you the next level."
59:41,900;59:42,580;"Yeah."
59:42,580;59:44,460;"I think people would."
59:44,460;59:46,020;"I think so too."
59:46,020;59:47,620;"I'm like, it's not black and white, man."
59:47,620;59:49,820;"Like that's a very complex issue."
59:49,820;59:53,100;"And like I said, it breaks down your body and I'm not condoning it as well."
59:53,100;59:57,220;"But I also understand what thought process these guys had."
59:57,220;59:59,540;"And some of them didn't even know really what was going on."
01:00:00,260;01:00:04,220;"you know, as silly as that sounds, I believe some of that."
01:00:04,220;01:00:07,860;"So how can we as a society then condemn these people"
01:00:07,860;01:00:10,340;"to the point where they like, they should be in jail"
01:00:10,340;01:00:14,820;"for 20 years for destroying the integrity of the game"
01:00:14,820;01:00:17,420;"when it's like, hey, it's his choice, you know,"
01:00:17,420;01:00:18,660;"yes, it is cheating."
01:00:18,660;01:00:21,340;"Yeah, he should be banned from the sport maybe"
01:00:21,340;01:00:23,460;"or maybe not being the record bucks."
01:00:23,460;01:00:27,140;"But how can we condemn a guy who's like trying to compete"
01:00:27,140;01:00:28,580;"and be known as one of the greats?"
01:00:28,580;01:00:30,180;"I think that's very black and white."
01:00:30,180;01:00:31,180;"I don't know."
01:00:31,180;01:00:35,500;"It is, and I think there are people who just think in black and white, and it's either"
01:00:35,500;01:00:39,220;"right or it's wrong, and if it's wrong, then you should be condemned."
01:00:39,220;01:00:42,980;"I'm not one of those people, I think."
01:00:42,980;01:00:50,300;"And I have less of a problem with steroids and that sort of stuff in football because"
01:00:50,300;01:00:51,900;"of how violent sport it is."
01:00:51,900;01:00:56,060;"And it seems like a lot of the guys, at least nowadays, that are getting caught using it"
01:00:56,060;01:00:59,780;"are ones who are doing it to come back from injury."
01:00:59,780;01:01:03,540;"Right. Are you alluding to like Edelman and things like that?"
01:01:03,540;01:01:05,740;"Oh, yeah. Well, I was thinking about Rodney Harrison, but yeah,"
01:01:05,740;01:01:09,900;"Edelman and those were, and I'm assuming there have been other people."
01:01:09,900;01:01:11,540;"I mean, well, even like,"
01:01:11,540;01:01:15,340;"Adrian Peterson blew out his whatever it was,"
01:01:15,340;01:01:19,300;"ACL or something. Yeah. And was back within like summer,"
01:01:19,300;01:01:20,600;"Dick, and Simon, or even say,"
01:01:20,600;01:01:22,660;"Juan Barkley recently had a high ankle spray."
01:01:22,660;01:01:25,260;"We're supposed to put you out for six weeks and he was back in like two."
01:01:25,260;01:01:29,260;"Yeah. No. And then people wonder, they're like, Oh, they're superhuman."
01:01:29,260;01:01:30,700;"And it's like, I don't think it works that way."
01:01:30,700;01:01:31,700;"No."
01:01:31,700;01:01:37,060;"Well, I mean, even like we'll joke about like, paint manning, and I don't know if he's taking"
01:01:37,060;01:01:38,060;"HGH or not."
01:01:38,060;01:01:42,740;"But if the guy has a neck injury and he can barely feel his fingertips and he's doing"
01:01:42,740;01:01:47,420;"whatever he can to keep playing the game, I'm not condoning that again because, you know,"
01:01:47,420;01:01:50,260;"whatever he's doing to his body is his choice."
01:01:50,260;01:01:55,500;"But I also don't condone it because not everybody is able to be on it."
01:01:55,500;01:01:58,700;"Like if it was made available, that's a different thing."
01:01:58,700;01:02:03,920;"I can't like hate the guy for wanting to continue playing the game exactly I"
01:02:03,920;01:02:09,780;"Can make fun of them all day long cuz it's funny. Yeah, it's because of the size that it made us forehead"
01:02:09,780;01:02:15,580;"well, and I don't know if it did anything for his face, but the manning faces still one of the greatest ever and"
01:02:15,580;01:02:19,020;"pure genetics, bro"
01:02:19,020;01:02:25,620;"Yeah, I don't think it was gonna accuse Eli Manning of doing steroids, but they have the exact same face"
01:02:25,620;01:02:29,620;"That's true. His is slightly different. They're nuances, but"
01:02:29,620;01:02:37,140;"I'm like, yeah, and the storyline has just made funnier because like, yeah, supposedly his wife got in all this other stuff. I'm like, yadda yadda yadda."
01:02:37,140;01:02:44,100;"The point is, is that it's funny, I think, because of the situation, how ridiculous it is."
01:02:44,100;01:02:48,980;"It's not funny because of how damaging it is to your body and that you're cheating, but"
01:02:48,980;01:02:51,700;"I feel like they're not"
01:02:51,700;01:02:55,220;"To my knowledge killing anybody or whatever. So I think it's a little"
01:02:55,220;01:03:00,660;"harsh to condemn a person again kick him out of the league do whatever but"
01:03:00,660;01:03:06,180;"You know, I can understand reasons why people might or might not want to do that"
01:03:06,180;01:03:12,180;"Yeah, I agree on that note Barry bonds"
01:03:12,180;01:03:19,780;"Exactly but David Ortiz pass right down the fucker good around here"
01:03:19,780;01:03:29,500;"Yeah, I do. I think going back to just like the look and feel of these like players,"
01:03:29,500;01:03:35,300;"these that I thought the other great thing about old school football were the face masks."
01:03:35,300;01:03:36,940;"Oh, yeah."
01:03:36,940;01:03:39,380;"They were just so badass."
01:03:39,380;01:03:46,220;"I don't know what it was about him, but like like the tie law with the two like bars kind of like on the outside of his"
01:03:46,260;01:03:52,740;"I line mm-hmm like coming down like the vertical ones for some reason like every time I create my player mad"
01:03:52,740;01:03:56,500;"I'm like I have to tie a lot helmet. Oh, yeah, it's all about the accessories, man"
01:03:56,500;01:04:01,700;"Oh, man, that was so great or even the like the ones the running backs where it's like a regular one"
01:04:01,700;01:04:09,980;"But like the the middle bar had like two bars across it. Yeah a little dip across like in between the eyes at the top. Yep. Oh my god"
01:04:10,820;01:04:16,540;"What does a Tint admirers were cool? Oh, yeah, but or Linda Marais who's a kicker who had like"
01:04:16,540;01:04:23,260;"The the top of the bar kind of like went up a bit so it looked like he was raising his eyebrows in a quizzical fashion"
01:04:23,260;01:04:25,300;"But hey"
01:04:25,300;01:04:29,860;"You always like Z-words you put the helmet on all of a sudden like immediately confused right?"
01:04:29,860;01:04:32,020;"May's is a great tactic"
01:04:32,020;01:04:38,780;"Especially since you never missed a field goal right? He was just yes. He has underselling people"
01:04:38,780;01:04:53,980;"So speaking of football, I'm kind of talking about the first half and it was decent. But"
01:04:53,980;01:04:58,440;"then the second half happened. And I think it was a third quarter, especially where the"
01:04:58,440;01:05:06,620;"wheels fell off because it was 1710 right at the end of the half. Peter got the ball back,"
01:05:06,620;01:05:08,980;"to start the second half."
01:05:08,980;01:05:13,220;"- Well, can I talk about how the second half ended?"
01:05:13,220;01:05:14,700;"I believe this is how it ended."
01:05:14,700;01:05:16,180;"- The second half ended?"
01:05:16,180;01:05:18,260;"- I mean, the first half, second quarter."
01:05:18,260;01:05:19,540;"Sorry. - Okay, go ahead."
01:05:19,540;01:05:21,700;"- I'm trying to read and talk at the same time."
01:05:21,700;01:05:22,940;"Not all of us can do that."
01:05:22,940;01:05:24,780;"I'm sorry. - That's how I work."
01:05:24,780;01:05:25,940;"- Not very well, apparently."
01:05:25,940;01:05:27,820;"Thank you for calling me out."
01:05:27,820;01:05:29,740;"- You are literate fuck."
01:05:29,740;01:05:32,180;"All right, so tell me about the end of the first half,"
01:05:32,180;01:05:33,080;"the second quarter."
01:05:35,180;01:05:37,980;"And I'm hoping that this is because the notes"
01:05:37,980;01:05:40,260;"are in chronological order, not because I ran out of space."
01:05:40,260;01:05:45,260;"But I recall a Hill Mary attempt"
01:05:45,260;01:05:49,180;"right before the half time."
01:05:49,180;01:05:54,100;"And Brady was chucking it, right?"
01:05:54,100;01:05:57,880;"So the commentators were sort of talking"
01:05:57,880;01:06:01,540;"about like, what's the strategy or whatever?"
01:06:01,540;01:06:04,100;"And, you know, he drops back to pass"
01:06:04,100;01:06:06,060;"and Jason Taylor sacks braiding,"
01:06:06,060;01:06:09,420;"which I wrote down, you don't often see that."
01:06:09,420;01:06:11,140;"It's sort of like a pre-vent defense"
01:06:11,140;01:06:12,340;"with a couple of rushers"
01:06:12,340;01:06:14,460;"and, you know, the quarterbacks running around."
01:06:14,460;01:06:15,820;"So Jason Taylor lit them up"
01:06:15,820;01:06:19,420;"and that was before what you were going to talk about"
01:06:19,420;01:06:21,180;"in the second half of the game"
01:06:21,180;01:06:22,460;"where things just started to fall off."
01:06:22,460;01:06:25,060;"So I feel like that was an indication"
01:06:25,060;01:06:26,900;"of how things would continue."
01:06:26,900;01:06:27,740;"- Yeah, it was the,"
01:06:27,740;01:06:31,300;"what are they called in literary terms"
01:06:31,300;01:06:36,020;"You show the gun in the first scene and you have to use it for shadowing and it's something like that"
01:06:36,020;01:06:42,340;"Yeah, it was like a smoking gun rule or something like that. Oh, I don't know you are very good at English"
01:06:42,340;01:06:46,620;"You tell me apparently well apparently not that good because I don't remember his call but yeah"
01:06:46,620;01:06:51,820;"And then we can make you sound smarter. Yeah, that's a lot of editing"
01:06:51,820;01:06:53,740;"Okay"
01:06:53,740;01:06:56,340;"But yeah, I think foreshadowing is a good way of putting where"
01:06:56,340;01:07:00,200;"The defensive pressure is"
01:07:00,200;01:07:05,200;"is an issue for this offense right now."
01:07:05,200;01:07:10,460;"And I always remember that against Miami,"
01:07:10,460;01:07:12,400;"and it wasn't always just Jason Taylor,"
01:07:12,400;01:07:15,180;"it was just like Miami defenses in general,"
01:07:15,180;01:07:19,840;"but I think even like more than that,"
01:07:19,840;01:07:22,600;"it was AFC East defenses in general,"
01:07:22,600;01:07:25,200;"because I think when a new coach would come in"
01:07:25,200;01:07:27,720;"or a new GM or whatever,"
01:07:27,720;01:07:37,720;"come into the AFC East, the immediate like first step is to build a team that beats Patriots and"
01:07:37,720;01:07:43,480;"the number one way of beating Patriots stopping Tom Brady, number one way of stopping Tom Brady"
01:07:43,480;01:07:51,080;"is being able to get to him without blitzing. So over the years, I know there's been a bunch"
01:07:51,080;01:07:55,720;"of arguments about how none of these AFC East teams have ever had a decent quarterback,"
01:07:55,720;01:08:00,900;"But I think because they always started building with that defensive line and they were always like monsters"
01:08:00,900;01:08:05,860;"Where like the Jets always had great defensive linemen dolphins bills always had these?"
01:08:05,860;01:08:08,520;"like absolute like"
01:08:08,520;01:08:15,000;"Just guys it would wreak havoc so I actually looked it up to find out"
01:08:15,000;01:08:17,700;"Like who had the most sex"
01:08:17,700;01:08:22,480;"Against the Patriots mm-hmm. So I'll give you the top 10"
01:08:23,560;01:08:26,460;"Actually, I want to see if you can guess number one"
01:08:26,460;01:08:30,120;"Number one lineman"
01:08:30,120;01:08:34,660;"Yes, they're all linemen"
01:08:34,660;01:08:38,460;"And they're NFL wide or"
01:08:38,460;01:08:46,380;"Division NFL one and if I lied I mean the top one has to be within the division because just by frequency alone"
01:08:46,380;01:08:53,400;"I would think hmm, so I would say I have no idea man. I mean Johnny Abraham comes to mind"
01:08:53,400;01:09:04,440;"He's on the list. Okay. Number nine with six sacks. I mean, we could go Jason Taylor"
01:09:04,440;01:09:12,480;"on that one. Number two. Time for second with 12. Wow. No kidding. I would say, I mean,"
01:09:12,480;01:09:18,200;"that's it. I'm out. Technically it is Aaron Schobel. Remember him?"
01:09:18,200;01:09:22,640;"in the bills. Oh yeah, I remember I would not have just that one. That's number one."
01:09:22,640;01:09:27,400;"Yes. I think we had 14 sacks, although two of them were half sacks. So"
01:09:27,400;01:09:33,240;"or someone ever brought this attention because I believe so. I think I would"
01:09:33,240;01:09:36,360;"probably make him happy. Yeah. So it's Aaron Chowal."
01:09:36,360;01:09:41,240;"Aaron Chowal. I guarantee he knows that stat."
01:09:41,240;01:09:42,040;"Okay."
01:09:42,040;01:09:45,640;"The Jason Taylor, Joey Porter."
01:09:45,640;01:09:51,340;"Um, who Joey Porter Steelers obviously also played for the dolphins."
01:09:51,340;01:09:53,680;"Uh, Sean Ellis for the jet."
01:09:53,680;01:09:54,300;"Oh yeah."
01:09:54,300;01:09:54,700;"Yeah."
01:09:54,700;01:09:56,860;"And then camera wake for the dolphins."
01:09:56,860;01:09:57,460;"So yep."
01:09:57,460;01:10:01,780;"I feel that of the top five, three of those were dolphins defensive lineman."
01:10:01,780;01:10:03,100;"Nice."
01:10:03,100;01:10:05,940;"Uh, then it gets a bit interesting."
01:10:05,940;01:10:08,780;"Uh, number six, Von Miller for the Broncos."
01:10:08,780;01:10:09,880;"I can see that."
01:10:09,880;01:10:11,380;"Is that, is he a lineman though?"
01:10:11,380;01:10:13,900;"He's like a linebacker hybrid."
01:10:13,900;01:10:17,700;"Well, I mean, they're all this is just who has the most sex."
01:10:17,700;01:10:18,600;"Oh, gotcha."
01:10:18,600;01:10:18,900;"All right."
01:10:18,900;01:10:19,800;"But yeah, I think."
01:10:19,800;01:10:22,900;"And then it's Kyle Williams for the bills."
01:10:22,900;01:10:23,700;"Yep."
01:10:23,700;01:10:26,500;"Surprisingly, Robert Mass is from the Colts, of course."
01:10:26,500;01:10:31,200;"John Abraham from the Jets, like we said, and then at number 10."
01:10:31,200;01:10:33,400;"Justin Tuck from the Giants."
01:10:33,400;01:10:36,600;"Oh, there we go."
01:10:36,600;01:10:38,800;"But I mean, is that including playoffs?"
01:10:38,800;01:10:41,800;"I believe so, yes."
01:10:42,400;01:10:44,320;"That makes sense, unfortunately."
01:10:44,320;01:10:44,620;"Yeah."
01:10:44,620;01:10:51,640;"So of the 631 sacks that have happened since 2001,"
01:10:51,640;01:10:53,880;"and against, you know, Patriots quarterback in general,"
01:10:53,880;01:10:57,600;"they're not all Tom Brady, but the vast majority of them are."
01:10:57,600;01:10:59,640;"A third of those have come from the ASCE."
01:10:59,640;01:11:00,540;"So like a--"
01:11:00,540;01:11:02,540;"Dang, what a long percentage."
01:11:02,540;01:11:05,440;"Man, so how many was that 600 and something?"
01:11:05,440;01:11:06,880;"631."
01:11:06,880;01:11:07,680;"And I've been--"
01:11:07,680;01:11:09,280;"Don't they say that on each tackle or a sack"
01:11:09,280;01:11:12,200;"is like your car accident?"
01:11:12,200;01:11:19,320;"Yeah, I think so. So Brady has potentially been in 600 plus car accidents. Yeah, give or take."
01:11:19,320;01:11:24,360;"That's fucked up. And of those 214 who are from the AFC East."
01:11:24,360;01:11:37,960;"Yeah. So I mean, this is this is why I think when you think about Patriots divisional games,"
01:11:39,320;01:11:49,160;"You think of like these slug-fests and you know Brady having to overcome some sort of stout defense too. That's custom built to"
01:11:49,160;01:11:58,600;"prevent him doing what he wants to do comfortably. It's almost even more impressive what he's been able to do against. I mean"
01:11:58,600;01:12:02,760;"there's a lot of sacks by the bills but"
01:12:04,520;01:12:05,720;"Not very many wins."
01:12:05,720;01:12:07,020;"I think they've beaten them."
01:12:07,020;01:12:11,360;"Well, I mean, it's also the dink and dung thing that people love to praise"
01:12:11,360;01:12:13,200;"and bash, you know, at the same time."
01:12:13,200;01:12:16,360;"But I mean, how do you adapt to something like that?"
01:12:16,360;01:12:19,800;"You figure out a different way to do it, which is not necessarily west coast."
01:12:19,800;01:12:21,640;"I mean, they do their own thing, but you take."
01:12:21,640;01:12:22,520;"Well, you would think that."
01:12:22,520;01:12:27,440;"Yeah, that getting that pressure with your defensive line without blitzing"
01:12:27,440;01:12:32,960;"and then being able to play coverage behind that should prevent any sort of"
01:12:32,960;01:12:33,920;"thinking and dunking."
01:12:34,080;01:12:36,320;"Well, that's where the running backs come in, of course."
01:12:36,320;01:12:40,680;"And I think like with Shane Vereen and all those guys, Kevin Falk, like"
01:12:40,680;01:12:47,120;"James, I think, yeah, Bill Belichick sort of figured that out, I think pretty early on."
01:12:47,120;01:12:51,840;"So I mean, it kind of makes sense because you have the tight ends in the middle,"
01:12:51,840;01:12:56,240;"the, the wide receivers in the back, but you know, you still have these like"
01:12:56,240;01:12:57,800;"monsters kind of like rushing."
01:12:57,800;01:13:01,280;"So you have the running back either blocking or going out for like a short"
01:13:01,280;01:13:03,520;"two yarder that could potentially be a 20 yarder."
01:13:03,520;01:13:04,200;"Right."
01:13:04,200;01:13:07,800;"So it makes sense based on like how you're saying that."
01:13:07,800;01:13:08,320;"Yeah."
01:13:08,320;01:13:13,160;"It shows you the value of Gronkowski as well in this offense where he can either"
01:13:13,160;01:13:15,680;"stay in and block or go wrong."
01:13:15,680;01:13:16,680;"Be a weapon downfield."
01:13:16,680;01:13:16,880;"Yeah."
01:13:16,880;01:13:22,160;"If, uh, if they would only legalize CBD oil, he would be back."
01:13:22,160;01:13:23,920;"That's all it takes."
01:13:23,920;01:13:24,360;"Right."
01:13:24,360;01:13:26,800;"So yeah."
01:13:26,800;01:13:29,320;"Um, so we've kind of been alluding to this too."
01:13:29,360;01:13:32,800;"with talk about Brady getting sacked and pressure and stuff."
01:13:32,800;01:13:41,280;"And the actual turning point in this game, I think, was the fumble, which"
01:13:41,280;01:13:48,240;"is not something I've seen before, because I mean, do you want to talk through this?"
01:13:48,240;01:13:49,000;"Or do you want me to do it?"
01:13:49,000;01:13:53,600;"Because I think the play by play of this is fantastic."
01:13:53,600;01:13:56,520;"Because what happens is Brady is he's actually under center."
01:13:56,520;01:13:58,520;"It's not like it was a shotgun snap or anything, but he"
01:13:58,520;01:14:04,000;"mishandles the snap and the ball falls like to his right onto the ground."
01:14:04,000;01:14:07,720;"And the right guard is going back and pass protection."
01:14:07,720;01:14:12,840;"So he takes a step back and the ball falls perfectly where the,"
01:14:12,840;01:14:17,560;"I think it's the left foot of the right guard back heals the football."
01:14:17,560;01:14:21,600;"Like to a point where I think some soccer players would be jealous."
01:14:21,600;01:14:24,040;"Just the way that he hit it, how square it was."
01:14:24,640;01:14:28,560;"He caught its dead on and kicked it 10 yards directly backwards."
01:14:28,560;01:14:34,800;"And the only people that knew what was happening was Tom Brady and any dolphins."
01:14:34,800;01:14:36,440;"Passrushers."
01:14:36,440;01:14:40,720;"And these passrushers had a seven yard head start on Brady getting up the field"
01:14:40,720;01:14:44,200;"because Brady still hadn't seen what happened to this bug."
01:14:44,200;01:14:45,000;"It kicked backwards."
01:14:45,000;01:14:45,440;"Yeah."
01:14:45,440;01:14:46,280;"The Jason Taylor."
01:14:46,280;01:14:51,080;"It isn't until it picked it up at the one uncontested and took two steps and was"
01:14:51,080;01:14:52,320;"then celebrating it pushed down."
01:14:54,280;01:15:03,280;"And so it went from being a seven point game being down 1710 to being down 2410."
01:15:03,280;01:15:07,280;"And it all went down from there."
01:15:07,280;01:15:13,640;"Yes, because now you're a one dimensional offense and you are starting a quarterback"
01:15:13,640;01:15:19,080;"in his second game against the pass rushing phenom of this dolphins defensive line."
01:15:19,080;01:15:21,640;"And the results were pretty predictable."
01:15:23,600;01:15:29,400;"Well, I mean Brady, what I liked about the last minute"
01:15:29,400;01:15:32,520;"or so of the game was that me and ounces were kind of like"
01:15:32,520;01:15:34,560;"touching on this where Belichick wasn't giving up."
01:15:34,560;01:15:38,440;"He was forcing Brady to kind of run his, you know, no huddle"
01:15:38,440;01:15:42,600;"or two minute offense or whatever, the hurry up, you know."
01:15:42,600;01:15:43,880;"I don't know if they were huddling or not,"
01:15:43,880;01:15:48,200;"but I know there was like some sort of what's the word,"
01:15:48,200;01:15:51,200;"desperation to get him a touchdown."
01:15:51,200;01:15:53,120;"And, you know, they didn't get that."
01:15:53,120;01:15:56,720;"It actually ended up with Brady fumbling again to end the game."
01:15:56,720;01:15:57,680;"Yeah, getting stripped."
01:15:57,680;01:16:01,920;"Yeah, to end the game, which was literally right after the analysis had"
01:16:01,920;01:16:06,920;"praised Belichick for keeping Brady in to run this and get him the experience."
01:16:06,920;01:16:08,040;"And that happened."
01:16:08,040;01:16:10,000;"And I thought, well, there's some experience for you."
01:16:10,000;01:16:10,880;"You will."
01:16:10,880;01:16:11,640;"That's right."
01:16:11,640;01:16:14,920;"But then also on that drive, I thought it was interesting because they ran a fake"
01:16:14,920;01:16:18,640;"snap to Brady that went to Kevin Fox and they're direct snap."
01:16:18,640;01:16:18,840;"Yeah."
01:16:18,840;01:16:20,840;"That was the first one that you'd seen"
01:16:20,840;01:16:23,680;"Yeah play because"
01:16:23,680;01:16:27,180;"Pretends to like you know be chasing it and like the sky"
01:16:27,180;01:16:31,640;"But the ball goes over his head and he jumps right flails for it and Kevin Fox two steps to his right"
01:16:31,640;01:16:36,380;"So I thought that was an interesting wrinkle more of the Belichick stuff where he's like, you know"
01:16:36,380;01:16:41,540;"There's 30 seconds left in the game most people waste this I would throw something out there so people like know that that's there"
01:16:41,540;01:16:46,820;"Yeah, let's just try and see if it works right in game situations and it did it got"
01:16:47,520;01:16:52,160;"Now seven or eight yards, I think, which, you know, time didn't really mean anything, but you knew it worked"
01:16:52,160;01:16:58,340;"And they like actually wrote a whole blog post about that play in particular where they kind of"
01:16:58,340;01:17:01,240;"Brought it back a bunch of different times"
01:17:01,240;01:17:08,560;"Oftentimes like when they actually really needed a score for like two point conversions and things like that. Mm-hmm. Yeah"
01:17:08,560;01:17:11,280;"in the"
01:17:11,280;01:17:14,760;"The playoff game against the the charges they shouldn't have won"
01:17:15,480;01:17:18,280;"Right, but then I think it was an 0-7"
01:17:18,280;01:17:21,080;"they did"
01:17:21,080;01:17:22,240;"the"
01:17:22,240;01:17:27,880;"Like an offshoot of it where they actually snapped the ball of Brady and caught it and pretended to jump"
01:17:27,880;01:17:31,840;"Over his hand and Kevin Falk pretended to take I don't even think it's good"
01:17:31,840;01:17:37,900;"I mean, I mean Kevin Falk at that point but pretended to do the direct snap and it was almost like a"
01:17:37,900;01:17:41,440;"Statue of Liberty play"
01:17:41,440;01:17:45,760;"Where Brady still had the ball with his back turned to the defense for like a good second"
01:17:45,760;01:17:50,420;"He pulled it out turned around and threw a touchdown to I believe it was well for the time"
01:17:50,420;01:17:54,320;"They kind of like they continued to iterate over it"
01:17:54,320;01:17:58,540;"But you even saw it as recently as the Falcon Super Bowl"
01:17:58,540;01:18:01,680;"But did that was that on a two-point conversion as well?"
01:18:01,680;01:18:08,740;"Didn't that come back is either a short touchdown or a two-point conversion. I can't remember. I think it was a two-point conversion"
01:18:09,400;01:18:15,560;"Well, and then I also feel like on on top of that their other go to now is sort of that like little push pass or like"
01:18:15,560;01:18:20,680;"Shovel pass that like bringing us to like whoever's bringing across stuff between those two plays"
01:18:20,680;01:18:22,680;"I think I've seen those two the most"
01:18:22,680;01:18:30,440;"Yeah, that almost like the real fast screenplay which is the other play they did for the two-point conversion in the Falcon Super Bowl"
01:18:30,440;01:18:33,400;"Where they throw it to like"
01:18:33,400;01:18:35,720;"Either Amen Dola or Edelman"
01:18:36,360;01:18:39,920;"Like out of the bunch right it's immediate snap and chuck it to him"
01:18:39,920;01:18:44,240;"Then the two guys in front of him blocking. He was like dives through those two right"
01:18:44,240;01:18:52,560;"Yeah, but overall I mean I wrote down Brady's numbers he was 12 for 24 so it's 50%"
01:18:52,560;01:18:55,160;"86 yards passing two fumbles"
01:18:55,160;01:19:00,600;"And you know we laugh at the sports writers because they're both four seconds, you know"
01:19:00,600;01:19:05,880;"But four sacks forty seven yards rushing by Antoine Smith everyone pretty much crapped on this one"
01:19:05,880;01:19:06,880;"It was awesome."
01:19:06,880;01:19:13,980;"But, I mean, if Bletso was like ready to come back the next week, I think there would"
01:19:13,980;01:19:18,440;"be some sort of like thought process going there on like which way to go."
01:19:18,440;01:19:20,680;"But, yeah, because there was a little bit more time."
01:19:20,680;01:19:25,320;"And I think now, especially nowadays, man, you get a backup and he has a performance"
01:19:25,320;01:19:26,320;"like that."
01:19:26,320;01:19:27,840;"I think he's pretty much done."
01:19:27,840;01:19:29,320;"So you're kind of toast."
01:19:29,320;01:19:30,320;"Yeah."
01:19:30,320;01:19:35,320;"So I think it was the perfect storm for Brady to kind of lick his wounds."
01:19:35,320;01:19:39,600;"You know, after the game, he responded pretty well, you know, still very confident talking"
01:19:39,600;01:19:41,080;"about practicing and all that stuff."
01:19:41,080;01:19:45,040;"Yeah, yeah, about, yeah, who they interview."
01:19:45,040;01:19:48,360;"I think it was a lawyer, Malloy that they were interviewing."
01:19:48,360;01:19:52,040;"He's talking about how Brady come to him, that practice on Wednesday."
01:19:52,040;01:19:58,120;"And they're like, dude, like practice, like we're doing terribly in practice, but I'm"
01:19:58,120;01:19:59,120;"the backup."
01:19:59,120;01:20:01,400;"So I don't like have the ability to like call this out."
01:20:01,400;01:20:04,560;"So I'm coming to you as the captain to like call this out"
01:20:04,560;01:20:05,720;"that we're practicing like shit."
01:20:05,720;01:20:08,720;"So you can get us to get our shit together."
01:20:08,720;01:20:10,040;"- That's how you do it."
01:20:10,040;01:20:10,880;"- Yeah."
01:20:10,880;01:20:12,800;"- You delegate when necessary."
01:20:12,800;01:20:13,640;"- Yeah, but I have to say,"
01:20:13,640;01:20:16,720;"this is probably the only game of football that I can recall"
01:20:16,720;01:20:19,160;"where neither quarterback threw for 100 yards."
01:20:19,160;01:20:22,840;"- Yeah, I mean, it was pretty."
01:20:22,840;01:20:23,920;"- Really bad."
01:20:23,920;01:20:26,320;"- Pretty rough to watch, I gotta admit, but."
01:20:26,320;01:20:27,920;"- Yeah, it went quickly though."
01:20:28,920;01:20:31,360;"I guess, I mean, I was kind of, you know,"
01:20:31,360;01:20:33,760;"I had my eye on the fast forward button a couple of times,"
01:20:33,760;01:20:38,000;"but, but, you know, we're here bringing it to anyone"
01:20:38,000;01:20:40,180;"who is listening so that they can hear our bullshit,"
01:20:40,180;01:20:42,180;"but not necessarily watch this disaster."
01:20:42,180;01:20:44,520;"- Yeah."
01:20:44,520;01:20:45,840;"- But one thing we have, go ahead."
01:20:45,840;01:20:47,960;"- This would be a skip."
01:20:47,960;01:20:48,800;"- Yes."
01:20:48,800;01:20:50,080;"- If you find one. - I would definitely"
01:20:50,080;01:20:51,680;"not watch this one."
01:20:51,680;01:20:53,800;"But there are certain takeaways that are pretty good,"
01:20:53,800;01:20:55,800;"but one thing we haven't talked about,"
01:20:55,800;01:20:57,200;"that we've talked about every other time,"
01:20:57,200;01:20:58,240;"we're the announcers."
01:20:58,240;01:21:01,760;"And for me, a part of the fun of looking back at these games"
01:21:01,760;01:21:04,640;"is sort of what's being said, because I mean,"
01:21:04,640;01:21:07,720;"you just see how society sort of changes"
01:21:07,720;01:21:10,640;"and things evolve from like what people would consider"
01:21:10,640;01:21:13,160;"acceptable and what they understand"
01:21:13,160;01:21:14,680;"to not be acceptable now."
01:21:14,680;01:21:18,920;"But, you know, I have a bunch of stuff written down"
01:21:18,920;01:21:21,840;"from what it was Gus Johnson and Brent Jones again."
01:21:21,840;01:21:22,680;"- Yep."
01:21:22,680;01:21:24,380;"- And I don't mind them."
01:21:24,380;01:21:27,280;"- Me neither, but Brent Jones is like,"
01:21:27,280;01:21:34,920;"I think he wants to be if he knew like how Tony Romo would be I think he wants to be that because I think"
01:21:34,920;01:21:41,440;"Tony Romo's fantastic. He's like real and you know, he's honest with his opinions. He's funny"
01:21:41,440;01:21:47,380;"He's excited to be watching the game. He's excited. Whatever game it is. Yeah, he's got the players, you know"
01:21:47,380;01:21:52,520;"side of things, but he's also a goofball, right? So Brett Jones is a goofball"
01:21:52,520;01:21:56,540;"But I think he's like highly uncomfortable in like"
01:21:56,540;01:22:02,280;"Funny ways now looking back. I don't think this guy would have a job for two weeks today"
01:22:02,280;01:22:09,740;"Not doing this. I don't know what he's doing now. Maybe you can still be doing this, but probably I can't imagine though"
01:22:09,740;01:22:10,740;"So"
01:22:10,740;01:22:12,740;"Making you say this"
01:22:12,740;01:22:14,980;"Alright, man, first of all"
01:22:14,980;01:22:20,780;"The first thing I got to this game which is like basic basic like comedy"
01:22:20,780;01:22:23,140;"I feel like and this guy is shitting himself, but"
01:22:23,140;01:22:26,420;"they were talking about how"
01:22:26,420;01:22:29,500;"you know, it was hot on the field. This is right to start off the game and"
01:22:29,500;01:22:34,300;"Then that they showed they cut away to a cheerleader and the cheerleader"
01:22:34,300;01:22:40,060;"You know, it's got this bit where she's holding a thermometer and it's like 120 degrees, whatever and"
01:22:40,060;01:22:48,460;"Let's see it wasn't even that funny, but what do you see so Brent Jones? He goes, you know, that is hot down there"
01:22:50,060;01:22:53,640;"And he's like shit himself and I'm sitting there go fuck"
01:22:53,640;01:23:01,220;"Gus he goes. Oh, well. I have enough savvy to not comment on that. Yeah, I mean bread goes"
01:23:01,220;01:23:07,900;"I think my career is over so even maybe you knew that that was like inappropriate the guys like falling over himself for literally two more"
01:23:07,900;01:23:08,900;"plays"
01:23:08,900;01:23:14,380;"It wasn't good, but yeah, he he was cracking stuff up over that one. He did I"
01:23:14,380;01:23:18,380;"It was hilarious another comment"
01:23:18,380;01:23:23,980;"Brent Jones goes, ""Mark Edwards, great hands for a full back."""
01:23:23,980;01:23:26,180;"And then Gus goes, ""Really?"""
01:23:26,180;01:23:28,380;"And I was like, ""What does that mean?"""
01:23:28,380;01:23:31,380;"So fuck kind of like a response to that."
01:23:31,380;01:23:39,880;"And then another person, oh favorite of mine, Gus, we were out on the practice field on"
01:23:39,880;01:23:40,880;"Friday."
01:23:40,880;01:23:44,580;"It was so hot, we were standing around and almost fell out."
01:23:44,580;01:23:47,380;"And then Brent Jones goes, ""Don't say we."""
01:23:47,380;01:23:49,380;"What the fuck man?"
01:23:49,380;01:23:50,380;"And now..."
01:23:50,380;01:23:52,380;"Fucking hard, now."
01:23:52,380;01:23:53,380;"This also brings me to..."
01:23:53,380;01:23:55,380;"Okay, what, what, the best of them?"
01:23:55,380;01:24:00,380;"He said some shit that I assume are football terms, but I'm not as savvy as you are Andy."
01:24:00,380;01:24:05,380;"So I wrote these things down and maybe you can enlighten me on what the hell he was talking about."
01:24:05,380;01:24:08,380;"And I assume that they're football related."
01:24:08,380;01:24:12,380;"The first one is ""Hirk and Jerk""."
01:24:12,380;01:24:21,380;"I don't know if that's a real football term."
01:24:21,380;01:24:23,380;"I thought that was more like a weightlifting term."
01:24:23,380;01:24:27,380;"So they have like a clean jerk and something like that."
01:24:27,380;01:24:28,380;"And a harken jerk?"
01:24:28,380;01:24:29,380;"What is a harken jerk?"
01:24:29,380;01:24:30,380;"I don't know."
01:24:30,380;01:24:31,380;"It doesn't."
01:24:31,380;01:24:32,380;"It sounds painful, doesn't it?"
01:24:32,380;01:24:35,380;"It sounds like a technique for sure."
01:24:35,380;01:24:36,380;"Yeah."
01:24:36,380;01:24:38,380;"He made me that one up."
01:24:38,380;01:24:44,220;"Okay, so you're gonna go not not football on this one. Yeah. All right, so the next one"
01:24:44,220;01:24:47,380;"delivering the wood"
01:24:47,380;01:24:48,340;"Oh"
01:24:48,340;01:24:54,220;"That's definitely thing. Yeah, what is that? That means laying a big hit laying a big hit so it doesn't"
01:24:54,220;01:25:00,220;"It means it's a football thing. Yeah, okay, it's like hitting somebody in the face of two by four"
01:25:00,220;01:25:05,420;"That's sort of delivering the wood not like got you not like showing up with a pickup truck full of firewood"
01:25:05,420;01:25:06,980;"It's not that sort of delivery."
01:25:06,980;01:25:09,100;"Right. Just like two by four across the head."
01:25:09,100;01:25:09,700;"Got it."
01:25:09,700;01:25:10,500;"Yeah."
01:25:10,500;01:25:13,540;"Looking for gaping holes."
01:25:13,540;01:25:19,820;"So that's a good segue."
01:25:19,820;01:25:22,220;"The one that I wrote down."
01:25:22,220;01:25:24,460;"OK, I still want to know, but go on."
01:25:24,460;01:25:29,300;"Brent Jones, these holes are tight with the Patriots."
01:25:29,300;01:25:31,260;"You have to keep pounding at them."
01:25:31,260;01:25:33,300;"Say he's good with it."
01:25:33,300;01:25:38,020;"What is that? What is the gaping holes pounding the holes mean for those that don't know, including myself?"
01:25:38,020;01:25:46,920;"I believe that's talking about the running game where you want the offensive lineman to open up holes."
01:25:46,920;01:25:47,900;"Okay."
01:25:47,900;01:25:50,460;"So the defensive line for the gaping holes."
01:25:50,460;01:25:53,580;"So yeah, a bigger hole is better in this game,"
01:25:53,580;01:25:56,940;"whereas if the holes are tight, like they are with the Patriots,"
01:25:56,940;01:25:58,980;"you have to keep pounding them so that they become gaping."
01:25:58,980;01:26:01,060;"Gotcha. Okay. So that's a football term."
01:26:01,060;01:26:01,980;"Yes."
01:26:02,300;01:26:06,180;"Okay, and then, so then there was,"
01:26:06,180;01:26:08,400;"take your crack or give it away."
01:26:08,400;01:26:13,660;"- Do we have any context to this side?"
01:26:13,660;01:26:17,260;"- It was like, you know, you're driving,"
01:26:17,260;01:26:19,340;"let's say it's fourth down, you know,"
01:26:19,340;01:26:21,380;"you're trying to toss it up"
01:26:21,380;01:26:24,780;"and you take your crack or give it away, he said."
01:26:24,780;01:26:26,620;"- Oh, interesting."
01:26:26,620;01:26:31,620;"I think that might just be a Freudian slip of the tongue."
01:26:31,620;01:26:34,740;"tongue and Brent Jones is actually cocaine addict."
01:26:34,740;01:26:35,420;"Okay."
01:26:35,420;01:26:36,780;"So not football related."
01:26:36,780;01:26:37,940;"Yeah, I don't think so."
01:26:37,940;01:26:42,620;"And then my last one that I've written down here, the little man in the canoe."
01:26:42,620;01:26:46,740;"That's a football or not football football."
01:26:46,740;01:26:48,820;"Yeah."
01:26:48,820;01:26:50,780;"I don't know what it is, but it, oh, you know, it is."
01:26:50,780;01:26:51,700;"That makes a chin strap."
01:26:51,700;01:26:52,940;"It's your chin being in the chimp."
01:26:52,940;01:26:55,100;"I don't think he said it in the game."
01:26:55,100;01:26:55,780;"I'm just curious."
01:26:55,780;01:26:58,460;"I had one more."
01:26:58,460;01:27:01,140;"Oh, that he actually said."
01:27:01,500;01:27:05,860;"Yeah. And it's not sexual."
01:27:05,860;01:27:08,940;"Okay. Well, wait, what you didn't tell me what that meant."
01:27:08,940;01:27:10,820;"It's true. I thought you said it was a chin strap."
01:27:10,820;01:27:12,900;"No, it is. You know what I mean."
01:27:12,900;01:27:16,500;"Okay. It's it's it's the"
01:27:16,500;01:27:19,860;"I put down football, the lower hemisphere of chin strap."
01:27:19,860;01:27:21,900;"Yeah. So football. Yeah."
01:27:21,900;01:27:24,060;"Vaguely football related. Okay. Moving on."
01:27:24,060;01:27:29,940;"So when Belichick was flipping his"
01:27:29,940;01:27:34,500;"shit about the headsets. Yeah, they showed him and he was"
01:27:34,500;01:27:38,580;"livid and Brent goes, you never see Bill Belichick this"
01:27:38,580;01:27:43,300;"animated as he's yelling at the referees. And I thought,"
01:27:43,300;01:27:48,420;"really, I feel like he's always that animated. But is that"
01:27:48,420;01:27:50,980;"revisionist that we looking back? I mean, he's always pretty much"
01:27:50,980;01:27:55,380;"like that. But yeah, I don't think that's a secret. And this"
01:27:55,380;01:27:57,460;"wasn't like his first season with the team."
01:27:57,460;01:28:26,460;"that's the only thing that's going to be the first time that Brent Jones was paying attention. Yeah, well, obviously, it wasn't paying attention to all the other stuff. There were a lot of cheerleaders and a lot of gaping holes. So, a was this graph. You're talking about the line, I'm talking about your thing. I'm talking about your thing. We're running back. Yeah, those two different things. Dude, I'm just trying to figure this out, man, because I mean, Brent Jones is telling me football shit and he's supposedly a dude who played."
01:28:26,460;01:28:30,020;"a dude who played, right? So I'm just trying to learn."
01:28:30,020;01:28:31,940;"What do you know? That's all I'm saying. I'm not."
01:28:31,940;01:28:36,820;"You're not you're not savvy with the lingo, huh? No. All right."
01:28:36,820;01:28:40,560;"Okay. You know, if I if I have to write these things down every"
01:28:40,560;01:28:43,200;"week until we get to the bottom of this, I will. Okay."
01:28:43,200;01:28:45,740;"That I think that's a great segment. We will do that."
01:28:45,740;01:28:49,100;"We'll call it football or not football."
01:28:49,100;01:28:56,440;"All right. Oh, the one other thing I want to talk about"
01:28:56,440;01:29:03,400;"that I had on my list was the Terry Glenn saga. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I made note of that. Yeah,"
01:29:03,400;01:29:08,280;"because it wasn't in any of the papers or anything. So maybe it was like early in the week or something."
01:29:08,280;01:29:16,440;"But the commentators talked about how next week Terry Glenn was coming back and what had led to"
01:29:16,440;01:29:23,160;"that because apparently he had been suspended for games for violating the league substance abuse"
01:29:23,160;01:29:28,960;"policy. I don't know what what substance he abused. Do you remember?"
01:29:28,960;01:29:33,780;"I don't know. I mean, obviously, yet is off the field issues. So my"
01:29:33,780;01:29:37,800;"mind tends to think that but yeah, I didn't think it was like a PD"
01:29:37,800;01:29:43,600;"thing. No, I don't think so. But then they talked about how"
01:29:43,600;01:29:47,040;"Belichick, because he was suspended. So he didn't show up to"
01:29:47,040;01:29:51,440;"like OTAs or camp or something like that. And so Belichick just"
01:29:51,440;01:29:54,840;"said fuck it, you suspended for the year. Yeah. Which is such a"
01:29:54,840;01:29:59,140;"fucking Belichick move. It is. But I guess like they didn't say"
01:29:59,140;01:30:02,120;"why I'd be like, Oh, but so that got reversed. So I'm assuming"
01:30:02,120;01:30:06,680;"that he so that he appealed. Yeah. I don't know why I mean, I'm"
01:30:06,680;01:30:08,920;"assuming it's because it's not a rule like you can't just"
01:30:08,920;01:30:11,840;"suspend some money for I mean, you didn't show up to practice"
01:30:11,840;01:30:15,920;"and stuff though. So I know there is. So I mean, who did they"
01:30:15,920;01:30:20,200;"who did he appeal that to the league or the NFL PA or to"
01:30:20,240;01:30:22,160;"Bel check himself up, but whatever."
01:30:22,160;01:30:24,480;"- It's gonna happen if LPA took it to the league."
01:30:24,480;01:30:25,840;"- Yeah, it got reversed."
01:30:25,840;01:30:30,280;"So, but they were talking about how Emmaturek,"
01:30:30,280;01:30:32,160;"Len was saying he did nothing wrong"
01:30:32,160;01:30:34,680;"and like he should take accountability and all the stuff."
01:30:34,680;01:30:38,480;"- Which also led me to think about"
01:30:38,480;01:30:40,280;"the whole Antonio Brown thing."
01:30:40,280;01:30:42,720;"- That's a good point."
01:30:42,720;01:30:43,800;"- Yeah, 'cause I mean--"
01:30:43,800;01:30:45,000;"- We came together."
01:30:45,000;01:30:48,760;"- Yeah, it's obviously now with Twitter and everything,"
01:30:48,760;01:30:53,000;"Things are just blown out a little bit more, but, you know,"
01:30:53,000;01:30:57,920;"he has been shooting himself in the foot a few times and then not"
01:30:57,920;01:30:59,800;"necessarily acknowledging that it's his fault."
01:30:59,800;01:31:01,680;"And maybe it isn't."
01:31:01,680;01:31:02,560;"Maybe he did stuff."
01:31:02,560;01:31:06,280;"Maybe he didn't, you know, currently at the time that we're talking about this,"
01:31:06,280;01:31:06,880;"he's accused."
01:31:06,880;01:31:08,640;"I don't know what he didn't, what he didn't do."
01:31:08,640;01:31:12,720;"So I'm not going to condemn him for something that I don't know, but"
01:31:12,720;01:31:16,800;"I will say he's not making the smartest choices."
01:31:17,280;01:31:20,840;"And it's kind of got a like Terry Lenfield."
01:31:20,840;01:31:23,640;"Like if Terry Len had Twitter, this might be similar."
01:31:23,640;01:31:24,840;"Yeah, it might be very similar."
01:31:24,840;01:31:26,520;"I agree with that."
01:31:26,520;01:31:30,040;"And today, I don't know when this is going to be out."
01:31:30,040;01:31:31,600;"So it's probably going to be dated information."
01:31:31,600;01:31:33,320;"But still, it's an astounded podcast."
01:31:33,320;01:31:35,920;"So you guys can hear about what was happening in this year."
01:31:35,920;01:31:40,120;"But yeah, Antonio Brown, today."
01:31:40,120;01:31:45,120;"So he's supposed to meet with the NFL investigators"
01:31:45,120;01:31:50,120;"about his accused sexual harassment case situation."
01:31:50,120;01:31:55,080;"And he immediately after getting,"
01:31:55,080;01:31:56,880;"so he's been sort of campaigning"
01:31:56,880;01:31:58,320;"to get this interview done with."
01:31:58,320;01:32:01,360;"And then like literally within a couple of hours"
01:32:01,360;01:32:03,960;"of that information, being released"
01:32:03,960;01:32:06,240;"that he was supposed to meet with them next week,"
01:32:06,240;01:32:07,720;"he went on a Twitter tirade,"
01:32:07,720;01:32:10,080;"kind of telling the NFL to go fuck themselves"
01:32:10,080;01:32:11,600;"and he doesn't need anybody."
01:32:11,600;01:32:13,080;"- Yeah, Tom racist."
01:32:13,080;01:32:14,800;"- racist, yup."
01:32:14,800;01:32:18,920;"told all the fantasy football players to go fuck themselves."
01:32:18,920;01:32:24,880;"And then within two hours of that, there was a very well written"
01:32:24,880;01:32:28,560;"statement where he basically acknowledged that he's just frustrated."
01:32:28,560;01:32:31,920;"He still wants to play. And I really. Yeah. Yeah."
01:32:31,920;01:32:34,920;"I didn't see that. I would definitely check that out right now."
01:32:34,920;01:32:40,240;"But it's a, you know, chances are it could be written by Drew"
01:32:40,240;01:32:41,480;"Rosenhouse. I don't know."
01:32:41,480;01:32:43,120;"The writing styles are a little bit different."
01:32:43,120;01:32:49,620;"But it basically said that he's frustrated that he wants to get back to the NFL and he wants to do it ASAP."
01:32:49,620;01:32:54,820;"So I'm just very frustrated right now with these false allegations and slanting to my name."
01:32:54,820;01:32:56,320;"I love football and I miss it."
01:32:56,320;01:32:58,620;"I just want to play in a very emotional about that."
01:32:58,620;01:33:01,620;"I'm determined to make my way back to the NFL ASAP."
01:33:01,620;01:33:04,120;"So clearly that sounds like Antonio."
01:33:04,120;01:33:09,320;"As opposed to his previous one that was like fuck this and fuck that."
01:33:09,320;01:33:15,240;"I'm out making money on my body on my mind. No way, you know, some shit like that and now he's like I"
01:33:15,240;01:33:17,760;"Just miss you guys"
01:33:17,760;01:33:24,840;"Yo, I felt go fuck yourself. Yeah, he's I love his personality. I mean, I do think he's an entertaining guy"
01:33:24,840;01:33:28,560;"I love like watching him. I think he's engaging but"
01:33:28,560;01:33:31,520;"definitely"
01:33:31,520;01:33:36,720;"Does something seems off? I don't know if he's doing this for brands or because he's kind of going through things"
01:33:37,120;01:33:43,400;"But yeah, definitely seems like and hopefully it doesn't end like the Terry one thing and like you get this thing situated"
01:33:43,400;01:33:44,440;"And I don't know"
01:33:44,440;01:33:51,640;"I don't know if it's like, you know, people like to throw around CTE and you know, obviously those perfect hits when he was on the Steelers"
01:33:51,640;01:33:55,720;"Didn't help anything probably but I"
01:33:55,720;01:34:01,200;"Don't know why he's doing this. It's sad to see because I would have loved to watch Antonio play"
01:34:02,720;01:34:07,280;"But Terry Glenn was also a guy that I kind of love to watch"
01:34:07,280;01:34:10,600;"I mean I watched him, you know, I went to a couple of games when he was on the team"
01:34:10,600;01:34:14,600;"I liked watching it, but he was inconsistent. He did have all his troubles. So"
01:34:14,600;01:34:18,560;"But when he was on the field he was he was great to watch"
01:34:18,560;01:34:27,360;"Yeah, it does feel very similar now that you say that it's a shame. So it is hopefully he'll get it sorted out"
01:34:27,360;01:34:31,360;"And"
01:34:31,360;01:34:35,280;"I also wrote down and this is a pretty big one for me to admit"
01:34:35,280;01:34:41,120;"But I have the first time I've been disappointed in Lee Johnson this season so far"
01:34:41,120;01:34:47,760;"I know I'm a pretty big fan. I love what he's done. Love what he's"
01:34:47,760;01:34:50,760;"You know he had been doing throughout his career"
01:34:50,760;01:34:55,760;"Bigly Johnson fan, but this one just did not pass the sniff test"
01:34:55,760;01:35:01,360;"I mean he averaged 40 almost 45 yards a punt. He just wasn't that consistent"
01:35:01,360;01:35:05,080;"Yeah, but like what about that like 20 yarder like what's up with that?"
01:35:05,080;01:35:13,160;"Yeah, he had five puns two of them were like one was 28 yards one was like just over 30 and the other ones were like"
01:35:13,160;01:35:15,160;"bombs like 50 60 yards"
01:35:15,160;01:35:17,040;"so"
01:35:17,040;01:35:19,040;"You never knew what you're gonna get with them"
01:35:19,040;01:35:20,960;"That's right"
01:35:20,960;01:35:25,860;"But yeah, so I mean yeah between that and the Troy Brown fumbled punt it was"
01:35:25,860;01:35:32,200;"It was tough it was tough day for all all three phases of Belichick would say"
01:35:32,200;01:35:40,840;"That's right, but yeah, so let's let's do best and worse. We'll wrap this up. I mean we have tackled so much"
01:35:40,840;01:35:45,560;"You want me to go first? Yeah, do it all right so"
01:35:48,920;01:35:51,880;"My best was finding out that"
01:35:51,880;01:35:57,520;"Jason Taylor married Zach Thomas's sister. Oh, yeah, that was interesting"
01:35:57,520;01:36:03,760;"See how close they are that's right. Yeah, that's why they were crazy do all that team camaraderie right there"
01:36:03,760;01:36:11,300;"And good for Zach, you know, like that's just being okay with that taking him in into his family"
01:36:11,300;01:36:15,600;"What are you gonna say noted Jason Taylor? I mean that'd be a hell of a"
01:36:17,240;01:36:18,440;"I disagree."
01:36:18,440;01:36:19,440;"Taylor."
01:36:19,440;01:36:21,280;"Well, he's beautiful."
01:36:21,280;01:36:27,480;"There's a lot of people that I would marry before Jason Taylor, but he's great."
01:36:27,480;01:36:28,480;"A lot."
01:36:28,480;01:36:31,240;"I think he's probably out there and I'm not judging you, dude."
01:36:31,240;01:36:35,240;"In the NFL, in the NFL, oh, in the NFL, yeah, Hollywood doesn't care."
01:36:35,240;01:36:36,240;"You've lived in Hollywood."
01:36:36,240;01:36:37,240;"That doesn't count."
01:36:37,240;01:36:41,240;"Well, I do know somebody who is married to an NFL player and he's really good."
01:36:41,240;01:36:47,200;"I won't say who, but I probably would marry him because he's probably the most at home."
01:36:47,200;01:36:48,200;"I'm Brady."
01:36:48,200;01:36:49,200;"Nope."
01:36:49,200;01:36:50,200;"All right."
01:36:50,200;01:36:51,200;"See?"
01:36:51,200;01:36:53,200;"Guess it'll leave us a message."
01:36:53,200;01:36:54,200;"Jimmy G."
01:36:54,200;01:36:58,200;"You know, this is, um, this is what they call a teaser."
01:36:58,200;01:37:00,640;"I learned that from you."
01:37:00,640;01:37:01,640;"All right."
01:37:01,640;01:37:02,640;"Yeah."
01:37:02,640;01:37:04,200;"So next week, find out who Mike knows."
01:37:04,200;01:37:06,200;"Sleep with in the end of the row."
01:37:06,200;01:37:07,200;"Right."
01:37:07,200;01:37:08,200;"Great segment."
01:37:08,200;01:37:09,200;"Hell yeah."
01:37:09,200;01:37:16,200;"So my worst, um, it was the touch shot at the end of the half."
01:37:16,200;01:37:20,720;"Not so much because of the touchdown itself, although that was bad because it was"
01:37:20,720;01:37:25,720;"Teddy Bruceky and coverage 20 yards downfield, which looked exactly like you"
01:37:25,720;01:37:31,800;"would expect it to with Captain Necroal trying to cover a tight end. But also the"
01:37:31,800;01:37:35,240;"fact that when they scored the touchdown, the song that came on immediately after"
01:37:35,240;01:37:40,800;"was ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Oh yeah, you know I saw myself singing with that."
01:37:40,800;01:37:49,200;"song, which I don't think I've actually sung that song since college when I would buy a 30 rack of Red Dog."
01:37:49,200;01:37:54,720;"It's like a bring it to house parties and sing that song as I would pull it out of my backpack."
01:37:54,720;01:37:59,040;"I was singing this and then my girlfriend came into the room."
01:37:59,040;01:38:02,960;"She was like, it's a little confused. I think we talked about it for a while."
01:38:02,960;01:38:07,600;"And I defended my choice because it was the party song of that time."
01:38:08,160;01:38:10,760;"Oh yeah, of the early 2000s."
01:38:10,760;01:38:14,600;"Yeah, and one there it is, which I still stand by that one."
01:38:14,600;01:38:17,360;"Yeah, I feel like that was a little earlier."
01:38:17,360;01:38:18,360;"OK, whatever."
01:38:18,360;01:38:24,520;"So those are my best or worse."
01:38:24,520;01:38:30,920;"All right, my best was Jay Fiedler."
01:38:30,920;01:38:33,600;"There's less than 30 seconds left."
01:38:33,600;01:38:37,240;"He's in the pads red zone and he's running the no huddle."
01:38:37,240;01:38:40,160;"And he's he scrambles."
01:38:40,160;01:38:41,800;"He gets plowed, right?"
01:38:41,800;01:38:42,460;"Yeah."
01:38:42,460;01:38:46,080;"And he's he's rushing everybody to line."
01:38:46,080;01:38:47,000;"I mean, you can get a first down."
01:38:47,000;01:38:48,400;"Brent Jones is harping on this."
01:38:48,400;01:38:51,000;"It's like time is running off the cloth."
01:38:51,000;01:38:54,640;"It's like second or third down or whatever it is."
01:38:54,640;01:38:58,040;"And they still have chances and he's running everybody."
01:38:58,040;01:38:59,160;"I think he was concussed, man."
01:38:59,160;01:39:01,760;"I don't think he knew where he was, but he got lit up."
01:39:01,760;01:39:02,600;"Yeah."
01:39:02,600;01:39:05,940;"And he like rushed everybody to the line and then he calls a quarterback"
01:39:05,940;01:39:12,320;"So he gets the first down and then bread Jones is like, oh man, even though he took a pop like you self-aware"
01:39:12,320;01:39:16,180;"He knew that he knew the first down. Meanwhile another like 20 seconds goes off the block"
01:39:16,180;01:39:23,240;"I'm like, I've never seen it a like yeah, and that cubic sneaky got kind of like stood up and he got lit up again"
01:39:23,240;01:39:30,560;"Yeah, but and then that bread Jones was like just loving it. He's like that's what you gotta do"
01:39:30,560;01:39:34,140;"You gotta do that why you have two downs to kind of go for something"
01:39:34,940;01:39:39,100;"Spike it take a time out you had a couple left. Yeah, but he was"
01:39:39,100;01:39:43,520;"Yeah, he was it was like that stick of commercial. I was like, oh, do you know where you are?"
01:39:43,520;01:39:48,740;"I'm like, yes, it's third and two and 20 seconds left like oh, who are you? I'm Batman"
01:39:48,740;01:39:51,480;"Like he definitely thought he was Batman on that play"
01:39:51,480;01:39:55,080;"I"
01:39:55,080;01:40:00,640;"Would say that that was an accurate assessment and probably what the commercial was based on I don't know which came first"
01:40:02,960;01:40:04,880;"and Jay Fielder definitely came first."
01:40:04,880;01:40:06,640;"- Yeah, then there you go."
01:40:06,640;01:40:09,100;"- That's what Brett Jones would say anyway."
01:40:09,100;01:40:11,280;"- Yeah, and then the worst, I would say is Brett Jones."
01:40:11,280;01:40:15,720;"I mean, he was a source of inspiration for me in terms of--"
01:40:15,720;01:40:17,480;"- And also confusion from the sound of it."
01:40:17,480;01:40:20,120;"- Right, yeah, very confused, but I'm also entertained"
01:40:20,120;01:40:21,640;"because the game itself sucks."
01:40:21,640;01:40:25,960;"But I would also say one of the worst moments"
01:40:25,960;01:40:28,280;"was when the commentator said that Tom Brady,"
01:40:28,280;01:40:32,680;"won a national championship at Michigan in '97 as a backup."
01:40:32,680;01:40:35,240;"and he had won a championship after that."
01:40:35,240;01:40:38,400;"So it made me sad because it was the one true time"
01:40:38,400;01:40:40,200;"that Tom Brady was a loser."
01:40:40,200;01:40:45,960;"- All right, that's pretty good."
01:40:45,960;01:40:46,880;"I'll give you that."
01:40:46,880;01:40:47,960;"Nicely done. - Yeah, thank you."
01:40:47,960;01:40:49,080;"- Thank you. - Nicely done."
01:40:49,080;01:40:51,360;"- Great."
01:40:51,360;01:40:53,960;"All right, well, I think,"
01:40:53,960;01:40:56,120;"what do we have to look forward to next week?"
01:40:56,120;01:40:59,560;"- Would you tell me Andy?"
01:41:00,440;01:41:03,880;"The next week, oh, it's the Chargers coming to the town."
01:41:03,880;01:41:06,240;"- Nice."
01:41:06,240;01:41:09,640;"- Three and one Chargers who were undefeated"
01:41:09,640;01:41:12,160;"until losing to the Browns this week"
01:41:12,160;01:41:13,600;"with Doug Flute at the helm,"
01:41:13,600;01:41:17,240;"because this was when the Bills had to make a choice"
01:41:17,240;01:41:20,280;"between Doug Flute and Rob Johnson,"
01:41:20,280;01:41:21,720;"'cause that was in the Boston Globe too,"
01:41:21,720;01:41:22,920;"and they went with Rob Johnson,"
01:41:22,920;01:41:26,240;"who led them promptly to an 0-3 start"
01:41:26,240;01:41:28,440;"and then got hurt and threw a bunch of interceptions"
01:41:28,440;01:41:36,200;"fumbles and Doug Floody was leading the charges to a three-in-one start and"
01:41:36,200;01:41:41,440;"they obviously made the wrong decision there which is pretty typical bills."
01:41:41,440;01:41:48,160;"So we have a look forward to that. I'm coming to town riding high leading the"
01:41:48,160;01:41:50,160;"league even though they were 1-15 the other four."
01:41:50,160;01:41:52,920;"But not filing the substance abuse policy obviously."
01:41:52,920;01:41:58,680;"Oh absolutely not. That didn't come to later with what the hell is his name the"
01:41:58,680;01:42:06,360;"the sack dance guy. Oh Sean Merriman. Yes. I was talking about the recreational"
01:42:06,360;01:42:12,080;"variety but that too. Oh yeah we'll get to that then. We'll save that for next"
01:42:12,080;01:42:16,800;"week. It's a teaser we call that in the biz mic. I already used that man we can't"
01:42:16,800;01:42:22,040;"use that every episode. It's called a callback mic. All right fine. It's what we"
01:42:22,040;01:42:23,440;"call in the biz a callback."
01:42:23,440;01:42:26,960;"Well, if anybody's still listening, you just learn something."
01:42:26,960;01:42:27,800;"That's right."
01:42:27,800;01:42:33,240;"So not a lot of high hopes going into this next game, but we'll see how it goes."
01:42:33,240;01:42:35,080;"Will Tom Brady ever throw a touchdown?"
01:42:35,080;01:42:40,920;"Will the Patriots win another game or will they stay one win on the season forever?"
01:42:40,920;01:42:43,680;"My guess is yes."
01:42:43,680;01:42:47,680;"Tune in next week for all that and more."
01:42:47,680;01:42:48,960;"And maybe some other."
01:42:48,960;01:42:51,640;"So much more between so many guests."
01:42:51,640;01:42:53,640;"So many guests"
01:42:53,640;01:42:58,380;"John no don't go on"
01:42:58,380;01:43:01,880;"We're gonna call it right there"
01:43:01,880;01:43:05,640;"All right until next week we will see you then"
01:43:05,640;01:43:09,600;"Later"

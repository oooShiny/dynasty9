00:08,200;00:12,400;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,400;00:14,240;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,240;00:15,480;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,480;00:16,480;"Go right ahead."
00:16,480;00:22,880;"I am not your mother."
00:22,880;00:26,120;"Welcome back to the Patre's Dimesy Pod Test."
00:26,120;00:28,200;"It's been a while."

00:54,440;00:56,200;"Steve, Greg, how are you boys doing?"
00:57,440;01:03,280;"good. It's good to be back. I want to put out there for the record that I watched this game"
01:03,280;01:11,440;"over a month ago, five weeks ago. And my two brothers so selfishly decided to have babies"
01:11,440;01:16,400;"hence our delay. This is not on me. I just want to make sure all of our listeners understand that."
01:16,400;01:23,280;"If it was up to me, I could record any time. Except for that week you were in Greece getting"
01:23,280;01:27,360;"engaged, but other than yeah, yeah, yeah, well, the grease, then the bachelor party,"
01:27,360;01:32,240;"then the three weddings back to back to back, then trip to Texas to Austin,"
01:32,240;01:34,840;"then back to Arizona, it was a lot."
01:34,840;01:39,240;"So all I'm hearing is I was too popular to do this podcast."
01:39,240;01:42,280;"Yes. Yes. Well, you guys are just cleaning up shit."

01:47,760;01:56,440;"And that you can hear is our podcast, ""Yes"" for today."
01:56,440;01:57,760;"- Correct."
01:57,760;02:01,440;"- This is my buddy Kieran Stowe hanging out."
02:01,440;02:02,480;"- Say what's up, baby."

02:07,800;02:09,000;"Entertain us."
02:09,000;02:11,040;"- Andy, can you just slap him around a bit"
02:11,040;02:12,320;"and make him make some noise?"
02:12,320;02:13,760;"- Yeah, give him a little shake or something."
02:13,760;02:16,160;"- Yeah, yeah, shake the baby."
02:16,160;02:19,320;"- Speaking of babies, or Greg."
02:19,320;02:21,520;"- It's a delicate line, isn't it Andy?"
02:21,520;02:22,620;"Shakin' a baby?"
02:22,620;02:24,440;"You know?"
02:24,440;02:26,880;"- Because where's the line between bouncing and shaking, right?"
02:26,880;02:31,280;"- Yeah, 'cause bouncing, they love shaking."
02:31,280;02:34,360;"They're gonna be maldeveloped for the rest of their lives."
02:34,360;02:35,360;"- Right, yeah."
02:35,360;02:37,200;"Although playing with fire."
02:37,200;02:39,320;"- Yeah, with brown children, I think,"
02:40,400;02:44,960;"with the children of us, they're probably gonna have trouble in their life anyway."
02:44,960;02:46,400;"I speak for yourself."
02:46,400;02:48,400;"[laughter]"
02:48,400;02:51,400;"You're the dumbest out of the world."
02:51,400;02:52,400;"I don't know."
02:52,400;02:54,400;"Yeah, I know."
02:54,400;02:56,400;"My son's already a G."
02:56,400;02:57,400;"A Gizzy?"
02:57,400;02:58,400;"Oh, yeah."
02:58,400;02:59,400;"[laughter]"
02:59,400;03:02,400;"He pooped his pants at 30,000 feet today."
03:02,400;03:04,400;"Good for him."
03:04,400;03:05,400;"That's my boy."
03:05,400;03:07,400;"It's like he's flying."
03:07,400;03:09,400;"Yeah, Kelly went home."
03:09,400;03:13,960;"to see some family pooped his pants on the plane."
03:13,960;03:15,960;"-Of course. -As you do, right?"
03:15,960;03:18,400;"-I mean, isn't that why you-- -Check that off the list, you know?"
03:18,400;03:20,400;"[laughter]"
03:20,400;03:22,920;"-It's not the mile high club, what is it?"
03:22,920;03:23,880;"-Yeah."
03:23,880;03:29,560;"-Pile high club? Oh, shit."
03:29,560;03:32,520;"-Pile in that high. -That's diaper full club?"
03:32,520;03:33,960;"[laughter]"
03:33,960;03:36,960;"-Whoa, whoops. -Brown bombers."
03:36,960;03:38,800;"-Brown bombers."
03:38,800;03:42,240;"Yeah, it's funny. I was I was watching the"
03:42,240;03:46,320;"Thursday night football game last night the"
03:46,320;03:53,160;"Falcons the three and four Falcons versus the two and five panthers"
03:53,160;04:02,880;"Quality football is here. I watch that too. Yes riveting. Yeah, it was unbelievably bad game like almost unbearable to watch and they were saying that"
04:02,880;04:05,760;"Is it Jake Matthews"
04:05,760;04:08,720;"The tackle"
04:08,720;04:17,080;"as Falcons. Yeah, he had his kid Thursday morning and then drove to from Atlanta to Carolina"
04:17,080;04:25,560;"to play in a Thursday night football game against a two and five team. I'm like, dude,"
04:25,560;04:34,040;"get your priority straight. Who gives a shit? That's why like football is like, is poison"
04:34,040;04:38,680;"these these dudes minds, you know, oh, for sure. I can't imagine."
04:38,680;04:42,120;"Yeah, that's the American worker psyche."
04:42,120;04:46,760;"No, isn't it? Oh, yeah. No, I would never do that in a million years."
04:46,760;04:48,200;"Let's go."
04:48,200;04:50,360;"You go. It was his first child, too."
04:50,360;04:53,040;"Yeah, that's I was like, maybe it's his fourth."
04:53,040;04:54,200;"No, it's his first one."
04:54,200;04:57,200;"It's not like an Antonio cremaar."
04:57,200;04:58,520;"He's like, yeah, I'll have another."
04:58,520;05:00,760;"It's from the crime already makes sense. Yeah."
05:00,760;05:02,120;"Plenty more where that came from."
05:02,120;05:03,360;"Exactly. Yeah."
05:03,360;05:06,800;"And it gave up like eight Harries and three sacks. He played awful."
05:06,800;05:11,920;"Like what is he going to tell his kid? He's like, I'm sorry. I left your mom."
05:11,920;05:17,120;"It hurt like most needy moment to give up three sacks."
05:17,120;05:21,920;"There's a football game in the rain against the two and five Panthers."
05:21,920;05:26,720;"No one's making a podcast about that game. That's for goddamn sure."
05:26,720;05:27,680;"Yeah, for sure."
05:29,200;05:33,400;"So yeah, I watched this Super Bowl after and quite a palate cleanser."
05:33,400;05:35,320;"I was just going to use that word."
05:35,320;05:35,560;"Yeah."
05:35,560;05:39,160;"This is a this is a it was quality football."
05:39,160;05:42,560;"I think kind of up until the end to that last drive, but we'll get to that."
05:42,560;05:47,520;"Can we can we all just stop and appreciate that me and Greg watch this whole game"
05:47,520;05:49,040;"and Andy did did you watch?"
05:49,040;05:50,120;"Did you watch the whole game?"
05:50,120;05:50,600;"Yep."
05:50,600;05:52,360;"Can't play on the baby either."
05:52,360;05:53,200;"Whole thing."
05:53,200;05:53,520;"Yes."
05:53,520;05:54,160;"I've watched me."
05:54,160;05:57,800;"Oh, I have a baby and even that's right."
05:57,800;05:57,920;"Yeah."
05:57,920;06:02,400;"than you. Yep. Congratulations, Greg. Andy off air said that baby doesn't even"
06:02,400;06:07,840;"cry. Like it doesn't. It's your excuse then. He also doesn't sleep. It's fine. It's all"
06:07,840;06:13,240;"good. Isn't that right, bud? I guess you're just not as dedicated as podcast as me and"
06:13,240;06:17,680;"Greg. I'm just I'm just about to bother. That's all this. Yeah. You need to get more Jake"
06:17,680;06:27,080;"Matthews. Jake Matthews are to watch the twice. Steve, Steve didn't even watch it. He doesn't"
06:27,080;06:31,600;"have a kid. I told you I watched this literally five weeks ago."
06:31,600;06:35,320;"Yeah. And I watched the three games of glory. And I watched the football"
06:35,320;06:37,160;"life. Did you mull over this game?"
06:37,160;06:41,720;"I actually watched it before the past played the Eagles in that most recent"
06:41,720;06:46,240;"Super Bowl. I actually watched it live back in 2004. So you're not going to"
06:46,240;06:49,160;"suck. I think we all did that Andy. Yeah, come on."
06:49,160;06:54,080;"I don't believe it. Prove it. All right. So then tell me about these"
06:54,080;06:57,920;"Eagles, Steve. Mr. Oh, I didn't, I didn't actually watch the game. I know."
06:57,920;07:07,440;"So these Eagles were a wagon coming in. They started the season 13 and one."
07:07,440;07:08,800;"Their only loss was."
07:08,800;07:13,080;"Pittsburgh Steelers right right before we lost to them. Yeah. Correct."
07:13,080;07:16,520;"Yeah. So the Pittsburgh, the only the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the two undefeated"
07:16,520;07:19,600;"teams back to back. I think we talked about it earlier in the season, like,"
07:19,600;07:23,800;"I'm talking about that Steelers game. Um, but yeah, so that was their only"
07:23,800;07:28,960;"lost in the season until they rested their starters for the last two weeks of the season,"
07:28,960;07:35,640;"which seems like that's last one week. You see all the time at the last two weeks, especially"
07:35,640;07:38,380;"because you're going to have the buy going in, right? Because you're the top C in the"
07:38,380;07:43,480;"NFC to rest your guys two weeks in a row plus well, technically three weeks in rows."
07:43,480;07:45,480;"They haven't played football for almost a month."
07:45,480;07:50,640;"And when did do get injured? I don't know that you got injured early December. Yeah, I think"
07:50,640;07:54,820;"was what nine weeks explain the injury, right? Yeah. So yeah,"
07:54,820;07:56,200;"go ahead. Yeah."
07:56,200;08:01,320;"He owes coming. He broke his leg in a in a December game, seven"
08:01,320;08:05,920;"weeks prior to this Super Bowl. And the doctors have advised him"
08:05,920;08:09,920;"that he is not like cleared to play. Yeah, he broke his ankle."
08:09,920;08:15,240;"Yeah. It was a horse collar tackle by Roy Williams, I believe."
08:15,240;08:16,840;"Yes."
08:17,040;08:24,280;"some bees. Really? I don't know. Yeah. Why do you know that?"
08:24,280;08:25,080;"For"
08:25,080;08:32,440;"Yeah. So this is his first and you can see him limping around after"
08:32,440;08:35,880;"like every play. Oh, he was a he was a baller in this game. Oh,"
08:35,880;08:40,080;"yeah. If he had if they had won, this is definitely like the"
08:40,080;08:44,120;"to game, you know, yeah, and he gets MVP and etc, etc. We have"
08:44,120;08:46,120;"14 targets"
08:46,120;08:50,440;"And I catch his 122 yards right on one leg pretty hot like yeah"
08:50,440;08:53,840;"Yeah, did you have a bunch of like screws in his ankle and stuff too? I?"
08:53,840;08:59,600;"Think it screws in a like a metal plate or something like that in there. It's not like that. We're just fucking bananas"
08:59,600;09:02,880;"Yeah, but to put it in context, right? This is the"
09:02,880;09:07,520;"This is their they've made their fourth straight NFC conference game"
09:07,520;09:13,040;"So they had lost their three straight times with Andy Reed. Yep. Yep. So they're a pretty good team"
09:13,040;09:19,760;"team led by their defense. I think their defense is like top five in the league for"
09:19,760;09:23,480;"like four years running. They had three pro bowlers in their secondary."
09:23,480;09:31,620;"Yeah. And then they added to in the offseason, Jermaine curse and Jeremiah Trotter starts"
09:31,620;09:38,320;"season 13 and one roll through the playoffs. So they're a wagon, but also I don't know"
09:38,320;09:42,320;"that people trust this e-mail to get over that hump, right?"
09:42,320;09:46,640;"So it's almost like the 90s bills going to force people to grow, not winning any of them."
09:46,640;09:47,440;"Right."
09:47,440;09:48,560;"And people are still..."
09:48,560;09:54,720;"The Andy Reid thing is still an open-ended question at this point in his career of"
09:54,720;09:56,000;"is he actually a good coach."
09:56,000;09:56,880;"Yeah, right."
09:56,880;10:01,280;"It's a big game for that. I mean, but I think they also kind of like just got over that hump"
10:01,280;10:05,200;"in the NFC Championship game and they were like, that off the gas a little bit maybe."
10:06,240;10:09,920;"Yeah, because I like, ah, whatever happens to people who care at least we didn't lose that fourth one in a row."
10:09,920;10:15,840;"Maybe, I mean, I don't know if that's how that works, but it's a possibility."
10:15,840;10:23,040;"The Patriots are seven point favorites. Right. So big. Yeah. But that's also considering their best"
10:23,040;10:28,480;"offensive weapon. People didn't expect to get much out of them. Right. So I think T.O. is healthy."
10:28,480;10:34,800;"That's probably more like four or five. Yeah. It's pretty meat. Yeah. Definitely a swing just based on that."
10:34,800;10:39,800;"But I would surprise it how good McNabb was this season."
10:39,800;10:45,220;"They mentioned in the broadcast that he threw 31 touchdowns"
10:45,220;10:47,700;"to only eight interceptions."
10:47,700;10:51,180;"And he was the first quarterback to throw 30 plus touchdowns"
10:51,180;10:53,500;"with less than 10 interceptions in the season,"
10:53,500;10:57,220;"which I feel like you see, it's like commonplace now."
10:57,220;10:59,180;"Like the 30 touchdowns, less than 10 interceptions."
10:59,180;11:00,900;"Like it's what Aaron Rodgers does every year."
11:00,900;11:02,280;"And Brady does every year."
11:03,260;11:07,420;"But he was the first quarterback to ever do that back in 2004."
11:07,420;11:08,340;"I'm sure you run."
11:08,340;11:10,580;"I feel like he was a running quarterback too back."
11:10,580;11:11,740;"Oh, he definitely will."
11:11,740;11:12,180;"Yeah."
11:12,180;11:12,580;"Yeah."
11:12,580;11:15,380;"He definitely had that threat and he kind of saw it a bit in this game"
11:15,380;11:19,820;"where he was able to escape pressure to a certain extent."
11:19,820;11:23,980;"And he didn't really take off of the ball."
11:23,980;11:28,540;"He would just kind of escape pressure just to buy his receivers more time."
11:28,540;11:32,060;"And you saw that kind of on some of the deep balls that happened because the"
11:32,060;11:36,820;"pages their game plan was just to bring pressure pretty much every play that was"
11:36,820;11:39,820;"going to be a pass play. And it works surprisingly well."
11:39,820;11:44,780;"But he's still got a case to the Russell Wilson's right where he's kind of a dork."
11:44,780;11:50,940;"That's a good analogy. Yeah. And he loves to just like throw that deep looping"
11:50,940;11:53,060;"ball. Hope there's somebody down there. Yeah."
11:53,060;11:55,300;"And you got the feeling his teammates probably don't like him."
11:55,300;11:59,380;"Yeah, there is that feeling, right? You know, unless he's winning."
11:59,380;12:01,260;"Yeah, if he's winning, they can't say anything."
12:01,260;12:07,620;"But like as soon as he got bad, everything came out of the woodwork and they're like,"
12:07,620;12:09,500;"this guy sucks."
12:09,500;12:12,500;"He's puking on the field in the Super Bowl, which we'll get to later."
12:12,500;12:17,460;"But I feel like he's hated on now, right?"
12:17,460;12:20,820;"Well, that's when the Redskins are like, Oh, yeah, we need this guy."
12:20,820;12:21,820;"Yes."
12:21,820;12:22,820;"Yeah."
12:22,820;12:23,820;"Yeah."
12:23,820;12:29,460;"Speaking of the red skin, who do you think the team's actually going to sell?"
12:29,460;12:32,340;"No, the Snyder hasn't way too much of an ego for that"
12:32,340;12:36,580;"But he's already come out and said he's gonna sell the team. They're looking in no he hasn't he is"
12:36,580;12:41,900;"Something some shit, but he might just sell part of it to marry some money to build a new stadium or something"
12:41,900;12:46,580;"Yeah"
12:46,580;12:55,140;"And us he's under investigation from us. Oh absolutely. Yeah sure the strong arm of the Patriots dynasty podcast"
12:55,140;12:58,580;"Yeah, the weight of the law behind us"
12:58,580;12:59,580;"That's right."
12:59,580;13:02,100;"You tell them, bud."
13:02,100;13:06,060;"You tell them."
13:06,060;13:14,500;"I think the other thing that I didn't realize in this game was how pertinent Brian Westbrook"
13:14,500;13:16,340;"was to their offense."
13:16,340;13:20,100;"Oh, I thought it was mostly based around the wide receiver didn't sound like it sounded"
13:20,100;13:25,920;"like it was terrible Owens, obviously, but Brian Westbrook was kind of that like they"
13:25,920;13:30,520;"We're talking about how similar to Marshall Falk on the Rams offense and how a lot of it ran through him"
13:30,520;13:35,000;"Both in the running game and they're in the passing game too, which makes sense"
13:35,000;13:39,240;"Yeah, I remember him being like that passing back, but I didn't realize he was kind of the central piece"
13:39,240;13:46,840;"This is his first pro bowl. It's third year. Yeah. Yeah, he's like a more talented Kevin Falk"
13:46,840;13:53,560;"Yes, oh, yeah, I was a lot less broken. Yeah, because he all he either turned punson kicks and you know"
13:53,560;13:55,320;"I bet he'll play defense too if you asked him."
13:55,320;13:58,360;"Yeah, very good player."
13:58,360;13:59,840;"Who else they got?"
13:59,840;14:02,000;"Lido Shepard was first team."
14:02,000;14:02,560;"All pro."
14:02,560;14:03,520;"I did not write."
14:03,520;14:04,360;"He was that good."
14:04,360;14:05,520;"Yeah, I don't think he was."
14:05,520;14:07,800;"I think they're kind of coasting on reputation."
14:07,800;14:09,160;"Like Dawkins was in that."
14:09,160;14:11,080;"He was in the pro baller, right?"
14:11,080;14:11,720;"Yeah."
14:11,720;14:12,560;"All pro."
14:12,560;14:15,720;"Sheldon Brown and Michael Lewis were their defensive backs."
14:15,720;14:17,720;"And it's like three of those guys were pro bowlers."
14:17,720;14:19,720;"He sounds like one."
14:19,720;14:20,240;"Yeah."
14:20,240;14:22,400;"I recognize Lewis, but I've ever showed him Brown."
14:22,720;14:23,360;"Yeah, I remember she'll."
14:23,360;14:25,360;"I remember Louis not brown."
14:25,360;14:29,320;"I remember a little shepherd chair, but I was never like scared of that guy."
14:29,320;14:33,280;"Good special teams, David acres."
14:33,280;14:35,600;"Yeah, they have pretty."
14:35,600;14:36,840;"Yeah."
14:36,840;14:40,640;"Tempro bowl is for all pros on this team."
14:40,640;14:42,040;"I was a"
14:42,040;14:43,960;"Oh, curse to"
14:43,960;14:45,080;"from these tightens."
14:45,080;14:45,760;"He was so good."
14:45,760;14:46,760;"The freak."
14:46,760;14:47,520;"Yeah."
14:47,520;14:50,960;"Then they had a freight train to right."
14:52,080;14:54,080;"Is that ready?"
14:54,080;14:55,180;"Fred X."
14:55,180;14:56,080;"Fred X."
14:56,080;14:56,440;"Sorry."
14:56,440;14:56,940;"Yes."
14:56,940;15:02,440;"Did he have a catch in this game?"
15:02,440;15:05,640;"We did get one catch in the fourth quarter, I believe."
15:05,640;15:06,640;"Pearl 11 yards."
15:06,640;15:07,440;"Yeah."
15:07,440;15:07,920;"Yeah."
15:07,920;15:09,400;"Four targets."
15:09,400;15:12,400;"Four targets, one catch up."
15:12,400;15:14,120;"Let's loop back on that one."
15:14,120;15:19,160;"Is there some fun quotes about Fred X?"
15:19,160;15:21,680;"I was from the Packers."
15:21,680;15:24,120;"Remember that guy?"
15:24,120;15:29,360;"Yeah, I think he might have been on the Packers team that beat"
15:29,360;15:32,400;"the Patriots back in the 90s, right?"
15:32,400;15:33,360;"Possibly."
15:33,360;15:36,080;"94."
15:36,080;15:36,840;"Yep."
15:36,840;15:40,160;"Through 2001 is on the Packers."
15:40,160;15:40,880;"So he was part of that."
15:40,880;15:41,920;"Yeah, he's a suitable ring."
15:41,920;15:42,600;"Yep."
15:42,600;15:43,320;"Meeting drew blood."
15:43,320;15:44,440;"So right."
15:44,440;15:47,240;"So this is really the Dorsey Levens revenge game."
15:47,240;15:47,520;"Yeah."
15:48,080;15:49,080;"a touristy like."
15:49,080;15:51,400;"Pages revenge against Dorsey."
15:51,400;15:54,400;"Definitely."
15:54,400;15:55,080;"Yeah."
15:55,080;15:58,480;"So I guess what other storylines do we have going into this game?"
15:58,480;16:02,080;"It's in Jacksonville, which people apparently hated."
16:02,080;16:03,080;"Really? Yeah."
16:03,080;16:03,480;"Yeah."
16:03,480;16:06,080;"I didn't hear good things about Jacksonville in general."
16:06,080;16:09,080;"Well, I mean, I think that kind of."
16:09,080;16:11,080;"But this was the first."
16:11,080;16:13,080;"No, I'm saying this was the first time they had a game, Jack."
16:13,080;16:13,680;"So, right?"
16:13,680;16:15,920;"Yeah, because the Jaguar started what?"
16:15,920;16:17,080;"99 or so."
16:17,080;16:18,080;"Yeah, something like that."
16:18,080;16:21,180;"So this is like five years off that stadium's built."
16:21,180;16:23,580;"Yeah, so it's a new stadium, but."
16:23,580;16:29,580;"Apparently it's in like a just a desert of entertainment."
16:29,580;16:31,480;"Well, have you been to Jacksonville?"
16:31,480;16:34,180;"No, I'd go to Jacksonville."
16:34,180;16:35,080;"Have you?"
16:35,080;16:36,780;"Yeah, a couple of times."
16:36,780;16:37,980;"And really?"
16:37,980;16:38,780;"Yeah."
16:38,780;16:40,480;"So is it right?"
16:40,480;16:43,280;"It's just like you don't realize."
16:43,280;16:46,780;"It sort of makes sense when you look at a map, but it's it's like"
16:46,780;16:47,780;"Rednecky there."
16:47,780;16:53,340;"Lot of hicks because it's like just on the border of Georgia, you know, in South"
16:53,340;16:53,860;"Carolina."
16:53,860;16:58,820;"It's like real outside of Jacksonville, Barry Rednecky."
16:58,820;16:59,580;"Okay."
16:59,580;17:01,900;"It's one of the most populated cities in America."
17:01,900;17:02,900;"Really?"
17:02,900;17:06,460;"Yeah, but like it's like drawn a gigantic circle."
17:06,460;17:06,820;"Yeah."
17:06,820;17:07,780;"I think that's why."
17:07,780;17:08,500;"Yeah."
17:08,500;17:09,500;"Same with Houston, right?"
17:09,500;17:13,780;"Houston's Houston's huge, huge, but like everyone is building out."
17:13,780;17:14,460;"Yeah."
17:14,460;17:14,660;"Yeah."
17:14,660;17:22,700;"apparently they had to bring in cruise ships for hotels really yeah because"
17:22,700;17:28,100;"they didn't have enough hotels there that's wild yeah yeah not a lot of Jacksonville"
17:28,100;17:33,740;"but it's fine it's not the worst city in Florida which is I know that's a low"
17:33,740;17:38,940;"benchmark but shout out to Clay County County as county of all the counties"
17:38,940;17:40,740;"right outside Jacksonville."
17:40,740;17:42,940;"- What's so county about it?"
17:42,940;17:44,820;"- Okay, this is just real hick."
17:44,820;17:48,920;"- A couple of country boys."
17:48,920;17:51,180;"(laughing)"
17:51,180;17:54,500;"You know, I love my country boys."
17:54,500;17:58,140;"Shout out to all country boy listeners, you know?"
17:58,140;17:58,980;"- Uh huh."
17:58,980;18:00,820;"- Or a huge and country boy."
18:00,820;18:03,500;"- Can you explain to me what a country boy listener is?"
18:03,500;18:06,060;"- I don't know, it's like pornography, Andy."
18:06,060;18:07,420;"You know one when you see it."
18:07,420;18:10,180;"(both laughing)"
18:10,180;18:14,140;"- I thought that was fine art,"
18:14,140;18:16,060;"but I guess it works for pornography too."
18:16,060;18:17,420;"- It works for a lot of things, Andy."
18:17,420;18:18,260;"- Yeah."
18:18,260;18:22,580;"- Other storylines, Paul McCartney, our mother,"
18:22,580;18:23,740;"is gonna be performing at night."
18:23,740;18:24,820;"- Mother's brother."
18:24,820;18:25,660;"- Yeah."
18:25,660;18:28,860;"For those that don't know,"
18:28,860;18:30,740;"our mom just looks like Paul McCartney."
18:30,740;18:31,820;"That's the joke."
18:31,820;18:32,820;"- You're the jerk, dude."
18:32,820;18:33,780;"- Not just our joke."
18:33,780;18:35,980;"She's told me that people and elevators have asked her"
18:35,980;18:37,580;"if she's related to Paul."
18:37,580;18:38,420;"- Yeah."
18:38,420;18:39,260;"(laughs)"
18:39,260;18:41,860;"- And like, she has short hair too."
18:41,860;18:42,700;"- Yep."
18:42,700;18:45,740;"- So like, and Paul McCartney's kind of feminine looking."
18:45,740;18:47,380;"- He's a little shaggy hair too."
18:47,380;18:48,220;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
18:48,220;18:49,300;"- Long hair."
18:49,300;18:50,180;"- Yeah."
18:50,180;18:51,500;"- They look very similar."
18:51,500;18:52,500;"- Honestly, it's crazy."
18:52,500;18:53,340;"- It's crazy."
18:53,340;18:54,180;"- It's crazy."
18:54,180;18:55,980;"- It's surprisingly perfect."
18:55,980;18:56,820;"(laughs)"
18:56,820;18:57,820;"- And she's British."
18:57,820;18:59,460;"- Yeah, British accent thing."
18:59,460;19:01,300;"- Totally good."
19:01,300;19:02,220;"You can't be offended by that."
19:02,220;19:03,460;"- Yeah, yeah."
19:03,460;19:07,460;"Yeah, but this was kind of the, uh, the overreaction to the previous Super Bowl,"
19:07,460;19:11,380;"right? That which was Justin Timberlake and nipple gate and all."
19:11,380;19:14,020;"No, right. Right. Yeah. They need something real safe. Yep."
19:14,020;19:16,460;"Yeah. So they went with a British mom."
19:16,460;19:19,140;"Perfect."
19:19,140;19:22,780;"In Jackson though. Yeah."
19:22,780;19:26,180;"With on the red next, they loved it. Yeah. All right."
19:26,180;19:28,380;"Any other storylines before we get into it?"
19:28,380;19:31,860;"I guess we can talk about the Freddie Mitchell thing because that was, uh,"
19:31,860;19:36,780;"Yeah. The one last story I can think of is that this is the last game with your offensive"
19:36,780;19:38,980;"coordinator defensive court. Oh, that's a good point. Yeah."
19:38,980;19:46,100;"And Charlie wants to roll me a Cornell as well. So at this point, their last ride as a trio."
19:46,100;19:50,540;"And everybody knew it too. I was like already Don deals on the outside of it. Oh, yeah."
19:50,540;19:55,140;"Yeah. They've already signed to go to Notre Dame and the Cleveland's that Romeo could"
19:55,140;19:56,860;"want to immediately. Yep."
19:56,860;19:58,780;"Neither of them worked out, right?"
19:58,780;20:04,380;"That's the theme right maybe like they're sent there to sabotage. I'm like Josh McDaniel's is doing with the Raiders"
20:04,380;20:12,560;"Raiders are so bad. I think they're punting on the season too. You think so? Well, yeah, they just put a bunch of guys on IR"
20:12,560;20:16,480;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, like they have no receiving core anymore"
20:16,480;20:24,600;"All right, so Freddy Mitchell Fred X himself made famous by"
20:26,400;20:32,060;"Fourth and 26 that's the only play. Oh, that was the only football thing I can think of"
20:32,060;20:37,280;"He was a first round pick though. He was real. Yeah. Yeah"
20:37,280;20:40,680;"I was round pick in 2001 out of UCLA"
20:40,680;20:44,780;"This is his last game of his career. Yeah"
20:44,780;20:51,760;"His career NFL stats were 90 catches for 1200 yards and five touchdowns. So bust"
20:51,760;20:55,680;"Wait, why does he not play after this year?"
20:55,680;21:08,000;"because he sucks. Mitchell held out from the Eagles mini camp in 2005 with Andy Reed stating,"
21:08,000;21:15,440;"""I did not want him here."" So it wasn't injury related. Yeah, he was released from the team that May."
21:15,440;21:22,320;"Yeah, it sounds like he just practiced squaded from there on out."
21:22,320;21:32,320;"Wow. Yeah. So before this game, he sat for a short ESPN interview with Dan Patrick, said,"
21:32,320;21:36,560;"asked to identify the members of the Patriots secondary. Mitchell claimed he did not know them"
21:36,560;21:41,840;"by name, only by number, and then deliberately stated each of their numbers incorrectly."
21:41,840;21:46,720;"Finally, he said he had something for safety Rodney Harrison."
21:49,280;21:51,680;"Well, Harrison has more catches than Freddie."
21:51,680;21:53,200;"Scared."
21:53,200;21:55,520;"That's a spoiler alert."
21:55,520;22:01,760;"And I guess we could just skip to what Bill Belichick said,"
22:01,760;22:04,480;"because this is the best part of this whole thing."
22:04,480;22:06,960;"But it was after the game."
22:06,960;22:11,360;"The normally tight-lipped Patriots head coach Bill Belichick later said of Mitchell,"
22:11,360;22:15,200;"""All he does is talk. He's terrible and you can print that."
22:15,200;22:17,120;"I was happy when he was in the game."""
22:18,320;22:20,040;"Bill Belichick of all people."
22:20,040;22:20,720;"Never."
22:20,720;22:21,240;"Never."
22:21,240;22:21,520;"He never slacks."
22:21,520;22:22,520;"Yeah."
22:22,520;22:24,120;"Belichick don't do that."
22:24,120;22:25,240;"He never says that."
22:25,240;22:27,720;"You never hear him talk badly about anybody."
22:27,720;22:29,640;"If anything, if he's really pumping a guy up,"
22:29,640;22:31,080;"he's like, oh, that guy sucks."
22:31,080;22:33,240;"Yeah, exactly."
22:33,240;22:36,080;"You can print that."
22:36,080;22:37,560;"We were happy when he was in."
22:37,560;22:39,040;"Unbelievable."
22:39,040;22:39,880;"Savage."
22:39,880;22:41,240;"That's why his career ended."
22:41,240;22:42,080;"Everything's going on."
22:42,080;22:44,920;"So that Bill Belichick ended that man's career."
22:44,920;22:46,360;"Absolutely."
22:46,360;22:47,720;"With two sentences."
22:47,720;22:53,760;"I mean, honestly, I can sort of see Fred X's point of like the secondary was just a mess."
22:53,760;22:57,080;"And we're starting to gain the rookie in the Super Bowl."
22:57,080;22:59,120;"You're starting."
22:59,120;22:59,880;"Quarterbacks."
22:59,880;23:01,760;"You're starting Troy Brown is your."
23:01,760;23:02,600;"Yeah."
23:02,600;23:03,240;"You're a lot."
23:03,240;23:03,800;"I mean, you're a lot."
23:03,800;23:04,320;"I get it."
23:04,320;23:07,560;"But how do you not know Troy Brown's name and number?"
23:07,560;23:09,080;"Come on, bro."
23:09,080;23:09,440;"Right."
23:09,440;23:11,040;"He leads the team in interceptions."
23:11,040;23:14,200;"And Rodney Harrison's absolute beast."
23:14,200;23:15,240;"Absolutely."
23:15,240;23:18,600;"Oh, I think he had the best game of his career maybe in this game."
23:18,600;23:20,840;"If Rodney Harrison gets injured this year,"
23:20,840;23:22,560;"Patriots don't want Super Bowl without a doubt."
23:22,560;23:23,640;"Yeah."
23:23,640;23:26,640;"He's the only guy holding that whole secondary back there together."
23:26,640;23:28,600;"He was MVP for me."
23:28,600;23:29,360;"Mm-hmm."
23:29,360;23:30,000;"Yeah, I agree with that."
23:30,000;23:31,720;"This might be his best game as a patriot."
23:31,720;23:34,200;"He's all over the place."
23:34,200;23:36,360;"Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
23:36,360;23:38,200;"Two picks."
23:38,200;23:40,680;"And he set up another that got called back for."
23:40,680;23:42,480;"Well tackles."
23:42,480;23:43,240;"Yeah."
23:43,240;23:46,200;"10 of them solo. Just yeah, three picks even."
23:46,200;23:50,080;"He's he kind of held the guy up for that force fumble."
23:50,080;23:54,800;"He had an he set up the one exception before that to the game then."
23:54,800;23:55,840;"Yeah, let's do that."
23:55,840;23:59,800;"The game now. Yeah. Yeah. Let's just list these Patriots defensive backs"
23:59,800;24:01,480;"for posterity's sake."
24:01,480;24:06,800;"Gerard Cherry, rehab, Abdullah, Hank Poteet, Dexter Reed."
24:06,800;24:09,600;"My God. Dexter Reed."
24:09,600;24:12,280;"I had no idea who he was when I saw him show up on the screen."
24:12,880;24:15,280;"Dude, Hank, I was like, who the fuck is 42?"
24:15,280;24:16,480;"And why is he playing in a seat?"
24:16,480;24:17,480;"Right."
24:17,480;24:18,960;"Rehab Abdullah."
24:18,960;24:21,440;"Dude, I didn't even know this guy was a patriot."
24:21,440;24:22,000;"Yeah."
24:22,000;24:24,440;"Cause Eugene Wilson ends up getting hurt in this game too."
24:24,440;24:25,440;"Yeah."
24:25,440;24:28,040;"So right now, you're down here."
24:28,040;24:29,240;"You're starting safety too."
24:29,240;24:32,480;"And that was on the kickoff return."
24:32,480;24:35,720;"Let the Eagle kickoff returns, a kickoff coverage."
24:35,720;24:39,440;"And Eugene Wilson was the one that made the tackle and heard his shoulder somehow."
24:39,440;24:40,720;"They didn't say what it was."
24:41,960;24:45,200;"But you know, then they're talking about how that's the, you know,"
24:45,200;24:48,320;"Belichick's one of the few guys, a few coaches at the time anyway,"
24:48,320;24:51,400;"who has his starters on special teams."
24:51,400;24:56,060;"And, you know, it makes special teams better, but it also can create these"
24:56,060;24:59,160;"issues where you guys can get injured, which, you know, we've seen with"
24:59,160;25:02,680;"Gronk on the point after attempt to break his arms or a thing."
25:02,680;25:03,880;"Mm hmm."
25:03,880;25:05,160;"I don't see the stake."
25:05,160;25:11,320;"If you watched the football life for this, the game speech, well,"
25:11,320;25:15,240;"that, but there's an interview or a bell check where he's like talking about how thin they were and"
25:15,240;25:19,880;"he's like, you know, we'll be okay. We just don't have a lot of depth. And then he's like, he gets"
25:19,880;25:23,400;"injured on the first two minutes of game. Are you kidding me? Now we have to play the whole game."
25:23,400;25:28,680;"Troy Brown is our cornerback. Like, and then it went back to like how in training camp they had"
25:28,680;25:33,800;"Troy playing cornerback and you know, all that stuff. But yes, the pregame speech."
25:33,800;25:40,840;"Yeah, I just like that. Yeah. I agree. That pregame speech. I usually,"
25:40,840;25:45,840;"you know, I'm not a fellow Czech apologist, but that was electric."
25:45,840;25:47,840;"Oh, I'm saying Greg."
25:47,840;25:51,840;"It's the wall where he's there in like a hotel conference room."
25:51,840;25:53,840;"I think it's a day of the game."
25:53,840;25:55,840;"They flew early or something."
25:55,840;26:08,840;"Yeah. And, and they have, he's like reading what looks like it's something from like a newspaper where Philadelphia had already planned out their parade route and like put all the details and whatever and put in a newspaper."
26:08,840;26:13,600;"And he's basically just like reading all the details of the parade route."
26:13,600;26:16,800;"Yeah. Hey, if you want to attend, like here's the details."
26:16,800;26:18,000;"Super dry fashion."
26:18,000;26:20,080;"He's like, we're doing a flyover."
26:20,080;26:22,240;"If that's something you're interested in and like."
26:22,240;26:23,240;"Amazing."
26:23,240;26:24,680;"That should be fun."
26:24,680;26:25,680;"Yeah."
26:25,680;26:28,680;"It fits his like dry delivery perfectly."
26:28,680;26:29,680;"Oh, yeah."
26:29,680;26:33,680;"But yeah, very effective."
26:33,680;26:35,760;"So yeah, combine that with the Fred X."
26:35,760;26:43,920;"Fertx crap. I think you could kind of tell the past players were a little like fuck you about it."
26:43,920;26:49,840;"They would stop for sure. Yeah. I mean, there was even respect them. They just, you know,"
26:49,840;26:54,080;"they won two of the last three Super Bowls. They have a Belongous Windstreak and NFL history and"
26:54,080;27:00,480;"he's sitting over there just shitting on everybody. And they went 14 and two this season and still"
27:00,480;27:05,760;"people are. But I also think that with Rodney Harrison, especially, they got a lot of mileage"
27:05,760;27:11,520;"out of that whole plane, the disrespect card, nobody was practicing on it. And it was probably"
27:11,520;27:16,240;"at this point a little bit overblown. I remember thinking that back in the day of like, yeah,"
27:16,240;27:20,800;"are you though? But I mean, it fucking worked for him. So who am I?"
27:20,800;27:26,960;"Well, sure. I mean, even if that to, I mean, that's the same, like, Fred X and the Philadelphia"
27:26,960;27:30,280;"newspaper, whatever, really didn't need to do that."
27:30,280;27:30,760;"Yeah."
27:30,760;27:33,160;"Cause like they were scrapping when finding any sort of"
27:33,160;27:37,040;"disrespect they could possibly find of like, Oh, Pittsburgh, after"
27:37,040;27:39,680;"they ended up win streak was like, celebrate on the sidelines."
27:39,680;27:41,200;"We want to fucking show them what's up."
27:41,200;27:47,040;"It's like, yeah, you know, I guess just like, that's what you do."
27:47,040;27:47,600;"Like the painting."
27:47,600;27:47,960;"Yes."
27:47,960;27:48,320;"Yeah."
27:48,320;27:50,600;"So plan there to be like a good city planner."
27:50,600;27:52,760;"You have to like anticipate things."
27:52,760;27:52,960;"Right."
27:52,960;27:54,200;"You can't just throw it together."
27:54,200;27:54,840;"The last thing."
27:55,360;27:56,760;"That's like a Super Bowl shirt."
27:56,760;27:57,680;"The Super Bowl winning shirts."
27:57,680;27:59,080;"They printed for both teams."
27:59,080;27:59,560;"Yeah."
27:59,560;28:00,720;"He's only ever she won."
28:00,720;28:01,080;"Yeah."
28:01,080;28:04,000;"Bill checks up up there holding the Philly Super Bowl shirt."
28:04,000;28:05,160;"And he's like, can you believe this?"
28:05,160;28:10,280;"It only worked once."
28:10,280;28:11,160;"Because yeah."
28:11,160;28:13,720;"All right."
28:13,720;28:15,760;"So first quarter, what do we got?"
28:15,760;28:17,280;"How do you want to start with the first half?"
28:17,280;28:20,440;"Because it's pretty quick moving first half."
28:20,440;28:20,880;"It was."
28:20,880;28:23,640;"Yeah, there wasn't a whole lot happening in the first quarter."
28:23,640;28:24,800;"That's our getting out plate."
28:24,800;28:26,240;"Well, we all agree."
28:26,240;28:28,140;"Or we even the before they even"
28:28,140;28:30,740;"hike the ball, Belchik goes to the wrong bench."
28:30,740;28:32,040;"That's true."
28:32,040;28:34,240;"That's the wrong bone."
28:34,240;28:36,440;"Like we shit, we got Bellichik now, too."
28:36,440;28:39,840;"It's like whoops."
28:39,840;28:44,140;"Yeah, although that conspiracy theory, he was just checking"
28:44,140;28:45,840;"to see if there's any communications he could steal."
28:45,840;28:47,840;"Yeah, obviously."
28:47,840;28:50,840;"Ooh, grabbing some documents, taking some pictures, what are you?"
28:50,840;28:51,440;"Yeah, no big deal."
28:51,440;28:53,540;"You know, just just cruising the sideline, just in case."
28:53,540;28:58,600;"It's like a it's like a engineers that I work with that are like really smart really brilliant"
28:58,600;29:00,440;"But yes and do the simplest thing and they're like"
29:00,440;29:06,260;"Like watching him try to program is the clock in his car"
29:06,260;29:11,980;"Yeah, yeah, yeah, that thing's probably a piece of shit. I'm with"
29:11,980;29:17,320;"The other piece we haven't talked on either at the beginning this game is Richard Seymour is back"
29:17,320;29:20,140;"Which I think flew one of the radar for a lot of people"
29:20,780;29:24,940;"And it's like this big edition as TL being back to I feel I see his points Steve"
29:24,940;29:27,860;"He's a really I mean he's a great in this game and"
29:27,860;29:33,040;"Their own defense was already like really good and then you had seen more of that and it's looking elite"
29:33,040;29:35,700;"You know yeah, he was popping off the screen a couple times"
29:35,700;29:38,940;"Yeah, especially in the run defense. Yeah"
29:38,940;29:41,740;"Run deep is like a whole lot different than it had"
29:41,740;29:44,820;"for"
29:44,820;29:47,980;"West Crockett only 15 carries for 44 yards"
29:48,740;29:51,140;"With a long with a long of 22"
29:51,140;30:00,760;"So he had 14 carries for 22 yards 22. That's tough. Yeah, that feels right to me, right? Not much doing"
30:00,760;30:09,560;"Only at 45 yards rushing the whole game everybody. Yeah, nothing from now one yard for the full back. That's it"
30:09,560;30:12,500;"Yeah"
30:12,500;30:17,960;"Shut that baby up, please. Yeah, right? Who brought a baby here. That's better"
30:17,960;30:19,460;"Well, you don't have to stop here."
30:19,460;30:19,960;"Yeah."
30:19,960;30:20,960;"Yeah."
30:20,960;30:23,240;"You're not damn babies."
30:23,240;30:26,600;"There's a ruin in everything, you know?"
30:26,600;30:27,600;"Ruin the podcast."
30:27,600;30:32,920;"How selfish of you staring at us too."
30:32,920;30:33,920;"Yeah."
30:33,920;30:41,480;"So this first quote, I think you're I understand why you say the it felt like the Eagles were"
30:41,480;30:42,480;"out playing the Patriots."
30:42,480;30:46,840;"I think at the end of the first quarter, like the yardage was the same weirdly."
30:46,840;30:48,600;"They both had 40 yards of offense."
30:48,600;30:53,880;"But I thought the McNabb looked,"
30:53,880;30:56,880;"and you know, I didn't watch a lot of McNabb play,"
30:56,880;30:58,940;"but he looked very like loose with the ball."
30:58,940;31:05,320;"Like he had one fumble that was overturned on the first drive."
31:05,320;31:07,400;"Like his strip sack, but his knee was down."
31:07,400;31:12,560;"And then the second or third drive or whatever it was,"
31:12,560;31:16,280;"he drove down and they got like a ton of penalties"
31:16,280;31:20,120;"to get into the red zone and then he throws an interception,"
31:20,120;31:23,440;"but that gets called back for legal contacts."
31:23,440;31:25,320;"So it was a fucking soft ass penalty."
31:25,320;31:26,780;"- Yeah, soft ass legal contact."
31:26,780;31:29,420;"Yeah, that's like a 2022 illegal contact."
31:29,420;31:31,680;"Like you weren't expecting to see that in 2004."
31:31,680;31:32,720;"- Exactly."
31:32,720;31:33,960;"- But, and then the next play"
31:33,960;31:35,600;"goes and throws an interception again."
31:35,600;31:36,800;"- I love that, that was the best."
31:36,800;31:40,120;"- So it's just like not, I mean,"
31:40,120;31:42,720;"and that was his first red zone interception of the season."
31:42,720;31:44,440;"So I don't know what was going on."
31:44,440;31:50,160;"I don't know if maybe the situation was too big for McNabb, but he didn't look like this"
31:50,160;31:56,440;"world beating 30 touchdown eight interception guy to me, at least in the most."
31:56,440;31:58,120;"No, he didn't look very good at all."
31:58,120;31:59,800;"He had a bunch of bad throws."
31:59,800;32:03,360;"Yeah, he was like missing guys."
32:03,360;32:08,120;"I think the page of demons doing a pretty good job of like blowing up the screens as well,"
32:08,120;32:12,720;"which was a sound like a big part of the Eagles offensive game plan, throwing those screens"
32:12,720;32:13,720;"Westbrook and stuff."
32:13,720;32:17,840;"It was one play where the commentary is actually caught it too."
32:17,840;32:19,940;"I saw it happen."
32:19,940;32:24,920;"And I think it was Roman Fyfer saw that they was going to be a screen pass and just turn"
32:24,920;32:28,160;"around and blew up Brian Westbrook, just like laid him out."
32:28,160;32:30,480;"And McNabb's like, oh, shit."
32:30,480;32:35,120;"And so he tried to scramble and Ron D Harrison came screaming in and caught his leg and"
32:35,120;32:36,400;"just like flipped him upside down."
32:36,400;32:38,400;"And that was fantastic play."
32:38,400;32:41,480;"My first quarter note is what a terrible throw up McNabb."
32:41,480;32:43,140;"like his fifth of the first quarter."
32:43,140;32:46,180;"He was not like maybe a snare."
32:46,180;32:51,020;"It's whatever he was, but he did not look like a NFL MVP quarterback up there."
32:51,020;32:52,120;"Yeah, I agree."
32:52,120;32:53,940;"But the pages suggest this bad, right?"
32:53,940;32:54,920;"They didn't move the ball."
32:54,920;32:55,780;"Not all."
32:55,780;32:56,420;"It's not good."
32:56,420;32:56,780;"No."
32:56,780;32:56,780;"Yeah."
32:56,780;32:57,280;"Yeah."
32:57,280;32:58,080;"Yeah."
32:58,080;33:01,480;"I feel like the the pages were trying to take some deep shots too, and they just"
33:01,480;33:09,680;"weren't quite working, but that Eagle Blitz, I think, was pretty potent, especially"
33:09,680;33:11,440;"with that, that frontline that they had."
33:11,440;33:15,840;"So they were even talking about how Brady was going to what they call it."
33:15,840;33:21,000;"The molasses count, I think he called it, where he would go through his cadence"
33:21,000;33:25,600;"once and try to get the defense to commit to show like where, who the"
33:25,600;33:27,160;"blitzes were and where they were coming from."
33:27,160;33:29,160;"And then he'd reset and do it again."
33:29,160;33:32,680;"And he's like, Oh, look, it's usually working."
33:32,680;33:34,040;"And I'm like, it hasn't worked yet."
33:34,040;33:37,320;"Like if they're still getting the pressure on the blitzes, it's still getting home."
33:37,920;33:41,280;"But I think they started to figure out as the game went on more than anything."
33:41,280;33:42,200;"Yeah."
33:42,200;33:46,680;"Patriots first four drives four plays, punt three plays, punt three plays, punt three"
33:46,680;33:48,440;"plays, punt eight plays fumble."
33:48,440;33:49,200;"Yeah."
33:49,200;33:50,680;"So bad start."
33:50,680;33:52,200;"Eagles, not that much better."
33:52,200;33:58,040;"Three and out three and out 10 plays interception three plays fumble."
33:58,040;34:02,280;"So the first four or five grads from each team, not great."
34:02,280;34:02,880;"No."
34:02,880;34:07,080;"It was a typical first quarter of a"
34:07,080;34:08,320;"a Patriots Super Bowl, right?"
34:08,320;34:11,840;"Like how long did it take for Tom Brady to throw a touchdown"
34:11,840;34:14,280;"past in the first quarter of a Super Bowl?"
34:14,280;34:16,640;"- I think it was. - They went to Tampa."
34:16,640;34:17,480;"- Was it?"
34:17,480;34:18,640;"Yeah. - Yeah."
34:18,640;34:19,560;"- In the Chiefs Super Bowl."
34:19,560;34:22,320;"It was the first time he threw a first quarter touchdown."
34:22,320;34:24,320;"- It was absolutely wild."
34:24,320;34:25,600;"- It was bananas."
34:25,600;34:27,600;"But yeah, and then the scoring started."
34:27,600;34:33,600;"The second quarter, the Eagles hit a big play to Todd Pinkston."
34:35,520;34:38,080;"Do you have an ESPN name, a Birmingham forum, Greg?"
34:38,080;34:39,440;"No."
34:39,440;34:39,960;"Do you?"
34:39,960;34:43,400;"Oh, I always thought I was like weirdly like pink eye, you know,"
34:43,400;34:45,480;"I always thought I was like two in the Pinkston, but maybe not."
34:45,480;34:48,680;"Oh, OK, different."
34:48,680;34:51,920;"I don't think that was a barberism, but I know no."
34:51,920;34:55,280;"Not pink eye Pinkston or two Todd two in the Pinkston."
34:55,280;34:57,600;"I like I like yours a lot better."
34:57,600;34:59,120;"I don't I don't think I can claim that."
34:59,120;35:00,400;"I don't think it was mine."
35:00,400;35:02,200;"Oh, whatever Andy come on."
35:02,200;35:03,440;"He's got to claim it anyways."
35:03,440;35:04,560;"It's like one of those fans."
35:04,560;35:08,280;"definitely mine. Oh, yeah, that's probably where it came from. Yes."
35:08,280;35:12,160;"I need a good fantasy hockey name if you if you got anything. I"
35:12,160;35:14,600;"even realized people play fantasy hockey. I didn't either."
35:14,600;35:17,520;"I just drafted all the Bruins guys."
35:17,520;35:23,760;"I think she probably good plans here. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I also"
35:23,760;35:25,720;"bet on the Bruins before the season started."
35:25,720;35:29,920;"44 bucks at plus 2,800."
35:29,920;35:34,360;"I always bet 40 footed. It's the best number to say."
35:34,360;35:36,640;"The best colors copper aqua"
35:36,640;35:40,240;"Orange what a ball or Steve"
35:40,240;35:42,240;"Aquamarine"
35:42,240;35:43,720;"Silva picked"
35:43,720;35:48,840;"You think the bookie will ever be able to recover if the Bruins win no chance"
35:48,840;35:51,600;"I'm the new mattress Mac, baby"
35:51,600;35:57,360;"Sports betting is the new fantasy team it is"
35:57,360;36:00,840;"Yeah, like dirt I fucking"
36:01,520;36:03,520;"Bad $60 on this"
36:03,520;36:10,480;"Say my $12 38 big parlay"
36:10,480;36:14,440;"Dude I almost hit it if yeah"
36:14,440;36:17,960;"Went the right way"
36:17,960;36:22,040;"You believe Derek Henry didn't run for four touchdowns"
36:22,040;36:25,600;"Sick this year, so I mean what no big deal"
36:26,440;36:32,120;"I'm sorry. What was that Greg nothing dude nobody gives off second quarter first score"
36:32,120;36:36,720;"The Philadelphia yeah first was off that the deep ball to"
36:36,720;36:39,360;"Pinkston that"
36:39,360;36:41,880;"That was the thing I was talking about"
36:41,880;36:45,600;"Yeah, when I was talking about McNabb being able to buy more time"
36:45,600;36:47,760;"Because even the commentary was like well"
36:47,760;36:52,640;"That's something that the Patriots don't see when they play a Peyton Manning because you're avoided a sack basically"
36:52,960;37:00,300;"Stepped up in the pocket and then Chuck deep ball. I have some of what you see in like every game now from even like a Zach Wilson kind of like"
37:00,300;37:05,040;"Stepping up but like throwing on the run as he's stepping up in the pocket. You know what I mean?"
37:05,040;37:10,600;"Mm-hmm. It was one of those. I'll and stuff you that okay Chuck in that deep ball. No, he doesn't doesn't do a lot"
37:10,600;37:12,600;"But that's fine"
37:12,600;37:14,840;"Give him time"
37:22,280;37:27,920;"Shit's there. Yeah. Oh, yeah, you were definitely you're probably calling into Boston sports car. Let's be honest"
37:27,920;37:33,520;"They both suck but hi. This is Greg from North Carolina. That is more fun because it's got a fun name"
37:33,520;37:36,360;"first time long time"
37:36,360;37:43,080;"When do we see zappy you think yeah, dude, we got a fire bell check"
37:43,080;37:50,200;"Someone's got to say it, you know, I get a filter to take over the Patriots"
37:50,920;37:52,520;"Yeah, we've got some good ideas."
37:52,520;37:57,080;"Belgarpet GM."
37:57,080;37:59,480;"Literally saw that on Twitter today."
37:59,480;38:00,760;"That's the only reason I came up with it."
38:00,760;38:07,800;"So yeah, but then that kind of sparked the Patriots to get their shit together"
38:07,800;38:12,520;"where they would go on their touch on driving the ensuing drive."
38:12,520;38:16,600;"I think it sounds like they figured out like this green was the play."
38:16,600;38:17,400;"Yes."
38:17,400;38:19,280;"like they hit like two or three of those in a row."
38:19,280;38:20,360;"The core you get one."
38:20,360;38:21,360;"The core dill of all people."
38:21,360;38:22,440;"Yeah, it's not really there."
38:22,440;38:23,400;"They're usually trying to."
38:23,400;38:23,640;"Right."
38:23,640;38:29,440;"And then later on that drive, you had a couple of runs by Kevin"
38:29,440;38:32,600;"Falk, like, you know, under center sort of like running,"
38:32,600;38:34,720;"you know, between the tackles, which is where it's."
38:34,720;38:37,080;"They were zigging when they should have been zagging, right?"
38:37,080;38:38,160;"Screen scoring,"
38:38,160;38:40,280;"they run up the gut with Kevin Falk."
38:40,280;38:40,840;"Yeah."
38:40,840;38:45,280;"So just kind of keeping that that I'm guessing it was like a matchup thing, too,"
38:45,280;38:49,200;"because who is the middle linebacker for the the e-grotter?"
38:49,200;38:50,240;"Trotter. Yeah."
38:50,240;38:50,880;"From the right."
38:50,880;38:52,240;"Apparently they were saying Jeremiah."
38:52,240;38:53,200;"He was a bullfrog."
38:53,200;38:56,440;"Bullfrog interview that was he Jeremiah."
38:56,440;38:57,200;"Yeah. Yeah."
38:57,200;38:58,160;"Well, the bullfrog."
38:58,160;38:59,880;"OK, Jeremiah was a bullfrog."
38:59,880;39:00,680;"Yes."
39:00,680;39:02,240;"What the fuck are you talking about?"
39:02,240;39:06,360;"You know, my favorite jokes are the ones you have to explain."
39:06,360;39:11,120;"Is this like a little kid's book or something that I'm not aware of?"
39:12,280;39:16,240;"Did Steve and he can you overlay that?"
39:16,240;39:18,240;"A song. Yeah."
39:18,240;39:20,760;"When you release this, I'll try to remember that."
39:20,760;39:23,600;"Yeah. You would definitely not, but I might."
39:23,600;39:25,440;"I've done it. But I won't."
39:25,440;39:33,000;"Yeah. So with Jeremiah Trotter, they're talking about how great the run"
39:33,000;39:36,240;"defense had been as soon as they put him in at run defense."
39:36,240;39:38,640;"I think it was actually after the Steelers game, where the Steelers put up"
39:38,640;39:40,560;"like 200 and something rushing yards on them."
39:40,560;39:44,220;"Uh, and the bus just like ran down their throats in the second half."
39:44,220;39:48,840;"And then, uh, they put trotter in it."
39:48,840;39:52,400;"Cause I think he was maybe rookie or like this, this first year on the team."
39:52,400;39:54,680;"And I think it came from the red skin."
39:54,680;39:57,080;"I mean, it was actually, if knowing the red skins, they're probably like, Oh, wow."
39:57,080;39:59,520;"Let's just sign him to a contract."
39:59,520;40:00,400;"That's way too much."
40:00,400;40:00,760;"Right."
40:00,760;40:00,960;"Yeah."
40:00,960;40:02,320;"Afri burns out here."
40:02,320;40:03,120;"Uh huh."
40:03,120;40:05,280;"But yeah."
40:05,280;40:09,360;"And then I think they started averaging like 50 yards less"
40:09,360;40:12,940;"rushing yards against per game with him at middle linebacker."
40:12,940;40:16,560;"So I'm wondering if the Patriots saw that"
40:16,560;40:18,920;"and every time Corey Dillon was on the field,"
40:18,920;40:22,120;"Trotter was on the field and when he wasn't, you know."
40:22,120;40:24,120;"So you put Ken Falk in there,"
40:24,120;40:26,920;"you don't have Trotter, you can run up the middle sort of thing."
40:26,920;40:28,720;"- So I just looked up Trotter,"
40:28,720;40:31,040;"this is kind of funny, so I'll make you last deep."
40:31,040;40:38,320;"So he was drafted by Philly, was an all pro at the tail end of his rookie contract, then"
40:38,320;40:42,920;"signed with Washington, sucks for two years, came back to Philly and was good to get some"
40:42,920;40:43,920;"fun."
40:43,920;40:45,920;"Oh, it's even better."
40:45,920;40:46,920;"Awesome."
40:46,920;40:47,920;"Dude."
40:47,920;40:49,920;"Maybe it's not the player."
40:49,920;40:54,600;"It's the Patrick Chung move right there, you know?"
40:54,600;40:55,600;"Yeah."
40:55,600;40:57,160;"Yeah, no shit."
40:57,160;40:58,640;"Oh my God."
40:58,640;41:00,640;"Kyle Van Neuwe."
41:00,640;41:04,000;"Yeah. Jamie Collins again."
41:04,000;41:06,720;"Yeah. So yeah. Um,"
41:06,720;41:10,320;"Jason Jackson, the, the Patriots put together a few,"
41:10,320;41:11,720;"a couple of drives in the second quarter."
41:11,720;41:15,600;"The first one was, uh, they drove inside the Philly 10,"
41:15,600;41:19,320;"but then Brady fumbled the play action, like went to go like fake to hand off"
41:19,320;41:24,320;"and drop the football, which, uh, the commentators were talking about how,"
41:24,320;41:27,680;"oh, well, in the Super Bowl, they switch out the ball every play."
41:27,680;41:29,080;"So those balls are really slick."
41:29,960;41:32,060;"and probably inflated too much."
41:32,060;41:33,060;"- Oh, for sure."
41:33,060;41:33,960;"- Here's what it is."
41:33,960;41:36,600;"- But we'll throw that back for us."
41:36,600;41:39,240;"- People would say that the fumbling thing"
41:39,240;41:40,400;"was the big thing."
41:40,400;41:42,120;"- It's the big thing."
41:42,120;41:42,960;"- It's the biggest fumble?"
41:42,960;41:45,680;"- Right, because they had the less inflated balls."
41:45,680;41:48,120;"- Okay."
41:48,120;41:52,000;"- So this would be evidence towards that theory, yes?"
41:52,000;41:54,520;"That if they didn't have their special balls,"
41:54,520;41:55,360;"they're fumbling."
41:55,360;41:58,000;"- Sure."
41:58,000;41:58,840;"- Cool."
41:59,800;42:03,160;"except that after you guys got off lead defensive there for a second."
42:03,160;42:06,920;"Except after deflate gate happened, the Patriots still fumbled at less,"
42:06,920;42:12,760;"less of a rate than the rest of the NFL in on par with how it was before deflate"
42:12,760;42:16,120;"gate. Yeah, but that's because they were still defling football."
42:16,120;42:18,960;"They just got better at hiding it. Is that right?"
42:18,960;42:22,160;"Even though it was supposed to be tested every game after every play."
42:22,160;42:22,880;"Yeah."
42:22,880;42:24,720;"Do you know the actual gas law?"
42:24,720;42:26,360;"Called out."
42:26,360;42:28,920;"It's not called in Jacksonville."
42:28,920;42:35,440;"That's right. Fumble. And he fell right on top of that shit and didn't and still didn't come up with it. Yeah. Yeah."
42:35,440;42:47,920;"And it was one of those hilarious things where there's a huge dog pile of people and it's like before the penalty of like dragon people also like Dawkins is like grabbing people by the legs dragon and then like some dude squirms out with the football."
42:47,920;42:55,920;"He's holding it up and no one notices and the rest are still like and eventually they look up and they're like, Oh shit, that guy's got the ball."
42:55,920;42:59,780;"like 30 hours. Yeah, he's celebrating the other end. I guess it"
42:59,780;43:00,180;"seagulls."
43:00,180;43:05,160;"Exactly. Yeah, they pull a pile off his no ball at the bottom of"
43:05,160;43:08,540;"it. Yeah, what the foot that happens all the time to yo, yeah,"
43:08,540;43:11,100;"it does just like some random dude on the side of the file comes"
43:11,100;43:14,420;"away with it. You're like, how do you get it? Yeah, there's this"
43:14,420;43:15,660;"thing up on greased up pig."
43:15,660;43:20,660;"So yeah, so that was the first good drive with it. They're"
43:20,660;43:25,900;"actually putting together some ball movement. And then"
43:25,900;43:27,820;"then I got the ball back and do it again."
43:27,820;43:32,060;"Throw a touch on a given, which was a nice pass, nice catch."
43:32,060;43:34,260;"Do you see him stun on the Eagle fans?"
43:34,260;43:35,740;"Oh, yes."
43:35,740;43:39,260;"Yeah. People remember this kind of an iconic thing,"
43:39,260;43:42,300;"where he puts the football down, steps on it, does the big"
43:42,300;43:45,140;"glassing and slapping of the things."
43:45,140;43:46,580;"And then flexes."
43:46,580;43:47,940;"Yeah."
43:47,940;43:49,420;"Did you see the, um,"
43:49,420;43:54,140;"I don't know if they, it was kind of like the do your job"
43:54,700;43:57,000;"like a behind the scenes thing on this Super Bowl too."
43:57,000;43:58,000;"- What would it do?"
43:58,000;43:58,840;"- Yeah."
43:58,840;43:59,900;"- 'Cause they talk about like the practice,"
43:59,900;44:02,580;"they had that play in, it was supposed to be like"
44:02,580;44:04,940;"4A right over the middle and he falls over."
44:04,940;44:05,940;"- Yep."
44:05,940;44:09,340;"- And then the second read is Dion Branch to the left"
44:09,340;44:10,420;"and he was double covered."
44:10,420;44:13,820;"So, Givens is actually the third read on that play."
44:13,820;44:17,220;"And it's like, that was Brady's best throw of the day,"
44:17,220;44:18,060;"I thought."
44:18,060;44:19,460;"- 'Cause he had to come all the way back across"
44:19,460;44:21,900;"and throw it like, yeah, he's throwing across"
44:21,900;44:26,700;"his feet aren't squared to where he's throwing it. And there's a guy right there that if he"
44:26,700;44:31,660;"under throws that and he doesn't and his feet aren't right. So that's easy to under throw it."
44:31,660;44:36,380;"And he just beautifully like lays it over this defender and Givens just like takes one step and"
44:36,380;44:40,940;"Yeah, it's from the four year that it's not a lot of room there either. And if he under throws"
44:40,940;44:46,620;"that that guy's going the opposite way. He's going that. Yeah. I'm a liberal throw. I mean,"
44:46,620;44:51,660;"probably a bad decision because that guy sitting there staring right at Braden he's throwing it"
44:51,660;44:53,180;"all across the field."
44:53,180;44:54,460;"True off balance."
44:54,460;44:56,580;"I bet like nine times that"
44:56,580;44:57,700;"attend that doesn't work out."
44:57,700;44:59,140;"But I just goes to show you like"
44:59,140;45:00,740;"Tom has."
45:00,740;45:01,860;"Yeah, exactly."
45:01,860;45:03,020;"He has underrated arm talent."
45:03,020;45:03,820;"I think it does."
45:03,820;45:05,460;"That was an arm talent throw."
45:05,460;45:06,340;"Yeah, it was."
45:06,340;45:07,180;"Yeah, I agree."
45:07,180;45:08,620;"Yeah."
45:08,620;45:13,340;"And then the Patriots as they"
45:13,340;45:15,100;"are want to do come out in the"
45:15,100;45:16,860;"second half first drive,"
45:16,860;45:18,700;"drive straight down the field."
45:18,700;45:21,100;"Nine plays four minutes,"
45:21,300;45:28,500;"69 yards. Nice score touchdown. And now they're up and gone from being down seven to up seven."
45:28,500;45:32,420;"And that's that whole what do they call it? The middle eight, I think they call it now."
45:32,420;45:37,220;"Like a whole philosophy of like scoring before the half and after the half."
45:37,220;45:42,260;"Oh yeah, trying to get your things there and it worked there."
45:42,260;45:49,060;"I guess who scores a touchdown who is second. Super ball touchdown, which"
45:49,060;45:50,080;"which pissed me off."
45:50,080;45:51,080;"I was a tight end."
45:51,080;45:56,800;"Mike Brayable just hoovering up all this like accolades"
45:56,800;45:59,420;"on the fucking side of the ball."
45:59,420;46:00,260;"- No shit."
46:00,260;46:02,540;"- To not even do anything."
46:02,540;46:03,380;"- Right."
46:03,380;46:04,220;"- Yeah."
46:04,220;46:06,420;"I mean, when you're down, you're down in that spot."
46:06,420;46:08,500;"Like it's not, I mean, to be fair,"
46:08,500;46:10,460;"this was a great catch."
46:10,460;46:12,220;"He's being a mall to the ground."
46:12,220;46:13,060;"- Yeah."
46:13,060;46:14,060;"- And he still had to like,"
46:14,060;46:16,140;"bat it up in the air and then come down with it."
46:16,140;46:16,980;"Yeah."
46:16,980;46:17,980;"It was a nice catch."
46:17,980;46:18,820;"- Yeah."
46:18,820;46:25,320;"And there was a penalty on the play too. Oh, yeah, it was the defensive home. Yeah, I don't get what goes into this decision though"
46:25,320;46:30,840;"It is is Mike Vable that much better than a tight end at that play. Is that why he's in there?"
46:30,840;46:34,720;"I don't know. So you've got to be right. I mean, this is pretty good"
46:34,720;46:39,900;"Yeah, I maybe there you know, it's something that I from what I remember hearing he"
46:39,900;46:43,180;"advocated for"
46:43,620;46:50,180;"Playing tight end in those short yardage situations for himself. He's like I can catch sure plenty of defense players"
46:50,180;46:53,460;"Oh, that's what they're saying, but he was able to back it up in practice"
46:53,460;46:55,420;"So yeah, they're like coaches like yeah, fuck it"
46:55,420;46:57,700;"Let's let's see what you can do and they did it and he was actually okay"
46:57,700;47:04,060;"And so I think it was one of those things where they just kept letting him do it until he failed and like I'm not you're done"
47:04,060;47:10,380;"Now and he just kind of never did so just like kept happening until like, you know, he's taking"
47:10,380;47:12,300;"snaps away from"
47:12,300;47:19,260;"Christian Fourier fucking Super Bowl. I'd be pissed. Yeah, but I go I guess also there's something towards like"
47:19,260;47:23,980;"just like players that have it, you know, right? Yeah, I've like"
47:23,980;47:31,900;"They just seem to make big plays. Yeah, it's not like a physical thing or like yeah tools like it's not like that"
47:31,900;47:32,700;"Are you?"
47:32,700;47:38,380;"Right, it's just like you know, you know what you're gonna get when you put this player out there"
47:38,380;47:40,620;"Oh, you're like you can rely on"
47:41,500;47:43,260;"Yeah, I mean, it's Tom Brady to it too."
47:43,260;47:44,860;"Right. He's always had that extra gear."
47:44,860;47:47,700;"And also like maybe in practice,"
47:47,700;47:49,860;"Fourier did make those catches and"
47:49,860;47:51,620;"Sarabel was making those catches, right?"
47:51,620;47:53,980;"Yeah, practicing goal line, whatever,"
47:53,980;47:56,340;"where Fourier might be a more talented player,"
47:56,340;47:58,660;"but you don't know if you can rely on him."
47:58,660;48:01,140;"Exactly. Yeah."
48:01,140;48:03,100;"So but either way sucks even more."
48:03,100;48:05,620;"If he's taking your super bowl touchdown"
48:05,620;48:07,420;"and you know the coach doesn't trust you,"
48:07,420;48:09,180;"that's probably like, oh, gosh."
48:09,180;48:10,740;"This sucks."
48:10,740;48:13,680;"And now for a zone."
48:13,680;48:16,440;"What EI talking shit about Bell check is perfect."
48:16,440;48:17,340;"Full circle."
48:17,340;48:18,240;"I like that."
48:18,240;48:19,780;"Mike Reibel's coaching the Titans."
48:19,780;48:20,180;"Right."
48:20,180;48:22,480;"Could be coach of the year this year."
48:22,480;48:23,020;"Yeah."
48:23,020;48:23,340;"It would be."
48:23,340;48:24,880;"Reibel's awesome."
48:24,880;48:25,920;"He's awesome."
48:25,920;48:27,220;"I think he's a really good coach too."
48:27,220;48:27,580;"Yep."
48:27,580;48:28,380;"Yep."
48:28,380;48:32,420;"I wonder if he's interested in the Patriots when Bell check's done."
48:32,420;48:37,460;"I brown waggle."
48:37,460;48:38,460;"I brown waggle."
48:38,460;48:39,460;"Yes."
48:39,460;48:39,740;"Sorry."
48:39,740;48:41,780;"I forgot this is a audio medium."
48:41,780;48:42,940;"Yes, it is."
48:42,940;48:45,440;"Good job."
48:45,440;48:48,160;"So yeah, so Patriots score to go up 14-7."
48:48,160;48:49,820;"Eagles answer back."
48:49,820;48:54,260;"We'll drive later with their own McNabb"
48:54,260;48:56,580;"pass to Brian Westbook."
48:56,580;48:57,260;"Ill-advised."
48:57,260;48:59,020;"And the Nabb pass."
48:59,020;49:01,580;"Yeah, he snuck it in there."
49:01,580;49:02,500;"But--"
49:02,500;49:03,540;"Because a lot."
49:03,540;49:05,140;"That was a great throw."
49:05,140;49:06,180;"Yeah."
49:06,180;49:08,580;"That was the best throw of the day."
49:08,580;49:10,700;"It was up there."
49:10,700;49:12,580;"It's it's calm."
49:12,580;49:14,380;"It's all how off balance he is."
49:14,380;49:14,820;"Yeah."
49:14,820;49:15,940;"For no real reason either."
49:15,940;49:17,260;"It wasn't like pressure."
49:17,260;49:21,500;"And he's like falling backwards on one foot."
49:21,500;49:26,020;"And just side arm, side arm just slings this thing."
49:26,020;49:28,740;"It's almost like he like forgot that he had to throw it."
49:28,740;49:29,500;"And I was like, oh shit."
49:29,500;49:30,500;"Like."
49:30,500;49:31,300;"Yeah."
49:31,300;49:32,420;"And it's like when I was playing,"
49:32,420;49:34,380;"there was like a defender on each side."
49:34,380;49:38,260;"And there's a window of maybe a yard that he can put that ball in."
49:38,260;49:40,020;"And he just stuck it in there."
49:40,020;49:40,700;"They hummed it."
49:40,700;49:41,100;"Yeah."
49:41,100;49:41,700;"Yeah."
49:41,700;49:42,700;"It was a good throw."
49:42,700;49:44,180;"That was an incredible play."
49:44,180;49:45,220;"Yeah."
49:45,220;49:46,620;"Didn't look great."
49:46,620;49:48,260;"No, no, but it worked."
49:48,260;49:48,820;"It was effective."
49:48,820;49:50,460;"But he got the job done."
49:50,460;49:54,980;"So tie ball game going into the fourth quarter."
49:54,980;50:01,580;"But then the Patriots answer back driving into the fourth quarter."
50:01,580;50:03,020;"Right."
50:03,020;50:04,100;"Yep."
50:04,100;50:05,580;"Driving down."
50:05,580;50:06,860;"And the third started the fourth."
50:06,860;50:08,980;"they're they drive down. Yeah."
50:08,980;50:14,780;"This is where Dion Brandt starts to make his presence felt too as well."
50:14,780;50:18,060;"Yeah, right. Let's make and catch at this second half."
50:18,060;50:19,500;"He was all over the place."
50:19,500;50:20,980;"The borderline uncoverable. Yeah."
50:20,980;50:23,420;"They I don't know if they went to man or whatever it was,"
50:23,420;50:26,340;"but he's just like he was just open on every play."
50:26,340;50:29,620;"The second Super Bowl in a row. Yeah. Yeah."
50:29,620;50:34,660;"And then there was one catch, which I would argue is the catch of the"
50:34,660;50:40,620;"the past of the game where Brady puts it just over the hands of the defensive back into"
50:40,620;50:50,940;"the on branches hands like literally inches. And so you reminded me of Julio Jones in the"
50:50,940;50:56,060;"Falcon Super Bowl. Yeah. Just just where you're like this guy's covered. Yeah. But but he threw"
50:56,060;51:00,740;"it anyway. And he made a catch in it was just like you had to watch replay to be like, wait,"
51:00,740;51:02,900;"I wasn't that an interception. I don't understand."
51:02,900;51:04,100;"Great."
51:04,100;51:07,180;"Well, targets 11 catches 133 yards."
51:07,180;51:09,300;"Yeah. Yeah."
51:09,300;51:11,100;"And that 11 kitchen on 12 targets."
51:11,100;51:12,980;"Like he caught almost everything."
51:12,980;51:14,740;"I don't know. Throw it to Dion."
51:14,740;51:16,300;"Yeah. Fuck it. Right."
51:16,300;51:18,780;"Dion's down there somewhere against"
51:18,780;51:20,580;"Lido Shepherd. No less."
51:20,580;51:21,700;"Yeah. Pro bowl. Lido."
51:21,700;51:22,700;"Shepherd."
51:22,700;51:25,060;"Pro all pro whoops."
51:25,060;51:27,020;"So yeah, they end that drive."
51:27,020;51:28,420;"Start of the fourth touchdown."
51:28,420;51:29,380;"Corey Dillon."
51:29,380;51:31,140;"- Cold doser. - Yeah."
51:31,140;51:35,100;"- Runs through Brian Dawkins too,"
51:35,100;51:37,340;"which I thought was a nice little touch there."
51:37,340;51:38,980;"- No, it's the thing, the Patriots could sort of run it"
51:38,980;51:40,540;"and the Eagles could not, you know?"
51:40,540;51:41,520;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
51:41,520;51:43,860;"Which was a little bit surprising, but not."
51:43,860;51:47,220;"I guess the Eagles were more of a pass first team anyway,"
51:47,220;51:49,780;"but like seeing them not be able to run it all"
51:49,780;51:50,980;"was a little surprising."
51:50,980;51:53,620;"- Dylan had 75 yards on 18 carries,"
51:53,620;51:55,500;"Kevin Falk had 38 on eight."
51:55,500;51:56,500;"- Mm-hmm, pretty good."
51:56,500;51:58,340;"- Yeah, so over 100 for the game."
51:58,340;51:59,060;"Not bad."
51:59,060;52:03,220;"And then they combine for five catches and 50 yards as well."
52:03,220;52:04,260;"Yeah."
52:04,260;52:05,660;"Say, you got a lot of your running back."
52:05,660;52:06,660;"But you always do."
52:06,660;52:07,740;"And the Patriots offense, right?"
52:07,740;52:11,380;"Like that's what you expect to see."
52:11,380;52:13,220;"But then I felt like the Patriots went a bit conservative."
52:13,220;52:19,380;"Went three and out a couple of times after--"
52:19,380;52:21,140;"Yeah, McNabb throws an air session."
52:21,140;52:22,220;"Bruceky."
52:22,220;52:23,140;"Yeah."
52:23,140;52:25,100;"Bruce."
52:25,100;52:27,340;"And then Patriots immediately turned around and pointed back"
52:27,340;52:28,180;"to him."
52:28,180;52:33,540;"Yeah. Yeah. And then the interesting stuff starts if you're an Eagles fan."
52:33,540;52:41,540;"So the situation is there's five minutes and 40 seconds left."
52:41,540;52:44,980;"It is a 24 to 14 game. Right."
52:44,980;52:50,540;"You have the ball in your own 20 yard line. Two scores, right. Two score game."
52:50,540;52:55,020;"Five and a half minutes. They start driving."
52:56,300;52:58,620;"And everything's dinkin' dunk underneath."
52:58,620;52:59,700;"Yada, yada, yada."
52:59,700;53:01,780;"They get to midfield and there's like"
53:01,780;53:04,660;"under three minutes left."
53:04,660;53:05,860;"- Yes, they were like closing in"
53:05,860;53:07,140;"on the two minute warning now."
53:07,140;53:08,380;"- Yeah."
53:08,380;53:10,260;"And they're just walking."
53:10,260;53:12,380;"They're huddling after every play."
53:12,380;53:13,980;"- There's no urgency."
53:13,980;53:14,820;"- Commentators. - It's almost like"
53:14,820;53:16,900;"they feel like it's only a one score game"
53:16,900;53:19,100;"and this is the score that they have to do."
53:19,100;53:21,180;"- Yeah, they're run their five minute offense."
53:21,180;53:22,020;"- Right."
53:22,020;53:23,500;"And it doesn't seem to make sense."
53:23,500;53:25,460;"All the commentators are like,"
53:25,460;53:27,780;"Uh, what's going on?"
53:27,780;53:30,660;"They're like huddling and then walking to the line after they"
53:30,660;53:31,500;"bottle. Yeah."
53:31,500;53:33,060;"This is any urgency."
53:33,060;53:37,500;"You could you just know Eagles fans are home like screaming their heads off."
53:37,500;53:38,620;"Yeah."
53:38,620;53:39,140;"Yeah."
53:39,140;53:39,660;"Yeah."
53:39,660;53:44,100;"That football like they interview Belichick and he's like, I had to double"
53:44,100;53:44,900;"check the score."
53:44,900;53:46,820;"I was like, did I get the score wrong?"
53:46,820;53:48,500;"Are they not down to these scores?"
53:48,500;53:49,180;"Yeah."
53:49,180;53:51,620;"And he was like, and I never figured it out."
53:51,620;53:54,620;"He's like, usually I can come up with like a reason why."
53:54,660;53:57,020;"And he's like, I still to this day have no idea why they did that."
53:57,020;53:58,020;"Ridiculous."
53:58,020;54:00,900;"And this is where the McNabb puking stuff."
54:00,900;54:03,820;"Origin origin is, right?"
54:03,820;54:10,620;"It's this drive where there is like some people were saying he was puking in the huddle."
54:10,620;54:11,220;"Yeah."
54:11,220;54:11,620;"Yeah."
54:11,620;54:16,140;"Other people are saying that he was like mumbling and like couldn't get the play"
54:16,140;54:19,740;"call out and that like other players had to call the plays for him."
54:19,740;54:22,500;"Other people were like, yeah, he was just really tired."
54:23,060;54:28,060;"So, yeah, so, so, here, let me read you the, the part about it on Wikipedia.org."
54:28,060;54:34,300;"Um, well, anecdotal reports later came out alleging that McNabb was suffering from dry"
54:34,300;54:38,340;"heaves and teammates John Ritchie and Lito Shepard have gone on record years later that"
54:38,340;54:42,700;"McNabb was suffering from dry heaves or vomiting, though no video evidence exists and the stories"
54:42,700;54:44,460;"have not been confirmed."
54:44,460;54:48,060;"Hank Fraley said in an interview the day after the game that McNabb was almost puking due"
54:48,060;54:52,100;"to two large hits from Teddy Bruceky and Jarvis Green on back to back plays."
54:52,100;54:59,260;"Knapp himself denies that he was vomiting or dry heaving during the final drive and Brian Westberg later claims that McNabb was merely coughing"
54:59,260;55:02,500;"But he apparently used to cough all the time"
55:02,500;55:09,180;"Really? That's what I read too is like that was not uncommon for him to be like have coughing fits in the game"
55:09,180;55:16,420;"But coughing fits enough that like he couldn't call the play. Yeah, like I don't know"
55:17,300;55:20,020;"It had the skills and I think it's I think he's hurt."
55:20,020;55:21,940;"I think he took two big hits."
55:21,940;55:22,380;"Yeah."
55:22,380;55:24,460;"And was like, we're big, woozy."
55:24,460;55:25,860;"And it was like, oh, fuck."
55:25,860;55:26,740;"And that makes sense."
55:26,740;55:28,340;"Then you're not like rushing."
55:28,340;55:30,700;"Like if you're like, don't know where you are."
55:30,700;55:33,540;"You're, it's hard to run a two minute hurry up offense."
55:33,540;55:34,420;"You know, right."
55:34,420;55:36,180;"So that kind of fits that too."
55:36,180;55:39,700;"And yeah, he's still ended up throwing a 30 yard, like, yeah,"
55:39,700;55:43,540;"like for a touchdown with one minute, 40, something left."
55:43,540;55:45,660;"Just under the after the two minute warning."
55:45,660;55:46,180;"Yeah."
55:46,180;55:46,620;"Yeah."
55:46,620;55:49,400;"140 really that's not the reason they lost the game"
55:49,400;55:56,040;"But I think in hindsight a lot of people look back and be like one Andy Reed does not imagine clock two right"
55:56,040;55:58,040;"McNabb pukes when things get tough"
55:58,040;56:03,360;"It's kind of a bad rap because they like and that's correct. That's not a drive plot. Yeah, still"
56:03,360;56:09,080;"Yeah, right. Yeah, they didn't give themselves a great chance for"
56:09,080;56:15,620;"Yeah, it wasn't a good look, you know, you know, the whole of America watching and you're just like walking around"
56:15,620;56:23,580;"around. Yeah, exactly. What are you doing? It's tough. Yeah. So"
56:23,580;56:25,980;"that so that you know, they scroll the touchdown, pages"
56:25,980;56:29,900;"recover the on size kick Christian for you. I guess. Well,"
56:29,900;56:33,220;"the other part. What's that? Do you have to on site kick?"
56:33,220;56:36,940;"That's all. Yeah, I don't know if that no, the only two"
56:36,940;56:41,700;"timeouts two timeouts a minute. If you've got six left 148"
56:41,700;56:44,300;"- Okay, whatever."
56:44,300;56:46,460;"- I don't know."
56:46,460;56:47,740;"- You could kick it deep."
56:47,740;56:53,140;"And it's what, 35 seconds on the plate clock, 45?"
56:53,140;56:53,980;"- Hey, get it back."
56:53,980;56:55,300;"- You don't get the ball back."
56:55,300;56:57,540;"- Yeah, you get the ball back closer to midfield, hopefully."
56:57,540;56:58,580;"If you hold them."
56:58,580;56:59,860;"- Right."
56:59,860;57:02,020;"And instead they ended up with 46 seconds left"
57:02,020;57:03,620;"on their own four-yard line."
57:03,620;57:04,460;"- Right."
57:04,460;57:09,740;"- It's the same turnaround, you just get it at midfield."
57:09,740;57:10,580;"- Right."
57:10,580;57:11,860;"- Well, you have to feel goal though, right?"
57:11,860;57:14,920;"So you only need to go 20 yards, whatever it is,"
57:14,920;57:15,760;"instead of having a goal."
57:15,760;57:17,060;"- I think he got a ticket there."
57:17,060;57:17,940;"- I agree."
57:17,940;57:20,380;"- Yeah, I think that may have been what lost it for him."
57:20,380;57:22,900;"- I think it's a different league now too,"
57:22,900;57:24,180;"in terms of that stuff."
57:24,180;57:25,100;"- Good point."
57:25,100;57:25,940;"- Yeah, I'm really agree."
57:25,940;57:28,060;"- We're like modern offense."
57:28,060;57:31,900;"If you gave like Patrick Mahomes 46 seconds,"
57:31,900;57:33,300;"and all you need is a field goal,"
57:33,300;57:34,660;"you can have a four yard line one,"
57:34,660;57:35,500;"you know, I don't give a shit."
57:35,500;57:36,980;"- He's done it with 13."
57:36,980;57:39,100;"- Yeah, yeah, he's gonna do that."
57:39,100;57:40,940;"he's gonna move the ball fast."
57:40,940;57:44,100;"I feel like back then it was much more like"
57:44,100;57:45,660;"we need way more time."
57:45,660;57:46,660;"- Yeah, I agree."
57:46,660;57:48,940;"Yeah, I think the offense just wasn't,"
57:48,940;57:51,700;"they don't have the explosive players to like, yeah."
57:51,700;57:55,340;"- Even so then, it's even more reason to kick it deep"
57:55,340;57:56,820;"and hoping to get it back."
57:56,820;57:57,660;"- Right, right, absolutely."
57:57,660;57:58,500;"- And then it healed."
57:58,500;58:00,300;"And they took you have a bunch of that"
58:00,300;58:01,940;"field position game there."
58:01,940;58:03,220;"- Yeah."
58:03,220;58:04,580;"- But they didn't."
58:04,580;58:05,900;"- And they didn't."
58:05,900;58:08,100;"- Some of the Patriots pumped it, right?"
58:08,100;58:10,580;"So yeah, they didn't have any of the back to catch it."
58:10,580;58:11,580;"Right."
58:11,580;58:13,620;"Yeah, they were just coming all in."
58:13,620;58:20,060;"And I found a quote from Josh Miller, the punter, about that, that play."
58:20,060;58:21,060;"Okay."
58:21,060;58:22,500;"So this is what he said."
58:22,500;58:26,220;"He goes, ""The Super Bowl for me is my all time."
58:26,220;58:30,460;"Here's the best coach in the world, hands down, and we have such a funny moment in Jacksonville"
58:30,460;58:33,780;"in 2004, the night before I'm not religious, but I pray to God."
58:33,780;58:35,860;"Listen, God, I don't even care if we lose."
58:35,860;58:37,620;"Just don't make me be the reason."
58:37,620;58:40,860;"get these in game and if we win fantastic, but if not, I understand."
58:40,860;58:43,740;"Just don't let me be the thing that people see for the next 20 years."
58:43,740;58:47,580;"So here I am with 20 seconds left on the field and there's time out after time"
58:47,580;58:48,220;"out after time out."
58:48,220;58:49,620;"I'm sitting there on the field like Jesus."
58:49,620;58:51,260;"This is not where I want to be right now."
58:51,260;58:53,300;"So it was a long time out."
58:53,300;58:54,740;"Belichick says Miller, come here."
58:54,740;58:55,740;"I'm like, what's up, coach?"
58:55,740;58:57,540;"He's like, listen, just get rid of the ball."
58:57,540;58:58,660;"I don't care where it goes."
58:58,660;58:59,820;"I'm like, OK, fantastic."
58:59,820;59:00,260;"Easy enough."
59:00,260;59:00,780;"I'll do that."
59:00,780;59:01,980;"I'm running back on the field."
59:01,980;59:03,020;"He's like, Miller, come here."
59:03,020;59:06,220;"If you can get inside the 10, that's obviously what we're looking for."
59:06,220;59:06,980;"I'm like, OK."
59:06,980;59:11,780;"I'm running out. He's like, forget it. Listen, just get rid of the F and ball, please. Josh, don't drop it."
59:11,780;59:16,460;"I'm like, don't drop it. That's what you tell me. He was like, yeah, that was dumb."
59:16,460;59:23,140;"That's, that's awesome. That's such a good story. Yeah."
59:23,140;59:25,540;"You're like, Oh, yeah, no, Steve. I should have said that to you."
59:25,540;59:26,980;"Yeah. Thanks."
59:26,980;59:27,500;"Thanks."
59:27,500;59:28,420;"You. That just made it worse."
59:28,420;59:29,580;"Isn't it? Yep."
59:29,580;59:34,260;"However, what happened? He drops it in the four-yard line."
59:34,260;59:35,540;"Didn't drop the ball."
59:35,540;59:36,540;"Drops a dime."
59:36,540;59:40,060;"And Dexter Reed, the guy who got burnt on the touchdown."
59:40,060;59:40,620;"Yeah."
59:40,620;59:41,980;"Is the one that downed it."
59:41,980;59:43,180;"Yeah, perfect."
59:43,180;59:44,540;"Redemption story."
59:44,540;59:47,300;"Absolutely."
59:47,300;59:52,020;"So they have 46 seconds left to go nine."
59:52,020;59:54,460;"Well, we need a vehicle and they're on their own."
59:54,460;59:55,620;"60 yards."
59:55,620;59:56,060;"What's that?"
59:56,060;59:56,420;"You are."
59:56,420;59:56,780;"So yeah."
59:56,780;01:00:01,500;"And they don't and they immediately blow it."
01:00:03,220;01:00:08,320;"Like immediately, McNabb to Brian Westbrook for one yards in balance."
01:00:08,320;01:00:08,660;"No time."
01:00:08,660;01:00:17,340;"And that incomplete tarot Owens and then intercepted over throws."
01:00:17,340;01:00:19,620;"LJ Smith by like three yards."
01:00:19,620;01:00:21,700;"Can of corn for Rodney Harrison."
01:00:21,700;01:00:26,380;"He returns it for six yards, falls on the ground to end the to end the"
01:00:26,380;01:00:27,820;"plan and then gets up flapping."
01:00:27,820;01:00:30,500;"Which it's him with the flap."
01:00:30,500;01:00:31,340;"Yeah."
01:00:31,340;01:00:38,980;"tackle made by Fred X is the picture that I remember from this year bull is that picture of him like running with the entire defense behind him"
01:00:38,980;01:00:41,260;"doing the flap"
01:00:41,260;01:00:43,260;"running Harrison"
01:00:43,260;01:00:46,740;"Absolutely amazing game over dynasty. Yeah"
01:00:46,740;01:00:50,740;"The first time the Patriots get to take a knee to end a Super Bowl"
01:00:50,740;01:00:53,860;"Hmm I"
01:00:53,860;01:00:55,780;"Believe there's only one other time they're gonna do that"
01:00:55,780;01:01:00,380;"And it was in their last Super Bowl the Rams one. Yeah"
01:01:00,820;01:01:06,180;"They're able to take a knee at that one so and then nice. Yeah for Stevie B. Yeah"
01:01:06,180;01:01:11,860;"Yeah for Bill and his dad. Yeah, but I remember seeing like people"
01:01:11,860;01:01:18,160;"Giving them flack for that because his dad's so old and you know like his heart doesn't work"
01:01:18,160;01:01:22,340;"So well like why you dowsing him and Gator is like bro is that super"
01:01:22,340;01:01:27,100;"Yeah, the fuck here. It's like it's a zoomable. If that's the way I'm going out"
01:01:27,100;01:01:29,760;"Yeah"
01:01:29,760;01:01:33,580;"Getting the fucking Gatorade bath at the Super Bowl ever wanted. Yeah, I'm cool with that"
01:01:33,580;01:01:37,160;"His dad died later that year, too. Yeah. Yeah"
01:01:37,160;01:01:40,200;"and also"
01:01:40,200;01:01:42,560;"Bell Brady's"
01:01:42,560;01:01:46,800;"Grandparent I can't remember what your grandfather. Yeah died"
01:01:46,800;01:01:49,400;"Like the week leading up to this game"
01:01:49,400;01:01:54,880;"So I'm also Bruce G. had his stroke like three weeks later. That's true. Yep"
01:01:55,720;01:01:58,680;"Because on the plane back from this game"
01:01:58,680;01:02:04,160;"Brady and Bruce you sit next to each other talking about how they were going to be the first team to ever win three"
01:02:04,160;01:02:09,880;"Super Bowls in a row because they're bringing everybody back and then shortly afterwards Bruce key has his stroke"
01:02:09,880;01:02:11,960;"it's like oh fuck"
01:02:11,960;01:02:16,880;"Also Corey don't Corey don't and hurt his nose if you if you know what I mean"
01:02:16,880;01:02:22,680;"I don't know what you mean. Yeah, explain it a bunch of blow"
01:02:23,880;01:02:28,160;"Yeah, really? I don't know. See sounds like the type of guy"
01:02:28,160;01:02:32,240;"Throwing around unsubstantiated"
01:02:32,240;01:02:36,200;"Right you just rumors full cloth. Yeah, unbelievable"
01:02:36,200;01:02:39,080;"Herpman knows"
01:02:39,080;01:02:41,120;"Unbelievable"
01:02:41,120;01:02:43,720;"He probably would you get down Dylan"
01:02:43,720;01:02:47,360;"You just you just"
01:02:48,320;01:02:50,320;"Landering people right?"
01:02:50,320;01:02:54,880;"Sorry if you had to ask one player on this roster for drugs who would it be?"
01:02:54,880;01:02:58,600;"Kevin Faulk Sante Samuel. Oh"
01:02:58,600;01:03:01,800;"Sonta's a good one too. Oh, yeah"
01:03:01,800;01:03:08,200;"They all got caught coming back from maybe they got caught coming back from"
01:03:08,200;01:03:11,600;"From Montreal remember"
01:03:11,960;01:03:17,540;"Two of them and Kevin Falk got caught with weed at the weazy concert weeds not drug though"
01:03:17,540;01:03:22,320;"Probably Tom Brady actually no"
01:03:22,320;01:03:29,720;"Harrison he's a second sign maybe maybe I mean if you if you can't issue it's a drug, then yeah"
01:03:29,720;01:03:33,720;"William again, it's"
01:03:33,720;01:03:35,000;"No"
01:03:35,000;01:03:39,920;"No, I think sneaky. He is bad boy. He just knows how to be a good guy in front of the cameras"
01:03:41,120;01:03:43,900;"Tolly go let mom here you say that yeah"
01:03:43,900;01:03:48,280;"What I mean bad boy in the best way"
01:03:48,280;01:03:53,680;"Okay, okay three spirit, you know sure"
01:03:53,680;01:03:57,120;"Wilfork"
01:03:57,120;01:04:06,400;"He's definitely not no he just chose it home food is his drugs man. Yeah, that's his places eaten ribs. Yeah"
01:04:06,400;01:04:09,800;"Fucking loves it"
01:04:10,040;01:04:17,320;"Andy Reed. Did you hear a consworth as are like storming the field? Just throw a shot at the Browns"
01:04:17,320;01:04:21,120;"No, he's a he sent something to the effect of like"
01:04:21,120;01:04:28,960;"Who would have thought the head coach that was like had to leave losing seasons in Cleveland?"
01:04:28,960;01:04:32,680;"Which now have like the best playoff winning percentage ever?"
01:04:32,680;01:04:38,320;"And he's like you got to think there's fans out there in Cleveland scratching their heads right about now"
01:04:38,320;01:04:40,320;"And this is like as they're running on the field"
01:04:40,320;01:04:45,400;"That's like the read the room bro. You saved this up for now"
01:04:45,400;01:04:50,400;"Taking them while they're down man. Yeah, you save that for the next time the Patriots play the Browns"
01:04:50,400;01:04:55,400;"Like what are you doing if I was a Cleveland fan? I'd be like dude. What the fuck? I'm just catching strays"
01:04:55,400;01:05:02,120;"Jesus Christ although I have to imagine Cleveland fans like yeah about right"
01:05:02,120;01:05:05,800;"Yeah, yeah"
01:05:05,760;01:05:12,560;"Of course we fucking give up the best coach in history. Yeah, because he couldn't keep the team winning"
01:05:12,560;01:05:15,800;"because they the last"
01:05:15,800;01:05:17,880;"coach to coach"
01:05:17,880;01:05:20,760;"The Browns to a playoff victory"
01:05:20,760;01:05:27,340;"Before it wasn't last year when the Browns beat the Steelers was Bill Belichick back in the 80s"
01:05:27,340;01:05:30,080;"and then the next year"
01:05:30,080;01:05:35,280;"The Browns announced that they were moving the team halfway through the season"
01:05:35,280;01:05:41,880;"And so the team fell apart and then they fired Belichick even though they told them they were going to keep him when they moved to Baltimore."
01:05:41,880;01:05:43,880;"So, you know, typical Brown shit."
01:05:43,880;01:05:44,880;"Mm-hmm."
01:05:44,880;01:05:49,680;"And then the Ravens went on to become"
01:05:49,680;01:05:55,320;"Super Bowl champion in the early 2000s right after Belichick left"
01:05:55,320;01:06:02,960;"With some of that core team and some of their draft picks Belichick was the guy who wanted to draft Ray Lewis apparently"
01:06:04,240;01:06:09,240;"And so there's a good chance that the reason Ray Lewis is a Raven was because of Bill Belichick"
01:06:09,240;01:06:13,720;"Yeah, I don't buy those. Yeah, you wanted this guy"
01:06:13,720;01:06:19,240;"Apparently did if he got calls it said that he wanted Tom Brady"
01:06:19,240;01:06:23,920;"Yeah, but that was a six round page in the first round pick. I"
01:06:23,920;01:06:27,480;"Ain't buying any of those stories course not"
01:06:27,480;01:06:31,280;"I'll buy one is Belichick. Yeah, I know"
01:06:32,280;01:06:33,880;"- Of course you will."
01:06:33,880;01:06:35,880;"You can do no wrong, so you know."
01:06:35,880;01:06:37,480;"He doesn't know how to lie."
01:06:37,480;01:06:40,000;"He's too much of a truth teller."
01:06:40,000;01:06:41,960;"He's one of those people."
01:06:41,960;01:06:44,800;"- All right, you wanna hear my notes on Torelloans?"
01:06:44,800;01:06:46,240;"Give me your notes on Torelloans."
01:06:46,240;01:06:47,080;"- Absolutely."
01:06:47,080;01:06:53,440;"- Torelloans, if you had to guess where he is all time"
01:06:53,440;01:06:56,400;"in yards, receiving yards, where would you say"
01:06:56,400;01:06:57,320;"he falls on that list?"
01:06:57,320;01:07:00,200;"- He's like surprisingly high, right?"
01:07:00,200;01:07:03,460;"Yeah. He's like top five or top 10 or something."
01:07:03,460;01:07:04,960;"He's third all time."
01:07:04,960;01:07:05,960;"God damn."
01:07:05,960;01:07:06,960;"He's even here."
01:07:06,960;01:07:08,960;"It's, can you guess one and two?"
01:07:08,960;01:07:09,960;"Jerry Rice."
01:07:09,960;01:07:10,960;"Yeah."
01:07:10,960;01:07:11,960;"Number one."
01:07:11,960;01:07:14,400;"I don't think you're getting any."
01:07:14,400;01:07:15,400;"No."
01:07:15,400;01:07:16,600;"Am I clerving?"
01:07:16,600;01:07:17,600;"No."
01:07:17,600;01:07:19,440;"You're not going to get it."
01:07:19,440;01:07:20,760;"I was shocked."
01:07:20,760;01:07:23,960;"Is it somebody from our time frame?"
01:07:23,960;01:07:26,640;"Yeah, recently retired like a year or two."
01:07:26,640;01:07:27,840;"Oh, I know it."
01:07:27,840;01:07:29,320;"Who is it?"
01:07:29,320;01:07:30,340;"- Alvin Johnson."
01:07:30,340;01:07:31,980;"- No, damn it."
01:07:31,980;01:07:33,420;"- Larry Fitzgerald."
01:07:33,420;01:07:35,880;"- Oh yeah, 'cause he played for so goddamn long, wow."
01:07:35,880;01:07:37,520;"- Yeah, Moss is four."
01:07:37,520;01:07:41,320;"He's third all time in touchdowns."
01:07:41,320;01:07:44,080;"One and two. - You're cut off, that's right."
01:07:44,080;01:07:45,600;"- Yeah, Moss and Bryce."
01:07:45,600;01:07:46,420;"- Yeah."
01:07:46,420;01:07:48,480;"- Eighth all time in receptions."
01:07:48,480;01:07:53,560;"This is like the peak of his career, 2004."
01:07:53,560;01:07:54,400;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:07:54,400;01:07:56,980;"- So the tail end of his San Francisco"
01:07:58,160;01:07:59,860;"his last four years and his first year here"
01:07:59,860;01:08:02,560;"was best years, he had like five pro bowls,"
01:08:02,560;01:08:07,240;"four first email pros whose average in like 91,"
01:08:07,240;01:08:09,700;"1300, 13 touchdowns a year."
01:08:09,700;01:08:15,240;"- He technically got traded to the Eagles,"
01:08:15,240;01:08:18,040;"but not really."
01:08:18,040;01:08:20,680;"So apparently he's gonna be a free agent."
01:08:20,680;01:08:22,040;"The 49ers are sick of him"
01:08:22,040;01:08:24,440;"'cause he was just kind of pan the ass."
01:08:24,440;01:08:27,800;"And then his agent forgot to file the paperwork."
01:08:27,800;01:08:37,160;"So he signed a deal with the Eagles, but it wasn't legit because he was still a member of the"
01:08:37,160;01:08:40,280;"Niners. So then the Niners quickly traded him to Baltimore."
01:08:40,280;01:08:47,320;"So Baltimore thought they were getting them for a while. And then like the players union like"
01:08:47,320;01:08:54,040;"fucking had them like, you know, do a arbitration thing. And there's some settlement where like"
01:08:54,040;01:08:59,000;"Baltimore got like a second round pick out of it because they were like, this is bullshit."
01:08:59,000;01:09:00,840;"Yeah. Good one."
01:09:00,840;01:09:08,040;"So yeah, a couple of his off the field antics, like obviously he was really good, but yeah,"
01:09:08,040;01:09:13,560;"the pom poms, right? The popcorn, Sharpie in the stock. He's like the first one to do that."
01:09:13,560;01:09:14,360;"I'm left with it."
01:09:14,360;01:09:17,400;"Yeah. The Dallas star, which you did twice that game."
01:09:17,400;01:09:18,200;"Oh, yeah."
01:09:18,200;01:09:23,480;"Why not? I had one the second one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He did the Ray Lewis one."
01:09:23,480;01:09:29,660;"Yes. And then after the game, they asked him about it. And he was like, yo, Ray Lewis,"
01:09:29,660;01:09:35,360;"like killed two people. He's like, I didn't do it. I didn't kill anybody. I was like,"
01:09:35,360;01:09:44,480;"hell yeah, brother. He was, he did that Monday night football skit that we talked about earlier"
01:09:44,480;01:09:50,800;"this year with the housewives. Yeah. It's really suggestive. Yeah. We got a lot of shit"
01:09:50,800;01:09:57,280;"for that. He implied Jeff Garcia was gay. Oh, yes. It in"
01:09:57,280;01:09:58,600;"interview with Playboy."
01:09:58,600;01:10:03,720;"What does he do? You missed one of the. We're still going"
01:10:03,720;01:10:06,080;"through the list, Andy. Okay. All right. One of his"
01:10:06,080;01:10:11,960;"celebrations, which one I'm done with my cellies. I guess"
01:10:11,960;01:10:17,680;"in 2007, when he was playing for the Cowboys, they're playing"
01:10:17,680;01:10:21,800;"the Patriots, he touched down. Actually, no, it was after he was playing the dolphins,"
01:10:21,800;01:10:26,240;"but he filming. He hid behind a field goal post and held the football to his faces if"
01:10:26,240;01:10:27,360;"he was on video camera."
01:10:27,360;01:10:28,360;"It's hilarious."
01:10:28,360;01:10:35,480;"It's hilarious. Great. Yeah. That's a good one too. So yeah, in play, boy, they stay,"
01:10:35,480;01:10:39,160;"I don't know why they asked if they thought Jeff Garcia was gay, which seems like a weird"
01:10:39,160;01:10:44,240;"question to ask in the first place. But he said, like my boy tells me, if it looks like"
01:10:44,240;01:10:50,840;"a rat and smells like a rat by golly. It's a rat. Jesus. That's a, that's a tough look."
01:10:50,840;01:10:57,000;"And then he was like, and then he was like, I never said he was gay. That's like, you"
01:10:57,000;01:11:01,000;"just called him a rep. It's not very ambiguous. What you said, right? Yeah. And he's got to"
01:11:01,000;01:11:05,760;"use the duck one there too. You can't go rat. Yeah. Yeah. I was mixing up his metaphors"
01:11:05,760;01:11:06,760;"as well. Yeah."
01:11:06,760;01:11:07,760;"Yeah."
01:11:07,760;01:11:10,440;"So yeah."
01:11:10,440;01:11:16,760;"And then after this Super Bowl is when it all crashed and burned in Philadelphia too."
01:11:16,760;01:11:18,000;"Oh really?"
01:11:18,000;01:11:21,160;"So they all loved Omi, broke his ankle, got out there, played the game."
01:11:21,160;01:11:24,760;"But if you saw in the game, they were bitching at each other."
01:11:24,760;01:11:27,480;"Hey, man McNabb."
01:11:27,480;01:11:32,280;"That continued on the beginning and next year, he held out of training camp because he wanted"
01:11:32,280;01:11:33,680;"more money."
01:11:33,680;01:11:35,760;"Makes sense."
01:11:35,760;01:11:39,860;"And then Andy Reed suspended him."
01:11:39,860;01:11:43,720;"And then that's when he was doing the workout in his driveway."
01:11:43,720;01:11:45,680;"Oh, that's a classic."
01:11:45,680;01:11:46,680;"Yeah."
01:11:46,680;01:11:48,960;"And he was like, I'm a team player, bro."
01:11:48,960;01:11:50,720;"I do as best a team."
01:11:50,720;01:11:54,480;"He said to push us in his driveway."
01:11:54,480;01:11:57,240;"Just fucking hilarious."
01:11:57,240;01:12:01,240;"And then McNabb was interviewed and he said, I think we might be better off without him"
01:12:01,240;01:12:02,240;"here."
01:12:02,240;01:12:03,880;"at the same preseason."
01:12:03,880;01:12:06,800;"And then TL responded by saying,"
01:12:06,800;01:12:09,560;"I'm not the one who got tired in the Super Bowl."
01:12:09,560;01:12:10,400;"- Oh."
01:12:10,400;01:12:12,840;"- So then there was all this sucking, you know."
01:12:12,840;01:12:13,680;"- Jesus."
01:12:13,680;01:12:16,960;"- He actually, I think he played half this year maybe,"
01:12:16,960;01:12:21,080;"but he was like, he didn't have good numbers."
01:12:21,080;01:12:22,880;"There was a lot of fighting on the sidelines"
01:12:22,880;01:12:24,640;"and then he got traded to Dallas."
01:12:24,640;01:12:31,480;"So yeah, and then he almost got held out of the hall of fame."
01:12:31,480;01:12:34,840;"What people just said his staffs were too good."
01:12:34,840;01:12:36,840;"I mean, to be fair, they work."
01:12:36,840;01:12:37,600;"Yeah."
01:12:37,600;01:12:39,160;"The law team expected me to be."
01:12:39,160;01:12:39,440;"Yeah."
01:12:39,440;01:12:39,840;"Yeah."
01:12:39,840;01:12:41,560;"He came to five teams he played for."
01:12:41,560;01:12:42,160;"Yeah."
01:12:42,160;01:12:42,280;"Yeah."
01:12:42,280;01:12:45,480;"So obviously the Philly Cowboys."
01:12:45,480;01:12:45,960;"Yeah."
01:12:45,960;01:12:48,720;"Cincinnati and Buffalo."
01:12:48,720;01:12:49,680;"Yes."
01:12:49,680;01:12:50,160;"Buffalo."
01:12:50,160;01:12:50,520;"Yeah."
01:12:50,520;01:12:53,880;"I for totally forgot him on Buffalo and Cincinnati, honestly."
01:12:53,880;01:12:54,360;"Yeah."
01:12:54,360;01:12:54,800;"Yeah."
01:12:54,800;01:12:55,800;"Cincinnati was like for all."
01:12:55,800;01:12:57,520;"He wasn't that bad if I remember."
01:12:57,520;01:12:58,520;"He was pretty good in Buffalo."
01:12:58,520;01:12:58,760;"I remember."
01:12:58,760;01:13:02,320;"829 yards in Buffalo and then 983 in Cincinnati."
01:13:02,320;01:13:03,160;"Oh, yeah."
01:13:03,160;01:13:03,560;"It was good."
01:13:03,560;01:13:04,160;"Yeah."
01:13:04,160;01:13:09,200;"Dude, he's a piece of beast last year, age 37 season."
01:13:09,200;01:13:10,800;"But early seven."
01:13:10,800;01:13:14,720;"Yeah, 72 catches 983 yards and nine touchdowns."
01:13:14,720;01:13:15,320;"Wow."
01:13:15,320;01:13:16,280;"Nine touches."
01:13:16,280;01:13:17,120;"Yeah."
01:13:17,120;01:13:18,720;"Jesus Christ."
01:13:18,720;01:13:19,720;"What was thrown in the ball?"
01:13:19,720;01:13:21,160;"I wonder in the year."
01:13:21,160;01:13:22,600;"Oh, that's probably."
01:13:22,600;01:13:24,600;"No, maybe."
01:13:24,600;01:13:25,120;"Yeah."
01:13:25,120;01:13:26,760;"Palmer, maybe."
01:13:26,760;01:13:27,760;"Maybe."
01:13:28,400;01:13:29,400;"I don't know."
01:13:29,400;01:13:36,240;"But even when he got voted into the Hall of Fame, there was some controversy because he"
01:13:36,240;01:13:39,120;"is the only person to skip the official celebration."
01:13:39,120;01:13:40,120;"- Okay."
01:13:40,120;01:13:45,120;"- In Kent, Ohio, instead choosing to host his own celebration in Mackenzie Arena on the"
01:13:45,120;01:13:49,800;"campus of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga, who's on the matter, is the only inducted"
01:13:49,800;01:13:53,400;"of the hall to skip his induction instead of host a separate induction ceremony."
01:13:53,400;01:13:55,800;"The fucking course is."
01:13:55,800;01:13:56,800;"- Dude."
01:13:56,800;01:14:01,720;"Besides the gay thing, there's really not that much bad he did for sure."
01:14:01,720;01:14:08,000;"Yeah, he had some diva, but yeah, he had some sort of like pain medication overdose"
01:14:08,000;01:14:12,840;"to that was not sure if that was like an attempt at his own life and stuff."
01:14:12,840;01:14:15,760;"And he had like spit on the engine."
01:14:15,760;01:14:17,360;"Oh, yeah, there's a spitting thing."
01:14:17,360;01:14:19,200;"Yeah, but that was unconfirmed, right?"
01:14:19,200;01:14:19,680;"Yeah."
01:14:19,680;01:14:22,680;"And it was like, I don't know if it was like for real or if it was by accident."
01:14:22,680;01:14:25,360;"So, you know, he was."
01:14:25,920;01:14:28,400;"And he had one of my favorite quotes."
01:14:28,400;01:14:29,400;"Yeah."
01:14:29,400;01:14:29,440;"Yeah."
01:14:29,440;01:14:30,960;"That's my quarterback."
01:14:30,960;01:14:30,960;"Yeah."
01:14:30,960;01:14:32,160;"That's my teammate."
01:14:32,160;01:14:34,160;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:14:34,160;01:14:35,000;"That's my quarterback."
01:14:35,000;01:14:36,640;"Which quarterback is even talking about that I forget?"
01:14:36,640;01:14:37,480;"I think it's Roamal."
01:14:37,480;01:14:37,980;"Yeah."
01:14:37,980;01:14:38,480;"Roamal."
01:14:38,480;01:14:39,480;"Yeah."
01:14:39,480;01:14:40,680;"That's my quarterback."
01:14:40,680;01:14:43,400;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:14:43,400;01:14:45,880;"Jesus."
01:14:45,880;01:14:47,920;"NFL legend, throw-alongs."
01:14:47,920;01:14:49,040;"Throw-alongs."
01:14:49,040;01:14:49,520;"That's right."
01:14:49,520;01:14:50,440;"All right."
01:14:50,440;01:14:52,080;"Do you guys want to do best and worst?"
01:14:52,080;01:14:53,400;"You got anything else, Greg?"
01:14:53,400;01:14:54,120;"No, that's it."
01:14:54,120;01:14:54,760;"Best and worst."
01:14:54,760;01:14:55,040;"All right."
01:14:55,040;01:14:55,880;"Sure."
01:14:55,880;01:14:57,880;"Steve I'm your best and worse"
01:14:57,880;01:15:01,780;"But I got a fair bet stuff here"
01:15:01,780;01:15:06,760;"Worse was Fred ex drawing after he gets his first catch with two minutes and 42"
01:15:06,760;01:15:15,240;"Doing and then like you can be a steel receiver who celebrated the first down when they're trying to run the two-minute"
01:15:15,240;01:15:18,120;"Drill yeah, I wasted a bunch of time off a clock. Yeah"
01:15:20,040;01:15:24,660;"I mean, it's like TL was not show boating. He was out there just like giving it all and yeah"
01:15:24,660;01:15:28,600;"I have ballgame and then Fred X is like, you know, you're down two scores"
01:15:28,600;01:15:31,760;"To read that was cold"
01:15:31,760;01:15:34,940;"There was a cool"
01:15:34,940;01:15:38,440;"Little Super Bowl fact about eight plus point comebacks"
01:15:38,440;01:15:44,160;"In civil history, which is hilarious and retrospect, you know, well, what was the stat?"
01:15:44,160;01:15:49,360;"You know, I don't remember it was like ever had a team has ever come back from eight points down to win"
01:15:49,360;01:15:49,860;"Yeah."
01:15:49,860;01:15:54,760;"Still still hold in 2004."
01:15:54,760;01:15:56,000;"No team has done it."
01:15:56,000;01:15:56,640;"Yeah."
01:15:56,640;01:16:01,400;"There was some commentator ones as well that you're you're probably upset about Andy."
01:16:01,400;01:16:04,720;"No, I had I was okay with the commentators in this one."
01:16:04,720;01:16:07,360;"I knew going into it was I'm like, you know, I'm just going to"
01:16:07,360;01:16:10,560;"my chill about referees kind of bother me."
01:16:10,560;01:16:12,160;"I can get that if you want."
01:16:12,160;01:16:14,240;"No, I don't want that."
01:16:14,240;01:16:16,640;"That the blame you're going to do anyways."
01:16:16,640;01:16:16,960;"Cool."
01:16:16,960;01:16:17,160;"Yeah."
01:16:17,160;01:16:18,680;"Well, I'll just give you one."
01:16:18,840;01:16:20,560;"We already talked about the legal contact."
01:16:20,560;01:16:22,540;"That was soft, but the mist, uh,"
01:16:22,540;01:16:26,360;"there's a blatant pick on Owen's his first, like long catch for 30 yards."
01:16:26,360;01:16:30,440;"And it happened literally like the collision happened in front of the referee."
01:16:30,440;01:16:32,240;"Like what the fuck are you looking at?"
01:16:32,240;01:16:36,840;"If you don't like it was, uh, I think it was Fred X just like laid out, um,"
01:16:36,840;01:16:40,520;"whoever the offensive back was covering him, like just straight up block his"
01:16:40,520;01:16:42,000;"ass on like pancake them."
01:16:42,000;01:16:44,400;"It was a great block, but shit's illegal."
01:16:44,400;01:16:45,320;"Like it was a pick boy."
01:16:45,320;01:16:47,960;"And then they called the soft rough in the passer."
01:16:48,320;01:16:49,320;"Right. Yeah. Like two plays."
01:16:49,320;01:16:50,320;"Yeah."
01:16:50,320;01:16:51,320;"Oh, my God."
01:16:51,320;01:16:52,320;"Damn it."
01:16:52,320;01:16:57,080;"So, but apparently no one could have imagined Torell Owens's impact on this game according"
01:16:57,080;01:16:58,080;"to Collinsworth."
01:16:58,080;01:16:59,080;"No one."
01:16:59,080;01:17:01,520;"No, especially not Torell Owens himself."
01:17:01,520;01:17:05,200;"I'm sure as a such an ego maniac."
01:17:05,200;01:17:13,800;"And then, you know, it really ground my gears and that he called Dion Branch, Tom Brady's"
01:17:13,800;01:17:15,600;"most trusted target."
01:17:15,600;01:17:16,600;"Right."
01:17:16,600;01:17:17,440;"Come on, bro."
01:17:17,440;01:17:19,600;"One year round is out there."
01:17:19,600;01:17:20,200;"Yeah."
01:17:20,200;01:17:20,200;"Yeah."
01:17:20,200;01:17:21,000;"There've been here."
01:17:21,000;01:17:23,200;"And Troy Brown is right there."
01:17:23,200;01:17:23,400;"Yeah."
01:17:23,400;01:17:24,200;"Yeah."
01:17:24,200;01:17:25,000;"I can play."
01:17:25,000;01:17:26,760;"Chris playing defense."
01:17:26,760;01:17:29,280;"He's retarded and fun."
01:17:29,280;01:17:31,960;"Did we need to get this highlight on the website?"
01:17:31,960;01:17:34,280;"Because it's not showing up in the stat seat that that"
01:17:34,280;01:17:34,960;"were punt return."
01:17:34,960;01:17:35,600;"Yeah."
01:17:35,600;01:17:36,640;"They got called back."
01:17:36,640;01:17:37,320;"Yeah."
01:17:37,320;01:17:40,560;"It went from getting the ball in there 40 to the ball and R8."
01:17:40,560;01:17:41,080;"Yeah."
01:17:41,080;01:17:44,560;"And he made like four or five people mess on that."
01:17:44,560;01:17:46,480;"He said it was one of his best ever."
01:17:46,480;01:17:47,320;"It is."
01:17:47,320;01:17:48,160;"Yeah, I agree with that."
01:17:48,160;01:17:49,480;"Yeah."
01:17:49,480;01:17:52,120;"He's on the PAT block team."
01:17:52,120;01:17:54,000;"Yeah, he's everywhere."
01:17:54,000;01:17:55,000;"Just everywhere."
01:17:55,000;01:17:56,160;"Everywhere."
01:17:56,160;01:17:59,680;"And then Todd Pinkson's going in and getting IVs in the middle of the goddamn"
01:17:59,680;01:18:00,280;"third quarter."
01:18:00,280;01:18:04,000;"Now Jack is a little heat, baby."
01:18:04,000;01:18:04,720;"Yeah."
01:18:04,720;01:18:07,680;"Not you stood up there and held it elsewhere."
01:18:07,680;01:18:08,240;"Yeah."
01:18:08,240;01:18:11,120;"He's in the locker and getting IVs."
01:18:11,120;01:18:13,200;"Troy is making cut blocks on screenplays."
01:18:13,200;01:18:13,440;"Right."
01:18:13,440;01:18:14,000;"Exactly."
01:18:14,000;01:18:14,200;"Yeah."
01:18:14,200;01:18:18,760;"And then staying out there because he's got to be on on defense."
01:18:18,760;01:18:19,440;"Right."
01:18:19,440;01:18:20,120;"Yeah."
01:18:20,120;01:18:23,000;"Those are my best and worst."
01:18:23,000;01:18:23,400;"All right."
01:18:23,400;01:18:24,480;"Greg, what about you?"
01:18:24,480;01:18:31,000;"Give me some best and worst, but my best is my Super Bowl MVP Rodney"
01:18:31,000;01:18:31,560;"Harrison."
01:18:31,560;01:18:32,960;"Yeah, bear."
01:18:32,960;01:18:37,600;"Two interceptions, a sack, 12 tackles."
01:18:37,600;01:18:40,040;"Really on the fourth."
01:18:40,040;01:18:41,480;"Yeah."
01:18:42,360;01:18:44,680;"- And really just like jumped off the screen as like,"
01:18:44,680;01:18:46,520;"holy shit, this guy's physical."
01:18:46,520;01:18:49,480;"Like he's just, he was every tackle he makes,"
01:18:49,480;01:18:53,120;"he just like ragged all somebody that's sad"
01:18:53,120;01:18:54,120;"you were talking about."
01:18:54,120;01:18:57,680;"- Yeah, on McNabb's leg and like almost like flipped them."
01:18:57,680;01:18:58,520;"It was pretty crazy."
01:18:58,520;01:19:01,600;"- It was like an open field tackle on Donald and Matt,"
01:19:01,600;01:19:02,640;"which is not an easy thing to do."
01:19:02,640;01:19:05,560;"And he just, he's a ragdolled him."
01:19:05,560;01:19:08,920;"- Yeah, I mean, he jumped off the screen way more"
01:19:08,920;01:19:10,280;"than Dawkins did for me."
01:19:10,280;01:19:11,800;"- Yeah, 100%."
01:19:11,800;01:19:12,900;"I know Dawkins is good."
01:19:12,900;01:19:15,240;"- Wait more than any other defender did, just in general."
01:19:15,240;01:19:16,400;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:19:16,400;01:19:19,800;"So he was my best honorary MVP"
01:19:19,800;01:19:21,920;"from the Patriots Science and Podcasts."
01:19:21,920;01:19:22,760;"For sure."
01:19:22,760;01:19:24,240;"- I would agree."
01:19:24,240;01:19:25,680;"- My worst, I didn't have anything"
01:19:25,680;01:19:29,920;"for the only other note I had was on Fred X."
01:19:29,920;01:19:34,920;"So apparently his first cousins with Rod Smart."
01:19:34,920;01:19:36,400;"- Oh, Jesus."
01:19:36,400;01:19:37,960;"- That was, he hate me, right?"
01:19:37,960;01:19:38,800;"- Yeah."
01:19:38,800;01:19:39,640;"- Yeah."
01:19:39,640;01:19:41,400;"So that's his cousin."
01:19:41,400;01:19:46,840;"And it has here his several nicknames during his tenure in Philadelphia."
01:19:46,840;01:19:53,800;"That included fast Freddie, Sultan of slot first down Freddie, Fred ex."
01:19:53,800;01:19:56,320;"The people's champ in Hollywood."
01:19:56,320;01:19:58,800;"Oh, God."
01:19:58,800;01:20:03,360;"So over as an idiot, how many of those you think he gave himself?"
01:20:03,360;01:20:05,240;"Yeah, all of them."
01:20:05,240;01:20:08,460;"He also claims that, um, uh,"
01:20:08,460;01:20:13,660;"thought of him, McNabb costed him $40 million, but it's because McNabb didn't"
01:20:13,660;01:20:15,860;"like him because he was a first round pick."
01:20:15,860;01:20:17,580;"Yeah."
01:20:17,580;01:20:21,060;"And there's only room for one first round pick on the team or some bullshit."
01:20:21,060;01:20:23,660;"Does he not realize it was a first round pick ever?"
01:20:23,660;01:20:25,060;"I saw an airbeat."
01:20:25,060;01:20:26,580;"He said that as a grown man."
01:20:26,580;01:20:27,260;"He said that."
01:20:27,260;01:20:29,280;"This is like two years ago."
01:20:29,280;01:20:30,080;"He made that quote."
01:20:30,080;01:20:31,300;"Oh, geez."
01:20:31,300;01:20:32,000;"Yeah."
01:20:32,000;01:20:32,840;"You really do."
01:20:32,840;01:20:34,740;"You were actually good and you were a first round pick."
01:20:34,740;01:20:36,740;"You're going to get a shake somewhere else, you know, right?"
01:20:36,740;01:20:37,180;"Yeah."
01:20:37,180;01:20:39,100;"The four year career is so shit."
01:20:39,100;01:20:41,620;"And it certainly wasn't McNabb's fault."
01:20:41,620;01:20:43,140;"If anything, he helped you out."
01:20:43,140;01:20:44,460;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:20:44,460;01:20:46,340;"Drag dresser Super Bowl."
01:20:46,340;01:20:47,380;"Yeah."
01:20:47,380;01:20:48,380;"Yeah."
01:20:48,380;01:20:51,180;"That bell check quote all time."
01:20:51,180;01:20:51,660;"Yeah."
01:20:51,660;01:20:52,580;"Yeah."
01:20:52,580;01:20:53,780;"You can print that."
01:20:53,780;01:20:54,780;"You can print that."
01:20:54,780;01:20:55,300;"Yeah."
01:20:55,300;01:20:56,940;"No, people don't print anything anymore."
01:20:56,940;01:20:57,820;"They put on the internet."
01:20:57,820;01:21:00,340;"No, but that's the best part is you can print that."
01:21:00,340;01:21:02,020;"Tell him I said this."
01:21:04,460;01:21:10,300;"Unbelievable. All right. My best and worst. Steve, I'm surprised you didn't go with this."
01:21:10,300;01:21:14,620;"David Givens has his fifth straight playoff game, the touch and catch."
01:21:14,620;01:21:19,020;"Fucking record. I don't know. I was going to be up there."
01:21:19,020;01:21:25,740;"Stalworth with eight. Really? Yeah. The Patriots? No, no, not Dante."
01:21:29,180;01:21:34,340;"Oh, okay. The guy in the charge chairs? No. All work. Alls."
01:21:34,340;01:21:36,460;"We're so good at this."
01:21:36,460;01:21:40,580;"This isn't there an all worth that is in a trap charger?"
01:21:40,580;01:21:44,220;"John Stalworth. Yeah, there's a like a receiver back in like the"
01:21:44,220;01:21:46,860;"I'm thinking it lands all the Steelers guy."
01:21:46,860;01:21:48,860;"John Stalworth. Yeah."
01:21:48,860;01:21:49,340;"Yeah."
01:21:49,340;01:21:53,020;"Lance Bambi all worth. Lance all worth it."
01:21:53,020;01:21:53,940;"Yeah. For the same."
01:21:53,940;01:21:56,100;"You're chargers. Oh, the chargers. Right. Yeah."
01:21:56,100;01:21:58,860;"It's an all fan. Anyway, great."
01:21:58,860;01:22:05,140;"Speaking of records, Tom Brady, youngest quarterback to start in three Super Bowls."
01:22:05,140;01:22:07,140;"That probably still stands, I would think."
01:22:07,140;01:22:11,620;"I don't know any other quarterback since then who has started in three Super Bowls, right?"
01:22:11,620;01:22:12,620;"Yeah."
01:22:12,620;01:22:14,620;"My homes is two."
01:22:14,620;01:22:15,620;"Yeah, two."
01:22:15,620;01:22:16,620;"Yeah."
01:22:16,620;01:22:23,700;"And then also, I don't really have it worse."
01:22:23,700;01:22:28,300;"My worst is, if Fred X, he fucking sucks."
01:22:28,300;01:22:39,700;"I also have an interesting thing that I noticed when the Eagles were pinned deep and they"
01:22:39,700;01:22:41,700;"were punting."
01:22:41,700;01:22:45,540;"Pages charted out Troy Brown as a partner turner, but they also actually put Bethel"
01:22:45,540;01:22:48,620;"Johnson behind him as like the deep punter turner."
01:22:48,620;01:22:51,780;"And so Troy Brown was like the upman for it."
01:22:51,780;01:22:55,740;"And I was interested to see if Bethel Johnson would actually get a partner turn because"
01:22:55,740;01:23:05,540;"I think he was probably a better returner generally, but he wasn't as safe with his hands, I think, as Troy Brown was."
01:23:05,540;01:23:10,940;"So I was surprised to see like, oh, that specific situation where they put Bethel Johnson back there."
01:23:10,940;01:23:14,700;"But the punt was short, so Troy Brown took it anyway."
01:23:14,700;01:23:24,620;"And also one last thing was an interesting factoid that the Eagles in 2004 played the Vikings and Patriots in the playoffs."
01:23:24,620;01:23:38,620;"for the first time because the next time they would make Super Bowl, they would play the Vikings, the Falcons, and then again the Patriots in 2017, which we will get to eventually probably probably not."
01:23:38,620;01:23:40,620;"We shall see."
01:23:40,620;01:23:44,620;"In twenty five, we'll get to that game."
01:23:44,620;01:23:47,620;"We just at this end of the gold in the years."
01:23:47,620;01:23:48,620;"Yeah, at this pace."
01:23:48,620;01:23:49,620;"No chance."
01:23:49,620;01:23:50,620;"Right."
01:23:50,620;01:23:55,380;"So it was interesting they had the exact same route to their Super Bowl again"
01:23:55,380;01:23:58,460;"That is interesting"
01:23:58,460;01:24:02,700;"So I think that kind of wraps it up unless you boys have anything else on the"
01:24:02,700;01:24:05,940;"2004 Super Bowl 39 one of the"
01:24:05,940;01:24:08,580;"last of the"
01:24:08,580;01:24:10,780;"logoed Super Bowls"
01:24:10,780;01:24:13,940;"Before they went to their formula formulaic"
01:24:13,940;01:24:18,820;"Logos no, this is a fun season to watch though. This was yeah"
01:24:18,820;01:24:20,980;"Yeah, this is probably the best Patriots team."
01:24:20,980;01:24:24,180;"I'll close three for sure."
01:24:24,180;01:24:26,980;"I would like Corey Dillon edition."
01:24:26,980;01:24:29,780;"I was not playing more and the Vince Wolf work made it."
01:24:29,780;01:24:33,300;"And Brady just being a little more experienced."
01:24:33,300;01:24:35,860;"Yeah, Brady kind of coming into his prime, right?"
01:24:35,860;01:24:37,140;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:24:37,140;01:24:37,700;"Yeah."
01:24:37,700;01:24:38,860;"Yeah, absolutely."
01:24:38,860;01:24:41,140;"All right, should we skip the next, what, 10 years or so?"
01:24:41,140;01:24:41,900;"Yep."
01:24:41,900;01:24:43,220;"Yeah, just fast forward."
01:24:43,220;01:24:45,180;"Yeah, we'll go to 2007."
01:24:45,180;01:24:46,780;"Yeah, except for the last game."
01:24:46,780;01:24:48,260;"Yeah, it'll do."
01:24:48,260;01:24:52,660;"We'll do the 2007 regular season and then, uh, I'm in on that."
01:24:52,660;01:24:53,780;"Yeah."
01:24:53,780;01:24:54,300;"All right."
01:24:54,300;01:24:58,260;"Well, congratulations on getting through the 2004 season boys and"
01:24:58,260;01:24:59,260;"what about it?"
01:24:59,260;01:25:00,820;"Listen to this."
01:25:00,820;01:25:02,500;"This has been a good time."

00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:17,680;"I am not your mother."
00:17,680;00:18,680;"Welcome back."
00:18,680;00:25,600;"Page of the Dynasty Podcast."
00:25,600;00:31,060;"We are in the last week of the 2003 regular season."
00:31,060;00:33,800;"Patriots hosting the Buffalo Bills."
00:33,800;00:37,820;"And I, your host, Annie Brown, I'm hosting both my brothers today."
00:37,820;00:39,320;"Steve, how's it going?"
00:39,320;00:40,320;"Good."
00:40,320;00:44,040;"We're almost on one full year of quarantine."
00:44,040;00:45,040;"Almost exactly, yes."
00:45,040;00:49,560;"Because today is the 11th of March and I think it happened on the 13th."
00:49,560;00:53,720;"Well, how do you put a date on it?"
00:53,720;01:00,660;"Well, we when schools got shut down. We're on record predicting when it would end right yes"
01:00,660;01:08,240;"Not too far from one year ago and nobody does the year correct. Yeah, I think I was the closest and I said September"
01:08,240;01:10,000;"Of last year"
01:10,000;01:17,200;"And Greg definitely laughed at you. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, all of you and Milo was on at that point too, and he he laughed the hardest. Yes"
01:17,200;01:19,120;"Yeah"
01:19,120;01:21,120;"So I win I guess"
01:21,520;01:24,220;"No, I just lost less than you"
01:24,220;01:32,940;"Also, this is Greg Brown nice to see you Greg. It's great to see you too Andy. How you doing bud?"
01:32,940;01:38,440;"Good revenge game. This is what I'm talking about. We're talking last week with"
01:38,440;01:41,220;"our buddy Tarek"
01:41,220;01:42,980;"who we had on"
01:42,980;01:44,980;"about how"
01:44,980;01:49,140;"If you were to write this as like a TV show or movie"
01:50,020;01:54,900;"People would say this ending is too predictable. Like if this were Friday night lights"
01:54,900;02:00,320;"Yeah, and that team lost 31 nothing to open the season and had like all the stuff go on and"
02:00,320;02:04,900;"The last game of season they played the same team and they won 30 with nothing. It would be like"
02:04,900;02:09,960;"Well, you gotta mix that up a bit. That's that's too obvious. It's too hot"
02:09,960;02:13,120;"That's why this season is somewhat forgettable"
02:13,120;02:18,980;"That's the season we start with the bills, you know, you kind of like throw up the mouse out there"
02:19,700;02:21,340;"That's true. Yeah, they did."
02:21,340;02:23,060;"The news was the lawyer and Malloy trade,"
02:23,060;02:25,340;"but that's also part of week one, you know,"
02:25,340;02:26,700;"the cutting of him."
02:26,700;02:28,060;"Yeah."
02:28,060;02:31,340;"And Rodney Harrison replacement."
02:31,340;02:32,300;"Who?"
02:32,300;02:33,300;"I mean, I love--"
02:33,300;02:33,780;"I love--"
02:33,780;02:38,020;"I love Lloyd Malloy, but it was the correct decision."
02:38,020;02:39,540;"Yeah, Rodney bald out."
02:39,540;02:41,540;"He was amazing."
02:41,540;02:42,140;"Even if he was--"
02:42,140;02:43,860;"He was a game?"
02:43,860;02:45,220;"Favorite game."
02:45,220;02:47,780;"From the forgettable of the three season."
02:47,780;02:50,420;"I don't think it was that forgettable."
02:50,420;02:55,220;"No, I remembered more than I expected to in this."
02:55,220;03:00,460;"Yeah, but I didn't put that Broncos game to the Super Bowl season."
03:00,460;03:01,460;"Yeah."
03:01,460;03:02,460;"True."
03:02,460;03:03,460;"True."
03:03,460;03:05,660;"Yeah, there was a lot of games I didn't realize with this year."
03:05,660;03:06,660;"Yeah."
03:06,660;03:09,980;"I thought that would be like next year, something like that, or way later in the dynasty."
03:09,980;03:14,220;"Or even the dolphins overtime game."
03:14,220;03:16,780;"Yeah, the Troy Brown bomb."
03:16,780;03:20,780;"- Cold game, right."
03:20,780;03:21,780;"- Willie McGinnis."
03:21,780;03:26,780;"- Yeah, this has been hell of a season."
03:26,780;03:30,780;"- I have a new ranking format."
03:30,780;03:33,780;"Since I don't watch the games."
03:33,780;03:34,780;"- Okay."
03:34,780;03:35,780;"- Yeah."
03:35,780;03:38,780;"So instead of giving however many trophies."
03:38,780;03:39,780;"- Yep."
03:39,780;03:42,780;"- I'm putting them into classifications."
03:42,780;03:43,780;"- All right."
03:43,780;03:45,780;"- Do you want to hear my classifications here?"
03:45,780;03:52,780;"I do, I do. Okay. The first and highest classification is called the title game."
03:52,780;03:59,780;"Okay. So the criteria being, can you describe the game and four words or less?"
03:59,780;04:03,780;"Yes. So for instance, without the last game we watched, Stephen,"
04:03,780;04:07,780;"how would you describe the last game we watched last week? Oh, yeah."
04:07,780;04:09,780;"I love you, Susie."
04:09,780;04:10,780;"I love you, Susie."
04:10,780;04:13,260;"The kissing Susie Colberg."
04:13,260;04:13,580;"Yeah."
04:13,580;04:18,900;"But you don't remember the game from current, you know, like that's what I"
04:18,900;04:20,260;"think is a distinction of."
04:20,260;04:24,460;"So there that actually kind of leads me to my second point."
04:24,460;04:28,260;"So the next categorization is what I'm calling the thumbnail game."
04:28,260;04:35,300;"So can you, if you put a picture as the thumbnail for like the podcast,"
04:35,300;04:38,940;"could you immediately recognize what game we're talking about just from a"
04:38,940;04:46,080;"still shot like the dolphins game dolphins game the intentional safety game"
04:46,080;04:50,760;"William McGinnis game that's a thumbnail game with him like running down the field"
04:50,760;04:59,920;"pointing up yeah the next classification hidden gems where it's like a great game"
04:59,920;05:04,760;"that's been lost to the sands of time where it's there's no like one defining"
05:04,760;05:10,160;"play or it's not like a Super Bowl or you know you can't just be like oh yeah"
05:10,160;05:15,980;"Rams Rams second Super Bowl. I would put Panther Super Bowl. Those are title"
05:15,980;05:23,300;"games 2001 against the Chargers in that Brady's first comeback. That's actually"
05:23,300;05:27,900;"one of the games I haven't seen. Yeah yeah yeah. The Chiefs came from last year."
05:27,900;05:34,280;"Yes. Jim. Absolutely. And then the next classification is business as usual."
05:34,280;05:39,500;"Nothing remarkable, but so like every Jets game. Yeah."
05:39,500;05:41,180;"Pretty much the majority."
05:41,180;05:43,880;"A lot of the bills gains get like that real soon."
05:43,880;05:44,880;"Yeah."
05:44,880;05:45,880;"Yeah."
05:45,880;05:50,180;"And then slog fest. That's the last where it's like every Browns game."
05:50,180;05:51,180;"Yeah."
05:51,180;05:52,480;"A lot of the losses."
05:52,480;05:56,680;"Is that five categories or six Greg?"
05:56,680;05:57,680;"That's five."
05:57,680;06:02,480;"I feel like we can come up with one more and then just put like all losses."
06:02,480;06:03,480;"Yeah."
06:03,480;06:07,720;"losses losses. Yeah. So we just assign a Lombardi to each"
06:07,720;06:11,160;"different one of those. I know I kind of like this"
06:11,160;06:14,280;"classification now. Oh yeah. I think we could use that."
06:14,280;06:16,840;"Title game is six Lombardis. Yeah."
06:16,840;06:18,840;"And the thumbnail game is five Lombardis."
06:18,840;06:24,200;"Yeah, it fits. I love it. That's nice. Yeah."
06:24,200;06:26,440;"Which begs the question, what is this game?"
06:26,440;06:28,600;"I was just going to ask you that. How would you?"
06:28,600;06:32,440;"I know. It's a tough one to pick because it's not really a"
06:32,440;06:36,040;"thumbnail game you can't you can't really just take a still shot and be like yeah"
06:36,040;06:41,840;"yeah I mean maybe like a picture of it being week 17 31 nothing that's not"
06:41,840;06:45,400;"just gonna clue you but you think a picture of the scoreboard mm-hmm"
06:45,400;06:50,160;"not a really business as usual because this like stands out it was like oh yeah"
06:50,160;06:54,400;"that was a pretty unique game and it was yeah it was it was also not really a"
06:54,400;06:58,240;"hidden gem either because yeah everybody knows it like again the yeah the two"
06:58,240;07:01,600;"So the first almost 30 it's almost a title case."
07:01,600;07:02,600;"She's already failed."
07:02,600;07:06,160;"It's almost a title game because you could say 31 nothing."
07:06,160;07:09,960;"Yeah, well, if you combine it with the first with week one,"
07:09,960;07:11,840;"then it's a title game."
07:11,840;07:14,040;"Because if you like roll all the highlights together, right?"
07:14,040;07:15,400;"It was like, oh, yeah, the loss sucked."
07:15,400;07:17,920;"We could back and then we won."
07:17,920;07:19,480;"It was a pretty unique game with a patient."
07:19,480;07:19,980;"Yeah."
07:19,980;07:21,080;"I thought they almost need to be--"
07:21,080;07:22,600;"They're the first half."
07:22,600;07:24,080;"They shit stomp the bills."
07:24,080;07:26,560;"Worse than the bill, shit stomped us."
07:26,560;07:32,760;"I feel like there needs to be one more classification below loss,"
07:32,760;07:37,040;"which is what the week one was, where it's just like a shit stomping."
07:37,040;07:41,760;"See, see that I almost would classify as a thumbnail game."
07:41,760;07:43,400;"You think so?"
07:43,400;07:47,880;"Like you can show me a picture of Sam Adams returning an interception in Buffalo."
07:47,880;07:50,240;"And I'll go, I know exactly what game that is."
07:50,240;07:55,360;"You know, that's probably true because there aren't many blowouts."
07:55,360;08:00,360;"in this dynasty."
08:00,360;08:03,360;"- 'Cause I think we decided that the week one"
08:03,360;08:04,760;"was the worst one, right?"
08:04,760;08:05,600;"- I think so, right?"
08:05,600;08:07,520;"That was their worst loss."
08:07,520;08:08,360;"- Yeah."
08:08,360;08:09,720;"- In the dynasty history."
08:09,720;08:10,560;"- I think so."
08:10,560;08:11,380;"- Yeah."
08:11,380;08:12,360;"- It would make sense."
08:12,360;08:14,720;"- So yeah, minus 31 was the worst."
08:14,720;08:19,440;"There's only been four games where they've lost"
08:19,440;08:23,080;"by more than 25 and more was in 2000."
08:23,080;08:26,440;"That was Brady's first game, right through three passes."
08:26,440;08:30,960;"And then 2008, 2008 to the Dolphins."
08:30,960;08:32,320;"- The Lions."
08:32,320;08:35,960;"- Yeah, and then the Chiefs to open 2014."
08:35,960;08:37,760;"Not to open, but when they got blown out."
08:37,760;08:40,360;"- Oh, that was Ronda Cincinnati, yeah."
08:40,360;08:42,280;"- Yeah, that's better."
08:42,280;08:44,280;"- So that's a name game too."
08:44,280;08:45,120;"- Yeah."
08:45,120;08:46,560;"- I'm gonna give this one the name."
08:46,560;08:48,440;"I'm gonna lump it in with the other,"
08:48,440;08:50,680;"although it was part hidden gem too."
08:50,680;08:52,920;"We're at least the first half."
08:52,920;08:53,960;"I don't know about a hidden gem."
08:53,960;08:57,440;"This is I think it's kind of it's over shadow."
08:57,440;09:00,240;"But I don't want one lost to because it can't quite thumbnail."
09:00,240;09:03,240;"Like Greg said, but there is some highlight plays in this game for sure."
09:03,240;09:03,920;"Oh, yeah."
09:03,920;09:04,280;"Yeah."
09:04,280;09:06,200;"And I managed to pull a chock full."
09:06,200;09:06,680;"Yeah."
09:06,680;09:08,160;"And David Gibbons all over it."
09:08,160;09:09,120;"Hmm."
09:09,120;09:09,800;"Yeah."
09:09,800;09:11,120;"This is definitely David Gibbons game."
09:11,120;09:11,600;"This one."
09:11,600;09:15,360;"David Gibbons and Teddy Bruski."
09:15,360;09:19,280;"Probably game balls on each side of the side of the ball."
09:19,280;09:20,360;"Would you agree?"
09:20,360;09:22,360;"Bruski was a Tom Brady."
09:22,360;09:27,360;"- Bro, you played well, but he didn't have to do much actually."
09:27,360;09:30,280;"- I mean, for four touchdown passes, no picks."
09:30,280;09:33,360;"He was AFC player of the week, offensive player."
09:33,360;09:34,200;"- Yeah, no, he had no idea."
09:34,200;09:37,200;"- Yeah, for four touchdown passes on like 200 yards though."
09:37,200;09:39,200;"It wasn't like he was slinging all over the place."
09:39,200;09:41,840;"- Yeah, but this is 2003."
09:41,840;09:45,400;"That is like 600 yards in the modern NFL."
09:45,400;09:46,240;"- That's true."
09:46,240;09:51,240;"Also, he ran for 20, something yards, 22 yards."
09:51,240;09:57,560;"something yards 22 yards, five three yards 23 yards, better numbers in Antoine Smith,"
09:57,560;09:58,320;"but up all year."
09:58,320;10:00,840;"Just got onto yards last week."
10:00,840;10:05,560;"Which was the first hundred yard Russia they had on the season."
10:05,560;10:07,440;"Yeah, but you want to guess."
10:07,440;10:10,600;"Uh, so 23 yards on five carries."
10:10,600;10:15,120;"You want to guess where that ranks in Tom Brady Russian games."
10:15,120;10:21,220;"It's got to be first, second, no, third, four, no, fifth,"
10:21,220;10:23,220;"Fifth? Fifth."
10:23,220;10:29,220;"His most will be 2006."
10:29,220;10:31,860;"You'll rush for 31 yards against the Jaguars."
10:31,860;10:34,860;"- Relific."
10:34,860;10:38,460;"- That's a title game."
10:38,460;10:40,200;"- On 10 carries."
10:40,200;10:41,540;"- 10 carries."
10:41,540;10:43,260;"- 3.1 yards a carry."
10:43,260;10:49,260;"The next one, 2011 at Philadelphia."
10:49,540;10:51,180;"Five carries 28 yards."
10:51,180;10:55,660;"And then the other two games are ones"
10:55,660;10:57,540;"we've already seen apparently."
10:57,540;11:00,060;"2002 against the Packers,"
11:00,060;11:02,580;"he rushed for 26 yards."
11:02,580;11:06,660;"And then 2002 against the Jets,"
11:06,660;11:08,380;"he rushed for 24 yards."
11:08,380;11:10,500;"- They were calling a lot more like,"
11:10,500;11:12,140;"Tom Brady would just get it and be able to run."
11:12,140;11:14,300;"Like when the linebacker wasn't there."
11:14,300;11:16,780;"And sometimes they call sneaks on like third and six"
11:16,780;11:17,620;"and stuff like that too."
11:17,620;11:20,220;"- Yeah, you do it way more aggressively then."
11:20,220;11:23,420;"- And this was like my favorite thing"
11:23,420;11:24,660;"that they got away from."
11:24,660;11:26,780;"I don't know if this was just like a Charlie Weiss thing"
11:26,780;11:28,020;"or whatever, but they would,"
11:28,020;11:31,980;"and it would kind of happen a lot in the no huddle"
11:31,980;11:35,460;"where you'd see them go five wide receiver"
11:35,460;11:37,260;"and brave just get up on the center."
11:37,260;11:39,700;"And because the defense was so spread out,"
11:39,700;11:41,260;"you just run straight up the middle"
11:41,260;11:44,380;"and get five, six, 10, 11 yards."
11:44,380;11:47,580;"- Probably just didn't want to get hurt."
11:47,580;11:51,400;"Yeah, I mean, I guess because he almost blew his knee out in this game, which I did not"
11:51,400;11:52,400;"remember at all."
11:52,400;11:53,400;"Yeah."
11:53,400;11:55,700;"Thanks to his best buddy, Loy Malloy."
11:55,700;11:57,700;"That shit was."
11:57,700;12:00,900;"No, it was it was shades of two salaries."
12:00,900;12:02,100;"An eight Bernard Pollard hit."
12:02,100;12:03,100;"Exactly."
12:03,100;12:04,100;"Yeah, except it was all."
12:04,100;12:05,100;"Same kind of like."
12:05,100;12:07,380;"Except Brady wasn't trying to do it."
12:07,380;12:09,580;"Yeah, I don't remember this at all."
12:09,580;12:12,660;"But that was a it was a terrible look."
12:12,660;12:14,380;"Someone fell on his leg dick."
12:14,380;12:16,580;"Did you hear that?"
12:16,580;12:18,700;"- What? - No."
12:18,700;12:21,220;"- 'Cause it was Dick Emberg, right?"
12:21,220;12:23,060;"And as he was throwing it,"
12:23,060;12:26,300;"like Deodorov was like, boy,"
12:26,300;12:29,020;"it did pretty as someone fall on his leg dick."
12:29,020;12:31,020;"For some reason, he put like leg dick,"
12:31,020;12:32,860;"like, it sounded like one word."
12:32,860;12:36,380;"I was like, oh, what the hell are you talking about, Dan?"
12:36,380;12:38,300;"- That's what he does. - I thought he already know."
12:38,300;12:40,900;"- Oh, he's useless."
12:40,900;12:44,260;"- It's a little Freudian slip."
12:44,260;12:47,060;"- Oh, I can driftwood Brady."
12:47,060;12:48,900;"Third leg."
12:48,900;12:50,700;"(laughs)"
12:50,700;12:52,060;"- That's why his knee didn't buckle,"
12:52,060;12:54,260;"'cause it's fucking dick with supporting it."
12:54,260;12:55,260;"- Mm-hmm."
12:55,260;12:57,260;"Let's go with that tri-potties."
12:57,260;12:59,700;"- Well, did you hear what they were saying after,"
12:59,700;13:02,740;"where he's like, I think it was just,"
13:02,740;13:04,780;"dear, off was I like, all I could say is I hope"
13:04,780;13:06,900;"Tom Brady has some loose ligaments."
13:06,900;13:07,740;"(laughs)"
13:07,740;13:09,500;"Which is foreshadowing."
13:09,500;13:10,820;"- Oh, yeah, that's a great comment."
13:10,820;13:12,540;"- Great commentary by Dan."
13:12,540;13:15,920;"Speaking of since this is the"
13:15,920;13:18,520;"commentation section of the podcast,"
13:18,520;13:19,760;"I will have you know,"
13:19,760;13:22,920;"I'm wearing the gift that my brother's"
13:22,920;13:25,760;"I was gonna say generously got me,"
13:25,760;13:27,760;"but I don't have generous is the right word."
13:27,760;13:28,660;"It was a Christmas present."
13:28,660;13:30,160;"We were sort of obligated."
13:30,160;13:33,100;"Yes, there's a podcast related Christmas present"
13:33,100;13:35,100;"that I got this year that I haven't had a chance to wear yet,"
13:35,100;13:38,100;"but it is a number 72"
13:38,100;13:40,840;"Arizona Cardinals jersey."
13:40,840;13:42,240;"- Uh huh. - Yes."
13:42,240;13:45,840;"- With the last name, Deodorf, on the back."
13:45,840;13:47,280;"No Hall of Fame patches on it."
13:47,280;13:48,120;"I don't know if that's a thing."
13:48,120;13:49,280;"- Stitched."
13:49,280;13:51,680;"- We did ""Spare Dime."""
13:51,680;13:54,600;"- No, this is a thing, 'cause I knew Andy would be"
13:54,600;13:59,400;"only the best for our brother, our pal."
13:59,400;14:02,040;"I've been waiting for a Deodorf game to break this out,"
14:02,040;14:04,720;"'cause it didn't feel right otherwise."
14:04,720;14:06,700;"But here I am rocking the Deodorf."
14:06,700;14:08,320;"- You look great in it, my bad."
14:08,320;14:09,640;"- I'm good in red, you know?"
14:09,640;14:10,880;"Well, it just suits you."
14:10,880;14:13,000;"You're just your general aura."
14:13,000;14:13,840;"Yes."
14:13,840;14:17,400;"I will say, this feels like it was built this,"
14:17,400;14:21,480;"the sizing is probably Dan Deodorf size."
14:21,480;14:23,960;"So I like, I like to get to wear it as a dress."
14:23,960;14:26,520;"So I'm wearing this and nothing else,"
14:26,520;14:27,720;"just for you boys."
14:27,720;14:28,920;"So thank you."
14:28,920;14:33,200;"Dude imagine, I didn't go into like a Patriots game"
14:33,200;14:35,400;"with a Deodorf jersey on."
14:35,400;14:36,800;"You couldn't pay me enough."
14:36,800;14:37,640;"What are you doing like that?"
14:37,640;14:39,000;"I'm not kidding."
14:39,000;14:40,960;"Well, I know there's like be explainable."
14:40,960;14:43,520;"If you show up to a Patriots game and they're like,"
14:43,520;14:46,520;"yeah, just a huge fan of the commentators."
14:46,520;14:49,800;"I'm like, what the fuck is this kid doing?"
14:49,800;14:52,520;"Of all commentators too, we damn fuck the dear door."
14:52,520;14:54,520;"'Cause there's no one that's like alive"
14:54,520;14:57,080;"as a fan of dude or the player anymore."
14:57,080;14:58,080;"Yeah, no."
14:58,080;14:59,840;"No one's a fan of him as a commentator."
14:59,840;15:00,680;"Yeah, exactly."
15:00,680;15:02,040;"People hate it anymore as a commentator."
15:02,040;15:05,880;"So it'd be so confusing for like everyone at the stadium."
15:05,880;15:07,200;"Yeah, it really would."
15:07,200;15:08,720;"Although to be fair, I don't think I'll ever"
15:08,720;15:12,600;"aware that's not in public. So this is the public is just getting right now."
15:12,600;15:14,960;"Well, maybe we'll make a better something."
15:14,960;15:16,500;"Okay."
15:16,500;15:19,280;"Predict the pandemic."
15:19,280;15:20,840;"Maybe maybe we'll give it away."
15:20,840;15:23,560;"That's you dare."
15:23,560;15:26,760;"You wouldn't do that to us."
15:26,760;15:31,760;"Uh, I don't know if it was if it was him or Dick Enberg, but they kept calling"
15:31,760;15:33,160;"Teddy Bruski Ted Bruski."
15:33,160;15:34,760;"Well, that's what."
15:35,560;15:43,500;"That's bullshit Ted Bruce key and they said that Ted Bruce key he plays the sacks and he has some sacks"
15:43,500;15:47,360;"Like these what do you mean has some sacks?"
15:47,360;15:51,680;"He like a second this game. Oh, how many idiots?"
15:51,680;15:56,800;"No, you know who's the idiot over the fuck said that"
15:56,800;15:59,680;"Dan Deardo I he"
16:00,440;16:05,080;"They the two of them combined it's not just dandy enough. I can't put all the blame on him"
16:05,080;16:07,080;"But him and Dick emberg"
16:07,080;16:14,040;"Together they are like the personification of like every shitty commentator point of view or every like"
16:14,040;16:20,680;"Just awful like hot take they're not even hot take they're just like this stupid shit like"
16:20,680;16:26,600;"They were pissy like basically the entire second half that Brady was still in the game"
16:27,600;16:31,000;"Because like oh well, you know, you don't want it. Yeah, he's almost got a hard time"
16:31,000;16:34,800;"It was the beginning of the fourth quarter. No, it was in the third quarter"
16:34,800;16:39,820;"No, it was the fourth quarter that we should know because Brady was throwing and Dan Duda through a shit feel"
16:39,820;16:44,580;"I can't believe it they're out here throwing it with Tom Brady when I've got the game wrapped up and they're already gonna make the play out"
16:44,580;16:48,320;"Like no, I get it that it was a terrible take"
16:48,320;16:52,920;"Especially when Brady never comes out. I think it's also"
16:52,920;16:58,640;"And he's got a point that he just like wins. He finds a point that he feels strongly about"
16:58,640;17:01,760;"and repeats it over and over and over again. All right, dude."
17:01,760;17:07,680;"Come and we get it. Let's move on. How do you actually feel about a Dan? Like, Oh, fuck."
17:07,680;17:11,840;"And then every play is like validation of, Oh, well, you almost you got hit on now one."
17:11,840;17:17,560;"What if you got it? It's like, okay. All right, let's just comment the game here. I can't"
17:17,560;17:21,160;"I can't believe the bills brought it in the backup first before the pit. The bills have"
17:21,160;17:26,360;"been on fucking vacation mode this entire game. Like the fact that blood so even played in this"
17:26,360;17:33,640;"surprise me. Poor Drew Bledson. But he did predict loose ligaments being the direction Tom Brady"
17:33,640;17:38,840;"would go and it's off. And I actually have another plus Greg a bler a broken clock is right once."
17:38,840;17:44,200;"Well, it's twice a day actually because he had another great point depends on the peasant"
17:44,200;17:45,760;"if you're in military time."
17:45,760;17:51,700;"They were talking, they say in David Patton is kind of coming on similar to"
17:51,700;17:52,500;"Givens right now."
17:52,500;17:57,100;"So Givens has a sick game, a couple touchdowns and like a real sweet"
17:57,100;18:01,000;"head fake to get in the end zone on lawyer and the toe tap."
18:01,000;18:02,800;"Yeah, the toe tap touchdown too."
18:02,800;18:05,500;"He was following out in this game and they were saying, oh, he's coming on"
18:05,500;18:07,200;"because he's a seventh round pick or whatever."
18:07,200;18:10,700;"Just like Dion was."
18:10,700;18:11,700;"2001."
18:11,700;18:12,400;"Yeah."
18:12,700;18:17,700;"No, he said he said it with a it was patent in 2001 or a patent came out of the end of"
18:17,700;18:18,700;"the year."
18:18,700;18:20,060;"He came out of nowhere from the arena league that year."
18:20,060;18:23,100;"But I don't think patent came on at the end of the season though."
18:23,100;18:25,580;"Like he definitely turned it up late that year."
18:25,580;18:30,660;"Like he has the touchdown catch in the AFC gym, chicken, and soup bowl in yellow."
18:30,660;18:36,700;"Wasn't it like week five where he had a pass catch and a run for a touchdown?"
18:36,700;18:39,900;"Like he was on kind of all year."
18:39,900;18:41,380;"That's true."
18:41,380;18:46,460;"another point for Deidorff here I wrote down this quote. He throws compliments"
18:46,460;18:53,100;"around like manhole covers like that. That's good. That is pretty good. You know"
18:53,100;18:58,160;"hope you know a heavy manhole covers are Andy? Yeah. Yeah. You don't just go"
18:58,160;19:04,860;"throwing those around do you? Well you don't. I will say though they pulled in"
19:04,860;19:09,140;"the Bill's radio announcer guy. Yes. I've been doing it for a long time and I was"
19:09,140;19:10,620;"like, well, can we just listen to this?"
19:10,620;19:11,300;"Oh, yeah."
19:11,300;19:12,260;"Can we just keep it here?"
19:12,260;19:13,300;"That's how you as a blow."
19:13,300;19:15,020;"They're like, Oh, well, look, we've got here."
19:15,020;19:16,660;"Let's listen in on him for a little bit."
19:16,660;19:23,260;"OK, I mean, but I have a counterpoint to your your your"
19:23,260;19:25,220;"pluses counter counter."
19:25,220;19:25,860;"Yeah."
19:25,860;19:28,220;"So I'm just going to debate teen here."
19:28,220;19:31,540;"I'm just going to let this talk for me."
19:31,540;19:34,740;"Understandably, a lot of long faces on the bill."
19:34,740;19:38,940;"Sideline Greg, how top of the task is it as a coach to go into the locker room now"
19:38,940;19:41,740;"and tell your guys how important it is to try to go out on a positive note."
19:41,740;19:42,540;"Well, they're pros."
19:42,540;19:45,460;"You know, we've got to go out and try to get off the field better on deep fan."
19:45,460;19:46,620;"They spread us out a little bit."
19:46,620;19:48,220;"Didn't make any plays."
19:48,220;19:50,940;"We didn't capitalize on the one turnover we did get."
19:50,940;19:52,020;"Our guys have come out."
19:52,020;19:53,980;"We'll be a little bit more wide open here in the second half,"
19:53,980;19:55,500;"and we've got to finish it strong."
19:55,500;19:57,100;"Thank you."
19:57,100;19:59,580;"Quality man, Greg Williams, you've got to empathize."
19:59,580;20:05,980;"I'm sorry."
20:05,980;20:07,580;"What was that, Dan Deodorf?"
20:07,580;20:08,580;"quality man."
20:08,580;20:13,820;"Understandably, a lot of quality man Greg Williams is God empathize quality man Greg"
20:13,820;20:17,100;"quality man Greg Williams is God empathize."
20:17,100;20:18,100;"Do you though?"
20:18,100;20:22,300;"I will I refuse to empathize with Greg Williams."
20:22,300;20:25,740;"Yeah, the worst, the worst."
20:25,740;20:30,460;"And they kept talking him up about how like all the players like, Oh, I can't believe"
20:30,460;20:34,260;"how great he's like stuck with us through this whole season, even though we suck."
20:34,260;20:35,940;"What the fuck choices you have?"
20:35,940;20:37,260;"Like it's, he sucks."
20:37,260;20:38,620;"You like you suck because of him."
20:38,620;20:39,660;"Like he's the coach."
20:39,660;20:43,540;"This is got two Gs in his name."
20:43,540;20:44,980;"He's selling the Greg."
20:44,980;20:45,820;"Oh my God."
20:45,820;20:46,820;"I guess three Gs."
20:46,820;20:49,940;"Yeah, he's awful."
20:49,940;20:52,500;"So do we want to just talk about the,"
20:52,500;20:56,260;"the potential complications of this game?"
20:56,260;20:57,100;"Yes."
20:57,100;20:58,020;"What the Patriots are playing for?"
20:58,020;21:00,180;"Cause this is week 17."
21:00,180;21:02,540;"Yeah, this is the last week."
21:02,540;21:04,300;"There's a bunch of stuff on the line."
21:05,300;21:10,300;"It took a screenshot of the graphic that they had up"
21:10,300;21:15,340;"because two teams in the AFC were undefeated"
21:15,340;21:17,020;"at home this season."
21:17,020;21:20,860;"The Chiefs 12 and three who have,"
21:20,860;21:21,980;"they start off undefeated."
21:21,980;21:23,720;"They went like nine and O,"
21:23,720;21:25,780;"but have struggled down the stretch here."
21:25,780;21:29,000;"And I believe this game was on a Saturday."
21:29,000;21:35,260;"And so the Chiefs are hosting the Bears the day after."
21:35,260;21:36,740;"who are seven and eight."
21:36,740;21:40,140;"And the Patriots again are a game up,"
21:40,140;21:43,900;"but if the Patriots lost this game,"
21:43,900;21:48,460;"and the Chiefs won, there would be tie for a record,"
21:48,460;21:51,020;"but I think the Chiefs would have a tiebreaker"
21:51,020;21:52,740;"somewhere down the road on..."
21:52,740;21:55,660;"- I don't know. - I'm an opponent."
21:55,660;21:57,020;"- Yeah, something like that, yeah."
21:57,020;21:59,660;"Or like conference, whatever."
21:59,660;22:04,860;"- So yeah, and the Chiefs do end up winning that game."
22:04,860;22:07,580;"So this is basically the battle for the one seed."
22:07,580;22:08,080;"Yeah."
22:08,080;22:08,580;"Yeah."
22:08,580;22:11,780;"And that's probably part of the reason Brady was in there"
22:11,780;22:13,100;"for as long as he was."
22:13,100;22:13,380;"Right."
22:13,380;22:16,780;"Just to make sure which is what Belichick said at halftime,"
22:16,780;22:18,060;"too, is what they said."
22:18,060;22:22,020;"And also both teams really good at home."
22:22,020;22:24,020;"But the Chiefs-- like the Patriots, obviously,"
22:24,020;22:25,420;"both teams undefeated."
22:25,420;22:31,060;"The Patriots were averaging 20 to 10 wins,"
22:31,060;22:34,140;"like 20 points for 10 points against the Chiefs"
22:34,140;22:38,380;"On the other hand, averaging 34, almost 35 points a game at home."
22:38,380;22:42,300;"Um, well, when allowing only 17, so that, I mean, that's."
22:42,300;22:47,340;"Like for the chiefs, it's kind of a big deal to want to win at home."
22:47,340;22:49,220;"Or want to play at home."
22:49,220;22:49,580;"So."
22:49,580;22:55,460;"You're also denying the chiefs that, um,"
22:55,460;22:58,700;"I don't know what I'm looking for."
22:58,700;22:59,820;"Advantage."
22:59,820;23:00,180;"Yeah."
23:00,180;23:01,700;"Home field advantage."
23:01,820;23:03,000;"Arrowhead's no joke either."
23:03,000;23:04,460;"That's true."
23:04,460;23:04,980;"Yeah."
23:04,980;23:05,760;"Yeah, especially at this point."
23:05,760;23:06,480;"Yeah."
23:06,480;23:07,480;"And priest homes."
23:07,480;23:08,040;"Peace."
23:08,040;23:08,780;"Yeah."
23:08,780;23:10,920;"So were there any other, um,"
23:10,920;23:16,640;"was there anything else on the line Greg, like around the league for this week?"
23:16,640;23:18,200;"Yeah, do you want?"
23:18,200;23:19,040;"I mean, I have."
23:19,040;23:20,660;"So this is obviously week 17."
23:20,660;23:26,560;"So there's a lot of maybe we get, we, we touch on it after we talk about the game."
23:26,560;23:27,720;"All right."
23:27,720;23:27,960;"Yeah."
23:27,960;23:28,400;"Yeah."
23:28,400;23:30,400;"Cause it's a lot of like results based stuff."
23:30,400;23:31,300;"That's what I figured."
23:31,300;23:31,500;"Yeah."
23:31,500;23:32,000;"Okay."
23:32,000;23:34,800;"All right."
23:34,800;23:39,560;"So in terms of if you want to watch this game, I would say,"
23:39,560;23:41,040;"watch the first half."
23:41,040;23:41,540;"Yeah."
23:41,540;23:41,800;"Yeah."
23:41,800;23:42,240;"First half."
23:42,240;23:45,720;"And watch kind of like the end of the, hey, you can watch the fourth quarter to"
23:45,720;23:47,140;"watch the first, not even fourth quarter."
23:47,140;23:48,040;"Watch your first half."
23:48,040;23:50,040;"And then the last couple minutes to watch that."
23:50,040;23:52,240;"I and T that we all know the game ceiling one."
23:52,240;23:52,780;"Yeah."
23:52,780;23:57,880;"Um, that I think is you could, that could be your thumbnail, Greg."
23:57,880;23:58,480;"There you go."
23:58,480;24:00,080;"I don't know."
24:00,080;24:00,920;"- That's not the number."
24:00,920;24:01,760;"- Yeah."
24:01,760;24:02,580;"- Yeah."
24:02,580;24:04,640;"- I didn't remember it was an interception until."
24:04,640;24:05,480;"- Oh really?"
24:05,480;24:06,320;"- I remember the interception."
24:06,320;24:07,360;"I thought it was Teddy Bruski."
24:07,360;24:08,920;"- I thought it was a fourth down play."
24:08,920;24:12,360;"I remember like a goal line stop at the end of the game."
24:12,360;24:13,200;"- No, yeah."
24:13,200;24:15,320;"I thought they put their starters back in."
24:15,320;24:17,400;"- I thought they put their starters back in too Andy."
24:17,400;24:18,240;"- Yeah."
24:18,240;24:19,080;"- But they didn't."
24:19,080;24:19,920;"- No."
24:19,920;24:21,720;"- Which was even better when,"
24:21,720;24:23,960;"'cause it was Larry Izzo with the Unisoyant to end it."
24:23,960;24:24,800;"- He does, it was Izzo."
24:24,800;24:26,200;"- To keep the 31 nothing."
24:26,200;24:29,400;"- He was playing two, he was one guy versus two."
24:29,400;24:32,960;"He had the guy in the fly and the guy deep and he like bumps the guy in the flat goes deep,"
24:32,960;24:33,960;"makes interception."
24:33,960;24:34,540;"Yeah."
24:34,540;24:41,360;"And then I thought it was Teddy because like Teddy flips the fuck out and is like on the field"
24:41,360;24:44,240;"and they had like this crazy hugging party in the midfield."
24:44,240;24:44,960;"It was awesome."
24:44,960;24:46,000;"Yeah."
24:46,000;24:47,720;"With the entire defense and Troy Brown there."
24:47,720;24:49,840;"They are so fucking stoked."
24:49,840;24:53,360;"So yeah, it was a fucking hell of a party at the end of it."
24:53,360;24:57,960;"Um, yeah, I think the first quarter is basically the Patriots offense."
24:58,720;25:00,320;"did whatever the hell they wanted."
25:00,320;25:05,760;"The defense against the number two ranked defense"
25:05,760;25:07,280;"in the NFL."
25:07,280;25:08,200;"- Where are they?"
25:08,200;25:09,040;"- I missed that."
25:09,040;25:10,160;"- So Buffalo had a tough year."
25:10,160;25:11,760;"Yeah, they had a tough year."
25:11,760;25:12,760;"- Oh, they were, that's right."
25:12,760;25:14,560;"- In terms of yardage,"
25:14,560;25:17,040;"they were the number two defense in the NFL."
25:17,040;25:18,720;"And they were number five for a pricing,"
25:18,720;25:21,160;"which is for points against as well."
25:21,160;25:22,000;"- Yeah."
25:22,000;25:22,840;"- So another defense is sick."
25:22,840;25:24,080;"They had playmakers everywhere."
25:24,080;25:25,400;"- Yeah. - They're off top five defense."
25:25,400;25:26,920;"- They're off top five defense though."
25:26,920;25:27,760;"- Yo, yeah."
25:27,760;25:29,100;"They're running faster."
25:29,100;25:29,620;"Good drew blood."
25:29,620;25:30,220;"So it was good."
25:30,220;25:32,520;"It also felt like the whole line."
25:32,520;25:33,600;"And I don't know."
25:33,600;25:35,020;"It may have been day and year or two."
25:35,020;25:39,940;"The point that's out that it seemed like the defense wasn't trying."
25:39,940;25:44,740;"The Bill Zefans wasn't running at 100% effort either on the Bethel"
25:44,740;25:47,540;"Johnson touchdown where I don't remember."
25:47,540;25:48,840;"I miss my boy."
25:48,840;25:49,820;"Yeah."
25:49,820;25:50,880;"You have his jersey, right?"
25:50,880;25:54,780;"Kind of half asked it and got stiff armed in the chest and just like didn't"
25:54,780;25:56,320;"even really try to make the tackle."
25:56,580;26:02,480;"Your Bethel is is this is like peak battle because he's been playing awesome these last couple weeks to he's had a kickass year"
26:02,480;26:08,460;"I'm I'm hyped on Bethel right now. Yeah, there's a look so much better. I don't know how he didn't"
26:08,460;26:16,820;"Stick because yeah, he's been playing great. He and not just I mean, okay, so yeah, oh I gotta I gotta get comparison"
26:16,820;26:20,980;"Cordero Patterson"
26:21,460;26:26,580;"Mmm. No, that's like shift here. No, I just mean from like a game impact, right?"
26:26,580;26:28,460;"He's not like he's not you're not giving him like"
26:28,460;26:34,680;"10 10 targets a game or anything, but like every time he gets the ball. He seems to do something that's like, okay"
26:34,680;26:39,220;"That's okay. That's a big and and his his biggest contribution is on kickoffs"
26:39,220;26:46,660;"And even in this game, I think Bethel Johnson's biggest contribution was kickoff coverage. Yes because"
26:47,660;26:53,820;"Antonio Brown the other Antonio Brown the bills Antonio Brown was a kick off one. I looked it up"
26:53,820;26:58,820;"I was like what no well. Yes. No, it's not the same way. We were over we went over this week one. I think"
26:58,820;27:06,700;"It's the Antonio Brown that you draft by accident and fantasy and kick yourself"
27:06,700;27:15,500;"But yeah, so he was a bit of a burner in this and Bethel Johnson rained him down on kickoffs"
27:15,500;27:17,700;"that probably would have been touchdowns otherwise."
27:17,700;27:20,900;"Like, ran this guy down from behind"
27:20,900;27:22,700;"when nobody else could catch him,"
27:22,700;27:24,460;"like from the other side of the field on one of them."
27:24,460;27:26,020;"So Bethel Johnson, yeah."
27:26,020;27:27,420;"I'm big on him in this."
27:27,420;27:30,180;"And like, that's the kind of players you like"
27:30,180;27:32,180;"that make the most of their opportunities."
27:32,180;27:36,740;"Yeah. And so I'm kind of, but I think it was a couple of weeks ago,"
27:36,740;27:38,100;"maybe in the Jags game,"
27:38,100;27:40,900;"they said that he didn't play because"
27:40,900;27:44,620;"something to do with his preparation for the game wasn't up to snuff."
27:44,620;27:47,260;"like it wasn't the pages weren't happy with it."
27:47,260;27:48,540;"So they'd like bench him for a game."
27:48,540;27:52,220;"So there may have been something else going on there, but every time he's on"
27:52,220;27:53,220;"the field, he does something."
27:53,220;27:54,820;"He makes a, he makes a difference."
27:54,820;27:56,420;"He like wasn't prepared."
27:56,420;27:58,060;"So he didn't even dress."
27:58,060;27:59,140;"Yeah."
27:59,140;28:01,660;"I'm so prepared well enough for the week or some, some show you that."
28:01,660;28:02,220;"Yeah."
28:02,220;28:07,980;"Uh, similar to Ruben Brown in this game, it gave me old fucking, uh, Malcolm"
28:07,980;28:08,900;"Butler treatment."
28:08,900;28:09,060;"Yeah."
28:09,060;28:10,340;"I'm not going to give you a real reason."
28:10,340;28:13,380;"We're just going to sit one of our players."
28:13,620;28:17,860;"Yeah, and in a super ball for no reason."
28:17,860;28:22,540;"Bill Belichick, your hero, your God."
28:22,540;28:23,820;"Yes."
28:23,820;28:25,020;"I mean, there's got to be something there."
28:25,020;28:26,180;"It can't believe that never came up."
28:26,180;28:28,420;"I know."
28:28,420;28:31,540;"Well, when we have either of them on the podcast, we will talk about it."
28:31,540;28:34,260;"Butler, you free agent."
28:34,260;28:34,700;"Yeah."
28:34,700;28:35,140;"He is."
28:35,140;28:36,980;"Yeah, he's got release."
28:36,980;28:38,940;"So we shall see."
28:38,940;28:43,060;"Yeah, but there was something about in this game,"
28:43,060;28:47,980;"Reuben Brown didn't travel with the team the bills like"
28:47,980;28:50,500;"Pro Bowl"
28:50,500;28:52,500;"Line, oh is left tackle maybe"
28:52,500;28:56,500;"So he's a guard. Yeah, there's a guard"
28:56,500;29:00,660;"But yeah, he"
29:00,660;29:08,020;"I guess he had some altercations on the field and on the sidelines in the game before this"
29:08,020;29:10,700;"against the"
29:10,700;29:14,140;"Dolphins in a game where Drew Bledso was sacked six times"
29:14,140;29:19,780;"And I guess they said he was frustrated with the way the offense was was performing"
29:19,780;29:26,380;"And so he didn't practice all week and didn't travel with the team and this was another thing that that"
29:26,380;29:30,020;"Your boy Dan Deidorf was like"
29:30,020;29:35,260;"Meleagering. Yeah, he was he was upset about this"
29:35,260;29:40,380;"But the fact that Ruben gets to stay home and still gets a paycheck, but all his teammates are"
29:40,380;29:46,700;"are here battling it out, which I think if you look at the scores probably a"
29:46,700;29:56,380;"questionable statement, but yeah he was on that train for probably most of the"
29:56,380;30:02,340;"second quarter I would say about how this offensive line looked."
30:02,340;30:07,860;"I hear nipples hard underneath your gear door if Jersey or Rock solid."
30:07,860;30:12,860;"- Ruben Brown, four time second team all pro."
30:12,860;30:15,820;"- Yeah."
30:15,820;30:16,860;"- What was the brides made?"
30:16,860;30:18,500;"Never the bride."
30:18,500;30:20,380;"- Well, that's cause he's gonna show up for his team."
30:20,380;30:23,260;"- Is that the most bills stat ever?"
30:23,260;30:26,120;"Four time second team all pro."
30:26,120;30:28,620;"(laughing)"
30:28,620;30:30,820;"- Well, they have been four times second place"
30:30,820;30:31,660;"that I've had."
30:31,660;30:32,500;"- Yeah."
30:32,500;30:33,340;"- Just fits."
30:33,340;30:37,500;"- Oh."
30:37,500;30:41,060;"Yeah, I'm more of a Cuban guy myself, you know a cubano"
30:41,060;30:48,160;"Yeah, I did find it strange that patrons go 14 and 2 set a franchise record for wins"
30:48,160;30:52,520;"Going to win Super Bowl and have two pro bowlers"
30:52,520;30:57,280;"Mmm. Yeah, that's what well. I mean I'm wearing one of them's Jersey"
30:57,280;31:02,780;"Tyler baby is that from me is that the Jersey from this year? Yeah?"
31:02,780;31:06,300;"Why war today"
31:06,300;31:09,380;"Oh, yeah. So who is the other one?"
31:09,380;31:11,380;"Three, Tyler, Pearl, Bull Jersey."
31:11,380;31:14,620;"The other one is Seamore, right? Yeah."
31:14,620;31:16,420;"Yeah. So no offense."
31:16,420;31:19,940;"Oh, yeah, that makes sense. This offense has been Harrison."
31:19,940;31:21,740;"I think you could have made a case for Harrison."
31:21,740;31:22,140;"I agree."
31:22,140;31:23,460;"He stuck out as like Bruce,"
31:23,460;31:24,900;"the hominist. Bruce, he"
31:24,900;31:26,220;"should have made it. He had it."
31:26,220;31:29,380;"Because I should have had more than two being how dominant they were because they"
31:29,380;31:32,380;"were absolute crushing teams."
31:32,380;31:33,580;"Yeah. Yeah."
31:33,940;31:40,740;"And Wikipedia.com is saying that William McGinnis is a pro baller to maybe he got in as a alternate"
31:40,740;31:41,540;"could be"
31:41,540;31:47,940;"It doesn't matter if it's not like I didn't even play it right. Yeah, actually now this was this was when the pro bowl was after"
31:47,940;31:53,540;"the school was that's right. Now a title I did play in this game. Yeah, I bet he did. Yeah."
31:53,540;32:03,860;"But yeah, the Teddy, no, Teddy, Mike Vable had an interception early in the first quarter."
32:03,860;32:10,660;"better. Bill's first drive, I think. And that was, that was this defense 28th interception"
32:10,660;32:16,700;"on the season with 28 interceptions a lot. It was actually, it moved them into first"
32:16,700;32:21,740;"in the NFL. I don't know if that stuck, but it was also the most by pages defense since"
32:21,740;32:29,060;"1964. It's a long fucking time. Also, in 1964, I'm surprised you could get 28 interceptions"
32:29,060;32:33,620;"because I don't think teams threw more than like three times a game back then. But yeah,"
32:33,620;32:35,620;"Well, that's why because I kept throwing somebody got in there."
32:35,620;32:37,120;"Except because it's so bad at it."
32:37,120;32:41,860;"But this team was also only allowing nine points per game at home."
32:41,860;32:43,980;"Pretty good."
32:43,980;32:47,380;"And I mean, this first half was making crazy domination."
32:47,380;32:52,100;"Like they get the kickoff, go down nine plays, 60 yards touchdown."
32:52,100;32:57,820;"Next drive, blood so throws an interception, touch down again, 14, nothing before you"
32:57,820;33:01,380;"can even like before the finish sat down."
33:01,380;33:01,820;"Yeah."
33:01,820;33:02,620;"Exactly."
33:02,620;33:07,180;"Yeah, but like they've been waiting for this all is the best the offense looked in forever"
33:07,180;33:11,260;"In many games and they were just against the number two defense"
33:11,260;33:16,380;"Yeah, because they came out just saying, you know what fuck it five wide no huddle"
33:16,380;33:21,600;"We're just gonna just hammer right down your throat and it worked for two drives and then they just"
33:21,600;33:24,820;"Got up"
33:24,820;33:27,220;"Nothing like 20 nothing at half time"
33:27,220;33:32,100;"Yeah, it was 21 nothing after like right at the right at the beginning of the second quarter because they"
33:32,100;33:36,560;"Their last drive the first quarter finished in the second like right at the beginning"
33:36,560;33:39,180;"Brady through touch on a Troy Brown"
33:39,180;33:46,020;"And so some blood so like still hasn't thrown a complete a pass at this point. Yeah, he had the bills lit"
33:46,020;33:51,820;"horrendous. Yeah, they couldn't block anybody on that offensive line like Siva say"
33:51,820;33:53,540;"- Here's a question for you guys."
33:53,540;33:56,460;"Did you guys feel bad for Brady watching this?"
33:56,460;33:57,900;"- Bad for Brady?"
33:57,900;33:58,780;"- Blood, so sorry."
33:58,780;34:00,380;"- Yes, yes I did."
34:00,380;34:01,340;"- Because of the good of no time,"
34:01,340;34:03,260;"he was just throwing hot every time."
34:03,260;34:05,260;"- There was a free rusher every single time."
34:05,260;34:07,500;"- He was throwing down straight up flashbacks dude."
34:07,500;34:09,580;"- Yeah, he was like, no, just like, oh God,"
34:09,580;34:10,900;"he's not really his fault,"
34:10,900;34:13,100;"but he's not making it any better."
34:13,100;34:14,420;"- No."
34:14,420;34:17,540;"- Because, yeah, there was one drive where I think"
34:17,540;34:20,580;"the bills dropped back to pass three times"
34:20,580;34:23,060;"And every single time, bloodsoil got hit"
34:23,060;34:24,620;"because there was a free rusher."
34:24,620;34:26,940;"But he was also like, there was no hot routes."
34:26,940;34:28,460;"There was no like quick dump outs"
34:28,460;34:30,340;"to the running back and then like that."
34:30,340;34:32,300;"And then they punted and Brady got the ball."
34:32,300;34:34,220;"And literally the first place of free rusher"
34:34,220;34:36,820;"and Brady just dumps it off to like the tight end and the flat."
34:36,820;34:38,740;"And they get like four or five yards out of it."
34:38,740;34:41,460;"Like that right there is why they kept Brady"
34:41,460;34:43,260;"and not bloodsoil."
34:43,260;34:44,700;"But yeah, bloodsoil."
34:44,700;34:49,420;"I'd say he had maybe a second and a half"
34:49,420;34:51,540;"to make a decision in this."
34:51,540;34:53,780;"Those are free Russia almost every single day."
34:53,780;34:56,020;"They just blessed, the blitz percentage"
34:56,020;34:58,540;"I spent through the roof because they just blessed every play."
34:58,540;34:59,820;"It felt like it. Yeah."
34:59,820;35:00,900;"Well, I don't even think they did."
35:00,900;35:03,620;"I think they just brought rushes from different places."
35:03,620;35:05,820;"It's usually like a four man rush, but it was like--"
35:05,820;35:07,980;"They're putting safeties and corners and linebackers"
35:07,980;35:09,820;"on every--"
35:09,820;35:14,540;"Even into garbage time when the bills brought in--"
35:14,540;35:16,780;"the fuck was his name?"
35:16,780;35:17,940;"Travis Brown."
35:17,940;35:19,140;"Travis Brown, yeah."
35:19,140;35:23,380;"one of the Brown brothers from Northern, Northern Arizona,"
35:23,380;35:25,100;"lumberjacks represent."
35:25,100;35:26,940;"Northern Arizona, huh?"
35:26,940;35:28,340;"The lumberjacks, baby."
35:28,340;35:29,460;"Chop that wood."
35:29,460;35:31,220;"Oh, he's a Phoenix boy."
35:31,220;35:32,020;"Yeah, that's a guy."
35:32,020;35:34,460;"Yo."
35:34,460;35:35,940;"I can put on it at the moon."
35:35,940;35:42,940;"He was kind of like your very like Madden"
35:42,940;35:45,900;"created backup quarterback because he came in"
35:45,900;35:49,500;"And he like looked like a dollar store version of Drew"
35:49,500;35:51,980;"blood, so similar builds."
35:51,980;35:53,520;"But like his helmet didn't quite fit right."
35:53,520;35:56,020;"And his face mask was too big because it looked like they"
35:56,020;35:59,600;"give him him, you know, the like the old school tight ends"
35:59,600;36:01,420;"helmets from these days."
36:01,420;36:03,700;"There's like a little bit bigger and the face mask is huge."
36:03,700;36:05,500;"And it goes like down to their chest."
36:05,500;36:08,540;"You know those ones like the ones that Christian fory wears."
36:08,540;36:11,140;"Yeah, this guy was wearing that."
36:11,140;36:13,740;"And he just like."
36:13,740;36:15,180;"They just like hung him out to dry."
36:15,180;36:16,820;"you got lit up in this game too."
36:16,820;36:21,300;"That was the Harrison definitely can custom."
36:21,300;36:23,740;"Well, oh, yes."
36:23,740;36:24,740;"So what yes, yeah."
36:24,740;36:26,340;"He's walking up the head."
36:26,340;36:27,540;"We had to come out and he was clear to"
36:27,540;36:28,740;"him custom came back."
36:28,740;36:30,340;"Well, wasn't that the tight end?"
36:30,340;36:31,740;"Yeah. Yeah."
36:31,740;36:32,660;"Yeah, it was a tight end."
36:32,660;36:33,500;"Who'd be killed as?"
36:33,500;36:36,220;"But you you mistook them because they look"
36:36,220;36:37,700;"exactly the same because they were in the same"
36:37,700;36:38,700;"fucking helmet."
36:38,700;36:39,220;"Yeah."
36:39,220;36:40,220;"The helmet was just like that."
36:40,220;36:41,220;"It was like a beer."
36:41,220;36:41,740;"Yeah."
36:41,740;36:42,900;"That's one of those ridiculous ones."
36:43,620;36:44,620;"I just couldn't stop."
36:44,620;36:47,380;"A lot of Browns in this game, huh?"
36:47,380;36:48,460;"Fuck yeah."
36:48,460;36:52,460;"Travis Brown, Antonio Brown, Reuben Brown, Troy Brown."
36:52,460;36:53,660;"Yeah."
36:53,660;36:57,660;"Craig Brown, Annie Brown, Steve Brown."
36:57,660;36:59,420;"Dan Deardo."
36:59,420;37:01,500;"No."
37:01,500;37:02,540;"Yeah."
37:02,540;37:04,460;"Who else?"
37:04,460;37:06,060;"Well, there's a couple of Travises."
37:06,060;37:07,540;"We're going Travis Brown."
37:07,540;37:11,100;"We got Travis Henry, who was literally the only bright spot"
37:11,100;37:12,980;"in this game for the Bills."
37:12,980;37:14,980;"Who bared is none of the burden."
37:14,980;37:16,180;"Ooh, let's play this game."
37:16,180;37:18,820;"What game are you playing?"
37:18,820;37:21,860;"You know where that could go from like last names to first names."
37:21,860;37:22,500;"All right."
37:22,500;37:23,460;"So Travis Henry."
37:23,460;37:27,540;"Henry Ruggs III."
37:27,540;37:28,540;"Henry Winkler."
37:28,540;37:34,980;"Ruggs and bugs."
37:34,980;37:40,140;"Yeah, Travis Henry actually ended this game with over 100 yards, didn't he?"
37:40,140;37:41,140;"Rushing."
37:41,780;37:42,780;"I believe he did."
37:42,780;37:43,780;"Stat Trek?"
37:43,780;37:44,780;"I don't know."
37:44,780;37:45,780;"I didn't watch the second half."
37:45,780;37:46,780;"I'm just after you."
37:46,780;37:47,780;"Travis Henry, before you."
37:47,780;37:48,780;"I was 62."
37:48,780;37:55,060;"I was confusing him with Travis Brown who threw for 100 yards."
37:55,060;37:57,280;"Which is more than Bledso other before."
37:57,280;38:02,940;"Bledso 12 of 29 83 yards, 1 interception, 3 sacks."
38:02,940;38:05,940;"She's not great."
38:05,940;38:07,180;"Not great."
38:07,180;38:12,180;"Yeah, in a rating of 34.7."
38:12,180;38:14,360;"Damon Heward had a higher rating than that."
38:14,360;38:16,600;"Damon Heward was 0 for 1."
38:16,600;38:17,600;"[laughs]"
38:17,600;38:21,440;"And it had a better rating."
38:21,440;38:22,800;"And negative 1 rushing arts."
38:22,800;38:23,800;"Yeah."
38:23,800;38:24,800;"Pretty good."
38:24,800;38:25,800;"Yeah."
38:25,800;38:27,720;"So, well that's because he had a kneel down."
38:27,720;38:31,600;"Was that tight end on the bills?"
38:31,600;38:35,840;"The same one that Brady ruined with at Michigan and was like super close with?"
38:35,840;38:36,840;"Yes."
38:36,840;38:38,600;"- Is it Reimersma?"
38:38,600;38:39,440;"No."
38:39,440;38:42,040;"- Mark Campbell."
38:42,040;38:44,640;"- That's, is that the same dude?"
38:44,640;38:46,400;"- Yes, yeah, 'cause they mentioned it."
38:46,400;38:47,240;"- That's the first one that they would,"
38:47,240;38:49,320;"when you ever read like a Brady bio or whatever."
38:49,320;38:51,440;"- Yeah, that was the same one."
38:51,440;38:52,520;"'Cause I think, and he was the one"
38:52,520;38:54,080;"that got kind of concussed in this too."
38:54,080;38:55,780;"- He was super concussed."
38:55,780;38:58,360;"- Yeah, he was taking shots because they kept like"
38:58,360;39:00,560;"this Travis Brown character kept like"
39:00,560;39:04,480;"floating the ball down the middle to that tight end seam route."
39:04,480;39:07,940;"which brought me Harrison just feasted on every time he caught the ball."
39:07,940;39:11,180;"He got lit up and he went back a couple times."
39:11,180;39:12,700;"Not great."
39:12,700;39:16,180;"So yeah, Travis Henry was like the only person still trying at the end of the"
39:16,180;39:16,660;"game too."
39:16,660;39:17,940;"It's like the third quarter."
39:17,940;39:20,860;"They're just like handing it off to him and not blocking for him."
39:20,860;39:25,060;"So he's breaking like four or five tackles and getting like a loss of two"
39:25,060;39:27,620;"yards soon to be replaced by the bills."
39:27,620;39:30,900;"First round picked this year who redshirted the entire year."
39:33,340;39:37,620;"Yeah, that's because he had that crazy leg injury in college, right?"
39:37,620;39:45,180;"Title he has it right before he gets drafted. Yeah, he's in like the I don't know if it's a national championship"
39:45,180;39:49,040;"But it was in the ball game right in the Rose Bowl against Texas"
39:49,040;39:52,740;"Ever"
39:52,740;39:54,780;"Where did they draft him?"
39:54,780;39:58,020;"Jesus music for something"
39:58,820;40:04,540;"That's so like in the at a high pick they weren't like awesome last year either. They didn't know either. No, they did not"
40:04,540;40:10,300;"Running backs were like way more value back then. I mean this is true"
40:10,300;40:15,620;"But still the dude had like a cross-ass knee injury in this last game at college"
40:15,620;40:18,460;"Speaking of which you want to"
40:18,460;40:21,660;"You want to talk about the"
40:21,660;40:26,180;"Around the league or yeah, yeah, yeah, that's a good spot for it. All right"
40:26,980;40:32,660;"So this is the first edition of the newest segment that I will probably forget about next time"
40:32,660;40:41,140;"We're calling it around the league with Greg Brown, okay"
40:41,140;40:51,300;"That's the one yeah"
40:51,300;40:56,380;"So"
40:56,380;41:02,280;"Let's take a little gander. Let's take a walk around the NFC, the AFC, see what else is going on."
41:02,280;41:05,280;"Oh, she had the playoffs. The realm of the Patriots. Yeah."
41:05,280;41:11,280;"First they're made. Not only that, but some records reset this year. So."
41:11,280;41:21,480;"Yeah. Um, Jamal Lewis would complete his 2000 yard season this week."
41:21,480;41:22,480;"Oh yeah."
41:22,480;41:26,240;"Finishing the year with 2066 yards,"
41:26,240;41:31,240;"which at the time was second all time."
41:31,240;41:33,640;"To Barry Sanders maybe?"
41:33,640;41:36,520;"No, Andrew, do you have a guess?"
41:36,520;41:37,600;"Eric Dickerson?"
41:37,600;41:38,800;"Eric Dickerson."
41:38,800;41:40,240;"Ha! Look at me."
41:40,240;41:42,600;"Still holds the record."
41:42,600;41:43,760;"Dickerson."
41:43,760;41:45,800;"Lewis has been, there's a new second."
41:45,800;41:47,080;"Can you name that?"
41:47,080;41:49,760;"Adrian Peterson?"
41:49,760;42:00,060;"in Peterson 2012. So yeah, he had a fucking monster year. He had like, he absolutely feasted"
42:00,060;42:04,620;"on Cleveland. He had like 295 yards in like one week and then 180."
42:04,620;42:10,140;"I have a, I have a, I think we may have touched it on his back when we played the Browns,"
42:10,140;42:16,560;"but the fun fact that we had for the Browns game that one was in week two, Browns linebacker"
42:16,560;42:21,200;"Andre Davis, telephone Ravens running back to Mal Lewis before the game and say that he wanted"
42:21,200;42:26,240;"Lewis to carry the ball at least 30 times in their upcoming matchup. Quote, if that happens,"
42:26,240;42:32,320;"it's going to be a career day. Lewis replied, Lewis then erupted to 295 rushing yards, breaking"
42:32,320;42:37,200;"the record previous held by Corey Dillon in 2000 as a brand spell 33 to 13."
42:37,200;42:43,040;"The browser Feders literally called up Javalu is like, I fucking dare you to run 30 times."
42:43,040;42:44,040;"I was like, ""Okay."""
42:44,040;42:45,040;"And runs for 300."
42:45,040;42:46,040;"Yeah."
42:46,040;42:47,480;"And then did it again in week six."
42:47,480;42:48,480;"Yeah."
42:48,480;42:51,760;"Like, yeah, like a fuck 80."
42:51,760;42:56,680;"So I mean, like Steve was saying, the running backs are way more valued."
42:56,680;43:03,240;"So also in this year, Priest Holmes said what was at the time the record for most touchdowns"
43:03,240;43:04,240;"in a season."
43:04,240;43:05,240;"Oh, yes."
43:05,240;43:06,240;"27 touchdowns."
43:06,240;43:07,840;"Which was broken by LTV."
43:07,840;43:08,840;"Yeah."
43:08,840;43:09,840;"Eventually."
43:09,840;43:10,840;"Like 30 something."
43:10,840;43:11,840;"She was ridiculous."
43:11,840;43:16,840;"Interestingly, it was 2005, Sean Alexander broke it,"
43:16,840;43:19,600;"and then 2006, that's right, broke that."
43:19,600;43:22,320;"So I remember that, like, we had a four years,"
43:22,320;43:24,800;"the record was set. - Sean Alexander, yeah."
43:24,800;43:27,000;"- So LT at 31 touchdowns, that's the record"
43:27,000;43:29,320;"as it stands now in 2006."
43:29,320;43:30,160;"- Yeah."
43:30,160;43:36,640;"- So, a little around the league playoff updates."
43:36,640;43:39,240;"- Give me the playoff picture."
43:39,240;43:51,240;"the playoff picture. So the, the AFC is the Pats and first, the chiefs in second. Yep."
43:51,240;43:59,240;"Colton third, they win the AFC South with like the same record as the Titans. Right. But"
43:59,240;44:02,640;"they wanted head to head I think. And they're both wicked good too. Right. They're both like"
44:02,640;44:08,080;"three or four lost teams. I think they're four lost teams. Yep. Yeah. So that bolts"
44:08,080;44:16,000;"more wins based on defense in Jamal Lewis. They win their division, the SC North. So they"
44:16,000;44:24,280;"actually have a worse record than the Titans, but say we'll get Baltimore and Tennessee,"
44:24,280;44:31,000;"wild car game and then the chiefs or the Colts will play Denver. Okay. So those are the two"
44:31,000;44:33,580;"And then Chiefs, Pats have buys."
44:33,580;44:36,640;"So"
44:36,640;44:39,220;"the Colts Denver game."
44:39,220;44:40,720;"I remember that either."
44:40,720;44:42,120;"I think I do."
44:42,120;44:44,920;"It's a pretty yeah."
44:44,920;44:48,120;"Well, guess that maybe once we once that game, like"
44:48,120;44:48,960;"that's what we're going to do."
44:48,960;44:51,760;"The pages could because obviously we know that we play the"
44:51,760;44:53,120;"Titans and the Colts this year."
44:53,120;44:57,480;"So the Chiefs after having this amazing year are basically one and done."
44:57,480;45:00,040;"Yeah, fall apart with the which is interesting."
45:00,040;45:00,560;"Yeah."
45:00,560;45:09,800;"The NFC. So the NFC finishes with Philadelphia as the one seed."
45:09,800;45:12,320;"St. Louis says the two seed."
45:12,320;45:13,440;"That makes sense."
45:13,440;45:15,200;"Panthers as the three seed."
45:15,200;45:19,160;"Green Bay as the four seed, which I'll get to in a minute."
45:19,160;45:22,000;"Seattle and Dallas as wildcards."
45:22,000;45:30,000;"OK, so I don't know if you remember how the Packers got into the playoffs this year."
45:30,160;45:31,760;"But we're not division."
45:31,760;45:35,960;"So it was between them and Minnesota going into the last week of the year."
45:35,960;45:36,960;"Okay."
45:36,960;45:42,160;"So Minnesota, this is the uh, Culpepper Randy Moss theme."
45:42,160;45:47,360;"So it was fucking sick team with um, who's our other wide resource card?"
45:47,360;45:49,360;"Only does all he does catch touchdowns."
45:49,360;45:50,360;"Yeah."
45:50,360;45:50,360;"Yeah."
45:50,360;45:53,860;"So it is like 1000s catch or something on a highlight the other day."
45:53,860;45:56,560;"And it was catching a touchdown on 1000s."
45:56,560;45:57,360;"Of course."
45:57,360;45:58,360;"All he does is catch touchdowns."
45:58,360;46:04,360;"So last week, Minnesota had like blown the doors off Kansas City."
46:04,360;46:06,360;"It was like 45. Oh, yes."
46:06,360;46:08,360;"When he or something like that. So that was a big win."
46:08,360;46:10,360;"That was actually a big game for the past."
46:10,360;46:14,360;"Moss is like in peak Moss form."
46:14,360;46:17,360;"He had like seven catches, there's a buck 11, two touchdowns in that game."
46:17,360;46:20,360;"So now into week 17, all they need is like,"
46:20,360;46:26,360;"it's one of those situations where like they either need to win or Seattle wins or tie."
46:26,360;46:29,960;"or tie, you know, it's like one of those things where like four things have to go against them"
46:29,960;46:31,280;"for them to not make the playoffs."
46:31,280;46:32,280;"Yeah."
46:32,280;46:39,800;"And they're playing the three and 12 Cardinals after just these Cardinals, those Cardinals"
46:39,800;46:43,200;"after just beating the 12 ditch thieves."
46:43,200;46:46,920;"So there they go into Arizona."
46:46,920;46:48,520;"They're fucking kicking their ass."
46:48,520;46:50,920;"17 to six with less than two minutes left."
46:50,920;46:52,880;"It's 17 to six."
46:52,880;46:53,880;"What?"
46:53,880;46:56,200;"And then some deodorant magic happens."
46:56,200;46:57,840;"Josh McCown magic."
46:57,840;47:02,440;"This is the Josh McCown led card notes."
47:02,440;47:03,740;"What?"
47:03,740;47:05,520;"It was like his rookie year too."
47:05,520;47:09,080;"It's actually like second or third year in the league, but he played."
47:09,080;47:11,560;"So 2019, which is fucking crazy."
47:11,560;47:12,040;"Yeah."
47:12,040;47:12,640;"Yeah."
47:12,640;47:13,160;"So."
47:13,160;47:13,800;"Holy shit."
47:13,800;47:16,600;"McCown leads them down."
47:16,600;47:17,960;"They score a touchdown."
47:17,960;47:20,840;"I think they convert like a fourth and 10 on that drive."
47:20,840;47:24,320;"They get an onside kick."
47:24,320;47:25,560;"Nice."
47:25,560;47:27,880;"recover that they start driving."
47:27,880;47:32,040;"They're like down within like the 10 yard line of Minnesota."
47:32,040;47:34,840;"They it's second down."
47:34,840;47:36,360;"They have did one time out."
47:36,360;47:39,080;"They get sacked, call the time out."
47:39,080;47:40,840;"The next play."
47:40,840;47:43,440;"They get sacked a sack fumble."
47:43,440;47:44,840;"Oh my God."
47:44,840;47:49,080;"So it's now fourth in goal from the 24."
47:49,080;47:53,000;"With like an expired."
47:53,000;47:54,620;"It's the last play of the game."
47:54,620;47:56,120;"If they can't clock it, then nothing."
47:56,120;48:02,560;"And some fucking way how Josh McCown pulls this bullshit out of his ass."
48:02,560;48:05,240;"And it's like it was very similar to the."
48:05,240;48:10,960;"The Super Bowl with the Steelers with the touchdown in the corner against Cardinals."
48:10,960;48:11,600;"Yeah. Yeah."
48:11,600;48:12,160;"Oh, yeah."
48:12,160;48:15,600;"Same idea of play where he's just like launches it into the back corner."
48:15,600;48:17,520;"The end on this guy like tol of tasks."
48:17,520;48:20,640;"And that's the last play of the game."
48:20,640;48:26,280;"the Cardinals win 18 to 17. The Vikings are out of the playoffs. The Packers are in season"
48:26,280;48:33,360;"done. Wow. It's one of the most ridiculous games ever seen to fit to lose your season"
48:33,360;48:40,320;"against a fucking three and 12 team like that. Oh, Josh McCallen and a three and 12 team"
48:40,320;48:45,520;"wasting a cold pepper Randy Moss team. Like there's just so many layers of heartbreak"
48:45,520;48:47,880;"for Vikings fans there like I can't even imagine."
48:47,880;48:50,320;"Yeah. Oh my God, this catch."
48:50,320;48:52,320;"How did you get?"
48:52,320;48:56,280;"And this was actually before they had the rule of push out."
48:56,280;49:00,360;"So he only he gets one foot down and then the defendant gets pushed out."
49:00,360;49:02,840;"But they say, yeah, so it's non reviewable."
49:02,840;49:07,640;"Yeah. Or no, it's reviewed, but they the review is that he had like"
49:07,640;49:08,800;"maintained. Yeah."
49:08,800;49:11,320;"For all he would have come down in bounds if"
49:12,320;49:17,140;"God damn. All right. Yeah. We'll post that in the show notes. So if anybody wants to watch it, they can"
49:17,140;49:21,040;"I didn't see it. But I think this is another one where if you find the right"
49:21,040;49:23,480;"commentator, it's hilarious."
49:23,480;49:37,320;"Oh, no. Right. Because we talked about the other day, the ending to the the"
49:37,320;49:42,880;"the Saints game. Yeah. How could they do that? Where they scored the lateral touchdown and"
49:42,880;49:48,440;"then missed the extra point to tie it to go to overtime. And I think that kept the Saints"
49:48,440;49:53,160;"out of the playoffs, didn't it? I guess the Saints did not make the playoffs."
49:53,160;49:58,960;"Yeah, they did not. They finished, but they finished eight and eight. So they had a chance"
49:58,960;50:05,120;"if they had won that. But yeah, sounds like they would have brutal fourth and 24. And"
50:05,120;50:08,760;"Of course, your guys are going to hate this, but like Brett"
50:08,760;50:12,440;"Farm is watching from, I think it was Chicago after beating the"
50:12,440;50:17,960;"bears being like, Oh, shock skies. We did it. Yeah, you guys"
50:17,960;50:25,920;"would have hated it. What if I am hitting it? All right. So we"
50:25,920;50:29,160;"got some some excitement having the NFC, which didn't really"
50:29,160;50:33,020;"happen. The AFC, he's not that last day. Then it was kind of"
50:33,020;50:35,940;"like it was just the seating more than anything. Right."
50:35,940;50:39,140;"Cause the Ravens were two games up on the Bengals."
50:39,140;50:42,540;"Patriots were four games up on the dolphins who finished 10 and six,"
50:42,540;50:43,340;"but missed the playoffs."
50:43,340;50:47,340;"Yeah, they missed him on a tiebreaker with Broncos. Yeah."
50:47,340;50:50,580;"So if they had beaten the Patriots once this season,"
50:50,580;50:52,100;"they wouldn't be the playoffs."
50:52,100;50:58,180;"ASE, man, it's tough when you got the Patriots in there."
50:58,180;51:01,700;"It's true. Damn. All right."
51:02,980;51:05,060;"So we got the Panthers at the three seed"
51:05,060;51:06,460;"and the Patriots at the one seed."
51:06,460;51:08,060;"And the commentators in this role"
51:08,060;51:11,340;"are also talking about how hard it was for the one seed"
51:11,340;51:14,780;"to win or to even get to the Super Bowl"
51:14,780;51:17,500;"because I think it took a screenshot."
51:17,500;51:21,660;"Only three of the top seeded AFC playoff teams"
51:21,660;51:24,380;"have made to the Super Bowl in the last 10 seasons."
51:24,380;51:27,020;"The only team to win was the 1998 Broncos."
51:27,020;51:29,220;"Only one seed to win from the AFC."
51:30,460;51:33,900;"So the one seat isn't really known for."
51:33,900;51:35,820;"- Well, that's 'cause it's always fucking Peyton Manning"
51:35,820;51:37,320;"and he blows in the playoffs."
51:37,320;51:40,560;"(laughing)"
51:40,560;51:42,660;"- Well, this is still early Peyton, so maybe not."
51:42,660;51:43,940;"- Yeah, I think, I think,"
51:43,940;51:45,260;"better early for that, but."
51:45,260;51:46,100;"- This is a point to happen."
51:46,100;51:46,940;"- This is a point to happen."
51:46,940;51:49,580;"- If that number is skewed,"
51:49,580;51:52,340;"it's 'cause of Peyton Manning, god damn it."
51:52,340;51:55,500;"- It's skewed because of Tom Brady or Will Bann."
51:57,540;52:02,060;"- Yeah, some other numbers in the pages favor though"
52:02,060;52:06,340;"for this is that single season since 1970,"
52:06,340;52:09,700;"only three teams of one 12 consecutive regular season games"
52:09,700;52:13,460;"before the pages did it just in this game here."
52:13,460;52:17,080;"All three of them won the Super Bowl."
52:17,080;52:20,240;"They were obviously the 1972 Dolphins,"
52:20,240;52:25,180;"the 1985 Bears and the 1998 Broncos."
52:25,180;52:28,260;"So good company to have to win those games."
52:28,260;52:29,440;"But two of those teams,"
52:29,440;52:31,940;"let's see, the 85 bear,"
52:31,940;52:33,740;"well, 72 dolphins obviously undefeated."
52:33,740;52:36,660;"85 bears, I think went 15 and one"
52:36,660;52:37,940;"and beat the shit out of everybody,"
52:37,940;52:40,620;"except the one team they lost you that year, do you know?"
52:40,620;52:44,700;"The Miami Dolphins."
52:44,700;52:45,780;"The Miami Dolphins."
52:45,780;52:48,020;"The only team to beat the 85 bears"
52:48,020;52:50,620;"keeping the time coming up every season."
52:50,620;52:51,740;"And I think the 98 Broncos"
52:51,740;52:54,180;"were a bit of a shit storm or two, aren't they?"
52:54,180;52:58,540;"wagon. Yeah, because that was L. way like end of his career."
52:58,540;53:02,460;"And then they had 12 Davis. Yeah. That's Pete."
53:02,460;53:05,740;"Torel Davis for those four years where he was just like on"
53:05,740;53:10,740;"another planet. Yeah, exactly. And and this was the time when the"
53:10,740;53:16,900;"the Broncos were like kind of skirting the salary cap by paying"
53:16,900;53:21,060;"money outside of it. Wasn't that this era? So they had that"
53:21,060;53:23,300;"story. They had some stack teams. Oh, yeah."
53:23,300;53:25,660;"Um, how are they doing that?"
53:25,660;53:29,660;"Not to get too into the weeds here, but you can actually find it on your team"
53:29,660;53:30,580;"and this dot com."
53:30,580;53:34,100;"I was going to say, are there other teams of the NFL cheating or"
53:34,100;53:38,620;"possibly bending the rules because I will throw a hissy fit on national"
53:38,620;53:39,260;"television."
53:39,260;53:43,980;"If that's the goddamn truth, I want you to cry like, yeah."
53:43,980;53:45,820;"We can do it about this."
53:45,820;53:46,100;"Yeah."
53:46,100;53:48,020;"Where's the inspector?"
53:48,020;53:48,900;"God damn it."
53:48,900;53:49,500;"There you go."
53:49,500;53:50,940;"It's called salary cap gate."
53:50,940;53:52,660;"According to your team cheats.com."
53:52,780;53:54,420;"- Same cap, Kate."
53:54,420;53:56,980;"That's the most boring gate ever."
53:56,980;54:00,460;"- Yeah, well, I think they name everything something gate"
54:00,460;54:02,860;"because as is tradition."
54:02,860;54:04,420;"But the summary is according to his website,"
54:04,420;54:06,700;"on September 17, 2004, the league announced that"
54:06,700;54:08,020;"for the second time in three years,"
54:08,020;54:10,860;"the Denver Broncos were fined nearly a million dollars"
54:10,860;54:13,700;"and would once again lose their third round draft pick"
54:13,700;54:17,140;"because of salary cap violations between 96 and 98."
54:17,140;54:19,100;"- Luxury tax, essentially."
54:19,100;54:21,180;"- Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis,"
54:21,180;54:23,580;"content at the Broncos circumvention of the salary cap"
54:23,580;54:27,380;"helped them win the Super Bowl in the '97 and '98 seasons."
54:27,380;54:29,780;"In the years where they didn't follow the cap rules,"
54:29,780;54:31,620;"the Broncos top player quarterback John Ella"
54:31,620;54:35,060;"was paid around 5.4% of the legal cap space, which"
54:35,060;54:38,140;"was 1.2% less than the next closest team."
54:38,140;54:40,060;"Even more telling, always cap charges"
54:40,060;54:44,980;"in the Broncos' '98 Super Bowl seasons were just 2.1 and 2.6"
54:44,980;54:47,740;"million respectively, which is pretty fucking small."
54:47,740;54:49,940;"By comparison, Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino--"
54:49,940;54:56,300;"Who would be the most logical comparison had cap triders of 4.3 and 7.6 million."
54:56,300;55:01,220;"So like a fraction of that implications that Ellie took a relatively low cap hit,"
55:01,220;55:03,940;"but received outside the cap funds to compensate for that."
55:03,940;55:06,660;"God damn see that's what I'm saying."
55:06,660;55:12,260;"Like it's you can only rile up the public if it's not boring."
55:12,260;55:12,780;"Yeah."
55:12,780;55:13,740;"Well, here you go."
55:13,740;55:17,420;"Here's like 4.6 2 million percent over the cap."
55:17,420;55:18,180;"And so here you go."
55:18,180;55:19,920;"Here's the pages tuned out."
55:19,920;55:21,180;"Here's the panel."
55:21,180;55:22,660;"You the fuck out."
55:22,660;55:27,000;"Tell me they were videotaping practice and I'll get hype."
55:27,000;55:27,540;"Okay."
55:27,540;55:32,340;"The Broncos explanation for the infraction goes something like this."
55:32,340;55:35,900;"Owner Pat Bolin was trying to build a new stadium for the Broncos and we're short on cash."
55:35,900;55:40,420;"So he asked Elway and running back to rel Davis to forfeit some of their paycheck now."
55:40,420;55:43,260;"And in return, he would pay them back plus interest after the season."
55:43,260;55:45,540;"Cash."
55:45,540;55:46,660;"She's giving them checks."
55:46,660;55:47,020;"Yeah."
55:47,020;55:47,900;"Fucking outside."
55:47,900;55:51,500;"You know, just give them just give them a cut and be like, yeah, I'll say it."
55:51,500;55:51,860;"I asked."
55:51,860;55:55,100;"So as soon as you retire, we'll give you a crispy fucking job as GM and let you"
55:55,100;55:59,340;"draft a bunch of shitty quarterbacks that will never replace you in the ring of"
55:59,340;56:00,820;"honor in Denver."
56:00,820;56:02,660;"All the calls for the franchise."
56:02,660;56:03,260;"It'll be fine."
56:03,260;56:03,660;"Yeah."
56:03,660;56:05,500;"So."
56:05,500;56:07,220;"Awesome."
56:07,220;56:11,860;"Steve, can we designate you are a salary cap guy?"
56:11,860;56:15,460;"Like this is your, I feel you'd be good at that."
56:15,460;56:15,940;"Yeah."
56:15,940;56:16,700;"You're a numbers guy."
56:16,700;56:21,100;"Your numbers cruncher. Can you be our like salary cap question answer?"
56:21,100;56:23,660;"Can you get some Excel spreadsheets going please?"
56:23,660;56:26,940;"No, I can be a"
56:26,940;56:30,100;"gift-sejester guy though."
56:30,100;56:32,780;"If suggested, give or gift."
56:32,780;56:35,660;"You can show me how to rip gifts like you do for your website."
56:35,660;56:36,940;"I have some gifts."
56:36,940;56:38,940;"Okay, what are they?"
56:38,940;56:41,740;"What are your suggestions?"
56:41,740;56:43,740;"Yeah."
56:43,980;56:49,260;"By all means I'll be like dick guy Tom Brady right after he like"
56:49,260;56:54,260;"Nearly tears is like a mint talking to Damien Heward. Yeah"
56:54,260;56:56,680;"No"
56:56,680;57:02,060;"So this is sort of like how it started right because that I mean get some audio here"
57:02,060;57:04,780;"There's no audio needed"
57:04,780;57:08,140;"Well, I mean this is an audio is a podcast"
57:08,140;57:10,420;"Yes"
57:10,420;57:13,460;"Greg you you play Tom Brady. I'll play Damon Heward"
57:13,460;57:16,460;"It was the kind of like, Hey, John."
57:16,460;57:18,460;"Y'all dude, did you see that shit?"
57:18,460;57:21,460;"Yo, that motherfucker."
57:21,460;57:24,460;"Yo, he was so close to my knee, dude."
57:24,460;57:25,460;"How's your playability?"
57:25,460;57:27,460;"Just like I'm fucking laser focused."
57:27,460;57:30,460;"He's just fucking, he's not even talking to Damon."
57:30,460;57:31,460;"Get fucked."
57:31,460;57:33,460;"Top, do you like my face mask?"
57:33,460;57:34,460;"I gotta get on my fucking face."
57:34,460;57:36,460;"I got it from the tight ends."
57:36,460;57:37,460;"They really liked it."
57:37,460;57:39,460;"What kind of name is he word anyway?"
57:39,460;57:40,460;"Speak highly of it."
57:40,460;57:42,460;"What kind of name is Damon?"
57:42,460;57:46,460;"And then does the name of the devil."
57:46,460;57:48,460;"Can we get some audio in one of these?"
57:48,460;57:49,460;"Maybe."
57:49,460;57:50,460;"I don't need these guests."
57:50,460;57:53,460;"I have some audio, but they're."
57:53,460;57:57,460;"Yeah, the highlights on the website don't have audio, but I have one audio."
57:57,460;57:59,460;"Yeah."
57:59,460;58:02,460;"Tom Brady is a Steve, you know, this is a podcast."
58:02,460;58:03,460;"Yes."
58:03,460;58:07,460;"So the people that are listening cannot see what you see."
58:07,460;58:08,460;"All right."
58:08,460;58:10,460;"I've got one that's."
58:10,460;58:13,380;"That's pretty great."
58:13,380;58:19,420;"So can you go to if you can line up when the way Malay hits Brady."
58:19,420;58:21,460;"I just want to hear like Dick."
58:21,460;58:27,380;"Because I'm not crazy in that he didn't go."
58:27,380;58:28,940;"Yeah, someone fell on his leg."
58:28,940;58:30,460;"Dick said like Dick."
58:30,460;58:33,860;"I'm not like debating that though."
58:33,860;58:35,820;"I think we all agree that Dan Dudor."
58:35,820;58:37,300;"So is a dumb show of all time."
58:37,300;58:38,300;"Old leg dick."
58:38,300;58:39,300;"Do you know."
58:39,300;58:42,300;"I mean, do you know the creepy comments?"
58:42,300;58:45,300;"Like like, like, dude, or dude."
58:45,300;58:49,300;"Oh, that's almost as good as WD 33 Andy."
58:49,300;58:51,300;"Oh, right. What was that for?"
58:51,300;58:53,300;"That's a fog."
58:53,300;58:54,300;"Well, that's right."
58:54,300;58:57,300;"Cause he just keeps the, he's the grease monkey."
58:57,300;58:59,300;"Yeah. The human lubricant."
58:59,300;59:03,300;"Do we know when about that?"
59:03,300;59:05,300;"The time that was?"
59:05,300;59:10,300;"This is going to be bad radio, but second quarter."
59:10,300;59:11,700;"47 minutes."
59:11,700;59:14,700;"So it'll be just like, I don't know, maybe a couple of minutes before 47."
59:14,700;59:19,580;"Well, while he looks for it, Steve, do you think that was a dirty play?"
59:19,580;59:24,540;"No, I didn't look at kind of blocking the back and like shoved down more."
59:24,540;59:26,180;"Whereas we're not a pilot."
59:26,180;59:31,020;"He was already on the ground and then made like an extra lunch or lawyer was sort of like pushed down."
59:31,020;59:34,980;"If it was the player other than lawyer, Maloy."
59:34,980;59:37,580;"I have the feeling you would say it's dirty."
59:37,580;59:42,020;"I don't think so because the ball was like, he's already down and then he made the lunge"
59:42,020;59:43,020;"for lawyers."
59:43,020;59:46,940;"It's like a dude getting rolled up blocking or like, you know, you're blocking and someone"
59:46,940;59:47,940;"gets rolled up behind you."
59:47,940;59:52,100;"It was a similar sort of play where it wasn't like where it was going for his knee."
59:52,100;59:56,580;"I just feel like in the NFL, all those plays are kind of like that."
59:56,580;59:59,340;"They were not probably able to."
59:59,340;01:00:02,940;"It was different because he definitely made like an effort to use already on the ground"
01:00:02,940;01:00:04,700;"and then like then lunge at him."
01:00:04,700;01:00:05,700;"I agree with that."
01:00:05,700;01:00:10,620;"I think you guys are just you're viewing these through rose colored glasses and that you like"
01:00:10,620;01:00:15,700;"lawyer and the line you don't want you don't want him to hate the Patriots."
01:00:15,700;01:00:17,340;"But he does."
01:00:17,340;01:00:20,660;"Well, dude, there's clear evidence that he was really good."
01:00:20,660;01:00:24,140;"But yeah, yeah, he sold Tom Brady his house."
01:00:24,140;01:00:24,780;"Yeah."
01:00:24,780;01:00:28,420;"Oh, well, in that case, you could never do a dirty hit Andy."
01:00:28,420;01:00:31,700;"It was not even going out there and trying to fucking tear Tom Brady's knee off."
01:00:31,700;01:00:34,780;"And that's also not who he was where Bernard Pollard has a dinner."
01:00:34,780;01:00:36,500;"We know what he's gonna."
01:00:36,500;01:00:39,580;"Bernard Pollard has a track reputation."
01:00:39,580;01:00:41,540;"What if Harris would have Harrison did that?"
01:00:41,540;01:00:43,820;"Oh, that would probably do."
01:00:43,820;01:00:47,860;"Yeah, for sure."
01:00:47,860;01:00:48,940;"We just say it was spirited."
01:00:48,940;01:00:50,540;"All right, I think I found it here."
01:00:50,540;01:00:52,660;"So fairly into the second quarter."
01:00:52,660;01:00:55,660;"Talk about his arms going to fall off before this thing's over."
01:00:55,660;01:00:56,580;"Going to do it again."
01:00:56,580;01:00:57,660;"And down he goes."
01:00:57,660;01:00:58,100;"I know."
01:00:58,100;01:00:59,260;"Pressure from the hell about."
01:00:59,260;01:01:00,180;"So there's a sack."
01:01:00,180;01:01:01,180;"That's a buffalo."
01:01:01,180;01:01:07,180;"Well, they're hoping that the play action here, honey, but his arm really has fallen."
01:01:07,180;01:01:08,180;"That's Sam."
01:01:08,180;01:01:10,180;"And you're in such a mess."
01:01:10,180;01:01:12,180;"A field position."
01:01:12,180;01:01:15,180;"Brady going for Gibbons."
01:01:15,180;01:01:16,180;"Incomplete."
01:01:16,180;01:01:20,180;"And Boyd at Tom Brady has somebody fall on his leg dick and he is hurt."
01:01:20,180;01:01:21,180;"He is hurt."
01:01:21,180;01:01:26,180;"And Boyd at Tom Brady has somebody fall on his leg dick and he's incomplete."
01:01:26,180;01:01:31,700;"and boy did Tom Brady have somebody fall on his leg dick and he is hurt he is"
01:01:31,700;01:01:37,940;"and boy did Tom Brady have somebody fall on his leg dick and he is hurt"
01:01:37,940;01:01:41,380;"I don't feel fine you're like dick"
01:01:46,180;01:01:48,180;"Sounds like dick Brady"
01:01:48,180;01:01:57,280;"I tell you it's terrible you triple your leg dick"
01:01:57,280;01:02:02,460;"I'm a trippin on his leg"
01:02:02,460;01:02:12,900;"Oh God I was right though. Yeah, I'm like big Brady"
01:02:12,900;01:02:17,840;"All right, but I also think you're right like this is where he says talks about the ligaments - yeah"
01:02:17,840;01:02:21,980;"Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a great show that replay over and over again. It was like oh, yeah"
01:02:21,980;01:02:27,440;"This was like they don't do it so much anymore, but they show the wide right replay"
01:02:27,440;01:02:32,240;"They showed drew blood so getting his lung cave didn't replay. They're just like hey, let's hit all the low lights"
01:02:32,240;01:02:38,220;"Let's see if he talks about the ligaments real quick. Oh"
01:02:38,220;01:02:42,220;"This is really awkward coming from the far side"
01:02:42,220;01:02:44,220;"side might have been Malloy is"
01:02:44,220;01:02:46,420;"good friend. It is lawyer"
01:02:46,420;01:02:48,620;"Malloy. Oh look at the last knee"
01:02:48,620;01:02:54,060;"and ankle of Tom Brady. Oh boy."
01:02:54,060;01:02:57,000;"That is when a quarterback is at"
01:02:57,000;01:02:59,160;"his most vulnerable standing"
01:02:59,160;01:03:00,460;"there with your legs straight"
01:03:00,460;01:03:02,400;"out and that hurt. You could"
01:03:02,400;01:03:03,900;"almost see the band. It's"
01:03:03,900;01:03:05,700;"remarkable that the only thing I"
01:03:05,700;01:03:07,200;"can say is I hope Tom Brady has"
01:03:07,200;01:03:10,540;"loose ligaments. I love"
01:03:10,540;01:03:12,540;"I don't care what anyone says."
01:03:12,540;01:03:14,540;"- I hope he's got loose link."
01:03:14,540;01:03:16,180;"- He's such an idiot."
01:03:16,180;01:03:18,140;"- I'm on AD, he's so bad."
01:03:18,140;01:03:20,020;"- Dan Deardorff, MD."
01:03:20,020;01:03:23,580;"But he's like, it's, you know when movies get so bad,"
01:03:23,580;01:03:24,420;"they're good?"
01:03:24,420;01:03:28,500;"You know, the thing I hate are movies that are like"
01:03:28,500;01:03:29,540;"somewhere in between."
01:03:29,540;01:03:32,220;"Like, you either be so bad you're entertaining."
01:03:32,220;01:03:34,860;"- Yeah, but like, watch like a ton of movies"
01:03:34,860;01:03:36,300;"that are so bad they're good, you know?"
01:03:36,300;01:03:37,540;"Like those are good ones in a while."
01:03:37,540;01:03:38,380;"- That's a good point."
01:03:38,380;01:03:39,660;"- You don't have to get too much of them."
01:03:39,660;01:03:43,740;"That's true. Yeah, I think that's that's my issue with him. He's so corny all the goddamn time"
01:03:43,740;01:03:47,180;"Yeah, any Bruce he plays the sex and he has some sex"
01:03:47,180;01:03:53,020;"This is gonna fall off. He's throwing it so much like that's his dumb"
01:03:53,020;01:03:57,580;"Right and also how many times of Tom Ray throw it like 25 times in the first half. Yeah"
01:03:57,580;01:04:03,500;"You're through 21 to 32 times this game. I'm just gonna fall off. Hey"
01:04:03,500;01:04:05,340;"Jesus"
01:04:05,340;01:04:07,340;"All right, you want to do best and worse?"
01:04:08,860;01:04:11,340;"Yeah, I guess I'm best of the worst. All right."
01:04:11,340;01:04:13,100;"Given to me, Steven."
01:04:13,100;01:04:21,900;"There was a stat where someone had thrown five touchdowns in a game when Brady was on fire in"
01:04:21,900;01:04:25,740;"the first half and was like, ""Oh, he was going to throw five touchdowns in the game and tie the"
01:04:25,740;01:04:31,660;"record."" And then doesn't he then later throw five touchdowns in a half? He does."
01:04:35,020;01:04:36,180;"- No, he'll get there."
01:04:36,180;01:04:38,660;"- Yeah, do you remember who it was that,"
01:04:38,660;01:04:39,860;"whose record it was?"
01:04:39,860;01:04:42,300;"The five touchdowns in a game?"
01:04:42,300;01:04:45,540;"Steve Grogan in 1979, versus Jess."
01:04:45,540;01:04:48,380;"And they were like, Tom Brady was two years old."
01:04:48,380;01:04:50,660;"Oh my God, can you imagine?"
01:04:50,660;01:04:53,260;"Yeah, that's how time works, bro."
01:04:53,260;01:04:54,100;"What did you expect?"
01:04:54,100;01:04:55,780;"They've just come out of the womb,"
01:04:55,780;01:04:56,580;"hucking footballs?"
01:04:56,580;01:05:00,500;"Like, I don't understand what you're getting at there."
01:05:00,500;01:05:01,340;"- Well, they're getting at,"
01:05:01,340;01:05:03,660;"that's an old record, Andy, do you not agree?"
01:05:04,860;01:05:06,580;"I don't think that's where they were going with it."
01:05:06,580;01:05:09,060;"I'm standing Dandy at all."
01:05:09,060;01:05:10,060;"I can see that."
01:05:10,060;01:05:12,060;"I'm going to."
01:05:12,060;01:05:14,820;"I'm fighting a good fight for my boy Dan."
01:05:14,820;01:05:17,380;"So all right, if you had to pick one"
01:05:17,380;01:05:24,140;"to spend an eternity on an island, just the two of you,"
01:05:24,140;01:05:29,140;"would it be your choices are Dan Deodor or Bill Belichick?"
01:05:29,140;01:05:30,140;"Oh, oh."
01:05:30,140;01:05:31,620;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:05:31,620;01:05:33,540;"We're brothers."
01:05:33,540;01:05:37,820;"I mean, you guys are Steve first Steve for sure"
01:05:37,820;01:05:42,340;"Yeah, we have all the time. Yeah, he gives great foot rubs"
01:05:42,340;01:05:49,240;"I know that's a good question Bill said Bellachacks probably wicked boring dude. I mean I mean"
01:05:49,240;01:05:56,280;"It's like would you rather be bored or like wicked annoyed? Yeah, it's a really good one"
01:05:58,900;01:06:04,920;"I guess board maybe if you like broke Belichick down enough you could get him to open up. I bet he would yeah"
01:06:04,920;01:06:08,460;"I know you know he's like boring on on purpose. I feel like yeah"
01:06:08,460;01:06:11,420;"And every time you hear like when he's miked up and stuff"
01:06:11,420;01:06:15,880;"He's always like telling jokes and shit, but they're like not great the jokes"
01:06:15,880;01:06:19,100;"Like all right. I tell you about that one round coach of the rounds back in the 80s"
01:06:19,100;01:06:24,260;"Yeah, all the players like yeah about this guy like yeah, it's not funny. Yeah coach"
01:06:24,580;01:06:30,660;"Yeah, when all you care about is football you're just not gonna be like a well-rounded like good fun person to hang out with"
01:06:30,660;01:06:38,340;"Can I do my other best yeah sure can"
01:06:38,340;01:06:43,700;"One I look at the radio announcers"
01:06:43,700;01:06:52,100;"From remember they had the bills guy on yeah, yeah, they said he was the longest serving radio announcer in NFL history"
01:06:53,500;01:06:58,560;"The bills guy who have been doing it since the bills were created as a franchise. Yeah, but didn't they say he missed?"
01:06:58,560;01:07:03,080;"He missed it for seven years because like the radio station went under or something"
01:07:03,080;01:07:09,160;"He was in second place was Gil Santos. Oh no shit"
01:07:09,160;01:07:13,940;"Hell yeah, I looked up who had a longer career like who who who yeah"
01:07:13,940;01:07:21,500;"Gil fucking crushes him really. Oh, yeah, so it was Gil in first place in 2012"
01:07:23,140;01:07:25,140;"That shmo was like"
01:07:25,140;01:07:29,940;"1957 to 2002. Oh whatever"
01:07:29,940;01:07:32,780;"Who's the longest?"
01:07:32,780;01:07:34,780;"Oh, I didn't look that up"
01:07:34,780;01:07:38,300;"Probably yeah, the guy from the Cubs, right? He was there forever"
01:07:38,300;01:07:45,660;"Well, I think it was just football. Yes like I started when the bill started. Yeah, and still must not have been too far behind either"
01:07:45,660;01:07:47,660;"Right, even the Patriots started"
01:07:47,660;01:07:52,740;"You would play for the Patriots when the Patriots are oh, J. You know"
01:07:52,740;01:07:53,740;"No."
01:07:53,740;01:07:57,740;"What do you just know for football and not for?"
01:07:57,740;01:07:58,740;"Yeah."
01:07:58,740;01:07:59,740;"Yeah."
01:07:59,740;01:08:01,740;"And then my best best fitting gloves is this next gift."
01:08:01,740;01:08:03,740;"I'm going to share screen again."
01:08:03,740;01:08:04,740;"Oh, good."
01:08:04,740;01:08:05,740;"Audio."
01:08:05,740;01:08:06,740;"Yep."
01:08:06,740;01:08:07,740;"Okay."
01:08:07,740;01:08:09,740;"Can you, can you give us a this?"
01:08:09,740;01:08:10,740;"This is such a throwback."
01:08:10,740;01:08:11,740;"Play by play."
01:08:11,740;01:08:14,740;"You should be able to share your audio too."
01:08:14,740;01:08:15,740;"There's no audio."
01:08:15,740;01:08:16,740;"It's just my fable."
01:08:16,740;01:08:17,740;"Okay."
01:08:17,740;01:08:24,020;"Is Mike Raywell in his he must have had a baller game wearing the shark tooth hat, which you're wearing right now Greg"
01:08:24,020;01:08:26,500;"Uh-huh just looking super young"
01:08:26,500;01:08:31,700;"And then it pulls up his little stat line of how long he's been in the year"
01:08:31,700;01:08:34,260;"Seven years Ohio State"
01:08:34,260;01:08:36,460;"28"
01:08:36,460;01:08:39,220;"And you're sitting here chilling on the sideline as a patron"
01:08:39,220;01:08:46,220;"Little do we know he would guarantee he would cut off his penis if the tenants he tight is would win a Super Bowl"
01:08:46,420;01:08:48,420;"How far we've come oh"
01:08:48,420;01:08:53,860;"Man football's different these days I came for my thumb on it"
01:08:53,860;01:08:58,660;"But oh, man"
01:08:58,660;01:09:06,660;"All right, Gregory you want to do your best and worse yes, I do okay"
01:09:06,660;01:09:09,300;"so my best"
01:09:09,300;01:09:15,020;"Was a sand gas sighting yes best name for a full-back"
01:09:15,580;01:09:17,580;"Yeah"
01:09:17,580;01:09:19,500;"No, I"
01:09:19,500;01:09:23,720;"He's got a cousin named Thad Gash"
01:09:23,720;01:09:27,220;"Thad Alvin Gash Jr. Which is"
01:09:27,220;01:09:33,400;"Kick ass name to be honest like I usually shit on the juniors like naming your kid after self"
01:09:33,400;01:09:38,400;"But if your name is Thad Gash you goddamn right your name you can't say anything. Yeah, that's"
01:09:38,400;01:09:44,860;"Play in the NFL - apparently oh damn pull back had to be I have no idea"
01:09:44,860;01:09:46,060;"- Yeah."
01:09:46,060;01:09:49,020;"Another interesting note about Sam Gash."
01:09:49,020;01:09:51,660;"I mean, obviously, you know, old school Pats fans"
01:09:51,660;01:09:53,620;"don't know what he played for the past for years."
01:09:53,620;01:09:57,660;"He made a Pro Bowl."
01:09:57,660;01:09:58,940;"He didn't make a Pro Bowl with the Pats,"
01:09:58,940;01:09:59,980;"but he did make a Pro Bowl,"
01:09:59,980;01:10:04,620;"and he was the first ever back in NFL history"
01:10:04,620;01:10:07,980;"to make the Pro Bowl without a single rushing attempt"
01:10:07,980;01:10:09,380;"in the regular season."
01:10:09,380;01:10:10,500;"- Holy shit."
01:10:10,500;01:10:11,340;"- Yeah."
01:10:11,340;01:10:12,160;"- No way."
01:10:12,160;01:10:12,980;"- That's impressive."
01:10:14,020;01:10:15,700;"just that could have a road greater, huh?"
01:10:15,700;01:10:17,980;"Yeah, I guess I might have caught."
01:10:17,980;01:10:19,500;"I think he was more like a"
01:10:19,500;01:10:22,780;"passing option at that because he caught a pass in this game."
01:10:22,780;01:10:24,860;"He did. I mean, it didn't."
01:10:24,860;01:10:26,860;"It didn't look particularly natural."
01:10:26,860;01:10:29,700;"Yeah, because no Mark Edwards, if you will."
01:10:29,700;01:10:33,220;"But I asked what a great fucking name, huh?"
01:10:33,220;01:10:33,460;"Right."
01:10:33,460;01:10:36,340;"Yeah, for somebody who's supposed to open up holes."
01:10:36,340;01:10:37,700;"Like that's perfect. Yeah."
01:10:37,700;01:10:38,700;"No."
01:10:38,700;01:10:41,540;"My worst is going to be"
01:10:42,700;01:10:47,500;"probably lawyer maloised mood directly after this game. Like I"
01:10:47,500;01:10:50,740;"can't imagine what was going through his head where they turn"
01:10:50,740;01:10:54,220;"around from week one where he thinks he's going on to like a"
01:10:54,220;01:10:58,580;"Super Bowl contender. Yeah, they beat the past 31 nothing. The"
01:10:58,580;01:11:01,260;"whole city's behind them. They got the lead. So they got"
01:11:01,260;01:11:05,340;"stacked as team. They're tuning all they're like, dude, this"
01:11:05,340;01:11:09,420;"was such a good decision to go to Buffalo. I'm gonna I'm gonna"
01:11:09,420;01:11:12,420;"fucking st-- I'm going to shove this down Bell check throat too."
01:11:12,420;01:11:14,320;"And the wrong fucking sense."
01:11:14,320;01:11:16,520;"They're out of the playoffs."
01:11:16,520;01:11:19,980;"He just fucking hurt his buddy Tom Brady."
01:11:19,980;01:11:20,520;"Yeah."
01:11:20,520;01:11:22,620;"And they fucking are trash."
01:11:22,620;01:11:28,320;"Also, on the Patriots first drive, it was Loy Malloy, who was called for defensive"
01:11:28,320;01:11:30,920;"pass interference in the end zone, which set up the first touchdown."
01:11:30,920;01:11:36,020;"And like he was the closest player to Givens when Givens scored his touchdown too."
01:11:36,020;01:11:37,920;"So not even a great game from Loyer."
01:11:38,520;01:11:43,560;"God damn shoes. Yeah, so not great. Yeah. I mean, I still love lawyer"
01:11:43,560;01:11:46,840;"Malay. And I'll always love lawyer Malay. Absolutely. Part of the law"
01:11:46,840;01:11:54,040;"firm. But just you got to feel for him for his dreams being shattered at this"
01:11:54,040;01:12:00,040;"point. Yeah, that's brutal. Mm hmm. Yeah, because I mean, and he, I guess he kind"
01:12:00,040;01:12:04,920;"of had a say in the decision at the beginning of the season. But like he was"
01:12:04,920;01:12:08,400;"also being asked to like take a cuz oven. Yeah. So I"
01:12:08,400;01:12:10,740;"understand that I got no problem with decision he made,"
01:12:10,740;01:12:14,400;"you know, no, he's a he's a pro. He's look out for his family. I"
01:12:14,400;01:12:18,640;"get that. Oh, yeah, absolutely. So it sucks. It does suck."
01:12:18,640;01:12:24,840;"That's what I'm saying. It's all about setting expectations in"
01:12:24,840;01:12:27,960;"life where if you expect to be bad, you'll never be"
01:12:27,960;01:12:34,240;"disappointed. But if you set that bar too high, you know, you're"
01:12:34,240;01:12:41,240;"asking for the hurt. There's something with a dumpster and a trash can or something like that, Greg, you have an analogy for this."
01:12:41,240;01:12:48,240;"What? And it's like you expect a dumpster and you get a trash can, you'd be like, Oh, all right."
01:12:48,240;01:12:55,240;"I think we talked about it in the pot before. Yeah, I haven't heard that."
01:12:56,240;01:12:57,300;"- I don't know."
01:12:57,300;01:12:59,420;"- Yeah, I like the setting expectations, that's good."
01:12:59,420;01:13:01,580;"- That's Greg's approach with his wife, with Kelly."
01:13:01,580;01:13:02,620;"- Yeah, right, right, yeah."
01:13:02,620;01:13:05,220;"- She expects I'm a dumpster fire"
01:13:05,220;01:13:07,180;"and then she just gets a trash can fire."
01:13:07,180;01:13:10,140;"- Yeah, yeah, that's, yeah, exactly."
01:13:10,140;01:13:13,180;"Setting expectations is, it's a real part of life"
01:13:13,180;01:13:15,460;"that we need to get better at, you know?"
01:13:15,460;01:13:16,580;"- I agree, yeah."
01:13:16,580;01:13:20,100;"Both at work and then your personal life."
01:13:20,100;01:13:21,100;"- Mm-hmm."
01:13:21,100;01:13:22,860;"- And you want to set them as low as possible as the key,"
01:13:22,860;01:13:23,700;"I think."
01:13:23,700;01:13:26,100;"- Yeah, we're all, we're all mediocre."
01:13:26,100;01:13:30,060;"The three of us are like definition of mediocre."
01:13:30,060;01:13:30,900;"Oh yeah."
01:13:30,900;01:13:31,740;"And the sooner we--"
01:13:31,740;01:13:33,660;"When we wake up at the podcast, like that's--"
01:13:33,660;01:13:34,100;"Yeah."
01:13:34,100;01:13:37,220;"If you look up mediocre in the dictionary,"
01:13:37,220;01:13:39,980;"it's three white men with a podcast."
01:13:39,980;01:13:40,740;"Yeah."
01:13:40,740;01:13:42,300;"We're actually a cliche."
01:13:42,300;01:13:43,420;"We're a meme."
01:13:43,420;01:13:43,900;"Yeah."
01:13:43,900;01:13:44,420;"Yeah."
01:13:44,420;01:13:46,420;"It's podcasts that we're doing now."
01:13:46,420;01:13:50,180;"What do you call a group of white males?"
01:13:50,180;01:13:52,860;"You call them a podcast."
01:13:52,860;01:13:54,860;"Yelling into the abyss."
01:13:54,860;01:13:55,340;"Exactly."
01:13:55,340;01:13:57,100;"yelling into the universe."
01:13:57,100;01:14:02,300;"- Well, all right, that took a turn."
01:14:02,300;01:14:03,140;"I wasn't expecting anything."
01:14:03,140;01:14:04,540;"- You know we're all gonna die one day."
01:14:04,540;01:14:05,540;"You gotta get back."
01:14:05,540;01:14:07,060;"(laughing)"
01:14:07,060;01:14:08,780;"- Yeah, but you know what'll live on forever?"
01:14:08,780;01:14:10,340;"- Just fucking podcast."
01:14:10,340;01:14:11,380;"- You fucking right."
01:14:11,380;01:14:12,620;"- You're gonna run this thing."
01:14:12,620;01:14:13,460;"- Yep."
01:14:13,460;01:14:14,420;"- Ugh."
01:14:14,420;01:14:15,780;"Dude, that leg dick."
01:14:15,780;01:14:19,700;"Fucking comment, that, that's in the annals of time."
01:14:19,700;01:14:20,700;"- It'll never die."
01:14:20,700;01:14:21,540;"- Yeah."
01:14:21,540;01:14:22,380;"- Oh God."
01:14:22,380;01:14:25,420;"There's somebody in like 20, 60 when the paths are terrible."
01:14:25,420;01:14:27,900;"They're going to be like, I wonder how it was when Brady was flying."
01:14:27,900;01:14:31,580;"And they're like, damn, this Dan Deegar sounds like a dickhead."
01:14:31,580;01:14:36,300;"I wonder where he's buried."
01:14:36,300;01:14:36,780;"Good."
01:14:36,780;01:14:40,980;"Ah, too far too far."
01:14:40,980;01:14:41,500;"Yeah."
01:14:41,500;01:14:42,580;"I'll take that back."
01:14:42,580;01:14:45,020;"All right."
01:14:45,020;01:14:47,260;"I'll do my best and worst to recover from that."
01:14:47,260;01:14:48,180;"My best."
01:14:48,180;01:14:48,820;"I got a couple."
01:14:48,820;01:14:52,020;"Um, first one is totally Ben DeCain's first sack."
01:14:52,020;01:14:57,260;"his career. Yeah. Oh, where he just kind of wrapped up through blood. So and then like"
01:14:57,260;01:15:01,860;"didn't tackle him because blood so had like a flung. Like who else can we send on a blitz"
01:15:01,860;01:15:04,180;"just sit down the roster, get everybody some experience."
01:15:04,180;01:15:09,580;"Fuck, telly band decay and also, um, Gerard Cherry had a nice blitz off the edge and he"
01:15:09,580;01:15:14,420;"caught, what was the name Travis Brown? Completely unaware. And I think may have concussed him"
01:15:14,420;01:15:20,660;"too. That was the brutal it. Yeah. Um, so telly, uh, who hopefully we'll have on to discuss"
01:15:20,660;01:15:29,300;"credit cards would be good. Also Tom Brady did not throw an interception at home in this"
01:15:29,300;01:15:33,660;"season. All 12 of his interceptions came on the road and the Patriots now have home field"
01:15:33,660;01:15:40,460;"advantage all the way through the playoffs. So that might work out. And then my last best."
01:15:40,460;01:15:47,780;"Oh, yeah, they talked about David Gibbons. And did you boys realize that he was a running"
01:15:47,780;01:15:52,460;"back at Notre Dame who converted to wide receiver. I had no idea."
01:15:52,460;01:15:54,380;"I've heard that as well."
01:15:54,380;01:15:59,900;"His stats were like, yeah, like 20 catches his senior year, something crazy."
01:15:59,900;01:16:03,140;"Yeah, I could see the wide receiver before they had dropped it and tried to convert him."
01:16:03,140;01:16:08,740;"I don't know. That's what the commentator said that he was running back at Notre Dame and then he"
01:16:08,740;01:16:14,660;"converted to wide receiver and the page is drafted as a wide out. He looks at the case. He is. Yeah,"
01:16:14,660;01:16:19,220;"He's a natural wider series like but he's also like built like a big wide series you like that's not"
01:16:19,220;01:16:26,580;"Running back built. I wrote this down watching this game. He is what we all wish Nick Hill Harry could be"
01:16:26,580;01:16:29,060;"or"
01:16:29,060;01:16:30,420;"Malcolm Mitchell"
01:16:30,420;01:16:35,380;"Well, Machel Mitchell like he was but like that's that prototype"
01:16:35,380;01:16:40,980;"I think Belichick was looking for was that David Givens and then the Malcolm Mitchell and probably even Aaron Dobson"
01:16:42,020;01:16:44,580;"the big bodied wide receiver Aaron dropson."
01:16:44,580;01:16:48,580;"Call what you will. Ken Braille dropkins."
01:16:48,580;01:16:54,260;"That one doesn't quite work really like it. But speaking of misses."
01:16:54,260;01:17:04,100;"They're bullsh*t Andy. In 2000 he had 24 rushing attempts, 25 catches, and then a senior"
01:17:04,100;01:17:11,060;"he had 33 catches, 6 rushes. Yeah. So yeah, so he started as a running back, converted in college"
01:17:11,060;01:17:15,780;"to a while. No, like 99 he had 14 catches and 13 rushes. So he's"
01:17:15,780;01:17:21,540;"kind of stuck on that or carry or carries. No catches. So he's"
01:17:21,540;01:17:25,580;"basically James White. Cool. You showed me my worst other"
01:17:25,580;01:17:30,500;"than getting a little spicy on the quad here tonight. He did have"
01:17:30,500;01:17:33,220;"seven Russian touchdowns. Three guys want to talk about it. Is"
01:17:33,220;01:17:35,860;"there something there's something going on between you guys"
01:17:35,860;01:17:39,500;"that you want to talk about? Yeah, I'm just I'm just insanely"
01:17:39,500;01:17:42,940;"jealous that he has a dog and I don't so I'm taking on the podcast."
01:17:42,940;01:17:46,100;"It's pretty great."
01:17:46,100;01:17:47,780;"Yeah, I go fuck yourself."
01:17:47,780;01:17:51,540;"Yeah, dude, those those videos that you send every day that are all the same."
01:17:51,540;01:17:52,220;"They're sick."
01:17:52,220;01:17:52,900;"I love them."
01:17:52,900;01:17:54,900;"I'm living vicariously."
01:17:54,900;01:17:57,580;"Yeah, they're not for you."
01:17:57,580;01:17:58,540;"They're friends, kids."
01:17:58,540;01:17:59,940;"Yeah, well, man."
01:17:59,940;01:18:03,980;"Hey, just know every time he's someone, there's someone out there that hates it, Steve."
01:18:03,980;01:18:06,540;"But no, that's not."
01:18:06,540;01:18:07,060;"No, Greg."
01:18:07,660;01:18:10,360;"If you're not supposed to be booked, that would be true."
01:18:10,360;01:18:12,400;"But I put it in our group chat for our family."
01:18:12,400;01:18:14,160;"So I know it's not somebody who hates it."
01:18:14,160;01:18:16,160;"It's specifically me."
01:18:16,160;01:18:19,000;"So Greg, is there something you want to get out?"
01:18:19,000;01:18:20,440;"Is there something between you and Steve?"
01:18:20,440;01:18:21,640;"That's going on anyway."
01:18:21,640;01:18:23,480;"There's always been something."
01:18:23,480;01:18:25,240;"There's always been something between the Steve."
01:18:25,240;01:18:26,920;"From the fucking list."
01:18:26,920;01:18:30,080;"First of all, he's a big dumb asshole."
01:18:30,080;01:18:30,580;"OK?"
01:18:30,580;01:18:35,240;"He's a P-brained fucking uncouth piece of shit."
01:18:35,240;01:18:37,280;"So we'll start there."
01:18:37,280;01:18:39,720;"uncouth, okay. As a podcast."
01:18:39,720;01:18:44,800;"I was trying to think of that word that you use about like people that are bad at technology."
01:18:44,800;01:18:48,200;"What is it? Oh, no."
01:18:48,200;01:18:49,600;"Oh, my God."
01:18:49,600;01:18:50,880;"Is that a religion?"
01:18:50,880;01:18:52,000;"Yeah."
01:18:52,000;01:18:54,160;"A lot of it. A lot of it."
01:18:54,160;01:18:55,960;"That's what it is. Yeah."
01:18:55,960;01:18:59,960;"I actually, ever since you explained that word to me, I'm hearing it everywhere."
01:18:59,960;01:19:01,680;"You know, that happens sometimes."
01:19:01,680;01:19:02,320;"Yep."
01:19:02,320;01:19:03,440;"It's a good word."
01:19:03,440;01:19:04,440;"It's a great word."
01:19:04,440;01:19:05,600;"Yeah. Drop a lot."
01:19:05,600;01:19:07,000;"You're fucking Luddite Steve."
01:19:07,000;01:19:08,000;"That's what you are."
01:19:08,000;01:19:09,080;"I hate technology."
01:19:09,080;01:19:10,880;"What do you mean?"
01:19:10,880;01:19:11,320;"I don't know."
01:19:11,320;01:19:13,000;"It's just a sweet word, dude."
01:19:13,000;01:19:13,480;"I don't know."
01:19:13,480;01:19:16,760;"OK, cool."
01:19:16,760;01:19:19,560;"But yeah, speaking of misses, my worst Adam"
01:19:19,560;01:19:23,040;"Minnitary has missed nine field goals this season."
01:19:23,040;01:19:24,360;"The most he's ever missed."
01:19:24,360;01:19:26,120;"24 yard."
01:19:26,120;01:19:29,560;"Yeah, Mr. Chip's check was like, what the fuck?"
01:19:29,560;01:19:30,040;"Yeah."
01:19:30,040;01:19:32,080;"And they went and got them another field goal anyways."
01:19:32,080;01:19:32,760;"Yeah."
01:19:32,760;01:19:34,160;"Yeah, because it was a 28-0."
01:19:34,160;01:19:37,560;"And there could have gone up 31 and he misses the chip shop field goal."
01:19:37,560;01:19:40,120;"Were they playing for the 31? Do you think?"
01:19:40,120;01:19:41,720;"Yes. I do."
01:19:41,720;01:19:44,480;"You think Belichick would do that?"
01:19:44,480;01:19:47,320;"No, because I think if they were, they would have left the defensive starters."
01:19:47,320;01:19:49,960;"And they're kind of conservative, you know, they're playing kind of super"
01:19:49,960;01:19:53,240;"conservative and red zone of like, but you could argue that I'm kind of getting"
01:19:53,240;01:19:53,760;"the touchdown."
01:19:53,760;01:19:54,800;"Let's just kick the field goal."
01:19:54,800;01:19:55,800;"Yeah, I don't think so."
01:19:55,800;01:19:59,160;"I think that's always a question with Belichick, right?"
01:19:59,160;01:20:00,800;"Does he do things out of spite?"
01:20:00,800;01:20:02,160;"Definitely does."
01:20:02,200;01:20:09,000;"where like calling seems to say it, but I mean, he would never admit it a million years, but the fuck you touchdowns of oh seven."
01:20:09,000;01:20:09,960;"Yep. Yep."
01:20:09,960;01:20:12,680;"We're definitely like, there's some spite in there."
01:20:12,680;01:20:14,560;"Oh, yeah. Running up the score just in every game."
01:20:14,560;01:20:15,000;"No seven."
01:20:15,000;01:20:22,560;"I think getting it 31 nothing was also a fuck you because as soon as the military misses that, you see in his face, he's like, what the fuck?"
01:20:22,560;01:20:28,560;"And then they go and get the because when he's lining it up, I was like, oh, here's the 31 nothing and he misses it."
01:20:28,560;01:20:30,080;"And I was like, oh, we kick another field goal."
01:20:30,080;01:20:33,840;"And the next field goal they kick was also 24 yards."
01:20:33,840;01:20:34,200;"Yeah."
01:20:34,200;01:20:35,640;"And you almost hooked that one too."
01:20:35,640;01:20:44,000;"But no, I, I don't think in this case, it was, I think it was just"
01:20:44,000;01:20:47,280;"Belichick being Belichick."
01:20:47,280;01:20:48,880;"Oh, this lead isn't big enough."
01:20:48,880;01:20:51,160;"Cause it's, it's, it's true blood."
01:20:51,160;01:20:55,560;"So, I mean, obviously I don't think there was ever a chance, but it's like 28 to three"
01:20:55,560;01:20:59,600;"being up 28 to three in the third quarter of a Super Bowl, you know,"
01:20:59,600;01:21:03,320;"like it's the lead is just not big enough to guarantee that you're going to win."
01:21:03,320;01:21:06,640;"So you're going to keep trying to add some points."
01:21:06,640;01:21:07,120;"All right."
01:21:07,120;01:21:08,080;"I think you're wrong."
01:21:08,080;01:21:10,840;"But I all right."
01:21:10,840;01:21:12,480;"Well, then I explained to me this."
01:21:12,480;01:21:14,280;"Explain to me this."
01:21:14,280;01:21:16,320;"I just moved on after I gave my best."
01:21:16,320;01:21:17,520;"I didn't get to do my worst."
01:21:17,520;01:21:19,440;"They explained to me this before you do your worst."
01:21:19,440;01:21:21,440;"Yeah. Let's get through this argument here."
01:21:21,520;01:21:27,800;"If Belichick was that concerned about winning 31 nothing, why did he pull his"
01:21:27,800;01:21:29,760;"defense before the last couple of drives?"
01:21:29,760;01:21:30,800;"Good point."
01:21:30,800;01:21:34,120;"Steve care to comment his backups more."
01:21:34,120;01:21:35,840;"Season is backups."
01:21:35,840;01:21:38,360;"Let the other team drive straight down the field to the one yard."
01:21:38,360;01:21:40,960;"I know because John hasn't a crazy sack."
01:21:40,960;01:21:46,200;"Yeah, but then they gave up a bunch of big plays that put the put the bills on"
01:21:46,200;01:21:46,920;"the one yard line."
01:21:46,920;01:21:50,400;"First and goal from the one with 17 seconds left with the whole team."
01:21:50,400;01:21:52,260;"Travis Henry was already rushed for 100 yards."
01:21:52,260;01:21:57,300;"He's he's he's building trust in his team and depth in his squad."
01:21:57,300;01:21:58,100;"I agree."
01:21:58,100;01:22:01,620;"But that's not what you do when you want to spy in."
01:22:01,620;01:22:02,000;"Yeah."
01:22:02,000;01:22:03,940;"When you want to win 31, nothing exactly."
01:22:03,940;01:22:06,740;"I'm just saying they got conservative in the red zone because they just"
01:22:06,740;01:22:09,720;"want to kick the field, go make it through or nothing as opposed to 35."
01:22:09,720;01:22:10,820;"Getting gear, sure."
01:22:10,820;01:22:11,300;"Give me shit."
01:22:11,300;01:22:12,340;"They were still slinging it."
01:22:12,340;01:22:16,300;"Pretty missed a couple of end zone froze when they were settled in for those."
01:22:16,300;01:22:19,760;"And my worst is actually a point in your column,"
01:22:19,760;01:22:24,760;"because listen to the bills penetration into the Patriots."
01:22:24,760;01:22:25,880;"- Oh yeah."
01:22:25,880;01:22:27,200;"- What?"
01:22:27,200;01:22:29,040;"- New England 26."
01:22:29,040;01:22:29,880;"- Yeah."
01:22:29,880;01:22:34,880;"- New England 15, New England 17, New England 22,"
01:22:34,880;01:22:37,140;"New England one yard line,"
01:22:37,140;01:22:38,800;"in a total of zero points."
01:22:38,800;01:22:39,920;"- Zero points, yeah."
01:22:39,920;01:22:41,880;"They got on the red zone like five times."
01:22:41,880;01:22:44,480;"- They were inside the red zone all the time."
01:22:44,480;01:22:46,600;"and just zero points."
01:22:46,600;01:22:48,600;"- And then like the 18 yard line fall start."
01:22:48,600;01:22:49,440;"(laughing)"
01:22:49,440;01:22:52,340;"- And then sack and then miss on fourth down"
01:22:52,340;01:22:56,720;"because their kicker was,"
01:22:56,720;01:22:59,080;"'cause you know how they show that line,"
01:22:59,080;01:23:00,560;"like the cool graph that they did,"
01:23:00,560;01:23:03,960;"like overlaid on the field when the field goal come out."
01:23:03,960;01:23:06,280;"It was like, oh, so from 10 to 20,"
01:23:06,280;01:23:09,680;"he's 92% and then from 20 to 30, he's 100%."
01:23:09,680;01:23:12,520;"And then from 30 to 40, 50%."
01:23:12,520;01:23:17,900;"kick a field goal of over 30 yards. That's not good for the NFL. Oh,"
01:23:17,900;01:23:24,020;"Oh, Greg Williams coach team though. So, you know, he's an honorable man."
01:23:24,020;01:23:30,280;"What are the fuck? Yeah. So that was a got her got an empathy for Greg Williams."
01:23:30,280;01:23:34,220;"This case. Yeah. Well, I don't know if this is a best or a worse, but this was"
01:23:34,220;01:23:37,980;"Greg Williams last game as a head coach with Buffalo. He did get fired."
01:23:37,980;01:23:41,620;"Good. You did it. This was it. This is his what this is how he went out,"
01:23:42,020;01:23:46,700;"which felt fitting. So I guess that's a best, a word for him,"
01:23:46,700;01:23:47,540;"but the best for us."
01:23:47,540;01:23:51,340;"I actually in researching that found an error in pro football"
01:23:51,340;01:23:52,100;"reference.com."
01:23:52,100;01:23:53,340;"Didn't."
01:23:53,340;01:23:54,140;"Yes, I did."
01:23:54,140;01:23:57,060;"I refuse to believe I'm listening."
01:23:57,060;01:23:59,460;"I was a Ryan Lindell 40 yard Pjilgal."
01:23:59,460;01:24:00,060;"No good."
01:24:00,060;01:24:04,420;"And if you remember any, they got a penalty on that."
01:24:04,420;01:24:06,300;"Then they tried another one."
01:24:06,300;01:24:07,540;"There's another one."
01:24:07,540;01:24:09,100;"Yeah, he missed."
01:24:09,100;01:24:10,100;"He missed a few."
01:24:10,100;01:24:11,820;"He missed a 45 yarder."
01:24:11,860;01:24:13,860;"And then they had the penalty and went up for a fourth"
01:24:13,860;01:24:15,700;"and then he missed a four-yard later."
01:24:15,700;01:24:16,520;"- Yep."
01:24:16,520;01:24:17,360;"- And a quarter."
01:24:17,360;01:24:20,700;"- We knew that, it's nasty."
01:24:20,700;01:24:23,700;"If there's one thing I can guarantee,"
01:24:23,700;01:24:25,620;"it's that you're wrong."
01:24:25,620;01:24:28,140;"Not pro football reference, dot com."
01:24:28,140;01:24:28,980;"Okay."
01:24:28,980;01:24:31,380;"(all laughing)"
01:24:31,380;01:24:33,780;"- This is why we have you to stat check our shit, Greg."
01:24:33,780;01:24:35,140;"(all laughing)"
01:24:35,140;01:24:37,140;"- Yeah, and you know how I stat check?"
01:24:37,140;01:24:39,540;"Pro football reference every fucking time."
01:24:39,540;01:24:40,460;"(all laughing)"
01:24:40,460;01:24:42,460;"I'm going to stat check in the stats, okay?"
01:24:42,460;01:24:43,940;"(laughing)"
01:24:43,940;01:24:44,940;"- How's that working out?"
01:24:44,940;01:24:48,820;"So Steve, did you say you had a worst?"
01:24:48,820;01:24:49,660;"Or was that it?"
01:24:49,660;01:24:50,580;"Was that take?"
01:24:50,580;01:24:52,020;"- As a bill stand watching this game,"
01:24:52,020;01:24:53,860;"watching them get inside the red zone all those times"
01:24:53,860;01:24:55,540;"and come over with zero points,"
01:24:55,540;01:24:57,420;"has to be the absolute worst."
01:24:57,420;01:24:58,780;"- Yeah, it can't be good."
01:24:58,780;01:25:01,020;"- 'Cause like I thought that we,"
01:25:01,020;01:25:04,460;"what the bills harder than they whooped us the first week."
01:25:04,460;01:25:07,780;"And that might be true in the first half,"
01:25:07,780;01:25:09,620;"but like the bills had chances"
01:25:09,620;01:25:16,580;"put points on the boards and just didn't. It was so big. Maybe again, but let's say this beat"
01:25:16,580;01:25:23,140;"in yourself. It's not like being beat, you know? Yeah. Well, so here's one last thing that I had."
01:25:23,140;01:25:30,500;"They showed a stat of Tom Brady, his numbers from 2001 when he was Super Bowl MVP, his numbers from"
01:25:30,500;01:25:39,540;"2003. So, oh one, completion percentage, just about 64%. 18 touchdowns, 12 interceptions,"
01:25:39,540;01:25:46,540;"2003, about 60% completion percentage, 19 touchdowns, 12 interceptions."
01:25:46,540;01:25:48,220;"So there's some similarities there."
01:25:48,220;01:25:53,340;"I wonder if that will carry over any more of these similarities into the playoffs and"
01:25:53,340;01:25:54,340;"maybe into Super Bowl."
01:25:54,340;01:25:58,180;"I think we'll have to find out next week."
01:25:58,180;01:25:59,180;"Bye week."
01:25:59,180;01:26:00,180;"What's next week?"
01:26:00,180;01:26:01,180;"Bye week."
01:26:01,180;01:26:03,100;"I suppose it is, isn't it?"
01:26:03,100;01:26:04,100;"Tuesday."
01:26:04,100;01:26:05,100;"Thursday."
01:26:05,100;01:26:06,100;"Wednesday."
01:26:06,100;01:26:09,100;"Who are we playing next week?"
01:26:09,100;01:26:14,300;"We're probably nobody's by we sit on our couch and watch the wild card see see"
01:26:14,300;01:26:23,140;"annual New England Patriots by week. That's true. All right. Well we we and then I"
01:26:23,140;01:26:29,680;"don't think that'll make very good radio. So we will play the winner of either the"
01:26:29,680;01:26:34,900;"Colts. No we can't play the Colts because they're the four. We could play Denver"
01:26:34,900;01:26:42,060;"Who's the six if they upset the Colts in Indianapolis or we could play the winner of Baltimore versus Tennessee"
01:26:42,060;01:26:44,060;"Yes being played in Tennessee"
01:26:44,060;01:26:48,020;"So Tennessee's pretty heavy favorites because they were 12 and 4"
01:26:48,020;01:26:54,780;"Time free AFC South they were favored by one in this game really yeah according to"
01:26:54,780;01:26:58,860;"Steve's least favorite website pro football reference. So that might be wrong"
01:27:04,180;01:27:07,860;"But yeah, I think the yeah Ravens were a good team this year. I"
01:27:07,860;01:27:11,960;"Know their quarterback play is hilarious"
01:27:11,960;01:27:18,260;"The Ravens. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, they want to hear the three quarterbacks that threw passes this year"
01:27:18,260;01:27:24,420;"I'm looking at them Kyle bowler. Yeah was number one thing you write and Chris Redmond"

01:27:52,480;01:27:54,980;"2000 yard rusher. Yep"
01:27:54,980;01:27:57,020;"Ray Lewis"
01:27:57,020;01:27:59,200;"- Top 10 defense."
01:27:59,200;01:28:03,360;"- Adelius Thomas, Peter Bullaware, Chris McAllister."
01:28:03,360;01:28:08,040;"- The defense was ranked third in yards against"
01:28:08,040;01:28:09,560;"and six in points against."
01:28:09,560;01:28:10,400;"- Yeah, but they're facing--"
01:28:10,400;01:28:12,080;"- And they had like eight pro bowlers"
01:28:12,080;01:28:13,760;"compared to the path to it too."
01:28:13,760;01:28:17,320;"- They're facing country strong pro MVP."
01:28:17,320;01:28:19,840;"- This is true, yeah, co MVP."
01:28:19,840;01:28:22,520;"Also Jeff Fisher noted--"
01:28:22,520;01:28:23,720;"- Mustache."
01:28:23,720;01:28:25,440;"- Incredible head coach,"
01:28:25,440;01:28:28,880;"who would definitely not get blown out by the Patriots in 2006."
01:28:28,880;01:28:31,800;"Speaking of Tom Brady's six touchdowns."
01:28:31,800;01:28:35,320;"So yeah, so next week we will find out who we're playing."
01:28:35,320;01:28:37,120;"Do you want to spoil it now or no?"
01:28:37,120;01:28:38,480;"We're going to hold off."
01:28:38,480;01:28:39,840;"I think everyone remembers."
01:28:39,840;01:28:41,560;"And it's a suspense."
01:28:41,560;01:28:43,440;"Yeah, I tell you, what do we have?"
01:28:43,440;01:28:44,800;"Let me just Google it real quick."
01:28:44,800;01:28:47,600;"Well, let's also add that season awards here."
01:28:47,600;01:28:51,960;"The MVP, there's co-MVPs of NFL this year."
01:28:52,800;01:28:54,200;"- Jay Manning."
01:28:54,200;01:28:57,720;"- And Steve McNair."
01:28:57,720;01:28:59,040;"- Country strong."
01:28:59,040;01:28:59,880;"- Country strong."
01:28:59,880;01:29:01,280;"- You written there."
01:29:01,280;01:29:03,160;"- The Napa extraordinaire."
01:29:03,160;01:29:04,720;"- Napa extraordinaire, yeah."

01:29:08,400;01:29:09,960;"- So I think the worst thing."
01:29:09,960;01:29:12,160;"- If that doesn't cue you into who we're playing next week,"
01:29:12,160;01:29:14,000;"then you're listening to the wrong podcast."
01:29:14,000;01:29:15,760;"- I think the worst thing for the Patriots"
01:29:15,760;01:29:18,840;"would be to have to play both of those players, right?"
01:29:18,840;01:29:19,680;"- Yeah."
01:29:19,680;01:29:21,360;"- That would be like the hardest road possible"
01:29:21,360;01:29:23,000;"to the Super Bowl."
01:29:23,000;01:29:25,160;"So hopefully that doesn't happen,"
01:29:25,160;01:29:28,360;"and the Patriots have an easy road to the big game,"
01:29:28,360;01:29:29,840;"and we'll see what happens."
01:29:29,840;01:29:33,680;"Next week on the Patriots Dynasty Podcast."

01:29:59,280;01:30:02,200;"- Is that just you stop smoking weed?"
01:30:02,200;01:30:05,300;"(laughing)"

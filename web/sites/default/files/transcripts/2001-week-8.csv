00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,160;"I am not your mother."
00:19,160;00:26,640;"Alright, should we just jump right in, shall we boys?"
00:26,640;00:27,640;"Alright."
00:27,640;00:30,640;"It's on too excited Jesus."
00:30,640;00:38,640;"Hi, welcome to the Page of Dinesy podcast in person Page of Dinesy podcast this week."
00:38,640;00:40,640;"Yeah."
00:40,640;00:45,640;"We are here in New Hampshire and the sticks of New Hampshire."
00:45,640;00:49,640;"This probably won't be aired at Christmas, but it is Christmas for us."
00:49,640;00:53,640;"So we are all together in the same room for the first time in."
00:53,640;00:58,120;"Fucking years I would think and I gotta say this really drives home on the point that"
00:58,120;01:03,560;"We're all people for radio. You know looking at how ugly you guys"
01:03,560;01:08,120;"I don't know I've missed mr. Mel has a face for"
01:08,120;01:17,220;"It's not like a man and bonnets like a man"
01:17,220;01:22,380;"Pony I was thinking of putting it up like I didn't know"
01:22,920;01:26,600;"I didn't know what the family was gonna say. I didn't know what your parents would have you know"
01:26,600;01:32,800;"I wanted to be respected you came with the last family I look got it. Oh, so you can turn that into a froke you want"
01:32,800;01:35,960;"Yes, I I"
01:35,960;01:40,600;"Hate to admit it, but it was recently straight"
01:40,600;01:47,040;"At least I don't support the Rams"
01:51,360;01:52,360;"the play-off."
01:52,360;01:53,360;"Exactly, right?"
01:53,360;01:54,840;"The Super Bowl hangover."
01:54,840;01:56,840;"Yeah."
01:56,840;02:00,720;"And I, this is another new Patriots, but I heard it today."
02:00,720;02:06,160;"It was a stat that I heard that I've already told Steven, but I needed to share with as"
02:06,160;02:07,920;"many people as possible."
02:07,920;02:18,260;"So I heard a stat today for James Winston and the games where he has thrown a, his record"
02:18,260;02:23,340;"in games where he's thrown an interception on the first drive. He is four and two in those"
02:23,340;02:29,980;"games. Wow. That makes sense. Two things. One. He's done it six times this year. Right."
02:29,980;02:36,180;"Enough to track it. He's got a winning record. Good for him. What about all the other times?"
02:36,180;02:39,660;"Other times what? What's the record? I don't know what they're at right now. They're eight"
02:39,660;02:43,380;"and eight. I think like eight and eight. Oh, okay. They just lost. But they sell another"
02:43,380;02:45,980;"the week to go. He's got time to set this record and own it."
02:45,980;02:47,660;"Yeah, they're they're they're"
02:47,660;02:52,140;"supremely mediocre, but he could he could join the 30 30 club to"
02:52,140;02:54,860;"yeah, where you touched on 30 because he's I think is he"
02:54,860;02:56,980;"leading the league in both touchdowns and interceptions?"
02:56,980;03:02,940;"Maybe not touchdown. I think Jackson. But he's top three"
03:02,940;03:07,140;"touchdowns and far and away to leave. He'd be the first ever"
03:07,140;03:08,980;"30. That's impressive."
03:10,660;03:18,340;"call it thirty for thirty. He's tied right with the NFL record on pick sixes. On pick sixes in"
03:18,340;03:23,860;"the season. Yes. With did anybody know this? Yeah, it was the Houston Texans, dude. No, you"
03:23,860;03:32,580;"would think you like me very close. But no, yes. Oh, really? Six in one season. And I haven't"
03:32,580;03:36,100;"actually looked it up at which season it was, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was the one we're"
03:36,100;03:41,820;"We're talking about this week or this year because he threw two against the Patriots"
03:41,820;03:44,460;"in the first time the past with the Colts."
03:44,460;03:48,380;"One to Tylon, one to OTIS, Otis Smith."
03:48,380;03:54,180;"So how was that debate for goats to Addis between Peyton and Brady going these days?"
03:54,180;04:01,140;"Yeah, if Peyton is tied with Jameson, any interception category all time, that's a"
04:01,140;04:03,420;"black mark for sure."
04:03,420;04:08,460;"All right, that's all I want to talk about, but I mean, we'll stay in the, where the"
04:08,460;04:09,460;"NFC South?"
04:09,460;04:11,380;"Is that where the Buccaneers are?"
04:11,380;04:12,380;"Yeah."
04:12,380;04:17,640;"With the Atlanta Falcons going down to the ATL, we actually made it halfway through the"
04:17,640;04:19,120;"season boys."
04:19,120;04:22,120;"I was, I didn't think that would happen."
04:22,120;04:26,340;"I mean, it only took us like most of a regular NFL season though."
04:26,340;04:27,340;"Yeah."
04:27,340;04:28,340;"Fair."
04:28,340;04:31,340;"Guys, we got there."
04:31,340;04:32,340;"Radical Vlogs."
04:32,340;04:36,780;"All right, so week, week eight coming in this game,"
04:36,780;04:39,020;"Pat's are three and four Falcons are three and three."
04:39,020;04:41,660;"So battle of mediocrity in theory,"
04:41,660;04:43,460;"at least at this point of the season."
04:43,460;04:48,460;"The let's see, the Falcons will finish this season"
04:48,460;04:51,860;"wired in mediocrity, we'll finish season seven and nine."
04:51,860;04:54,700;"Fourth in the NFC West."
04:54,700;04:56,940;"So when I was at the NFC South, you all agree with me?"
04:56,940;04:57,780;"Fuck all of us."
05:00,900;05:05,140;"in the NSC West. It's like Sam Fran, the Rams, Cardinals, right?"
05:05,140;05:09,860;"Well, this is pre 2002 when they shifted everything. So we both may be right."
05:09,860;05:12,060;"Oh, boy. I'm not about to look it up."
05:12,060;05:14,380;"Can we get all man? Am I the guy looking things up again?"
05:14,380;05:15,860;"Because that ended very well."
05:15,860;05:18,220;"Why would you put Indy in the East?"
05:18,220;05:19,780;"Elouch Miami in the East."
05:19,780;05:21,420;"Yeah."
05:21,420;05:22,700;"There."
05:22,700;05:24,940;"So yeah, who would it be in the in the AFC East?"
05:24,940;05:26,300;"Who would you put if you realign them?"
05:26,300;05:30,100;"Patriots bills."
05:30,100;05:32,100;"The Quebec"
05:32,100;05:35,820;"That's you know, I don't know if you want to put both"
05:35,820;05:38,860;"New York teams in the same"
05:38,860;05:45,460;"That would be pretty see like those. Oh Pittsburgh Steelers. Yeah, yeah"
05:45,460;05:49,700;"Next closest and that would be a hell of a rivalry. Well, it wouldn't have been"
05:49,700;05:53,900;"Everybody in the AFC North would think so, but"
05:53,900;05:59,220;"The Patriots have owned the Steelers over those years right still is fencing all that"
05:59,220;06:08,760;"deep down they do but they want to make it think about their call will make the playoffs and then we'll win the first round game and then we'll go to New England and beat the Patriots with the codges."
06:08,760;06:11,760;"It was like, okay, even you double."
06:11,760;06:13,760;"Quack, quack."
06:13,760;06:20,760;"Yeah, so the Falcons would win three in a row after this game."
06:20,760;06:23,760;"That was the longest winning streak of the season,"
06:23,760;06:28,760;"but they would follow that losing five of the last six games to finish."
06:28,760;06:33,760;"Out of the playoff hunt, we'll say, to be polite."
06:33,760;06:40,080;"had coached Dan Reeves, I remember Dan Reeves. Yeah. Coach for 23 years. I didn't realize he"
06:40,080;06:48,720;"coached that line. You got like fell off the horse. What? What? And it was paralyzed. Oh my god."
06:48,720;06:56,720;"I was skiing, Greg. And now the guy who played Superman. I know he's being slightly facetious."
06:56,720;07:03,120;"I don't remember that guy. That guy's not a super easy. All right. They may be related. We don't know."
07:03,120;07:13,560;"I mean, I won't say yeah, I'd like to force a Dan Reeves played retired against the pages, but this is his only game"
07:13,560;07:18,000;"So that joke doesn't really work. That would have been great though"
07:18,000;07:21,560;"It was only game against Belichick was this ever"
07:21,560;07:26,440;"At least when Belichick was on the pages. Yeah, even though"
07:26,440;07:31,720;"Coach 23 this is as late as once this is kind towards the end of the the"
07:32,440;07:38,400;"His tenure he did 12 years of Broncos for the Giants and then finished with seven years with the Falcons"
07:38,400;07:44,640;"So this key only coach still 2003 is 81 to 2003. So this was like this twilight era"
07:44,640;07:46,820;"He must have played bell check when he's in the Browns, maybe"
07:46,820;07:49,800;"You would think yeah"
07:49,800;07:56,040;"Probably maybe you were the Giants when he was defensive coordinator, but so there what?"
07:56,040;07:58,800;"Three years removed from their Super Bowl year"
07:58,800;08:01,800;"alright"
08:01,760;08:07,520;"No, 90 98 was the dirty birds whether one 14 and two oh man. I love that team. I was 98"
08:07,520;08:09,840;"So three years removed molly Anderson"
08:09,840;08:14,960;"Yeah, but after that so they went 14 to that year NFC champions made the Super Bowl"
08:14,960;08:18,080;"Didn't win it to the get rocked by somebody"
08:18,080;08:20,960;"Broncos. Yep, that was bad"
08:20,960;08:24,560;"Wait knows"
08:24,560;08:28,760;"It was 49ers. No, no, no, man. I'm thinking of somebody else"
08:28,760;08:30,760;"right on your right side."
08:30,760;08:32,260;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
08:32,260;08:33,260;"Sign up."
08:33,260;08:34,260;"Yeah."
08:34,260;08:43,760;"So in 14 and 2, that year, 98, 99, their Super Bowl hangover lasted 1, 2, 3, 3 years."
08:43,760;08:49,760;"And then at 5 and 11, 4 and 12, and then this year was 7 and 9, before they went."
08:49,760;08:51,760;"Wow, that's super bowl of 5 wins."
08:51,760;08:54,760;"Yeah, that's 4 wins the year after."
08:54,760;08:57,840;"Well, I mean I literally recognize nobody on this team"
08:57,840;09:00,920;"I remember my notes here. I don't recognize buddy"
09:00,920;09:07,980;"Oh shit algae crumpler and then who I spotted Mike Vick on the sidelines like that's literally how my thought process went"
09:07,980;09:12,640;"I knew nobody"
09:12,640;09:16,280;"Keith brookie. I recognize name, but I realize how"
09:16,280;09:21,120;"He was like the early actor type not just because he's white. Thank you Greg"
09:21,120;09:23,120;"I think you're gonna say that."
09:23,120;09:25,360;"(laughing)"
09:25,360;09:28,400;"- He also reminds me a lot of Sean Lee."
09:28,400;09:30,640;"(laughing)"
09:30,640;09:33,880;"- Well, yeah, no, he was pretty decent."
09:33,880;09:36,040;"I mean, there's a couple of good guys in there, right?"
09:36,040;09:38,160;"- Yeah, so I had,"
09:38,160;09:41,360;"he was the only pro-war on defense."
09:41,360;09:44,440;"He had 125 tackles that year."
09:44,440;09:47,320;"3 1/2 sacks, two picks, two fumble recoveries."
09:47,320;09:48,560;"Like the guy was absolutely,"
09:48,560;09:50,000;"I think he basically was a defense."
09:50,000;09:54,200;"he was a bit of a Sean Lee as the defense as he goes the defense goes"
09:54,200;09:56,800;"maybe without the injury problems."
09:56,800;10:00,600;"Other big names I have were Ray Buchanan quarterback."
10:00,600;10:01,800;"I remember him."
10:01,800;10:03,800;"He was was he number 24."
10:03,800;10:07,200;"I forgot to look it up before this, but we're just going to assume he was because"
10:07,200;10:09,200;"you know, all the best clothes."
10:09,200;10:10,200;"Exbury 24."
10:10,200;10:10,800;"Exactly."
10:10,800;10:11,800;"All right, Greg."
10:11,800;10:12,800;"It's right."
10:12,800;10:14,600;"Science."
10:14,600;10:16,200;"Ashley Ambrose."
10:16,200;10:19,200;"Well, they both they they co-led the team with five picks."
10:19,200;10:26,200;"and then Patrick Kearney was the defensive end of the team of 12 sacks."
10:26,200;10:31,700;"I don't remember him. It was pretty good. Literally. No, guys, maybe Ray Buchanan."
10:31,700;10:35,700;"I remember Ashley Ambrose. I don't remember. There's nobody."
10:35,700;10:41,200;"Wait a minute. Offends Sean Jefferson guys. That was like the Vincent Brismy days."
10:41,200;10:44,200;"Wasn't it? Yeah. He was playing opposite him."
10:44,200;10:50,120;"him. It was. Yeah. That was a general"
10:50,120;10:53,440;"sanity. Yeah. Same guy. Yeah, because he"
10:53,440;10:58,560;"played for the Patriots. It was 96 96 to"
10:58,560;11:01,720;"99. Yep. Before that he was a charger."
11:01,720;11:03,920;"So that's such a generic name. I didn't"
11:03,920;11:06,320;"put two and two together. Well, did you"
11:06,320;11:08,440;"know there's a Sean the guy on LSU right"
11:08,440;11:11,160;"now? Sean Jefferson Jr. Is his son?"
11:11,200;11:12,040;"It's not a stop."
11:12,040;11:12,860;"(laughing)"
11:12,860;11:14,040;"I'm not related at all."
11:14,040;11:15,480;"(laughing)"
11:15,480;11:17,440;"I got so excited when I was watching them play"
11:17,440;11:19,200;"and then I looked it up and I'm like, well, huh?"
11:19,200;11:20,960;"Just not related."
11:20,960;11:24,040;"That's kind of like we talked about Jim Ora earlier."
11:24,040;11:26,760;"Okay, yeah, but not sure if that's like"
11:26,760;11:28,960;"the later Jim Ora's son or not."
11:28,960;11:31,960;"I think we just kind of assumed that they were"
11:31,960;11:34,240;"just named the same, but we never actually put together."
11:34,240;11:35,720;"I think it might be."
11:35,720;11:37,240;"Didn't we figure that out?"
11:37,240;11:38,080;"Nope."
11:38,080;11:39,840;"I don't know where my phone is or else I would"
11:39,840;11:44,400;"down the door at all not not in the moment we didn't"
11:44,400;11:48,320;"uh... yes so often the players uh... christian there"
11:48,320;11:49,760;"who"
11:49,760;11:52,840;"let the team in fumble recoveries with four cool"
11:52,840;11:55,440;"pretty great uh... also"
11:55,440;11:58,400;"uh... not as great since they were his own fumbles which he also the team in"
11:58,400;12:00,040;"with eight"
12:00,040;12:01,640;"it is not bad"
12:01,640;12:02,960;"fully one of the game"
12:02,960;12:07,600;"acuity smith style is pretty uh... pretty stationary"
12:07,600;12:09,600;"But he actually went"
12:09,600;12:17,200;"He went six and eight, but I remember there was some stat in the game. I think I wrote it down of"
12:17,200;12:20,600;"His"
12:20,600;12:27,340;"Win lost record when he actually finished the game was really good. He just didn't often finish games"
12:27,340;12:31,160;"Oh, yeah, I saw them. I was always in yeah like"
12:31,160;12:36,120;"This is the quarterback we're talking about right again soon. Yes"
12:36,120;12:36,960;"- Yes."
12:36,960;12:38,840;"- For no name, Jim Narrow."
12:38,840;12:40,480;"- Yeah, he went to his Super Bowl."
12:40,480;12:41,320;"- So forget it."
12:41,320;12:42,880;"- Started his Super Bowl."
12:42,880;12:44,480;"- Yeah, you're right."
12:44,480;12:46,140;"- He also threw three interceptions"
12:46,140;12:47,500;"in his Super Bowl."
12:47,500;12:48,580;"- That's besides the punch."
12:48,580;12:52,760;"- We had a 20-100 yard, 16 touchdowns, 14 picks."
12:52,760;12:57,600;"But the bigger story, their quarterback for the Falcons"
12:57,600;13:01,280;"this year was their first overall draft pick,"
13:01,280;13:02,680;"rookie Michael Vick."
13:02,680;13:04,040;"- Was he number one overall?"
13:04,040;13:04,880;"- Was he number one overall?"
13:04,880;13:05,720;"- Number one overall."
13:05,720;13:08,440;"- Wait, when did he start going by Mike Vick?"
13:08,440;13:10,280;"- I don't know."
13:10,280;13:11,120;"- Was that a thing or?"
13:11,120;13:13,840;"- Well, I mean, we're pretty early."
13:13,840;13:16,400;"- No, well, I think just in this podcast in general,"
13:16,400;13:17,720;"we tend to use full names."
13:17,720;13:18,960;"So I'm gonna call him Michael Vick."
13:18,960;13:20,160;"- Okay, but he was Mike, right?"
13:20,160;13:21,360;"- Like I call you Michael Mello."
13:21,360;13:22,200;"- Yes."
13:22,200;13:23,120;"- And Michael Mello, speed of length."
13:23,120;13:25,320;"- He did sorry, I think it was after prison maybe,"
13:25,320;13:26,800;"maybe that was his prison name."
13:26,800;13:28,040;"I'm gonna go by Mike Vick."
13:28,040;13:28,880;"- Was it?"
13:28,880;13:29,720;"I don't know."
13:29,720;13:30,560;"- I don't know."
13:30,560;13:31,400;"- When that switch happened."
13:31,400;13:32,920;"'Cause he was Mike and then he made a statement"
13:32,920;13:35,640;"where he wanted to be known as Michael."
13:35,640;13:37,880;"like respect when I think it was when he was like hanging out with"
13:37,880;13:40,600;"Oh, he went from Mike to Michael? Not the other way. Oh, I thought I was going around."
13:40,600;13:45,800;"Like so. Maybe like Mike. I don't know. I mean, you think if you want to"
13:45,800;13:48,920;"more respectable, you've got a Michael. You would think yeah, you want the full"
13:48,920;13:52,680;"code dot by like one of them like, you know, non-"
13:52,680;13:57,960;"Tony Darcy. Yeah. I imagine the the Google results for Mike Vick were"
13:57,960;14:01,240;"probably not in his favor. So maybe you know what? I'm a"
14:01,240;14:02,720;"It's like the man in it at work."
14:02,720;14:03,720;"That's true."
14:03,720;14:06,480;"So they put a whole bunch of SEO effort into Michael Vick"
14:06,480;14:07,880;"and then they just like, switch."
14:07,880;14:09,160;"VR 101, baby."
14:09,160;14:12,920;"Nobody will remember if I just slightly tweak the R 101."
14:12,920;14:14,080;"You start fresh."
14:14,080;14:14,580;"Huh?"
14:14,580;14:15,960;"Remember what?"
14:15,960;14:16,960;"Woof."
14:16,960;14:18,480;"What are you talking about?"
14:18,480;14:20,480;"[HUMMING]"
14:20,480;14:25,720;"I think his nickname was Big Dog, maybe?"
14:25,720;14:26,320;"Something like that."
14:26,320;14:28,720;"Is that what we're talking about?"
14:28,720;14:29,520;"I think I'm missing something."
14:29,520;14:30,160;"Wow."
14:30,160;14:33,700;"I don't know. I guess I missed all my trying to play at PCs doesn't get fired later"
14:33,700;14:48,720;"So at wide receiver they had four guys who seem to be carving"
14:48,720;14:53,160;"Copies of each other there are four guys with just about 500 y'all receiving"
14:53,160;14:56,040;"Which is hugely mediocre"
14:57,760;15:05,280;"Terrence Mathis who I recognize the name but couldn't pick his face out of a lineup Tony Martin the aforementioned Sean Jefferson and"
15:05,280;15:09,980;"Give me Greg's favorite Brian Finneran because of the color of his skin"
15:09,980;15:13,460;"Wow, come on man see that I mean"
15:13,460;15:18,840;"Yeah, this is what we're doing. I mean well, I'm the college failure"
15:18,840;15:23,400;"So I figured we just start something about Gregory. How about he's the race of the group"
15:27,520;15:32,440;"I did. You know what my favorite joke is when it gets cold like this? Now that you guys are here in New Hampshire."
15:32,440;15:37,240;"It's what it gets down. If I turn on my car and it says it's zero degrees Fahrenheit,"
15:37,240;15:42,920;"I'll text my wife and I'll say, you know what, the weather today, my time at Penn State having common?"
15:42,920;15:44,580;"Zero degrees."
15:44,580;15:46,620;"Wow."
15:46,620;15:48,800;"You didn't even have it the first time, which is why I keep sending it."
15:48,800;15:52,340;"Persistence of C, Andy, for sure."
15:52,340;15:53,060;"That's what I was saying."
15:53,060;15:54,220;"I'll tell you, get to zero degrees."
15:54,220;15:57,300;"No, it's the opposite, actually."
15:57,300;16:02,540;"Well, if I'm a Rick Steve touches kids."
16:02,540;16:05,940;"I also don't condone any of this."
16:05,940;16:08,500;"I didn't go to Penn State, Andy did."
16:08,500;16:12,580;"I apologize for considering that you might have enabled his behavior."
16:12,580;16:16,380;"I assume you didn't know that that was going on, Andy."
16:16,380;16:21,580;"I was not on a first name basis with any of the Penn State coaching staff."
16:21,580;16:22,580;"At all?"
16:22,580;16:23,580;"No, no."
16:23,580;16:27,140;"just put them on the, uh, hot take."
16:27,140;16:28,020;"He didn't even do it."
16:28,020;16:30,580;"I'm going to put that out there."
16:30,580;16:31,860;"Who didn't do it?"
16:31,860;16:33,300;"Dandusky."
16:33,300;16:34,820;"Yeah."
16:34,820;16:36,500;"Why don't you read the transcript?"
16:36,500;16:37,340;"Transcripts, bro."
16:37,340;16:38,380;"All right."
16:38,380;16:40,100;"No one's in the phone call."
16:40,100;16:40,580;"Perfect."
16:40,580;16:42,620;"Dude, they're their key witness."
16:42,620;16:44,940;"He's all over the place."
16:44,940;16:46,340;"Because we can remember this thing."
16:46,340;16:47,740;"Like they remember that thing."
16:47,740;16:49,420;"Oh, and actually saw anything."
16:49,420;16:51,220;"Well, some people did this."
16:51,220;16:52,220;"They were just children."
16:52,660;16:53,220;"I don't know."
16:53,220;16:55,940;"Before the record, you didn't see anything."
16:55,940;16:56,340;"I did."
16:56,340;16:57,140;"That's the only thing, though."
16:57,140;16:59,940;"OK, that's a red hot thing."
16:59,940;17:01,780;"I did read an article that said that."
17:01,780;17:03,460;"But I don't know."
17:03,460;17:03,980;"But worse."
17:03,980;17:05,660;"Oh, yeah, they were some apologists."
17:05,660;17:07,580;"I would say that."
17:07,580;17:08,980;"That is what you just said."
17:08,980;17:10,100;"Just going to leave the U.S."
17:10,100;17:12,940;"Yeah. I'm just going to clip up the pieces that I like and say it for later."
17:12,940;17:15,500;"That's going to be the teaser for the podcast."
17:15,500;17:16,900;"It's Greg saying."
17:16,900;17:18,540;"Let's see."
17:18,540;17:19,500;"Gusky's innocent."
17:19,500;17:20,100;"The article."
17:20,100;17:21,900;"I mean, let's be our one on one."
17:21,900;17:27,400;"There's a little sound clip, Greg Jerry Sandusky not guilty podcast to find out more."
17:27,400;17:29,700;"The witness is all over the place."
17:29,700;17:31,900;"You don't like a job, right, Greg?"
17:31,900;17:39,400;"Speaking of I can't even I can't tie that in."
17:39,400;17:40,800;"We're just going to talk about the running backs."
17:40,800;17:44,000;"Or he's trying to."
17:44,000;17:46,600;"I was a speed of key touches or something, but."
17:48,100;17:49,360;"- That's algae crumpler."
17:49,360;17:50,680;"- Crumpler."
17:50,680;17:51,980;"- I'll let you know if that's the one."
17:51,980;17:54,280;"- Let's go with that one."
17:54,280;17:55,640;"- Yeah, that's pretty good."
17:55,640;17:59,960;"- Yeah, algae crumpler, who, yeah, crumpler, apparently."
17:59,960;18:03,520;"- Look at your, I feel like he's ancient."
18:03,520;18:04,560;"- Yeah."
18:04,560;18:06,360;"- He had it with the pads, I didn't know."
18:06,360;18:07,280;"- Yes."
18:07,280;18:08,640;"- He did, yeah."
18:08,640;18:09,760;"- Oh, you're right."
18:09,760;18:10,600;"- Yup."
18:10,600;18:12,280;"- That's four or five years, I think."
18:12,280;18:13,120;"- 2010."
18:13,120;18:14,280;"- That's what I was saying."
18:14,280;18:17,160;"- Relatively recent, 10 years ago."
18:17,160;18:18,160;"Yeah, fuck."
18:18,160;18:20,160;"It's middle of the dynasty."
18:20,160;18:23,120;"Well, like that was when he was like on his way out, though, and we had out."
18:23,120;18:24,120;"He was pretty much done."
18:24,120;18:25,120;"That was the last season."
18:25,120;18:30,440;"And this is his rookie season, which means Brady was already a year older than him."
18:30,440;18:32,520;"Fuck, that's what struck me."
18:32,520;18:34,000;"I was like, well, let's see."
18:34,000;18:38,400;"Algae Crumpler have been there forever, you know, algae crumplers 42."
18:38,400;18:39,800;"But it's his birthday today."
18:39,800;18:42,040;"Born December 23rd, 1977."
18:42,040;18:43,040;"Happy birthday."
18:43,040;18:44,040;"Algae crumplers."
18:44,040;18:45,040;"Yeah."
18:45,040;18:46,040;"Happy birthday."
18:46,040;18:47,540;"I'm sure he'll love it."
18:47,540;18:48,380;"- Fantastic."
18:48,380;18:49,220;"- And guy."
18:49,220;18:51,500;"- I met him once."
18:51,500;18:52,340;"- Did you?"
18:52,340;18:53,180;"- I got it."
18:53,180;18:54,020;"- No."
18:54,020;18:54,860;"- I'm stupid."
18:54,860;18:56,660;"- I thought somebody should have a story there."
18:56,660;18:59,020;"- No, that was just a fun guy, Joe."
18:59,020;19:01,060;"- Well, he's the only guy I ran out of talking to"
19:01,060;19:03,020;"from 2001, if that makes me feel good."
19:03,020;19:05,100;"- They were talking about his like 40 speed though."
19:05,100;19:07,820;"And I don't know if, to me, it's how they're like,"
19:07,820;19:09,740;"""Man, he's athletic, he's huge."
19:09,740;19:11,340;"He ran a 49 too."""
19:11,340;19:12,700;"(laughing)"
19:12,700;19:13,540;"- What the hell?"
19:13,540;19:14,780;"I'm looking at it and it's like,"
19:14,780;19:18,780;"this year's class like 2019 like Noah Fant ran like a four or five."
19:18,780;19:20,780;"[laughter]"
19:20,780;19:21,780;"I was gonna ask."
19:21,780;19:22,780;"I was gonna ask."
19:22,780;19:23,780;"Someone's gonna talk about it a lot."
19:23,780;19:25,780;"And he's not known for being fast."
19:25,780;19:26,780;"That's a different era."
19:26,780;19:28,780;"Well, yeah, that was fast."
19:28,780;19:30,780;"That was tight end."
19:30,780;19:39,780;"Yeah, and I don't want to spoil the fourth quarter, but when like Mike Vick was in there and he just looked like today's speed versus all of, you know, people super slow."
19:39,780;19:44,060;"I can't think wearing those huge shoulder pads and just lumbering around and Mike Vick was just"
19:44,060;19:46,700;"Oh, it was like a video game though, because you're right. He's like"
19:46,700;19:49,940;"Comfortable to take that. Yeah, but no one else is caught up. Yeah"
19:49,940;19:56,380;"This is like when you bought Madden this year and you were allowed to play as the Falcons because it was cheating. Yeah, he was"
19:56,380;20:01,780;"Couldn't do it. Yeah, but it was fair because it was actually like yeah. Oh, yeah, no"
20:01,780;20:06,660;"It was perfectly accurate. It was just unfair to play this year. He's the same same idea"
20:06,660;20:08,660;"Oh, yeah, I'm not as fast"
20:08,660;20:11,840;"But he's so quick"
20:11,840;20:18,260;"Yeah, I think he's quicker than Vic but not straight line fast. Yeah, I would like breakaways"
20:18,260;20:22,840;"Because that was Vic is like you get him on a straight line and he's just like yeah"
20:22,840;20:27,940;"Watching Vic run. I thought with the ease that he does it is like watching"
20:27,940;20:32,980;"Randy Moss just out run like Randy Moss throwing up his hand"
20:32,980;20:37,240;"What he's like ten yards in front of the defensive back knowing he's gonna beat him"
20:37,240;20:39,960;"But he's trying to jog and pass the guy and the guys"
20:39,960;20:42,160;"effort into it"
20:42,160;20:47,060;"I mean it was for watching him too because it part of the like, you know dog stuff aside"
20:47,060;20:57,480;"Like it was a shame that he has always hurt because I mean he had great vision too"
20:57,480;21:02,200;"He'd be Duke and run all over the place boy always ended with like him breaking the leg or something"
21:02,200;21:06,100;"So it would have been fun to kind of see where that would have gone"
21:06,100;21:09,020;"But I mean my homes is kind of in that territory"
21:09,020;21:16,380;"Yeah, so I've been saying this about all those mobile quarterbacks"
21:16,380;21:24,500;"Like since RG3 and that knee injury that he had like every it seems like they light the league on fire until that happens"
21:24,500;21:33,940;"They're managing him. They're also kind of like running decoys everywhere. So I mean it might not work the second year, but"
21:35,060;21:40,900;"Still feel like I mean every game that you watch if you if you look at a use there's at least one hit a game"
21:40,900;21:51,220;"You know it's not the same I don't think though"
21:51,220;21:58,580;"Yeah, I mean I guess we'll touch on that actually all the"
21:58,580;22:03,180;"Yeah, so the other on the roster"
22:03,180;22:07,780;"The same guy from the Simpsons"
22:07,780;22:15,700;"From such films as was that guy like Hank is there here or something like that. Oh, that's the guy"
22:15,700;22:28,020;"I thought you thought that there's this real name and he went from the Falcons"
22:28,020;22:29,020;"to the Simpsons."
22:29,020;22:32,020;"That's a hot take I think."
22:32,020;22:33,020;"I'm not sure."
22:33,020;22:34,020;"It's only Google."
22:34,020;22:35,020;"What's older?"
22:35,020;22:37,020;"The Simpsons are Tom Brady's Dynasty."
22:37,020;22:39,020;"The Simpsons have been around for 40 years."
22:39,020;22:42,020;"I'm just starting."
22:42,020;22:44,020;"I'm Jay Fili guys."
22:44,020;22:45,020;"The old dolphin skicker."
22:45,020;22:46,020;"I did have him on the list."
22:46,020;22:47,020;"I'm a kicker."
22:47,020;22:48,020;"Jay Fili."
22:48,020;22:49,020;"Three players."
22:49,020;22:50,020;"Something."
22:50,020;22:51,020;"Sure."
22:51,020;22:53,020;"I did no reason."
22:53,020;22:56,020;"Wasn't he a fan of an eagle's?"
22:56,020;22:57,020;"Yeah."
22:57,020;22:58,020;"Oh, we made it."
22:58,020;22:59,020;"Yes."
22:59,020;23:00,020;"One of the five."
23:00,020;23:01,020;"I did."
23:01,020;23:02,020;"I'm not going to lie."
23:02,020;23:03,020;"I didn't know research on J. Feely."
23:03,020;23:04,020;"Well, okay."
23:04,020;23:05,020;"There's more."
23:05,020;23:08,020;"Ended up being an actor slash comedian after."
23:08,020;23:09,020;"Dude, yeah."
23:09,020;23:10,020;"Fantastic."
23:10,020;23:18,020;"Oh, it's Jay Moore."
23:18,020;23:19,020;"All right."
23:19,020;23:24,420;"Before we get the game, though, I want to talk about the week leading up to this because"
23:24,420;23:31,460;"I think this was when the Terrigge Len shit came to a head because literally every bossing"
23:31,460;23:38,860;"globes course section this week leading up to the game was all about basic Terrigge Len."
23:38,860;23:46,100;"He was fine for not practicing on the day after the previous week's game."
23:46,100;23:53,460;"It was kind of LeBron last year in the finals maybe the year before but when he's like he"
23:53,460;23:58,220;"He loses the game and he comes to the thing with a cast on his wrist and this video of"
23:58,220;24:00,180;"him do shots in the locker room before the game."
24:00,180;24:02,180;"It's like dude, for real?"
24:02,180;24:04,300;"Yeah, it feels that way."
24:04,300;24:12,100;"But there's actually an article on the Wednesday about Sean Jefferson talking about Terry Glenn."
24:12,100;24:15,140;"He was obviously overlapped."
24:15,140;24:18,940;"John said he loves Terry Glenn like a brother and he tried to mentor him when they played"
24:18,940;24:19,940;"together."
24:19,940;24:24,900;"Jefferson wanted to show his support and that meant telling Glenn, ""Get your butt to"
24:24,900;24:25,900;"camp."
24:25,900;24:29,340;"There are guys depending on you, screw up the media or what Bill Belichick think."
24:29,340;24:31,820;"Get back out there for your teammates."""
24:31,820;24:32,820;"That's fair."
24:32,820;24:33,820;"It is."
24:33,820;24:37,200;"It's not a money thing that's not a..."
24:37,200;24:40,380;"It's how a bill checks handled the thing."
24:40,380;24:41,380;"That is true."
24:41,380;24:47,980;"I don't know what way he's a little bit of a miser."
24:47,980;24:49,140;"He is."
24:49,140;24:52,860;"I mean, he probably sucks to play for, right?"
24:52,860;24:54,900;"And if you don't-- this is 2001."
24:54,900;24:58,860;"So if you don't have the clout of one, all these championships,"
24:58,860;25:00,860;"and you're a 21-shit--"
25:00,860;25:01,860;"Yeah, fired and clear."
25:01,860;25:03,540;"You like dodge it."
25:03,540;25:04,980;"What makes you think you can do that?"
25:04,980;25:07,980;"You didn't have the respect at this point."
25:07,980;25:11,820;"Well, and I-- oh, by the time this here,"
25:11,820;25:15,100;"this might not be a big deal that ends when I'm a bro."
25:15,100;25:17,580;"That guy, she's now getting a from like,"
25:17,580;25:18,580;"celebrity."
25:18,580;25:20,220;"He's a couple of different social media."
25:20,220;25:22,260;"Take a look man, clear your butt."
25:22,260;25:24,180;"But he isn't."
25:24,180;25:26,300;"Hopefully it doesn't happen."
25:26,300;25:28,300;"The Terry Brown."
25:28,300;25:30,300;"That's the album."
25:30,300;25:32,700;"I mean, no more white women."
25:32,700;25:33,700;"Yes."
25:33,700;25:36,900;"He's making all the right decisions."
25:36,900;25:37,940;"I'm doing the same."
25:37,940;25:38,940;"No more women."
25:38,940;25:39,940;"Twenty twenty."
25:39,940;25:40,940;"I think we know."
25:40,940;25:41,940;"I got a head of this."
25:41,940;25:42,940;"I'm gonna have this crazy."
25:42,940;25:45,200;"(laughing)"
25:45,200;25:51,460;"- Did Terry Glenn ever play another snap after this?"
25:51,460;25:52,300;"- Oh yeah."
25:52,300;25:53,140;"- Yeah, he played with the Cowboys."
25:53,140;25:54,980;"- Play for the Cowboys, when she was."
25:54,980;25:55,820;"- Uh, Jake."
25:55,820;25:56,660;"- And then."
25:56,660;25:57,500;"- With?"
25:57,500;25:58,340;"- Bloods off."
25:58,340;25:59,180;"- Bloods off."
25:59,180;26:00,020;"And Parcells."
26:00,020;26:02,540;"All right, so Terry, glad being a little bitch."
26:02,540;26:07,020;"Well, let me get this as healthy again."
26:07,020;26:08,740;"I think the only reason I put that in there"
26:08,740;26:11,420;"is because just to mention the fact that you were a t-shirt"
26:11,420;26:13,740;"that said silent but violent."
26:13,740;26:15,300;"- Yeah, that one was fun."
26:15,300;26:16,620;"- Oh, we're gonna make that."
26:16,620;26:19,100;"You're gonna sell those fuckers on this?"
26:19,100;26:21,500;"Patre's died as the website."
26:21,500;26:22,340;"Oh, hell yeah."
26:22,340;26:24,340;"- Well, we should make it hashtag sound."
26:24,340;26:25,180;"- Sound of a violent."
26:25,180;26:27,660;"- I mean, ""Silent but violent"" back in 2001 for me"
26:27,660;26:28,780;"was talking about fun."
26:28,780;26:29,620;"- Yeah, definitely."
26:29,620;26:30,460;"- No."
26:30,460;26:31,300;"- Oh, what?"
26:31,300;26:32,140;"'Cause you were like 15 years old."
26:32,140;26:32,980;"- Yeah."
26:32,980;26:34,060;"- Well, silent but deadly."
26:34,060;26:35,340;"- I was old now, but yeah."
26:35,340;26:37,580;"Thanks for being cheddarous."
26:37,580;26:38,660;"(laughs)"
26:38,660;26:40,140;"Very charitable, very Christmassy."
26:40,140;26:43,220;"live especially as a hashtag these days."
26:43,220;26:45,820;"But why not? That's some assassin shit."
26:45,820;26:47,580;"Where's the silent coming from?"
26:47,580;26:49,220;"Cause he doesn't talk much."
26:49,220;26:50,540;"Even though he doesn't for a living now."
26:50,540;26:53,020;"Hey, ironically now he's doing post game."
26:53,020;26:54,500;"Yeah, right."
26:54,500;26:55,500;"Yeah, he's decent."
26:55,500;26:58,260;"Steve Smith is a legend."
26:58,260;27:03,340;"Man, she is like, he's off the cuff man."
27:03,340;27:04,300;"Like he was a care."
27:04,300;27:05,300;"Yeah."
27:05,300;27:08,580;"He said they're talking about, uh, I know,"
27:08,580;27:13,100;"Someone not throwing open receivers and he's like you gotta throw the ball when he's butthole naked"
27:13,100;27:19,660;"Oh, thank you, does it even make sense but whole naked"
27:19,660;27:27,140;"No, but I don't understand what he meant. I just like really said it. Yeah, I get it"
27:27,140;27:31,700;"I get it. You're you're so naked that you can get over and spread your cheeks and people see about home"
27:31,700;27:36,140;"You gotta be you gotta be that open"
27:36,580;27:43,500;"You gotta throw the the ball when he's so naked that he can bend over spend his butt cheek so you can see his brown eye come on"
27:43,500;27:48,300;"So think about this now here you go think about this"
27:48,300;27:50,060;"what"
27:50,060;27:52,060;"how how"
27:52,060;27:58,580;"Away from other people do you have to be to be that comfortable to be naked enough to bend over and spread you do that in the"
27:58,580;28:00,580;"In a crowd no problem"
28:00,580;28:05,820;"You could you fucking kitty touch her, but I don't know if I could hey, maybe that's what he meant"
28:06,660;28:11,660;"Can we call him up I think my little Jackson is that right memory used to kiss buttholes"
28:11,660;28:27,020;"This thing is"
28:27,020;28:33,660;"Another hot take mic. Did you read the article that Michael Jackson didn't do it?"
28:33,660;28:37,660;"I think I did I can't get forward tonight look I just know I don't think it's no you know"
28:37,660;28:42,140;"He was two separate children that had the same story of him"
28:42,140;28:46,660;"Pull their butt cheeks a car kiss him on the bus. All right in the document"
28:46,660;28:47,820;"I'm going on record"
28:47,820;28:54,200;"You cannot call me the kid dealer when both of these guys Greg defended Jerry Sandusky and Mike's over here"
28:54,200;28:56,200;"And I'm like a Jackson"
28:56,200;28:59,100;"I don't think he was kissing but holes"
28:59,100;29:01,580;"Go cause me is guilty"
29:01,580;29:15,580;"and it's not a big thing that man, and I think he did it, I just don't think he was kissing balls but maybe it was I didn't watch the documentary I could be a stack of turning it."
29:15,580;29:21,980;"Yeah, Google Google Michael Jackson but all kids."
29:21,980;29:25,220;"Just make sure you're in incognito mode."
29:25,220;29:29,780;"100% not going out on incognito."
29:29,780;29:33,580;"Yeah, that's that's."
29:33,580;29:36,180;"Regardless, Michael Jackson."
29:36,180;29:37,980;"Piece of shit."
29:37,980;29:38,980;"Yes."
29:38,980;29:39,980;"Okay."
29:39,980;29:40,980;"I can't."
29:40,980;29:43,240;"(laughing)"
29:43,240;29:50,660;"- Trying to segue here, you motherfuckers."
29:50,660;29:55,020;"Speaking of buttholes, Dan Neal, the offensive lineman"
29:55,020;29:58,460;"for the Denver Broncos, the week before,"
29:58,460;29:59,920;"broke Brian Cox's leg."
29:59,920;30:02,860;"He's a butthole, but did you hear what's--"
30:02,860;30:03,780;"(laughing)"
30:03,780;30:05,660;"- Good segue Andy."
30:05,660;30:07,300;"- Good segue, I like that."
30:07,300;30:08,660;"- Yeah, I like it."
30:08,660;30:22,180;"Yeah, but he was fined for his block on his illegal block on Brian Cox that these commentators in this game actually I"
30:22,180;30:29,500;"The game are our feeds started a little late so even I actually get to catch the first half first few drives"
30:29,500;30:31,500;"So I don't know who they were"
30:31,500;30:37,520;"So they're fucking terrible the commentation I like them. I like what they were it well"
30:37,520;30:41,020;"They were defending of course the shop block. They may be one"
30:41,020;30:44,940;"But they're also calling out Terry Glenn for being a biggie biggie bitch"
30:44,940;30:51,820;"We're like they're like I don't care dude Terry Glenn. They were they told me all the Sean Jefferson lines"
30:51,820;30:56,120;"Say fuck out there your team. They were yeah, but they were defending the chop log"
30:56,120;30:58,120;"Which is like the most illegal thing"
30:58,120;31:05,400;"I'm not going to possibly do think about this no intent and he think about this if one of the Patriots players did you would defend"
31:05,400;31:07,840;"Not if it's a job"
31:07,840;31:19,480;"Right that's not what the job blog was I'm just saying Andy you spin zone everything"
31:19,480;31:24,920;"I'll spend a lot of it. Well, I'm sorry. I'm a fan go fuck me, right?"
31:26,320;31:32,320;"Do you know a fan is you know a fan is your for fucking fanatic? I'm sorry. I'm fanatically"
31:32,320;31:34,880;"Vanatically inclined"
31:34,880;31:42,120;"They also had a good point where Troy Brown should have let a punt bounce in the end zone and fair caught it on like"
31:42,120;31:46,080;"The three-yard line and they're like why you for your kitchen that and I was like they're right they were right"
31:46,080;31:51,760;"No, that was after the chop blocks everything they said was wrong to them. So I will not agree with that"
31:52,960;31:55,040;"basically was like i'm gonna murder"
31:55,040;31:59,560;"her that i can accept my speed and destroy like this family or whatever he said"
31:59,560;32:03,720;"but then he came out apologize for that growth my friend so well i have"
32:03,720;32:05,280;"apologize in quotes"
32:05,280;32:08,660;"uh... because he said i need to apologize because in my frustration"
32:08,660;32:10,840;"i told him i was going to blow out his knee"
32:10,840;32:13,760;"i don't want to see anybody injured in that capacity"
32:13,760;32:14,960;"they have children"
32:14,960;32:18,400;"and other people that are they're taking care of"
32:18,400;32:21,240;"they compare with terry glenn to a twelve-year-old"
32:21,240;32:23,240;"But and said he was worse than Ryan"
32:23,240;32:32,200;"That's awesome. Black card's probably deserved it. I'm trying to get to the I'm trying to get the mile out here because I want"
32:32,200;32:35,240;"Dirty player"
32:35,240;32:44,640;"He was not dirty not like that is from Manowski, but like similar he was very fiery. I mean he was good for us, but he"
32:44,640;32:46,640;"He was on the Jets for sure"
32:46,640;32:49,160;"Was Rodney Harrison dirty? Yes"
32:49,800;33:01,440;"Okay then then yes right these as dirty as radi has to think but the comment that he was apologizing for which we didn't actually touch on last week because you're too busy shooting on me was wait were we"
33:01,440;33:11,080;"Oh 100% that we was just agreeing and flex them. Yeah some fine points. I'm saying we needed a report episode and that's just an average report."
33:11,080;33:13,800;"- Oh, at my expense, I love it."
33:13,800;33:15,660;"But yeah, so we did actually touch on"
33:15,660;33:18,220;"Brian Cox's comment after the game was,"
33:18,220;33:21,040;"to be honest, I don't care if it takes the rest of my career."
33:21,040;33:22,420;"If I ever play that guy again,"
33:22,420;33:23,800;"he's gonna have a blown out knee"
33:23,800;33:25,320;"and I don't care who knows it"
33:25,320;33:26,720;"because he just does that sort of"
33:26,720;33:30,760;"expletive all the time, Cox said, his voice a long growl."
33:30,760;33:33,160;"He cuts me like that and then has the"
33:33,160;33:36,440;"expletive audacity to ask me if I'm right."
33:36,440;33:40,880;"If I ask me if I'm all right, no, I'm not expletive all right."
33:40,880;33:48,100;"I can open the globe again. I'm not gonna put words in his mouth. I like that. That's what the Boston Globe reported. He's still dirty, but I like that. I like that"
33:48,100;33:56,520;"Yeah, so he kind of walked it back. But not really we lost before the year, right? How's it broken leg? I don't remember"
33:56,520;34:06,880;"Remember playing again. So I don't remember playing this year. We'll keep seeing all time is Matt Stevens a safety. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't remember him at all"
34:06,880;34:09,200;"Well, I do because he was white"
34:09,200;34:15,660;"Like no white guys are the defenses that I keep these where we're eight weeks in"
34:15,660;34:22,500;"Up and I'm like I was like we're eight weeks in. I was like, I don't remember this guy at all. Yeah, I don't remember"
34:22,500;34:26,960;"Either he's like one of our bad hair before it seems for a while because I remember"
34:26,960;34:31,980;"I haven't seen him make a super 1vp. Yes, Mike. Yes. He was"
34:31,980;34:35,400;"Though don't worry"
34:35,400;34:36,400;"Is he the whole fame?"
34:36,400;34:40,200;"Mike, he's intentionally just railing our conversations."
34:40,200;34:42,400;"Is he the whole fame?"
34:42,400;34:46,800;"I mean, we have done two minutes on Matt Stevens."
34:46,800;34:50,200;"No, he's the kind of woman of that week."
34:50,200;34:54,400;"Remember, like, he's see-rooming down, you jump in, and don't knock on the guy."
34:54,400;34:56,200;"Oh, no, he hasn't been good."
34:56,200;34:58,000;"So let me be surprised he's just bad."
34:58,000;34:59,800;"Yeah, some, I guess, as he's not hurt."
34:59,800;35:01,800;"He's got Lee Johnson, who, my guess."
35:01,800;35:03,000;"Well, he's a third safety."
35:03,000;35:06,160;"So he comes on and those like sub packages. Yeah, I think so"
35:06,160;35:13,000;"Who's your second? Yeah, he was a starter. I remember watching the who's your second safety. It says loi"
35:13,000;35:18,880;"Maloy into Bucky John. Yeah, there was by the beginning of the year and the week one. He was a starter"
35:18,880;35:22,060;"So he's always you nickel safety nickel says that work"
35:22,060;35:27,080;"When he was the he was well when they when they think you're starting earlier, but I think he was"
35:27,080;35:29,560;"This is where he starts getting phased out"
35:30,120;35:35,600;"Yeah, he's just listed as defense effects and maybe play a little bit of ball well"
35:35,600;35:41,720;"That's generous, but okay. I should probably talk about the game, huh? I was trying to be guys"
35:41,720;35:44,360;"Like turned on me over there. I talked to me"
35:44,360;35:47,520;"What jumped out of you about this game"
35:47,520;35:50,440;"things first"
35:50,440;35:54,080;"You know I"
35:54,080;35:59,160;"Will say that it was a poor start for the Falcons that's not good stuck out of me"
35:59,160;36:05,860;"I have here that the first three Falcon drives netted. I think it was negative seven yards. Yeah, I had negative six"
36:05,860;36:12,080;"Okay in the ballpark. Yeah, so that's pretty crazy in like the defense was a falls out like that's the"
36:12,080;36:14,520;"game. Oh, I don't think we've"
36:14,520;36:17,640;"Necessarily seen that before the commentators are touching on it too"
36:17,640;36:22,360;"How they had instead of sitting back in in like zone coverage and stuff like that"
36:22,360;36:28,120;"They were actually playing a lot more man blitting a lot more from spots that the Falcons weren't expecting it"
36:28,560;36:30,560;"The commentator actually showed the"
36:30,560;36:38,700;"Rolling from like a cover to recover one late. We can see a lot more recently now went with this 2019 defense where they they're hiding something or even"
36:38,700;36:42,880;"Last year's Super Bowl. They had kind of almost two calls where you see the one"
36:42,880;36:45,560;"Shift late to that second look"
36:45,560;36:48,740;"So they do a lot of like cover to cover one on one place"
36:48,740;36:52,280;"They have that extra guy in the box and the Falcons just had no fun"
36:52,280;36:55,080;"- It's got to do when the Falcons are pumping"
36:55,080;36:56,400;"crowd noise too, you know?"
36:56,400;36:58,280;"- Ooh, that's true."
36:58,280;36:59,440;"But what a tactic."
36:59,440;37:00,960;"I mean, I wish the Pats would have thought of that."
37:00,960;37:01,800;"Maybe they did."
37:01,800;37:05,080;"But Chris Chandler."
37:05,080;37:06,160;"- They probably played in a zone."
37:06,160;37:07,560;"- In a dome, right?"
37:07,560;37:09,280;"- Chris Chandler at the end of the game too,"
37:09,280;37:10,920;"was like saying that they were flipping"
37:10,920;37:12,600;"between three, four, and four, three,"
37:12,600;37:14,960;"which I think that was the start of that too,"
37:14,960;37:18,640;"where he used basically what I knew does this,"
37:18,640;37:20,840;"and then that year."
37:20,840;37:22,760;"Yeah. So it was interesting. I mean, I"
37:22,760;37:26,840;"point to like bring all that out mid season when you're like sort of"
37:26,840;37:29,200;"Hey, we can do this. You got a game plan for it."
37:29,200;37:31,600;"Yeah, it felt like it was."
37:31,600;37:36,680;"I mean, nowadays it seems more pronounced, but those first"
37:36,680;37:41,160;"four, six weeks of the season are almost like an extended pre"
37:41,160;37:44,720;"season for the pages where they're still kind of getting everybody on the same page."
37:44,720;37:50,480;"And then once you start getting middle of the season, they actually start doing"
37:50,480;37:53,040;"some more interesting things like that, because everybody's on the same page."
37:53,040;37:56,760;"And there's so much communication that goes on, especially with the offense as well,"
37:56,760;38:00,440;"I think nowadays with the way Brady runs things, but the defense,"
38:00,440;38:03,520;"especially that they're all kind of, they all have to be on the same page."
38:03,520;38:04,880;"They often know what the looks are."
38:04,880;38:12,600;"And I think their, um, their responsibilities shift a lot, like even during the play."
38:12,600;38:15,960;"I remember, um, Gilmore, we thought he was a boss."
38:15,960;38:19,400;"When we were like, Oh, man, I'm a shit."
38:19,400;38:20,400;"not on the hard."
38:20,400;38:26,120;"But even a couple of weeks ago, I remember seeing some replay of I don't even know what"
38:26,120;38:27,120;"kind of play it was."
38:27,120;38:32,160;"I think it was against the Cowboys where the Cowboys sent a guy in motion and they were"
38:32,160;38:36,520;"trying to do something like moving everything to one side."
38:36,520;38:42,200;"But because of the like as the motion was happening, the two linebackers were literally"
38:42,200;38:49,320;"like in real time switching off responsibilities because of the the I'm assuming because the"
38:49,320;38:52,680;"the offensive play had shifted to where the,"
38:52,680;38:54,600;"like that need to happen, but they did it like"
38:54,600;38:57,240;"instantaneously with no conversation happening,"
38:57,240;38:59,600;"no like talking, they just knew that as soon as this guy"
38:59,600;39:03,360;"moved over here, the entire like defensive"
39:03,360;39:04,880;"responsibilities for everybody to change."
39:04,880;39:07,000;"And so like everything just kind of shifted."
39:07,000;39:09,880;"And Dak Prescott had like, he thought he had something"
39:09,880;39:12,280;"and completely didn't because like every,"
39:12,280;39:14,920;"so I think there's a lot of that sort of stuff happening."
39:14,920;39:16,880;"I think once you get to like, you know, week eight"
39:16,880;39:20,380;"against even what was supposed to be an explosive Falcons team."
39:20,380;39:23,440;"All of a sudden you see that all start to click a little bit because they've"
39:23,440;39:25,220;"actually had all this time together."
39:25,220;39:26,740;"That's a good point though."
39:26,740;39:29,280;"Like when you bring a guy in like Gilmore, because he had all off season"
39:29,280;39:31,880;"until I get acclimated and whatever it was, a disaster."
39:31,880;39:33,740;"And obviously he's amazing now."
39:33,740;39:33,980;"I'm kidding."
39:33,980;39:34,140;"Yes."
39:34,140;39:34,460;"Thing."
39:34,460;39:38,660;"But you think that because the first Bella check here with the pads, it was"
39:38,660;39:41,900;"like, oh, like rookies and new guys and like it was kind of this young mess."
39:41,900;39:44,180;"Then they brought in all of these like older guys."
39:44,220;39:48,100;"So how do you think that like they got into jail that quickly like by"
39:48,100;39:49,660;"mentioned where people are just kind of new?"
39:49,660;39:53,420;"Well, I think that's why they brought in the older guys is that you,"
39:53,420;39:57,660;"they know enough about like, because if you have the technique,"
39:57,660;39:59,300;"yeah, they got the idea of Demi."
39:59,300;40:00,620;"Yeah, but Gilmore was like, at that time."
40:00,620;40:04,100;"Yeah, but if you have those young guys, like they, they're still learning,"
40:04,100;40:08,700;"you know, the speed of the NFL and like just everything about the new system,"
40:08,700;40:11,420;"whereas the guys that have been the lead, because I mean, you talked about it"
40:11,420;40:19,580;"the beginning of this season where they didn't just bring in vets. They brought in guys who"
40:19,580;40:24,580;"had been in the league for like 12, 15 years. So they knew the ins and outs of football on"
40:24,580;40:28,180;"Sunday. So it was a matter of just making sure they're all on the same page, I think,"
40:28,180;40:29,180;"more than anything."
40:29,180;40:32,380;"So you think Gilmore's problem was just that maybe he hadn't been exposed to something"
40:32,380;40:37,100;"like that and everybody else on the team did. So we're seamless when he wasn't there."
40:37,100;40:42,200;"when he joined like it just took a long time to kind of get you to that hole because he had played five years."
40:42,200;40:47,900;"I mean probably just stuck in man in Buffalo and we're like, yeah,"
40:47,900;40:53,400;"yeah, cover this game. Yeah, and they're like, oh, you're sick. Yeah. Man, it's man. But if this guy does this,"
40:53,400;40:57,200;"you have to you have to recognize this and you have to switch off. You have to switch off."
40:57,200;41:02,140;"That's what's up. That's fair. That's true. He's still being there's a pro"
41:02,140;41:08,220;"But yeah, he was just that good which we're seeing now right and I also think about this"
41:08,220;41:13,060;"But like the whole Malcolm Butler thing and we were like hey, which guy did like why don't they give him the contract?"
41:13,060;41:16,220;"Why did they bring this guy in? Well, you know, I guess that"
41:16,220;41:24,780;"Percent well, I don't know. I mean can you I mean not not Gilmour versus Butler"
41:24,780;41:28,860;"But I got to think that Butler would have been better staying here"
41:29,620;41:32,700;"But I think he's actually played well in Tennessee"
41:32,700;41:39,960;"He played better well, he had he had a rough first half of the season when he first went there"
41:39,960;41:43,160;"But then second half seems actually one of the better"
41:43,160;41:45,960;"Cornbacks in the league"
41:45,960;41:48,640;"I'm gonna bother stand up. I love I love"
41:48,640;41:52,560;"I still can't wait to find out what happened to Super Bowl because"
41:58,280;42:02,960;"Hey, we'll we will get there in 20 years of episodes"
42:02,960;42:08,760;"One freaking play from that guy would have changed everything but anyway"
42:08,760;42:16,360;"We'll get there too"
42:16,360;42:19,980;"Some great years or ten picks in one year. I think so freaking ballad check"
42:19,980;42:23,840;"That sucks moves on too early for too late though"
42:24,760;42:31,680;"Well isn't the most recent I actually saw it today the most recent argument for Bella check the"
42:31,680;42:36,120;"The"
42:36,120;42:38,680;"drafter or whatever team builder"
42:38,680;42:45,440;"Screwing Bell check the coach was letting Chandler walk. Oh"
42:45,440;42:48,320;"yeah, cuz he's"
42:48,320;42:52,720;"For three or four sacks away from the the record this year, right?"
42:53,680;42:58,800;"Like that whole thing worked perfectly though because it's sort of like needed to happen for the team to build around like"
42:58,800;43:05,480;"What they had and if you think about it like the the not the butler year that we didn't play like we yeah"
43:05,480;43:11,040;"They lost that one, but then like we kind of made out for it and more I think so it's like"
43:11,040;43:14,360;"Right like as much I would say but"
43:14,360;43:20,480;"Yeah, I'm there's doing fine, but she's also on like synthetic. We like make it running in like a cop's like station"
43:20,480;43:22,740;"That was awesome. I forgot about that."
43:22,740;43:23,080;"Yeah."
43:23,080;43:23,880;"That's a crazy stuff."
43:23,880;43:24,780;"That's a dollar right after."
43:24,780;43:26,080;"And then all the reason I'm not saying about it,"
43:26,080;43:27,780;"trade flowers is trade flowers."
43:27,780;43:28,440;"That's not a big year."
43:28,440;43:29,880;"The same thing."
43:29,880;43:30,920;"Same exact thing."
43:30,920;43:31,580;"Yeah."
43:31,580;43:31,780;"Yeah."
43:31,780;43:35,080;"So that synthetic weed does put you in a weird place though."
43:35,080;43:36,240;"Way weird."
43:36,240;43:36,680;"Yeah."
43:36,680;43:40,520;"The most I remember about this game was that it was it was college"
43:40,520;43:40,980;"year."
43:40,980;43:41,980;"See, I'm saying too much."
43:41,980;43:43,080;"I've had now."
43:43,080;43:45,580;"What else happened?"
43:45,580;43:45,920;"Yeah."
43:45,920;43:48,080;"So the sky's got his finger in my ass, right?"
43:48,080;43:49,080;"Watching the game."
43:49,080;43:49,920;"I'm gonna go for me."
43:49,920;43:51,520;"- Hang me out with Michael Jackson."
43:51,520;43:52,840;"Okay."
43:52,840;43:54,240;"- Well Jerry Sandusky, okay."
43:54,240;43:55,080;"- I don't know those guys."
43:55,080;43:56,840;"I didn't even kiss me by all."
43:56,840;43:57,680;"- Oh my God."
43:57,680;43:59,360;"- This is an idiot Penn State."
43:59,360;44:01,640;"- I remember this game the night before it."
44:01,640;44:04,400;"It was the first time that I ever really drank."
44:04,400;44:06,800;"And I was hanging out with some older people."
44:06,800;44:08,720;"At the time I think I was, I don't know,"
44:08,720;44:10,960;"young in college, whatever."
44:10,960;44:15,880;"And so we had played like some card games or so."
44:15,880;44:17,200;"I don't know what it was, but it was an asshole."
44:17,200;44:18,200;"I have no idea."
44:18,200;44:20,440;"They basically destroyed me."
44:20,440;44:21,280;"They thought it was hilarious."
44:21,280;44:22,360;"I didn't think it was so funny."
44:22,360;44:26,600;"And I remember I had some assistants walking upstairs."
44:26,600;44:27,800;"I think I threw up all over the bed."
44:27,800;44:29,280;"It was a great initiation to drink."
44:29,280;44:30,360;"Oh, it happens."
44:30,360;44:33,080;"But the night today was this game."
44:33,080;44:36,520;"I remember laying down on this chair."
44:36,520;44:37,680;"The game was going on the background."
44:37,680;44:39,640;"And the announcer's making me nauseous."
44:39,640;44:42,600;"It was like a robot that every smell was coming in there."
44:42,600;44:45,640;"It was throwing up with every page free display."
44:45,640;44:47,200;"And I remember that."
44:47,200;44:47,800;"So I don't know."
44:47,800;44:50,480;"So fond memories, like that."
44:50,480;44:51,920;"But this one is very vivid in my mind."
44:51,920;44:52,580;"Yeah."
44:52,580;44:55,360;"We've talked about my memories of Penn State or lack thereof."
44:55,360;44:55,680;"Oh, yeah."
44:55,680;44:57,560;"We talked about taking off a shirt."
44:57,560;45:01,720;"I mean, you already admitted to not being a part of that whole thing."
45:01,720;45:02,240;"Yeah."
45:02,240;45:02,740;"Yeah."
45:02,740;45:03,200;"It's not much of a--"
45:03,200;45:04,240;"Legitally."
45:04,240;45:06,040;"Story."
45:06,040;45:06,800;"Not all about it."
45:06,800;45:08,120;"He didn't drink to college."
45:08,120;45:09,240;"I didn't know."
45:09,240;45:10,120;"Me neither."
45:10,120;45:11,320;"Really?"
45:11,320;45:12,400;"Man."
45:12,400;45:14,960;"Eric, what was your first beer outside of mom and dad's"
45:14,960;45:16,960;"I'm just gonna give you a little bit of a preview."
45:16,960;45:18,960;"Probably like a sophomore in high school."
45:18,960;45:19,960;"But it wasn't."
45:19,960;45:20,960;"Really?"
45:20,960;45:21,960;"Yeah."
45:21,960;45:26,960;"First time I smoked weed and drank was the same night."
45:26,960;45:27,960;"Whoa, really?"
45:27,960;45:28,960;"Geez."
45:28,960;45:29,960;"For house sitting for someone."
45:29,960;45:32,960;"And they had a dog and I was so stunned and I couldn't get the weed."
45:32,960;45:35,960;"Oh, I really got in my head."
45:35,960;45:36,960;"So you don't like dogs?"
45:36,960;45:38,960;"Dogs are coppin'."
45:38,960;45:40,960;"Fuckin' dark."
45:40,960;45:43,960;"Mine was with Andrew."
45:43,960;45:49,480;"He and Nick he like got a we're just outing a whole bunch of motherfucker. I'm gonna have to cut this shit"
45:49,480;45:51,480;"I"
45:51,480;45:56,560;"Course original put underneath a wheelbarrow in his yard"
45:56,560;46:02,800;"As you do that warm course banquet. Do you have any fun first first source?"
46:02,800;46:07,000;"First beautiful fucking no"
46:07,000;46:12,040;"Yeah, cuz I mean I'm not the first time I blacked out and not realizing that oh"
46:12,920;46:15,720;"Oh, he always thought like, oh, I didn't remember him last night."
46:15,720;46:16,720;"You're like, yeah, yeah, yeah."
46:16,720;46:21,280;"And then I actually blacked out and I remember looking at text that I had sent"
46:21,280;46:24,880;"and being like, yeah, I don't remember that at all."
46:24,880;46:26,520;"Like blacking out his room."
46:26,520;46:27,600;"He got older."
46:27,600;46:28,480;"That didn't get me better."
46:28,480;46:32,360;"So pretty much, uh, I stay away from that maladies."
46:32,360;46:35,880;"But, uh, the next thing you know, you get picked up by one."
46:35,880;46:36,080;"Right."
46:36,080;46:36,560;"I haven't."
46:36,560;46:37,120;"It's up in there."
46:37,120;46:38,120;"Yeah."
46:38,120;46:38,800;"Don't ever drink."
46:38,800;46:39,680;"Don't drink."
46:39,680;46:40,360;"Don't ever do."
46:40,360;46:47,320;"Cp probably yeah, that's a no-no make sure you ask before you if you're in that situation"
46:47,320;46:57,400;"When it out"
46:57,400;47:03,980;"Conversation because it is and don't play in the NFL while on PCP because that is poorly"
47:03,980;47:05,440;"Well, I mean he did pretty good"
47:05,440;47:10,420;"terrible speed pro bowl is Tom Brady in this game. How'd you think he did? Well, I didn't watch it so"
47:10,420;47:19,680;"Watch this game"
47:19,680;47:28,000;"The commentators are all a brow Brady like he's them and I was lapping it up. He was precise"
47:28,000;47:30,160;"I mean, he was good the thing that I"
47:30,760;47:36,180;"Thought it was crazy about this game and very unbellaged. I like is like Brady was actually lights out"
47:36,180;47:39,040;"But like there are a lot of great plays that were called back for penalties"
47:39,040;47:44,460;"Yeah, it was happening all the time with the commentators to your point. Yeah, they were on on that as well"
47:44,460;47:46,460;"They're like what the hell is going on? They were pissed"
47:46,460;47:52,140;"Minutas going by no penalties imagine that. Oh, no, I have the quote. I wrote the quote down"
47:52,140;47:58,560;"It was having seen a flag in a minute or two. Yeah, and then the other guys like they're gonna eat umbrellas down there"
47:58,560;47:59,400;"- I love it."
47:59,400;48:02,700;"For all the flags."
48:02,700;48:05,940;"- And then we went like a fade pass to Kevin Falk"
48:05,940;48:06,780;"in the end zone."
48:06,780;48:07,940;"- That was a nice turn."
48:07,940;48:08,780;"- Right?"
48:08,780;48:09,600;"- Yeah, great to know about like,"
48:09,600;48:11,340;"who the fuck run in the field?"
48:11,340;48:12,820;"- Yeah, it was like great about that play."
48:12,820;48:14,380;"And that's like another Bella check thing"
48:14,380;48:15,520;"that he was toying with."
48:15,520;48:19,540;"He, so brooking was like kind of like wreaking havoc."
48:19,540;48:22,020;"And so they sent out like Kevin Falk wide"
48:22,020;48:23,980;"to like isolate him with like brooking"
48:23,980;48:24,820;"and be like the outside."
48:24,820;48:26,180;"And the announcers were like,"
48:26,180;48:27,180;"again, all over Bella check,"
48:27,180;48:40,180;"and all my knowledge, whatever. And it worked, it was a perfection, but it was like, I guess that was in the thing to kind of isolate, you know, line up."
48:40,180;48:41,180;"They match up."
48:41,180;48:43,180;"It was like running back. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty cool."
48:43,180;48:48,180;"I mean, I don't like the isolation, but like a fade route to Kevin Falk. It seemed weird to me."
48:48,180;48:53,180;"I don't think I've ever seen that again. I don't know if I've ever seen Tom Brady throw a fade to a running back."
48:53,180;48:58,940;"one of James White. Was it a fade fade though or was it kind of just like fade like hard"
48:58,940;49:03,380;"it was like right over the top of the guy's like a great ballroom in Camp Bog is 5 for"
49:03,380;49:12,380;"the day. Yeah. They don't know but to their credit he wasn't even looking so part of the"
49:12,380;49:18,020;"what I've enjoyed about this this season is that I have no recollection of it for me"
49:18,020;49:22,180;"it's a little bit of a treat so that's true I had no idea what to expect with this."
49:22,180;49:24,420;"I'm like, oh shit, I've a few points."
49:24,420;49:26,180;"- Well, that's 'cause you were blacked out, Mike."
49:26,180;49:27,100;"We just went over this."
49:27,100;49:28,540;"(laughing)"
49:28,540;49:29,540;"- High on PC people."
49:29,540;49:30,900;"- The whole story about it."
49:30,900;49:34,580;"- Game guys, one game this week."
49:34,580;49:36,860;"- Yeah, I think going to Steve's point,"
49:36,860;49:39,740;"it looked like, and I think there was something"
49:39,740;49:42,820;"in the paper the day after about how,"
49:42,820;49:45,660;"like the offensive game plan was because the corners"
49:45,660;49:48,860;"were so good for the Falcons that they were basically"
49:48,860;49:51,780;"just gonna give them that and just throw to like,"
49:51,780;49:53,540;"backs and tight ends the whole game."
49:53,540;49:54,380;"- Right."
49:54,380;49:55,980;"- And I think that was part of like the Kevin Falk touch"
49:55,980;49:56,820;"and was part of."
49:56,820;49:58,580;"- Yeah, but you know what's funny is that like"
49:58,580;50:00,700;"in commentators again, we're like pointing it out,"
50:00,700;50:03,060;"Brady was like picking on a rugby can in the whole game."
50:03,060;50:05,180;"- He was actually picking on a rugby can."
50:05,180;50:06,020;"He was."
50:06,020;50:06,940;"- Insane."
50:06,940;50:07,780;"- Yeah."
50:07,780;50:09,060;"- Did you see like at the end of the game,"
50:09,060;50:11,580;"like Brady waited for him to like kind of just like"
50:11,580;50:13,220;"congratulate him and yeah."
50:13,220;50:14,060;"- Oh really?"
50:14,060;50:14,900;"- Oh, I didn't see that."
50:14,900;50:16,700;"- Kind of tell him like, you know, obviously good job"
50:16,700;50:18,060;"or whatever, even though it wasn't."
50:18,060;50:19,420;"(laughs)"
50:19,420;50:20,300;"- That's why I was telling him."
50:20,300;50:21,140;"- Yeah, yeah."
50:21,140;50:26,320;"Like 2001 Brady confidence is my favorite thing about the season so far. He was like"
50:26,320;50:33,380;"There was two plays back to back the first play was they tried a flea flicker and Brady got sacked"
50:33,380;50:38,360;"I think yeah, he did which is which I don't think I've ever seen in my life a sack on a flea flicker"
50:38,360;50:42,520;"No, maybe a pick or something like that, but not a sack or even anything completely"
50:42,520;50:44,240;"But yeah, never I've never seen anybody sack"
50:44,240;50:49,520;"But then the next play comes back and throws like a 30-yard dime to Patton like the next place"
50:49,520;50:56,480;"Like not even phase it he got sacked on a trick play. Oh, I mean he threw that that Troy Brown bomb in the second quarter"
50:56,480;50:58,480;"He just hung in there and just"
50:58,480;51:00,560;"Oh my god. Yeah launched it"
51:00,560;51:04,700;"That's when the real dick sucking for Tom Brady from"
51:04,700;51:08,120;"They were loving to our faith. They thought he's a"
51:08,120;51:10,800;"You guys during this portion of the game"
51:10,800;51:16,480;"Vignitary though, there was a stat where it said something like he'd never missed at this point in the dome up until that point"
51:16,480;51:21,640;"I think it was like 22 for 22 field goals 21 for 21 extra points something like that"
51:21,640;51:25,620;"You didn't miss it all kept it going. I'm I believe"
51:25,620;51:32,120;"I believe you and me read the game where he started missing the first game. He missed a"
51:32,120;51:36,360;"Field goal indoors"
51:36,360;51:42,920;"You were hung over again. So maybe no, I was not now you're going over Ryan stories. They watched"
51:43,640;51:45,640;"It was against the Texans"
51:45,640;51:49,160;"No, we watch the game together though"
51:49,160;51:55,920;"I'm sure you weren't black out drunk. I remember stories parties. I would say I'm arguing about politics"
51:55,920;51:59,320;"You would be hammered. I remember correctly pretending. Are you politics?"
51:59,320;52:05,640;"Just to get on your nerves. So you want to talk about that brown touchdown. I think we brought you up"
52:05,640;52:08,680;"We're talking about Tom Brady like this is so"
52:09,800;52:12,800;"There was talk about what to call this play"
52:12,800;52:16,560;"The boss and globe and I say the OG right in Friday"
52:16,560;52:26,800;"Yes, so the quote is the macular reception is already taken so rather than violate any unwritten copyright laws"
52:26,800;52:32,440;"What should patients fans call yesterday's moment of divine intervention at the Georgia dome and here are the options?"
52:32,440;52:34,760;"the"
52:34,760;52:37,680;"The spotless snatch my personal fifth"
52:37,680;52:43,840;"snare or the pure puck the appear black snatch was like a thing back then right like"
52:43,840;52:49,020;"Wait, but snatch was like slaying for some"
52:49,020;52:54,840;"Let me see you think it's right so you knew that like the spotless"
52:54,840;52:57,560;"Snatch I feel like it fits this podcast"
52:57,560;53:03,880;"It was a suggestion by a bossing globe writer"
53:03,880;53:08,600;"Wow. All right. Let me see you clam."
53:08,600;53:10,800;"Spotless."
53:10,800;53:11,360;"That's good."
53:11,360;53:12,880;"But you threw that into triple coverage."
53:12,880;53:15,760;"I shouldn't pick 10 times out of 10."
53:15,760;53:19,000;"It doint off of someone throw by Brady."
53:19,000;53:21,840;"The confident throw by Brady."
53:21,840;53:23,000;"OK."
53:23,000;53:24,440;"The fine line."
53:24,440;53:27,560;"And I felt that Troy Brown actually struggled in this game pretty heavily."
53:27,560;53:29,480;"I didn't think so."
53:29,480;53:31,200;"I mean, I think you need a few heads up plays."
53:31,200;53:33,440;"There were like five or seven things, I think, for like 99 yards"
53:33,440;53:38,240;"and it touched down something like that. Yeah. I mean, he did his thing. But on that play,"
53:38,240;53:44,840;"though, what was funny is like, so Brady almost throws a pick and bounces into Troy Brown's"
53:44,840;53:51,000;"hands. He runs it in for what 2530 yards in the destiny 50 yards? No, it was like 50 yards"
53:51,000;53:58,600;"40 or 45 or 50. Yeah, plus some buffer yards in the back there. So he ran it in the commentators"
53:58,600;54:01,740;"were going nuts. Yeah. And then they're pointing out, they're like,"
54:01,740;54:05,440;"Blenzo was thinking, why doesn't that ever happen to me? Which I'm like,"
54:05,440;54:08,960;"so many interceptions, you know, he never got one of those, but then they close"
54:08,960;54:12,340;"up on a handboard. And then close up on brain. It's like, look at his"
54:12,340;54:17,060;"reaction, even he can't believe it. And basically, basically, like hands on"
54:17,060;54:19,460;"his head, yeah, Bledso is just like, that's"
54:19,460;54:27,580;"apologizing with body language. Oh my God. Poor guy. Bledso class act,"
54:27,580;54:33,260;"Well, Bledso's face on that that was all that was gonna be my best actually. Yeah, we didn't talk about it was Bledso's face"
54:33,260;54:36,580;"He's like you got a"
54:36,580;54:43,420;"They're gonna do the bad throw into triple coverage there's three guys there"
54:43,420;54:48,020;"It was like double-carver the safety coming over the top line back underneath the corner on the guy"
54:48,020;54:50,020;"I just like what do you do it? Oh?"
54:50,020;54:55,500;"I don't think I've ever seen anything like that again, but yeah, it poor blood so man like I"
54:57,020;55:02,940;"Think he was a class act. I mean he was pretty much like a mentor throughout the season, right? Yeah"
55:02,940;55:09,260;"Lot about that. So I mean I was good commentators. Brady has been open. I think about like"
55:09,260;55:13,180;"Not open, but I mean people have talked about how he's not the most helpful guy"
55:13,180;55:19,500;"Well, I think yeah from what I've heard he doesn't like to give up snaps and practice"
55:20,540;55:23,980;"in practice and stuff. Yeah. Because he saw what happened when he got the"
55:23,980;55:27,440;"opportunity. He did exactly. He's had the first head experience of what"
55:27,440;55:32,140;"happens if you. Yeah, that's the thing. It probably to be a really good athlete."
55:32,140;55:35,660;"I bet you got to be kind of a prick. Oh, yeah. That's a lack that he's"
55:35,660;55:40,500;"actually like, you know, that's a fair point. Yeah. Yeah. You know,"
55:40,500;55:43,980;"that's fair. Oh, I mean, he doesn't have to be like the hugest dick, but"
55:43,980;55:48,420;"enough to like secure a spot. Right. Didn't love what so."
55:48,420;55:50,420;"and"
55:50,420;55:53,580;"Hot take Brady's a dick"
55:53,580;56:00,740;"So anything else you guys want to talk about in this game there's a lot dude"
56:00,740;56:04,380;"Scott Chandler's face after that"
56:04,380;56:10,580;"Third quarter first drive sack of this is face the way he looked you like you can tell Steve doesn't recognize a guy"
56:10,580;56:12,580;"Cuz he called him Scott Chandler"
56:12,580;56:16,380;"He did get destroyed. I mean I even wrote down Scott Chandler"
56:16,380;56:18,380;"I"
56:18,380;56:22,340;"Rode down like Richard Seymour like got a sack in there, you know, oh"
56:22,340;56:25,380;"Was a sack was a grown-ass"
56:25,380;56:29,360;"That blocker was just threw him out of the way like you like"
56:29,360;56:33,740;"Chris Chandler he got sacked like six times. Yeah, and then"
56:33,740;56:37,820;"In like three quarters like he got sacked so much had to leave the game"
56:37,820;56:42,400;"Dude, yeah, so he left the game walking sideways"
56:42,400;56:45,720;"Yeah, if anybody wants to look that up it is like"
56:45,720;56:51,100;"anything like exactly wrong with it nobody bent over sight you can't"
56:51,100;56:56,780;"Not know what they did. There was no like reports on an or anything"
56:56,780;56:58,620;"So I don't know what it was"
56:58,620;57:03,840;"He's not the boss and papers, but it looked good like Otis Smith later"
57:03,840;57:07,040;"Another in this game. I mean"
57:07,040;57:10,000;"Otis Smith"
57:10,280;57:14,640;"He came in so fast that the commentator actually yelled out watch out."
57:14,640;57:18,800;"It's coming in on the blue and to my Jones had a few good ones."
57:18,800;57:22,760;"My notes are Chandler or Scott Chandler."
57:22,760;57:28,480;"Like he's having fun after that first drive sack and then Otis made sure of it."
57:28,480;57:31,200;"It was like he wanted to go out."
57:31,200;57:33,960;"Especially when people were like, I think this is the third quarter and people were like"
57:33,960;57:35,440;"yelling for Michael Vick."
57:35,440;57:37,640;"You're chanting for Vick."
57:37,640;57:40,280;"Yeah, I mean when Vic came in that changed the game."
57:40,280;57:41,080;"Oh, it did."
57:41,080;57:43,760;"But before that, I wrote down because this is amazing."
57:43,760;57:48,440;"But Brady was running the two minute drill and time's going out for the clock."
57:48,440;57:50,200;"Commentators get a little nervous."
57:50,200;57:52,120;"He has it under control."
57:52,120;57:57,200;"I wrote amazing time management because he killed everything,"
57:57,200;58:02,240;"bullet passed, like marked Edwards, and then like there's about 15 seconds left on the clock to give the ball."
58:02,240;58:04,760;"So that's what they were talking about."
58:04,760;58:08,960;"They're talking about how like the Patriots were like nobody for a long time and then how they were coming up."
58:08,960;58:11,060;"There were a couple other teams that were known as are coming up."
58:11,060;58:12,860;"They were talking about the parody of the NFL."
58:12,860;58:18,060;"I thought it was funny because they were right, but it's sort of like wasn't right for like the next 20 years."
58:18,060;58:19,760;"Exactly."
58:19,760;58:26,760;"Yeah, I also like that my favorite part of the two minute drill at the end of the half was Tom Brady doing the hard count."
58:26,760;58:28,360;"The beginning of the two minute drill."
58:28,360;58:29,060;"Yeah, that was good."
58:29,060;58:30,560;"Like nobody does it anymore."
58:30,560;58:30,960;"Yeah."
58:30,960;58:32,860;"Again, the commentators are all over that."
58:32,860;58:34,360;"These are great commentators in this game."
58:34,360;58:38,420;"they were by they did one glaring issue"
58:38,420;58:40,780;"feeling misses the field all right"
58:40,780;58:44,700;"yep like the answers like the field was a wide left the other"
58:44,700;58:46,980;"announcer's like furious is like the kicker"
58:46,980;58:49,540;"didn't miss why left the offense miss why less"
58:49,540;58:52,540;"if they got 50 more yards it wouldn't been missed"
58:52,540;58:56,420;"we had a good point though every trick ever yeah no they had to be a"
58:56,420;58:57,880;"though"
58:57,880;59:00,220;"they had like a dumb penalty like yeah"
59:00,220;59:04,260;"Fall starts I'm like again in this pointless if we kick a five-year-old closer. It doesn't matter"
59:04,260;59:08,220;"But he was a little too furious from my back. He was a kicker fault"
59:08,220;59:12,720;"Well to be fair he missed from 58 and 50 so dollar you was missing chip shots"
59:12,720;59:22,860;"Before we get to Vic's debut I think that"
59:22,860;59:27,740;"Last pass touchdown where they went up like 24 to 10 or something like that"
59:27,940;59:34,060;"Where like when Vic came in was kind of out of hand already 24/7 yeah was a twan had a huge dry starter"
59:34,060;59:38,960;"Like didn't do nothing in the whole second half and then he had a like a fat run"
59:38,960;59:44,380;"I think you got a screen pass or something because he fumbled early to he did yeah, and Mark Edwards"
59:44,380;59:48,980;"It too at some point I think that was right before that crazy trebrantosh down"
59:48,980;59:56,180;"Yeah, it was that started to drive no it was the same time right Juan got him from like there 20 to like the 50 on"
59:56,180;01:00:01,140;"But he had a he had like two or three big runs in that drive and then it was the Troy round"
01:00:01,140;01:00:06,740;"117 in the second half yeah, and like probably 40 of those were in the"
01:00:06,740;01:00:10,080;"In the in that one drive on like a run the catch"
01:00:10,080;01:00:16,580;"And if he doesn't do those and they don't have that thing and then it's not 24 7 1 Vic comes in it cuz Vic change that game"
01:00:16,580;01:00:19,580;"It is funny though. The game's one Smith was like"
01:00:20,580;01:00:25,300;"I guess go on the fourth quarter. What was that by managing a field goal?"
01:00:25,300;01:00:31,260;"Well, they got into the gut red zone with Mike Vick back there and then ran it with a running back three times in a row"
01:00:31,260;01:00:34,680;"So I have I wrote down the stat that"
01:00:34,680;01:00:37,180;"Chris Chandler going into this game"
01:00:37,180;01:00:42,740;"You had more touchdowns and in the red zone this season. It for touchdowns and two in completions. That's great"
01:00:42,740;01:00:46,340;"You say big but he was hurt. No Chandler"
01:00:48,100;01:00:51,300;"The game they if he had finished a game this is in the fourth quarter"
01:00:51,300;01:00:53,780;"Maybe it comes with that fourth quarter hits that slant"
01:00:53,780;01:00:58,560;"Right that quick slant that turns into like a six-yard game. Yeah, we're"
01:00:58,560;01:01:04,660;"One of the DB's on the pages literally like dodged them dodge the guy instead of that"
01:01:04,660;01:01:08,500;"Yeah"
01:01:08,500;01:01:11,940;"Cross some like the boom tower hit and just like"
01:01:15,780;01:01:17,780;"Just once it hit something doesn't kill what college"
01:01:17,780;01:01:21,920;"Anybody he literally like goes out of his way to not hit anybody"
01:01:21,920;01:01:23,540;"Because"
01:01:23,540;01:01:28,820;"Super frustrating so they're inside the red zone inside the ten I think and then they got a mic Vic back there"
01:01:28,820;01:01:33,440;"And they just call three straight running players the running back like I don't know"
01:01:33,440;01:01:35,900;"But you didn't know what you have really right?"
01:01:35,900;01:01:41,860;"I you draft the guy number one overall. You know you have plays in the playbook like you know I'm saying well"
01:01:41,860;01:01:43,500;"- Well they actually talked about that, how--"
01:01:43,500;01:01:44,340;"- They did."
01:01:44,340;01:01:46,540;"- Like Michael Vick was still learning the playbook"
01:01:46,540;01:01:51,080;"and he was like ways away from being able to run an offense"
01:01:51,080;01:01:51,920;"but they're gonna put him in anyway."
01:01:51,920;01:01:52,760;"- Seriously, please."
01:01:52,760;01:01:55,140;"- Basically, like I have here like nasty drive,"
01:01:55,140;01:01:58,740;"Mike Vick, 35 yard run, right?"
01:01:58,740;01:02:01,780;"Okay, then same drive, 15 yard run, right?"
01:02:01,780;01:02:02,620;"- Yeah."
01:02:02,620;01:02:04,120;"- And then like it petals out."
01:02:04,120;01:02:07,420;"And then it was like Laura Maloy-Sack,"
01:02:07,420;01:02:10,380;"Otis Smith crushes him to put his hands off the air."
01:02:10,380;01:02:13,680;"They get a, they get a penalty, but they take him down by the face mask."
01:02:13,680;01:02:14,180;"Yeah."
01:02:14,180;01:02:18,300;"He like lunges that his head and rips it off."
01:02:18,300;01:02:19,900;"They just corner blizzing him to death."
01:02:19,900;01:02:21,460;"They just kept bringing the corn blitz over."
01:02:21,460;01:02:23,580;"That's how they knocked Scott Chandler out of the game."
01:02:23,580;01:02:24,540;"Yeah."
01:02:24,540;01:02:26,420;"Was bringing those defensive back."
01:02:26,420;01:02:26,500;"Yeah."
01:02:26,500;01:02:28,140;"One just like he just couldn't get there."
01:02:28,140;01:02:30,940;"So he just reached out with his left arm and just face."
01:02:30,940;01:02:32,300;"That's Michael Victor, the graph."
01:02:32,300;01:02:37,220;"But even outside of that, like I was like basically it's written down that it was"
01:02:37,220;01:02:40,340;"like a meaning, a meaningless like Antoine Smith, like run the fourth"
01:02:40,340;01:02:42,760;"inside like the two minutes or like they were just killing"
01:02:42,760;01:02:46,920;"clock. Yeah. I'm like, I think it was Wiggins, like just like"
01:02:46,920;01:02:50,080;"last some dude for a block, right? So even on offense, they"
01:02:50,080;01:02:53,520;"were just destroying people. I think this is like the craziest"
01:02:53,520;01:02:57,200;"like blocking tackling like game I've ever watched. Maybe it"
01:02:57,200;01:02:58,240;"maybe it was"
01:02:58,240;01:02:58,540;"beating the"
01:02:58,540;01:03:01,160;"Marge Jackson too. Just"
01:03:01,160;01:03:05,440;"people up and like screw the penalties. I mean, I don't"
01:03:05,440;01:03:09,520;"disagree with that. I don't see. I mean, that does that even"
01:03:09,520;01:03:10,880;"flying to these NFL though."
01:03:10,880;01:03:13,040;"They get torn to shreds if you just committed to that."
01:03:13,040;01:03:14,160;"I don't know."
01:03:14,160;01:03:16,760;"But then again, they can only call so many penalties, right?"
01:03:16,760;01:03:17,200;"Right."
01:03:17,200;01:03:20,000;"Was it one of the least of booms idea?"
01:03:20,000;01:03:22,960;"Well, and the Bengals this year against them,"
01:03:22,960;01:03:25,880;"the coach was basically like the wide receivers got man-handled."
01:03:25,880;01:03:26,560;"So I--"
01:03:26,560;01:03:27,400;"Yeah, that's right."
01:03:27,400;01:03:29,600;"--might be a little bit of how they used to play the Cole."
01:03:29,600;01:03:30,200;"Yeah."
01:03:30,200;01:03:34,520;"So I'm like, if you can set the tone early, maybe it works."
01:03:34,520;01:03:34,760;"I don't know."
01:03:34,760;01:03:36,880;"Just break their will early, and they're just not going to try."
01:03:36,880;01:03:44,120;"Yeah, I know, but like I probably it probably wouldn't be a good idea to kind of lunge a Lamar. I think it's a difference. I think"
01:03:44,120;01:03:49,200;"Way more physical back then. Yeah, the players to do that right. You have players are like"
01:03:49,200;01:03:50,960;"athletic"
01:03:50,960;01:03:54,340;"They're not like guys are gonna let you up like Brian"
01:03:54,340;01:03:58,440;"True, you know, you don't think Dante high tower wants a lot of it"
01:03:58,440;01:04:03,200;"He just probably more than normal, but like Jamie Collins is not going and ripping someone's head off"
01:04:04,160;01:04:07,900;"Those guys like they're not Lawrence guy though. He's he's a fucking grown-ass man"
01:04:07,900;01:04:12,200;"That guy that guy arm tackles running backs as he's getting blocked. Yeah, they know it will dish out"
01:04:12,200;01:04:16,500;"They're no else. Yeah, let's throw some throw some heat. I don't know, but yeah, you're right"
01:04:16,500;01:04:22,260;"I don't think that would fall. Yeah, they don't have that like lawyer. Maloy sort of safety was gonna come up and just try to knock"
01:04:22,260;01:04:26,080;"Somebody's head off. Well, there was a there's a moment on like Vix third or fourth drive"
01:04:26,080;01:04:31,840;"When he'd been corner blitz to death and they like dropped out and like he just"
01:04:32,480;01:04:36,520;"Did the old San darnold saw ghosts and like saw that pass rush and he like"
01:04:36,520;01:04:39,700;"Through it and like immediately duck and like there's like"
01:04:39,700;01:04:41,960;"the way from them"
01:04:41,960;01:04:45,320;"Like it was even close like he was clearly seeing like"
01:04:45,320;01:04:52,160;"Pressure everywhere. It was like textbook Catholic every time. It was like a waste drive into ground. Yeah"
01:04:52,160;01:04:56,080;"Probably yeah, actually I"
01:04:56,080;01:05:00,480;"Haven't it on here survivor is the only thing older than Brady"
01:05:00,480;01:05:04,560;"they're like because we usually don't have the commercials in it."
01:05:04,560;01:05:06,120;"Yeah, they were some in this."
01:05:06,120;01:05:06,640;"Yeah."
01:05:06,640;01:05:08,280;"And I was like, survivor Africa."
01:05:08,280;01:05:12,480;"And I was like, well, if they're on survivor Africa, that means it can't be the original season."
01:05:12,480;01:05:19,600;"I also have, they're talking about two years in cost of all as like a short time for my pick."
01:05:19,600;01:05:21,640;"Oh, you only played two years."
01:05:21,640;01:05:22,320;"Oh, yeah."
01:05:22,320;01:05:22,480;"Yeah."
01:05:22,480;01:05:23,040;"College."
01:05:23,040;01:05:26,560;"And it's now, you look at this junior year kind of, yeah."
01:05:26,560;01:05:26,920;"Yeah."
01:05:26,920;01:05:29,680;"And 20 years, they're going to be like, you only spent two years with the XFL."
01:05:29,680;01:05:32,240;"- No. (laughing)"
01:05:32,240;01:05:34,680;"Well, like Joe Barro's gonna come out like real quick"
01:05:34,680;01:05:38,240;"and everyone sees it come out just immediately in college."
01:05:38,240;01:05:39,240;"- I mean, it makes sense, right?"
01:05:39,240;01:05:40,520;"You gotta get money."
01:05:40,520;01:05:41,840;"- Yeah."
01:05:41,840;01:05:43,280;"- What was that dude that kind of like messed"
01:05:43,280;01:05:44,760;"that whole thing up?"
01:05:44,760;01:05:46,280;"Was it Maurice Claret?"
01:05:46,280;01:05:47,440;"- Maurice Claret, I have his jersey."
01:05:47,440;01:05:49,160;"- Oh yeah, yeah, that whole thing."
01:05:49,160;01:05:51,760;"- Yeah, I have him Maurice Claret jersey."
01:05:51,760;01:05:53,920;"- He got a $15."
01:05:53,920;01:05:55,080;"- I remember that."
01:05:55,080;01:05:57,160;"- Yeah, whatever that plays with Lawrence."
01:05:57,160;01:05:58,480;"- Yeah."
01:05:58,480;01:06:06,580;"goal is dope. I also have they're like, oh, we can't play can't pay two starting quarterback seven million dollars a year. I thought that"
01:06:06,580;01:06:14,820;"seven seven seven. Yeah. Yeah, you can't pay one dollar quarterback."
01:06:14,820;01:06:18,540;"Fourteen million a year didn't bolden making five."
01:06:20,520;01:06:23,480;"- That's a cherry gong making 30."
01:06:23,480;01:06:24,400;"- Jesus Christ."
01:06:24,400;01:06:25,400;"- Yeah."
01:06:25,400;01:06:27,200;"Rex Burkhead's probably making five."
01:06:27,200;01:06:28,040;"- Yeah."
01:06:28,040;01:06:28,880;"- So many places."
01:06:28,880;01:06:30,000;"- You know, like, oh, they need too much ego"
01:06:30,000;01:06:31,800;"or it's like, they all want to start."
01:06:31,800;01:06:34,160;"It was like, yeah, there's just not enough money to go."
01:06:34,160;01:06:35,240;"(laughing)"
01:06:35,240;01:06:36,120;"- Really neat."
01:06:36,120;01:06:37,160;"And like, that's a top end."
01:06:37,160;01:06:39,400;"So like, what are the guys like,"
01:06:39,400;01:06:40,720;"just getting their heads thrown off."
01:06:40,720;01:06:41,560;"- Yeah, man."
01:06:41,560;01:06:42,400;"- Yeah, he won it years, man."
01:06:42,400;01:06:43,240;"That's true, bro."
01:06:43,240;01:06:45,520;"- He, bless us on what, like 10 year,"
01:06:45,520;01:06:48,000;"100 million dollars, he was 10 million a year, right?"
01:06:48,000;01:06:48,840;"- 10 million, yeah."
01:06:48,840;01:06:49,680;"But like, you ever take?"
01:06:49,680;01:06:51,280;"maybe some of those years were like void."
01:06:51,280;01:06:53,040;"- Yeah, I'm sure it was our back."
01:06:53,040;01:06:55,840;"- So you're saying two, so it'd be like 14"
01:06:55,840;01:06:56,840;"for your quarterback?"
01:06:56,840;01:06:57,680;"- Yeah."
01:06:57,680;01:07:00,040;"- I don't know the sound of the quarterback."
01:07:00,040;01:07:00,880;"- It's still Jesus."
01:07:00,880;01:07:03,640;"- Yeah, I mean these are 2001 dollars."
01:07:03,640;01:07:04,480;"- Yeah, exactly."
01:07:04,480;01:07:08,920;"- I had written that like Antoine Smith"
01:07:08,920;01:07:11,480;"had been campaigning for like 20 plus carries a game."
01:07:11,480;01:07:13,720;"Like that was his thing, which it's unfortunate"
01:07:13,720;01:07:15,800;"that you need a back that has to have that many,"
01:07:15,800;01:07:16,920;"but I guess it's given the groove."
01:07:16,920;01:07:18,240;"I mean, I think you're your impuderson"
01:07:18,240;01:07:20,400;"was like the same way, but yeah."
01:07:20,400;01:07:22,240;"- I mean, back then, that was a big thing."
01:07:22,240;01:07:26,240;"- Yeah, and I have, they mentioned that it was the first"
01:07:26,240;01:07:29,560;"pass runner that reached 100 yards since the 99."
01:07:29,560;01:07:30,400;"- Yes."
01:07:30,400;01:07:31,400;"- That's crazy."
01:07:31,400;01:07:33,080;"- Yeah, who was running back?"
01:07:33,080;01:07:34,480;"I wrote it down, but I don't."
01:07:34,480;01:07:35,960;"- Oh, it was Terry Allen."
01:07:35,960;01:07:36,800;"- Yes?"
01:07:36,800;01:07:37,960;"- I have no idea."
01:07:37,960;01:07:40,600;"- Yeah, Terry Allen, we were nerd that name."
01:07:40,600;01:07:44,320;"- Terry Allen, oh yeah, he was a Marky sounds."
01:07:44,320;01:07:45,160;"- No."
01:07:45,160;01:07:46,000;"- Third cousin."
01:07:46,000;01:07:46,840;"- Retarded brother, yeah."
01:07:46,840;01:07:50,640;"Oh, that's not a retouching."
01:07:50,640;01:07:52,000;"Yeah, come on."
01:07:52,000;01:07:53,440;"Terry is listening to me."
01:07:53,440;01:07:54,760;"I don't know how to use a brother."
01:07:54,760;01:07:56,200;"I know all the Barry is listening."
01:07:56,200;01:07:57,600;"Shout out to Terry."
01:07:57,600;01:07:59,240;"No, I mean, Terry."
01:07:59,240;01:08:00,760;"Yeah."
01:08:00,760;01:08:03,680;"Wasn't he in the same era as the Marion Butts?"
01:08:03,680;01:08:04,720;"These are Cameo."
01:08:04,720;01:08:05,760;"I don't remember Marion Butts."
01:08:05,760;01:08:07,160;"He's not up checked."
01:08:07,160;01:08:08,600;"I don't remember Terry Allen."
01:08:08,600;01:08:10,600;"I remember Terry Allen briefly."
01:08:10,600;01:08:11,960;"Did Jonas Gray ever get back to?"
01:08:11,960;01:08:13,920;"Nitron means so."
01:08:13,920;01:08:14,640;"It expired."
01:08:14,640;01:08:16,120;"You get five days and if they don't,"
01:08:16,120;01:08:17,020;"You get your money back."
01:08:17,020;01:08:18,220;"What?"
01:08:18,220;01:08:19,220;"You got to fight."
01:08:19,220;01:08:19,520;"Yeah."
01:08:19,520;01:08:20,520;"What are you doing nowadays?"
01:08:20,520;01:08:22,520;"I was trying out for the XFL believe it or not."
01:08:22,520;01:08:24,120;"I got a list of other guys."
01:08:24,120;01:08:25,720;"All right."
01:08:25,720;01:08:26,220;"All right."
01:08:26,220;01:08:28,520;"Who else we got who can potentially do our intro?"
01:08:28,520;01:08:29,120;"Where they go."
01:08:29,120;01:08:32,120;"My top list, Marshall new house."
01:08:32,120;01:08:34,120;"Oh, big."
01:08:34,120;01:08:35,920;"Yeah, I'm in on that Dominic easily."
01:08:35,920;01:08:37,920;"Mmm."
01:08:37,920;01:08:38,220;"Less."
01:08:38,220;01:08:38,720;"So."
01:08:38,720;01:08:39,620;"I don't know."
01:08:39,620;01:08:40,720;"I guys know terrible."
01:08:40,720;01:08:41,220;"Yeah."
01:08:41,220;01:08:42,620;"Well, he's just a nobody."
01:08:42,620;01:08:42,920;"Yeah."
01:08:42,920;01:08:43,620;"Joe's great."
01:08:43,620;01:08:44,520;"I'm not sure listening."
01:08:44,520;01:08:44,920;"Then I'll."
01:08:44,920;01:08:45,820;"Marshall new house."
01:08:45,820;01:08:47,520;"I'm a big new house guy."
01:08:47,520;01:08:50,180;"Because he's beloved because he was putting a tough spot."
01:08:50,180;01:08:51,020;"- Man."
01:08:51,020;01:08:51,860;"- He's not good."
01:08:51,860;01:08:53,180;"- I don't know if he's bad."
01:08:53,180;01:08:54,820;"- It's pretty fitting for--"
01:08:54,820;01:08:55,660;"- But he's not hated."
01:08:55,660;01:08:56,500;"- It feels right."
01:08:56,500;01:08:57,340;"- He's not hated."
01:08:57,340;01:08:59,020;"- Like Flash, like that's about it."
01:08:59,020;01:08:59,940;"- Exactly."
01:08:59,940;01:09:02,940;"What about Ross then Trown?"
01:09:02,940;01:09:05,580;"- Dude, that guy, I went a little like Jonas Christ,"
01:09:05,580;01:09:07,300;"deep dive man."
01:09:07,300;01:09:11,340;"And that dude, like, knowledge I ruined his life."
01:09:11,340;01:09:13,580;"(laughing)"
01:09:13,580;01:09:14,460;"- That was great."
01:09:14,460;01:09:15,300;"- Really?"
01:09:15,300;01:09:18,340;"- Yeah, I guess like, yeah, that huge game"
01:09:18,340;01:09:19,420;"was a 200 yard,"
01:09:19,420;01:09:20,780;"two hundred yards, four touchdowns, and the Colts."
01:09:20,780;01:09:21,780;"- 201 baby."
01:09:21,780;01:09:22,620;"- Oh, 201."
01:09:22,620;01:09:23,620;"- 'Cause he does it in his thing,"
01:09:23,620;01:09:25,420;"he says it's a 201 club."
01:09:25,420;01:09:27,740;"- And so, I guess what happened is like,"
01:09:27,740;01:09:29,940;"he set his alarm on his phone, the phone died,"
01:09:29,940;01:09:32,580;"and he went to practice late or whatever."
01:09:32,580;01:09:34,700;"So, he was in the ball check dog house,"
01:09:34,700;01:09:35,940;"and then he tweeted,"
01:09:35,940;01:09:37,460;"it's kind of like one of the first tweaks"
01:09:37,460;01:09:39,380;"that was really, really hard to remember this, yeah."
01:09:39,380;01:09:41,300;"- It was like they turned your back on you"
01:09:41,300;01:09:42,620;"so quickly or something like that,"
01:09:42,620;01:09:44,740;"and then basically, yeah."
01:09:44,740;01:09:46,340;"I mean, he was never allowed to play again."
01:09:46,340;01:09:48,740;"Like it said like a couple of like, you know,"
01:09:48,740;01:09:50,020;"carries here or there."
01:09:50,020;01:09:51,180;"He was actually on the Patriots,"
01:09:51,180;01:09:53,060;"I think for the next season as well,"
01:09:53,060;01:09:54,500;"they basically just like, they're like,"
01:09:54,500;01:09:55,980;"now you're not gonna play and then they shipped them out."
01:09:55,980;01:09:58,380;"I think to like the Dolphins or something like that."
01:09:58,380;01:09:59,220;"- Yeah."
01:09:59,220;01:10:00,260;"- I mean, he was like trying to get him to the XF."
01:10:00,260;01:10:01,780;"Fell in and he like, you know,"
01:10:01,780;01:10:02,700;"you didn't get picked up."
01:10:02,700;01:10:03,860;"I'm like, I feel bad for the guy."
01:10:03,860;01:10:04,700;"Cause I just like."
01:10:04,700;01:10:07,020;"- That's not, that's not Belichick ruining his life though."
01:10:07,020;01:10:08,420;"- And now he's doing Cammie."
01:10:08,420;01:10:09,260;"- Cammie."
01:10:09,260;01:10:10,100;"- Yeah."
01:10:10,100;01:10:12,220;"- Like I just, I gotta think, obviously like,"
01:10:12,220;01:10:14,220;"You know, I took all your products off some other things in practice or whatever."
01:10:14,220;01:10:20,180;"But sure, if like his alarm went off or whatever the case may be, if I, you"
01:10:20,180;01:10:22,460;"buying that, I don't know."
01:10:22,460;01:10:24,020;"No, no, I've said that to coach."
01:10:24,020;01:10:25,660;"Oh, really?"
01:10:25,660;01:10:25,980;"Yeah."
01:10:25,980;01:10:26,500;"Okay."
01:10:26,500;01:10:28,620;"Well, then I'm ready to track."
01:10:28,620;01:10:29,460;"Would you say to a coach?"
01:10:29,460;01:10:32,820;"I, yeah, it's okay for face value."
01:10:32,820;01:10:35,220;"I got drunk and I slept through the alarm."
01:10:35,220;01:10:36,460;"Missed the bus to Buck now."
01:10:36,460;01:10:39,700;"All right."
01:10:39,700;01:10:41,660;"- I was in for you guys, huge game."
01:10:41,660;01:10:43,300;"Maybe you were celebrating, I had no idea."
01:10:43,300;01:10:44,700;"I know I did."
01:10:44,700;01:10:46,980;"- What'd you like miss your car keys or something Greg?"
01:10:46,980;01:10:49,500;"- No, I just, you know, the whole team."
01:10:49,500;01:10:51,300;"- Yeah, you don't even have cackies."
01:10:51,300;01:10:52,140;"You only got jeans."
01:10:52,140;01:10:54,060;"- You only got to get it and I wasn't there."
01:10:54,060;01:10:56,540;"And then shout out to my coach."
01:10:56,540;01:10:58,700;"You didn't realize it's still halfway to New York."
01:10:58,700;01:11:00,460;"(laughing)"
01:11:00,460;01:11:02,780;"You only figured out when I called him."
01:11:02,780;01:11:04,540;"He's like, oh, you're not on the bus."
01:11:04,540;01:11:08,940;"- So you boys haven't been here for this,"
01:11:08,940;01:11:13,300;"But when it's been me and Mike, he's had a segment."
01:11:13,300;01:11:14,900;"But I think he wants to introduce here."
01:11:14,900;01:11:16,300;"- Well, to the rest of you."
01:11:16,300;01:11:18,700;"- I mean, basically what I found in doing this"
01:11:18,700;01:11:20,580;"is that I didn't know as much about football"
01:11:20,580;01:11:21,540;"as I thought I did."
01:11:21,540;01:11:24,300;"And sometimes the announcer say some terms or some things"
01:11:24,300;01:11:26,740;"that I have trouble understanding"
01:11:26,740;01:11:28,220;"if it's football or not football."
01:11:28,220;01:11:31,380;"And so I sort of bring to Andy, it's been,"
01:11:31,380;01:11:33,460;"'cause he knows more about football than I do."
01:11:33,460;01:11:35,500;"And so, you know, he can explain to me"
01:11:35,500;01:11:36,860;"is it football or not football."
01:11:36,860;01:11:39,860;"So maybe you guys can help with this like last week."
01:11:39,860;01:11:43,220;"I thought that I was kind of like learning about these terms"
01:11:43,220;01:11:45,460;"or whatever because nothing popped up and we kind of discussed it."
01:11:45,460;01:11:47,260;"And I was like, no, dude, I think I got this."
01:11:47,260;01:11:49,380;"But throw me for a loop again."
01:11:49,380;01:11:52,700;"Should we Epic should bring mom in for this one?"
01:11:52,700;01:11:53,460;"She'll talk to you."
01:11:53,460;01:11:53,740;"Yeah."
01:11:53,740;01:11:54,100;"Nope."
01:11:54,100;01:11:55,100;"Nope."
01:11:55,100;01:11:57,380;"Yeah, let's see what you guys think."
01:11:57,380;01:11:59,220;"And then we'll, uh, we'll address this."
01:11:59,220;01:12:03,820;"I mean, so these guys were saying, um, there's a few that I can rattle off here."
01:12:03,820;01:12:06,820;"Um, so Ambrose said, and then this is what they were"
01:12:06,820;01:12:14,460;"quoting them as, ""I like things a little tighter. Ray likes it a little looser."" Is that football"
01:12:14,460;01:12:17,100;"or not football? Who said that?"
01:12:17,100;01:12:22,100;"-I remember us going back. -And who's he talking about? Ray."
01:12:22,100;01:12:25,460;"-Ray is probably Ray. -He's but... Oh."
01:12:25,460;01:12:27,180;"-Yeah. -Where he likes it."
01:12:27,180;01:12:30,780;"-It's not his boyfriend. -But then Ray likes it. Oh, what? What was that?"
01:12:30,780;01:12:33,940;"-No, go ahead. Go ahead, finish. -Yeah."
01:12:33,940;01:12:37,460;"All right, so yeah, so he likes it a little tighter and relax a little looser and I'm not"
01:12:37,460;01:12:38,460;"that much."
01:12:38,460;01:12:41,260;"Well, I mean, let's ask the Jerry Sandusky expert."
01:12:41,260;01:12:46,100;"I think it has to do with coverage would be my guess."
01:12:46,100;01:12:49,620;"Well, I'll hit you with another similar analogy."
01:12:49,620;01:12:52,140;"Different strokes for different folks."
01:12:52,140;01:12:53,140;"Okay."
01:12:53,140;01:12:54,140;"Okay, yeah."
01:12:54,140;01:12:55,540;"But is that football or not football?"
01:12:55,540;01:12:56,540;"I don't know."
01:12:56,540;01:12:57,540;"You tell me."
01:12:57,540;01:13:01,060;"I mean, it could be both, but when he's talking, he's probably talking about like where Ray"
01:13:01,060;01:13:04,300;"gets right up on the receiver and like runs with them."
01:13:04,300;01:13:06,580;"Oh, well, the other guy gives him a little cushion."
01:13:06,580;01:13:07,820;"He likes to get physical."
01:13:07,820;01:13:10,260;"So it's tighter coverage versus loser coverage."
01:13:10,260;01:13:12,380;"We're playing off of the line as opposed to on the line."
01:13:12,380;01:13:13,100;"OK, yeah."
01:13:13,100;01:13:15,740;"So if he gets physical like the man and a little bit."
01:13:15,740;01:13:16,380;"Gotcha."
01:13:16,380;01:13:17,580;"Yeah, the other guy likes to kind of see"
01:13:17,580;01:13:18,820;"where what things are happening."
01:13:18,820;01:13:22,260;"Yeah, let the other person be dominant and dictate the loss."
01:13:22,260;01:13:24,300;"And on my face, sorry."
01:13:24,300;01:13:30,500;"Next one, when you're a hot quarterback, things happen to you."
01:13:30,500;01:13:37,300;"He's talking about Brady and this is like really on on him a little bit when you're a hot quarterback thing that's happened"
01:13:37,300;01:13:44,620;"So you think to you are having for you see cuz you had written it as happened for you and maybe I'm just that's it"
01:13:44,620;01:13:49,500;"Yeah, I heard happened to you. I mean you could be right. I don't know maybe it's happened for you"
01:13:49,500;01:13:54,100;"I mean it changes it right. Yeah, and that's what I was wondering what are they talking about?"
01:13:54,100;01:13:58,180;"You're a hot quarterback. Yeah, I think the message is still the same"
01:13:58,180;01:14:00,540;"I mean, I think in that same little silhouette,"
01:14:00,540;01:14:01,380;"they were talking about this,"
01:14:01,380;01:14:03,820;"if you have like Dan Marino and Dan Bouncer,"
01:14:03,820;01:14:05,980;"whoever, crap quarterbacks that were on the bench,"
01:14:05,980;01:14:07,060;"you're starting the hot hands."
01:14:07,060;01:14:08,940;"- No, sir, no, sir, that was another part,"
01:14:08,940;01:14:10,740;"but I know you've got to talk about it."
01:14:10,740;01:14:12,820;"Where you guys, if Johnny United's John L. Wade"
01:14:12,820;01:14:15,100;"and all five Backstreet Boys were on the bench,"
01:14:15,100;01:14:17,700;"you go with the hot hands, which again,"
01:14:17,700;01:14:18,900;"that could play on that."
01:14:18,900;01:14:19,740;"I don't know what he's talking about."
01:14:19,740;01:14:20,820;"Hot hands is it like--"
01:14:20,820;01:14:21,900;"- Like basketball tournament,"
01:14:21,900;01:14:22,740;"like the guy who's--"
01:14:22,740;01:14:23,580;"- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
01:14:23,580;01:14:24,900;"- Why is he talking about the Backstreet Boys?"
01:14:24,900;01:14:25,900;"- I was like, hey, yeah,"
01:14:25,900;01:14:26,740;"I was the one."
01:14:26,740;01:14:27,580;"- Backstreet Boys, too."
01:14:27,580;01:14:30,780;"Little lotta but think about the think about the term"
01:14:30,780;01:14:33,900;"2001 backstreet boys"
01:14:33,900;01:14:35,940;"They're they're hot"
01:14:35,940;01:14:42,620;"History boys what is happening here? They're hot in the streets. I mean must be that he's attractive right cuz I mean that's a backstreet boy"
01:14:42,620;01:14:48,240;"I don't get a bit. I'm really no ugly shit. These are handwritten notes, but he has bolded hot hand"
01:14:53,420;01:14:57,060;"I don't think talking about football. It was I don't think so and now and I would say no"
01:14:57,060;01:15:00,640;"We usually we get to yes, it's football, but I think in this case no"
01:15:00,640;01:15:04,460;"Yeah, I think they're just talking about the Tom Brady so beautiful that when he's right"
01:15:04,460;01:15:09,900;"I disagree because damn rain is ugly. I saw him in a sittura. He was not"
01:15:09,900;01:15:17,740;"This is Johnny United and John Alway both studs studs John Elway literally in the backstreet boys aren't studs"
01:15:18,900;01:15:20,900;"I too, that's what I'm saying. I don't know what the court was."
01:15:20,900;01:15:22,900;"- Those are the boy band music scene at the time."
01:15:22,900;01:15:24,900;"- So I mean, they're talking about something else."
01:15:24,900;01:15:26,900;"- Yeah, I think so. I think that might be slightly sexual,"
01:15:26,900;01:15:27,900;"which is weird."
01:15:27,900;01:15:30,900;"- So they're ahead of their time because Brady,"
01:15:30,900;01:15:32,900;"this is like free haircut."
01:15:32,900;01:15:35,900;"- I true. Yeah. With the bowl cut. Yeah."
01:15:35,900;01:15:37,900;"- Yeah. All right. All right. Not football."
01:15:37,900;01:15:40,900;"- But do you think he was hot back then?"
01:15:40,900;01:15:41,900;"- That's what I'm saying."
01:15:41,900;01:15:43,900;"- I think he was like a fine wine."
01:15:43,900;01:15:45,900;"- Was he, was he hot?"
01:15:45,900;01:15:47,900;"- I mean, obviously he's hot now. Her brain knows that."
01:15:47,900;01:15:49,340;"- Was he hot then?"
01:15:49,340;01:15:52,820;"- He had the butch in which I find attractive."
01:15:52,820;01:15:54,940;"- He did, but he was also,"
01:15:54,940;01:15:57,220;"didn't he run like a five five or something?"
01:15:57,220;01:15:58,060;"Like 40?"
01:15:58,060;01:15:59,700;"- I thought he was cute."
01:15:59,700;01:16:00,780;"Now he saw it."
01:16:00,780;01:16:01,620;"- Yeah, okay, yeah."
01:16:01,620;01:16:03,860;"- Okay, he can't view him through the 2001 lens"
01:16:03,860;01:16:06,100;"without viewing him through the 2019 lens."
01:16:06,100;01:16:06,940;"- That's also a good point."
01:16:06,940;01:16:07,780;"- Fair, that's a good point."
01:16:07,780;01:16:09,260;"- Yeah, so yeah."
01:16:09,260;01:16:11,260;"- Yeah, he suffers from getting better."
01:16:11,260;01:16:14,940;"- So then I have another one doubling back on the soft hands"
01:16:14,940;01:16:16,900;"'cause that one's double underlined right here."
01:16:16,900;01:16:23,080;"Oh, he says he goes boy, okay, I can put my hands in order to pull in a ball that goes that fast"
01:16:23,080;01:16:29,100;"Does that mean who's it do you know who that was about?"
01:16:29,100;01:16:41,220;"Welcome to segment I just I don't get it. It's like a transcript of the game's control F hot"
01:16:41,220;01:16:43,220;"I"
01:16:43,220;01:16:53,340;"Know so so do we know who this is about I think it's like a larger gentleman"
01:16:53,340;01:16:58,220;"No, I think it might have been I again you've told me to like put context into these things are like"
01:16:58,220;01:17:02,900;"That's fine. Yeah, it's a big soft hands date right boy, and it goes boy"
01:17:02,900;01:17:10,740;"Big soft hand I mean"
01:17:10,740;01:17:15,740;"I think that's the yeah, that's kind of tight end thing."
01:17:15,740;01:17:17,860;"Yeah, 'cause tight ends aren't really no of that."
01:17:17,860;01:17:19,980;"So if it happens like with algae,"
01:17:19,980;01:17:22,700;"carmpler running a four nine,"
01:17:22,700;01:17:24,780;"it's one of those things where it's unusual for him"
01:17:24,780;01:17:28,180;"to have big soft like supple hands"
01:17:28,180;01:17:30,980;"as opposed to the big gnarly lineman hand."
01:17:30,980;01:17:32,300;"Who sold me on that, that makes sense."
01:17:32,300;01:17:34,580;"So big soft hands, future means."
01:17:34,580;01:17:36,780;"You can catch it in the catch your footballs."
01:17:36,780;01:17:38,140;"I think is what they missed out on."
01:17:38,140;01:17:40,660;"So this one I did write context was about Marie Smith."
01:17:40,660;01:17:44,360;"He's a big back, not as strong and bruising."
01:17:44,360;01:17:47,320;"He's a little faster hitting the hole."
01:17:47,320;01:17:50,800;"So he's a back, not as strong and bruising,"
01:17:50,800;01:17:52,960;"which I think I get what that means."
01:17:52,960;01:17:55,240;"And he's a little faster hitting the hole."
01:17:55,240;01:17:57,400;"From all on out football."
01:17:57,400;01:17:58,440;"- So he's a twink."
01:17:58,440;01:18:02,000;"- Yeah, yeah, well, geez."
01:18:02,000;01:18:02,920;"You caught me off guard there."
01:18:02,920;01:18:03,840;"I don't know about that."
01:18:03,840;01:18:05,760;"- I think when they're talking about hole"
01:18:05,760;01:18:10,440;"and to talk about another one of my keyword control F,"
01:18:10,440;01:18:12,440;"(laughing)"
01:18:12,440;01:18:13,280;"- Twink."
01:18:13,280;01:18:20,000;"I want to make the point that I think Mori Smith is actually"
01:18:20,000;01:18:21,840;"Antoine Smith, he just changed jerseys."
01:18:21,840;01:18:26,000;"First of all, so I think the same people, same person."
01:18:26,000;01:18:26,840;"Yeah, same person."
01:18:26,840;01:18:28,920;"- I run the same way, I didn't watch so."
01:18:28,920;01:18:30,640;"- I had no idea who Mori Smith was."
01:18:30,640;01:18:32,360;"He's Antoine Smith, he just changed his name"
01:18:32,360;01:18:34,040;"and swapped jerseys at half time."
01:18:34,040;01:18:35,560;"- Yeah, well Antoine Smith had like that big"
01:18:35,560;01:18:37,400;"brit rate strip, so that would have been annoying"
01:18:37,400;01:18:39,400;"to keep on and off all the time."
01:18:39,400;01:18:41,640;"I mean, he makes football money."
01:18:41,640;01:18:43,400;"I like he goes through piles of them."
01:18:43,400;01:18:47,840;"But talking about, I think we've touched on this a bit before was."
01:18:47,840;01:18:49,840;"Right. We've mentioned gaping holes before."
01:18:49,840;01:18:50,880;"We have to do it."
01:18:50,880;01:18:51,880;"We have to do it."
01:18:51,880;01:18:52,560;"It's similar."
01:18:52,560;01:18:55,120;"I think it's, we're talking about hitting a hole."
01:18:55,120;01:18:55,560;"Right."
01:18:55,560;01:19:00,840;"That's how fast a running back gets into the hole, like that, that hole that the lineman"
01:19:00,840;01:19:01,160;"created."
01:19:01,160;01:19:01,800;"Hand off."
01:19:01,800;01:19:06,880;"And we talking all the way all the way into the hole or like how quickly he enters the hole."
01:19:06,880;01:19:08,720;"Usually how quickly he enters the hole."
01:19:08,720;01:19:09,220;"Okay."
01:19:09,220;01:19:09,720;"Yeah."
01:19:09,720;01:19:13,220;"Between getting the hand off and getting to the offensive lineman."
01:19:13,220;01:19:13,680;"Yes."
01:19:13,680;01:19:17,480;"See, the whole created in the defensive line by the offensive lineman."
01:19:17,480;01:19:18,320;"Oh, okay."
01:19:18,320;01:19:18,820;"Yeah."
01:19:18,820;01:19:18,820;"Yeah."
01:19:18,820;01:19:26,360;"I think I got it."
01:19:26,360;01:19:26,860;"Okay."
01:19:26,860;01:19:31,440;"So then that like leads into the next one where it's, um, he hits the whole"
01:19:31,440;01:19:37,440;"hard and direct vendors in, which, which, oh, I'm trying to be serious."
01:19:37,440;01:19:38,280;"- This is the whole thing, guys."
01:19:38,280;01:19:39,100;"- It's cheating."
01:19:39,100;01:19:42,560;"- How now that you're doing something that means"
01:19:42,560;01:19:44,120;"I get that this is football,"
01:19:44,120;01:19:45,760;"so I feel stupid to just bring it up."
01:19:45,760;01:19:46,600;"- Yeah."
01:19:46,600;01:19:47,440;"- So moving on."
01:19:47,440;01:19:50,040;"- So, dare I ask him, what did you think that meant?"
01:19:50,040;01:19:50,880;"- No."
01:19:50,880;01:19:51,720;"(laughing)"
01:19:51,720;01:19:53,520;"- I was saying to the other one."
01:19:53,520;01:19:56,000;"- How exactly would you drag defenders into other holes?"
01:19:56,000;01:19:58,680;"- I just, I don't know what you're talking about."
01:19:58,680;01:20:00,640;"- That sounds like a Jerry Sandusky thing right there."
01:20:00,640;01:20:01,480;"- Yeah, yeah."
01:20:01,480;01:20:03,440;"- I know what you're about football, guys."
01:20:04,440;01:20:07,220;"And then the last remaining two."
01:20:07,220;01:20:09,060;"So,"
01:20:09,060;01:20:10,500;"- I'm gonna stick to these."
01:20:10,500;01:20:11,340;"- Oh, not you."
01:20:11,340;01:20:13,860;"- Oh, man."
01:20:13,860;01:20:15,020;"The three say here."
01:20:15,020;01:20:16,080;"- Okay."
01:20:16,080;01:20:16,920;"- Deep breath."
01:20:16,920;01:20:19,540;"- All right, we have a lot of excitement down there."
01:20:19,540;01:20:21,860;"And this was about like thick."
01:20:21,860;01:20:23,620;"(laughing)"
01:20:23,620;01:20:24,780;"- I was wondering."
01:20:24,780;01:20:25,700;"- Not football."
01:20:25,700;01:20:28,060;"- I was not talking about football."
01:20:28,060;01:20:30,380;"I was wondering if we were talking about Ron Mexico."
01:20:30,380;01:20:32,640;"(laughing)"
01:20:32,640;01:20:57,640;"a lot of the same and then when he came to the game got to get to the show was Michael Victor's had an erection or a lot of the same and then that's not what I was thinking but that's what it could be and I didn't did you not see Michael Victor reaction now is this."
01:20:57,640;01:20:59,800;"Oh, he was a blaiting the obvious."
01:20:59,800;01:21:03,640;"And when he's stiff armed, the guy was a stiff man."
01:21:03,640;01:21:04,640;"Jeez."
01:21:04,640;01:21:05,640;"It was stiff."
01:21:05,640;01:21:07,640;"I'm glad I brought this to you guys."
01:21:07,640;01:21:09,520;"It's a lot better."
01:21:09,520;01:21:10,520;"So am I."
01:21:10,520;01:21:16,280;"He says, which this is what we have off guard, then I looked into some other stuff."
01:21:16,280;01:21:19,880;"So, eight different receivers Brady has hooked up with today."
01:21:19,880;01:21:22,200;"I was like, oh, shit, that's a lot."
01:21:22,200;01:21:24,240;"What does he mean by that?"
01:21:24,240;01:21:27,000;"And then I figured, like, OK, how many receptions or whatever?"
01:21:27,000;01:21:29,580;"I consider right, right, but then I was like wait a minute like at first"
01:21:29,580;01:21:34,260;"I was like thinking whoa if you hooked up with like not many people like was he dating anybody at the time or whatever?"
01:21:34,260;01:21:36,820;"I don't know and so I mean you're still wasn't"
01:21:36,820;01:21:42,860;"Doing oh my gosh"
01:21:42,860;01:21:50,860;"I mean, would you not be able to make you feel like I am talking to you. I just come to serve as a factor, Brady doesn't get a crap while me."
01:21:50,860;01:21:51,860;"You're touching."
01:21:51,860;01:21:56,860;"Maybe follow letters. They went unanswered. Did they? All those letters you wrote them? They went unanswered?"
01:21:56,860;01:22:01,860;"If you did write a few but it kind of didn't seem like it was Hannah, right? I don't know."
01:22:01,860;01:22:06,860;"Four of us seats in consistency. Yeah. Well, that one was..."
01:22:06,860;01:22:07,860;"[laughter]"
01:22:07,860;01:22:09,900;"- I never broke back."
01:22:09,900;01:22:13,160;"- Fun fact Brady was dating in 2001."
01:22:13,160;01:22:18,440;"- Layla Roberts, 1997 Playmate of the Year."
01:22:18,440;01:22:19,280;"- Oh."
01:22:19,280;01:22:21,680;"- Yeah, it says after the Super Bowl though."
01:22:21,680;01:22:23,520;"So I don't know when that relationship started."
01:22:23,520;01:22:24,360;"- Maybe not."
01:22:24,360;01:22:27,120;"- Yeah, Layla Roberts, 1997 Playmate of the Year."
01:22:27,120;01:22:28,760;"- That's that land of game, I doubt it though."
01:22:28,760;01:22:31,880;"- Well, yeah, I don't know about like, at the game though."
01:22:31,880;01:22:35,160;"I know this is around the time you're hanging out with Trump"
01:22:35,160;01:22:36,520;"and doing that like whole stuff."
01:22:36,520;01:22:42,960;"Was it? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I think so. So and then in 2002 so that release depended he started eating taurid"
01:22:42,960;01:22:44,960;"Which I think we all know about"
01:22:44,960;01:22:49,860;"But at that point she had done American pie she did a little bow ski. Yeah, she's big name"
01:22:49,860;01:22:55,640;"Yeah, so then he broke up with her and I was wondering I just watched Sharknados 6 and"
01:22:55,640;01:22:58,200;"She's in a just big player"
01:22:58,200;01:23:01,960;"I'm just wondering if you regress that and if he likes the movies so"
01:23:01,960;01:23:05,520;"- If we have them on, that'll be the question we have."
01:23:05,520;01:23:06,360;"- You came here."
01:23:06,360;01:23:07,680;"- Sharknado 6."
01:23:07,680;01:23:09,760;"(laughing)"
01:23:09,760;01:23:11,040;"- Drew, as you're asking, we've done,"
01:23:11,040;01:23:12,000;"that's a great question."
01:23:12,000;01:23:14,440;"- So Tom, now that we finally got you on this podcast,"
01:23:14,440;01:23:18,240;"after 10 years, we need to ask you the question"
01:23:18,240;01:23:20,880;"that everybody wants to answer to."
01:23:20,880;01:23:23,720;"Have you seen Sharknado 6 and what did you think of it?"
01:23:23,720;01:23:25,920;"- And there's probably Sharknado 7 by this point too."
01:23:25,920;01:23:27,760;"- Dude, there's a lot of people here."
01:23:27,760;01:23:29,840;"- There's rumors that has not happened yet."
01:23:29,840;01:23:30,840;"- By the time we get there,"
01:23:30,840;01:23:32,100;"- It'll be Sharknado 12."
01:23:32,100;01:23:33,420;"- Fingers crossed."
01:23:33,420;01:23:35,620;"- Dude, Tarrarid's like, I mean, spoiler alert,"
01:23:35,620;01:23:37,020;"but you guys should have watched it by now."
01:23:37,020;01:23:39,580;"I mean, Rid is like a cyborg by the sixth one,"
01:23:39,580;01:23:41,020;"so it's just true."
01:23:41,020;01:23:41,860;"- Really?"
01:23:41,860;01:23:42,700;"- Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:23:42,700;01:23:43,540;"- Have you actually watched it?"
01:23:43,540;01:23:44,380;"- It's fantastic."
01:23:44,380;01:23:45,220;"- It's nicely done."
01:23:45,220;01:23:46,060;"I've seen one in two."
01:23:46,060;01:23:46,900;"- Yeah."
01:23:46,900;01:23:47,740;"- That's not the first one."
01:23:47,740;01:23:48,580;"- Amazing."
01:23:48,580;01:23:49,420;"- It's something."
01:23:49,420;01:23:50,420;"- So we're just plugging other podcasts,"
01:23:50,420;01:23:51,260;"other movies."
01:23:51,260;01:23:52,460;"- Sharknado, yeah."
01:23:52,460;01:23:56,020;"We're showing that we're well-rounded people, right?"
01:23:56,020;01:24:03,100;"But then, so well documented split 2004 to 2006, Bridget Boyne again,"
01:24:03,100;01:24:05,860;"Coyote Ugly, all that other stuff."
01:24:05,860;01:24:08,860;"I had a kid with her at, it was a little, whatever."
01:24:08,860;01:24:12,300;"Didn't she name him his initial or jet?"
01:24:12,300;01:24:14,580;"Was it? No."
01:24:14,580;01:24:15,980;"Well, I thought it was Tom Brady."
01:24:15,980;01:24:17,700;"No."
01:24:17,700;01:24:23,020;"Yeah, their kid is like, no, Jason Edward Thomas."
01:24:23,020;01:24:24,060;"Get out of here."
01:24:24,060;01:24:27,460;"something more easier. What a dig. I didn't know this is a hot"
01:24:27,460;01:24:32,220;"take. Like Tom Brady, named his first chapter himself who gets"
01:24:32,220;01:24:35,220;"an aiming rights. Probably Brigitte, I think. Yeah, I don't"
01:24:35,220;01:24:39,660;"know. I keep going. Well, so can I add some serious work?"
01:24:39,660;01:24:44,840;"I'm like, yeah, I just looked her up for research. John Edward"
01:24:44,840;01:24:50,140;"Thomas Moynihan jet. Wow, that's a dig I've ever heard one."
01:24:50,220;01:24:51,980;"- Yeah, I bet, Jeddim."
01:24:51,980;01:24:53,940;"During that time, when he dated her,"
01:24:53,940;01:24:55,820;"also linked to Vin Diesel."
01:24:55,820;01:24:56,820;"- Get out of here."
01:24:56,820;01:24:58,460;"- Who was Tom Brady?"
01:24:58,460;01:24:59,300;"- Leila."
01:24:59,300;01:25:00,140;"- Tom Brady."
01:25:00,140;01:25:00,980;"(laughing)"
01:25:00,980;01:25:01,820;"- I was talking about Tom Brady,"
01:25:01,820;01:25:03,220;"what are you talking about?"
01:25:03,220;01:25:05,140;"- This is some New York problems."
01:25:05,140;01:25:07,300;"- This has got straight on opposite ends of the spectrum,"
01:25:07,300;01:25:08,140;"though."
01:25:08,140;01:25:10,020;"- And Diesel Tom Brady."
01:25:10,020;01:25:13,820;"- And then for a brief stint before Jazelle,"
01:25:13,820;01:25:18,060;"he apparently allegedly dated a Patriots cheerleader"
01:25:18,060;01:25:19,580;"who ended up,"
01:25:19,580;01:25:22,660;"She's married to him, but I think she's still with him Lonnie Paxton"
01:25:22,660;01:25:26,020;"Really tying it back to your boy"
01:25:26,020;01:25:28,700;"My boy Lonnie so"
01:25:28,700;01:25:35,020;"If we're gonna tie this on not Kevin Eucos is married to Tom Brady sister he is yeah"
01:25:35,020;01:25:40,220;"So I don't know if that's informative to anybody out there anybody cares, but here we are"
01:25:40,220;01:25:43,500;"All right and coincidence"
01:25:46,700;01:25:48,700;"We're gonna have to cut it out at this point. Yeah"
01:25:48,700;01:25:51,820;"No"
01:25:51,820;01:25:56,140;"Yeah"
01:25:56,140;01:26:05,260;"And there it is what's the saying it's not to gave it somebody sister mother brother whatever I"
01:26:05,260;01:26:09,980;"Mean we do have found that guy on the podcast that I know that did have"
01:26:09,980;01:26:12,820;"Relationship with somebody who did"
01:26:13,500;01:26:17,900;"Spent some time with Tom Brady on the same website. I can't knock him from her tonight"
01:26:17,900;01:26:23,580;"Nice. All right. Wow. Wow. Let's do best and worse"
01:26:23,580;01:26:27,260;"Steven"
01:26:27,260;01:26:28,940;"Best"
01:26:28,940;01:26:31,980;"Richard Seymour's first career sack. Oh"
01:26:31,980;01:26:34,780;"He bought he dad fucking"
01:26:34,780;01:26:40,780;"And first of many yeah first wrong pick took him week eight to get his first sack"
01:26:41,500;01:26:45,560;"And there's a brutal one and he's gonna have like how many more pages?"
01:26:45,560;01:26:48,700;"100 more"
01:26:48,700;01:26:55,660;"Oh, is that maybe yes, I love your style and for the Raiders and the war see more 66 305 pounds"
01:26:55,660;01:27:03,420;"Oh, yeah, but you see the true like, you know where the edge defender was going at that point the new defensive end"
01:27:03,420;01:27:06,060;"a crap for drafting him"
01:27:06,060;01:27:10,380;"Yeah, because he was yeah, it's too tall to be a defensive end but to"
01:27:10,380;01:27:14,820;"big to be outside linebackers and bullshit like he's gonna be a Hall of"
01:27:14,820;01:27:18,740;"Famer he's on the cusp probably eventually yeah hope so"
01:27:18,740;01:27:23,580;"pages off family for sure yeah oh yeah if he's not all right definitely I was"
01:27:23,580;01:27:30,740;"you worse the lawyer Maloy he just let me get out of the way that slant"
01:27:30,740;01:27:34,060;"wrote I don't just like what do you do it with I hear you know you're a"
01:27:34,060;01:27:38,900;"Maloy just does body him and like I think what his thought was like I don't"
01:27:38,900;01:27:41,800;"I don't want to hurt my own player too, but like it's literal."
01:27:41,800;01:27:43,800;"I don't think that's ever occurred to me."
01:27:43,800;01:27:44,800;"I know."
01:27:44,800;01:27:46,800;"I feel it's hard to zone player anyway."
01:27:46,800;01:27:47,800;"Yeah."
01:27:47,800;01:27:52,800;"I had a chance to tackle it 20 yards early and you just literally dodged the whole play."
01:27:52,800;01:27:55,000;"All right, Mr. Mellow."
01:27:55,000;01:27:56,200;"Best and worst."
01:27:56,200;01:27:58,400;"I got to go best."
01:27:58,400;01:27:59,800;"I got to go twofold here."
01:27:59,800;01:28:02,000;"It's a hustle to hustle double."
01:28:02,000;01:28:03,000;"All right."
01:28:03,000;01:28:08,800;"There was a play that was going to go for touchdown that Tyler cuts across the field."
01:28:08,800;01:28:12,560;"field, he runs like 40, 40 yards, I think it was."
01:28:12,560;01:28:15,880;"Yeah, yeah, and saves that touchdown on that play."
01:28:15,880;01:28:18,160;"So I was pretty, pretty great."
01:28:18,160;01:28:20,400;"And then Vinitari also did the same."
01:28:20,400;01:28:22,960;"So they're kind of called back to an earlier episode where you were talking"
01:28:22,960;01:28:24,000;"about his athleticism."
01:28:24,000;01:28:24,320;"Yeah."
01:28:24,320;01:28:28,520;"He pretty much did down the field and like knocked the guy out of bounds"
01:28:28,520;01:28:29,640;"to save another touchdown."
01:28:29,640;01:28:32,920;"So kind of two, two good hustle plays, I thought."
01:28:32,920;01:28:34,120;"I missed that episode."
01:28:34,120;01:28:37,880;"Was that the one where you guys pulled up that hit and running down the Cowboys"
01:28:37,880;01:28:39,640;"Turner. You mean?"
01:28:39,640;01:28:41,720;"Herschel Walker, you mean?"
01:28:41,720;01:28:42,480;"Yes."
01:28:42,480;01:28:42,880;"Yes."
01:28:42,880;01:28:45,320;"Remember I was hating on you."
01:28:45,320;01:28:46,360;"I was like, doesn't know it's true."
01:28:46,360;01:28:46,880;"Yeah."
01:28:46,880;01:28:47,880;"It's true."
01:28:47,880;01:28:49,480;"You I was wrong."
01:28:49,480;01:28:51,560;"Well, fuck is a whole player."
01:28:51,560;01:28:52,520;"Not a kicker."
01:28:52,520;01:28:53,520;"So far."
01:28:53,520;01:28:54,360;"Incredible."
01:28:54,360;01:29:02,280;"You have not seen this just YouTube, Ben, Terry, Herschel Walker."
01:29:02,280;01:29:03,200;"It'll come up."
01:29:03,200;01:29:03,880;"It's amazing."
01:29:03,880;01:29:04,280;"It's the best."
01:29:04,280;01:29:05,600;"I'm never seen anything with it."
01:29:06,520;01:29:11,360;"And I think I'm gonna bypass the worst moment because I didn't really have one"
01:29:11,360;01:29:14,160;"I was I you know for the holiday season"
01:29:14,160;01:29:18,160;"I think like I'll be nice but an honorable mention just not really the worst play"
01:29:18,160;01:29:22,520;"But I thought it was worth noting is that the first time I've seen we pull Bledso"
01:29:22,520;01:29:24,200;"And which I saw in your notes"
01:29:24,200;01:29:27,920;"So you kind of mentioned this sort of play as well in the same fashion is you know"
01:29:27,920;01:29:36,280;"He basically like Brady trucks the ball like no look over his head to try to complete a pass as he's falling down"
01:29:36,280;01:29:42,740;"And it ends up being almost a reception. It was an incompletion which I know Bledsoe would have been a pick six for sure"
01:29:42,740;01:29:45,240;"Oh easy. Yeah"
01:29:45,240;01:29:51,440;"Do anything remotely close to that guy which I mean just being mentored by him a lot at that point so"
01:29:51,440;01:29:54,880;"So he picks up some bad habits. Yeah, just check it over your head knows for the best"
01:29:54,880;01:29:57,960;"Yeah, that was rough"
01:29:57,960;01:30:00,080;"All right, Greg that's some rice"
01:30:00,080;01:30:02,360;"All right, so"
01:30:02,360;01:30:08,160;"My worst I'm gonna kind of go back to that Boston Globe thing we were talking about earlier the spotless snatch"
01:30:08,160;01:30:12,920;"You call Michael Smith all four these are bad"
01:30:12,920;01:30:16,680;"Spotless snatch stainless snare"
01:30:16,680;01:30:23,240;"Pure pluck I mean that's he's a writer gotta do better than that you have to do better than that"
01:30:23,240;01:30:29,320;"There was one of them stainless set worse than spotless sure"
01:30:30,880;01:30:40,760;"for a porn title yes yeah we need you ma'am yeah yeah my worst of the week is"
01:30:40,760;01:30:45,640;"my mom kicking me out of the gosh darn room we'll be five minutes yeah we've"
01:30:45,640;01:30:49,040;"finished already if we weren't for all these interruptions you don't have to"
01:30:49,040;01:30:54,360;"we'll get you later we'll do a real one we're already on hour three all right so"
01:30:54,360;01:31:01,600;"my uh my best um so I have all I have the newspaper clippings from that day that same"
01:31:01,600;01:31:08,840;"day um Arizona rallies in ninth inning to be thrown Yankees Kurt Schilling versus Roger"
01:31:08,840;01:31:18,120;"Clemens in a game seven world series Diamondbacks one oh yeah Louis Gonzalez segment yes"
01:31:18,120;01:31:18,920;"That's a great one."
01:31:18,920;01:31:19,560;"Same exact."
01:31:19,560;01:31:23,200;"Well, the world series gain seven."
01:31:23,200;01:31:23,760;"Same day."
01:31:23,760;01:31:24,360;"Wow."
01:31:24,360;01:31:47,280;"Her shell and"
01:31:47,280;01:31:54,720;"the finish of another right over here. All right. Yeah. Take notes, Michael Smith."
01:31:54,720;01:31:59,600;"Wait, wait, you you clip that a news news article and put that in your book about the Patriots."
01:31:59,600;01:32:04,000;"And you're stuck. Yeah, I think I'm a sustain day. So I was like, I got to throw this in here."
01:32:04,000;01:32:13,760;"Yeah. I mean, how many of you transfer the Patriots first parade? All right, my best and worst. My best,"
01:32:13,760;01:32:23,060;"I think Brady with his first ever third and short QB sneak where they entered the backfield"
01:32:23,060;01:32:25,420;"and had him do the quick QB sneak."
01:32:25,420;01:32:32,440;"First time I ever saw it, first of many that he would always convert, changed the game,"
01:32:32,440;01:32:38,140;"now has a thousand yards rushing one yard at a time, twenty fucking years later, the"
01:32:38,140;01:32:40,780;"thousand yard rush and it started there."
01:32:40,780;01:32:43,220;"- It is his average yard per rush."
01:32:43,220;01:32:47,540;"'Cause he has all the yield downs to negative."
01:32:47,540;01:32:50,020;"- His longest rush is like,"
01:32:50,020;01:32:50,860;"- 18, 19 years."
01:32:50,860;01:32:52,060;"- But his average has gotta be like,"
01:32:52,060;01:32:53,340;"one and a half."
01:32:53,340;01:32:54,180;"- It's not a lot."
01:32:54,180;01:32:59,820;"- Oh, also honorable mention was Terrell Buckley,"
01:32:59,820;01:33:02,380;"a bit wide receiver."
01:33:02,380;01:33:03,220;"- Yes."
01:33:03,220;01:33:06,060;"- And getting a pass to him on the streak play early."
01:33:06,060;01:33:08,500;"- A little weird off and go down."
01:33:08,500;01:33:09,340;"- Just do it, do it more."
01:33:09,340;01:33:12,020;"patience always like a wide receiver playing defensive back when you ever go"
01:33:12,020;01:33:20,140;"through that in the bills game no we threw a pass of JC Jackson right I don't"
01:33:20,140;01:33:23,740;"think I don't think I'm watching different games maybe I was just drunk"
01:33:23,740;01:33:28,900;"yeah I wouldn't be surprised if Gilmore does do something like I'm a playoff"
01:33:28,900;01:33:34,220;"I love to kill my on the on the scout team as wide receiver and like oh yeah"
01:33:34,220;01:33:37,500;"they did say that because you've been playing a lot and I'm pushing through"
01:33:37,500;01:33:38,500;"a ball."
01:33:38,500;01:33:39,500;"What do you read?"
01:33:39,500;01:33:41,500;"I don't think so."
01:33:41,500;01:33:43,500;"I'll double check."
01:33:43,500;01:33:53,500;"So my worst, and this was probably my favorite worst of the worst, the season so far."
01:33:53,500;01:33:57,500;"Yeah, the Jermaine Wiggins, he got a tripping call."
01:33:57,500;01:34:01,700;"I think he was like in the second quarter somewhere."
01:34:01,700;01:34:04,620;"And usually when you see tripping calls, they usually like kind of borderline like a guy"
01:34:04,620;01:34:06,540;"is beating kind of sticks his leg out."
01:34:06,540;01:34:09,820;"Jermaine Wiggins flopped on the ground"
01:34:09,820;01:34:10,940;"and just like the guy who'd be"
01:34:10,940;01:34:13,540;"so he like flailed his legs almost like a dead fish"
01:34:13,540;01:34:16,060;"like flopping and like tried to just kick the guy"
01:34:16,060;01:34:19,140;"in the junk and missed and got called for that on that play."
01:34:19,140;01:34:22,140;"And the next play had a false start like immediately afterwards"
01:34:22,140;01:34:24,060;"that you didn't seem for the rest of the fucking way."
01:34:24,060;01:34:24,900;"- I'm gonna wig."
01:34:24,900;01:34:27,020;"- The guys I'm talking about the commentators"
01:34:27,020;01:34:28,660;"all about the flags coming out."
01:34:28,660;01:34:32,060;"- Yeah, but that was like one of the few legitimate."
01:34:32,060;01:34:32,900;"(laughing)"
01:34:32,900;01:34:34,220;"- So it was."
01:34:34,220;01:34:35,260;"It was so bad."
01:34:35,260;01:34:37,180;"Falcons had like a first 25."
01:34:37,180;01:34:38,220;"It was just brutal."
01:34:38,220;01:34:38,740;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:38,740;01:34:40,260;"Well, it was brutal."
01:34:40,260;01:34:40,460;"Yeah."
01:34:40,460;01:34:44,060;"Some of these sequences were real bad."
01:34:44,060;01:34:44,720;"Oh, yeah."
01:34:44,720;01:34:47,500;"The page picked up 20 yards on a third and 30"
01:34:47,500;01:34:48,700;"to set a field goal at one point."
01:34:48,700;01:34:51,020;"See, kids don't watch these games in the entirety."
01:34:51,020;01:34:52,860;"They're actually not that fun."
01:34:52,860;01:34:53,220;"Yeah."
01:34:53,220;01:34:53,420;"Yeah."
01:34:53,420;01:34:55,420;"If you go to highlights, do it out."
01:34:55,420;01:34:57,260;"Actually, if you go to Paris, I see it in full."
01:34:57,260;01:34:59,220;"I'm not into there."
01:34:59,220;01:34:59,540;"I know."
01:34:59,540;01:35:02,260;"Lucky for us that there are no highlights of each game."
01:35:02,260;01:35:04,140;"I don't think for the most part of the majority"
01:35:04,140;01:35:08,780;"I'm so you need to listen to a website as a mop. No, they're either on the website patrons down to info"
01:35:08,780;01:35:12,140;"Well, big plays all the all the highlights"
01:35:12,140;01:35:20,780;"Well, but they do you gotta get the context cuz just that's true Troy Brown's miracle catch out of nowhere"
01:35:20,780;01:35:23,260;"I mean, oh you mean the spotless snack"
01:35:23,260;01:35:30,700;"That's fair"
01:35:30,700;01:35:32,700;"The queen is clam"
01:35:32,700;01:35:43,500;"All right, I think we beat this voice dead enough well, I got I got one more I got one more surprise all right"
01:35:43,500;01:35:46,780;"You already kind of blew it for me. Oh good"
01:35:46,780;01:35:54,300;"Christmas comes early. Oh, what is happening here?"
01:35:54,300;01:35:59,380;"No"
01:35:59,380;01:36:03,820;"- What are you doing? - I just want to teach you."
01:36:03,820;01:36:05,460;"We all got to teach you."

01:36:15,420;01:36:19,760;"- So I have a bit of issues with licensing."
01:36:19,760;01:36:21,340;"(laughing)"
01:36:21,340;01:36:23,500;"- I originally put one picture of like,"
01:36:23,500;01:36:25,540;"one of those cool ones that you had on the website"

01:36:31,720;01:36:34,560;"I'm gonna find another one from Patriots Twitter."
01:36:34,560;01:36:36,600;"She's like, ""You can't use NFL logos or anything."""
01:36:36,600;01:36:38,160;"I was like, ""She's like, ""I can't use that."""
01:36:38,160;01:36:39,000;"- Who is this?"

01:36:50,440;01:36:52,200;"But no, no, he's the Pope."
01:36:52,200;01:36:56,360;"He's the Pope set up and he's slicing Belichick."
01:36:56,360;01:36:58,600;"And he's like, ""Holding Rosaries."""

01:37:36,040;01:37:37,560;"Is this a Saints game?"
01:37:37,560;01:37:40,360;"Or the Rams when they lose the Rams?"

01:37:49,000;01:37:50,200;"Correct."
01:37:50,200;01:37:53,960;"The one in six bills will visit."
01:37:55,400;01:38:08,320;"Foxborough stadium. You want to sneak peek? No, we don't want to sneak peek. Don't ruin it. Yeah, no, I know it's going fresh. I was trying to give you like one of these cryptic headlines with throughout for you. Yeah, pretty obvious."
01:38:08,320;01:38:14,880;"Oh, how about this? This is a good teaser. Many are taking hits for Johnson decision."
01:38:14,880;01:38:18,280;"Oh, Ron Borges."
01:38:18,600;01:38:21,320;"- Lee Johnson, oh, I don't know if that's really accurate."
01:38:21,320;01:38:22,880;"- We didn't even talk about the punters."
01:38:22,880;01:38:24,720;"Ah, next time."
01:38:24,720;01:38:25,560;"- See, you guys."
01:38:25,560;01:38:29,960;"- I had a note, one last note to end this on a punter note."
01:38:29,960;01:38:31,720;"- Well, I haven't punter notes, well."
01:38:31,720;01:38:34,160;"- This is how it starts."
01:38:34,160;01:38:36,160;"- Chris Moore, Chris Moore the punter."
01:38:36,160;01:38:38,000;"- I hear him."
01:38:38,000;01:38:41,240;"- Aliah Falcons was averaging less than 30 yards a punt"
01:38:41,240;01:38:44,720;"and I wrote, ""Where's Lee Johnson when you need him?"""
01:38:44,720;01:38:48,000;"- I know, I actually wrote that fucking,"
01:38:48,000;01:38:53,000;"- I feel like punters are punting the ball further now."
01:38:53,000;01:38:58,320;"- Oh, they are."
01:38:58,320;01:39:01,640;"- They're like, oh, he's averaging like 40 yards upon."
01:39:01,640;01:39:03,280;"And I was like, well, that sucks."
01:39:03,280;01:39:04,640;"- Did that punter was available?"
01:39:04,640;01:39:05,880;"- And they were like, yeah."
01:39:05,880;01:39:07,200;"- Jay Moore."
01:39:07,200;01:39:08,040;"- Oh, Christmas."
01:39:08,040;01:39:08,880;"- Oh, yeah, right."
01:39:08,880;01:39:09,720;"- Oh man, yeah."
01:39:09,720;01:39:10,560;"- Tom McClure."
01:39:10,560;01:39:11,400;"- So bad."
01:39:11,400;01:39:13,200;"Back in the end, Jay Moore sold that punter."
01:39:13,200;01:39:14,840;"- Yeah."
01:39:14,840;01:39:15,880;"- Scott Chandler."
01:39:15,880;01:39:17,720;"- Scott Chandler."
01:39:17,720;01:39:19,720;"Alright, Merry Christmas guys. Love you."

00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:20,360;"I am not your mother."
00:20,360;00:26,520;"Welcome back to the Danger Stylancy podcast."
00:26,520;00:27,520;"Week 17."
00:27,520;00:29,520;"We're actually keeping track."
00:29,520;00:34,520;"And we are down in North Carolina. We've decided no"
00:34,520;00:39,760;"Shaka Lackey. That's right for Patriots at Panthers last game in the regular season."
00:39,760;00:48,120;"Lot on the line here, at least for the Patriots, not so much for the Panthers, which we'll get into, but before we do, gentlemen, how are you?"
00:48,120;00:50,240;"Doing fantastic."
00:50,240;00:51,640;"Muy bien."

00:54,920;00:56,640;"That's right. Yeah."
00:56,640;00:58,200;"We're down. Go on and raise up."
00:58,200;01:27,940;"take your share it off. That's like about North Carolina, South Carolina. I think you say this for all. Carolina's. That's it. No. No. It's North Carolina. Yeah. Petey. Yeah. Yeah. North Carolinas get get offended if you confuse them because we know North Carolina's do dude. People get pissed off if you call Raleigh Durham one thing. Really?"
01:27,940;01:31,780;"Yeah, and they're like, this is an airport called the Raleigh Durham Airport."
01:31,780;01:34,740;"They consider them two separate cities."
01:34,740;01:36,420;"They are two separate cities."
01:36,420;01:38,060;"You son of a bitch."
01:38,060;01:41,940;"They're literally like right next to you."
01:41,940;01:43,100;"Yeah."
01:43,100;01:46,220;"Well, they're like 15, 20 miles apart."
01:46,220;01:47,220;"Yeah."
01:47,220;01:48,300;"That's true."
01:48,300;01:51,380;"And then those fucking losers over in Chapel Hill."
01:51,380;01:52,900;"Yeah."
01:52,900;01:53,820;"Yeah."
01:53,820;01:54,860;"And now you're living Durham."
01:54,860;01:57,900;"So you are kind of the expert on what to call it."
01:57,900;02:02,900;"That's right. So stat check. What do we call that area?"
02:02,900;02:08,300;"The triangle. The whole area?"
02:08,300;02:11,700;"Yeah. Steve is correct. He's called the triangle."
02:11,700;02:15,000;"All right, great. What are the three points of the triangle?"
02:15,000;02:19,300;"Raleigh, Durham, and who the hell cares? Charlotte."
02:19,300;02:22,500;"Wait, no. No. Chapel Hill."
02:22,500;02:25,000;"There you go, Andy. All right."
02:25,000;02:26,240;"No, they call."
02:26,240;02:28,440;"They call those cities in North Carolina, right?"
02:28,440;02:30,560;"You know, they call where I live."
02:30,560;02:32,600;"That same version of the triangle."
02:32,600;02:33,560;"What?"
02:33,560;02:34,960;"The triad."
02:34,960;02:36,800;"No, the DMV."
02:36,800;02:38,320;"Oof."
02:38,320;02:38,840;"Wait."
02:38,840;02:39,800;"That's not a great nickname."
02:39,800;02:42,120;"Maryland, Virginia, Delaware."
02:42,120;02:43,960;"No."
02:43,960;02:45,600;"No."
02:45,600;02:46,640;"Delaware?"
02:46,640;02:48,240;"D.C.?"
02:48,240;02:50,400;"Yeah, the district, Maryland and Virginia."
02:50,400;02:50,880;"Yeah."
02:50,880;02:52,640;"With the district."
02:52,640;02:54,560;"You know, they call where I live."
02:54,560;02:56,900;"cow Hampshire, London, Derry,"
02:56,900;03:01,840;"Miss Vegas, Mitch, Afghanistan."
03:01,840;03:04,560;"That's probably more accurate."
03:04,560;03:05,560;"These are, yeah."
03:05,560;03:07,100;"We couldn't afford a house in"
03:07,100;03:09,200;"Derry, so they moved this to London,"
03:09,200;03:10,200;"Derry."
03:10,200;03:15,420;"Well, speaking of angry North"
03:15,420;03:17,380;"Carolinas, we actually know one."
03:17,380;03:19,480;"So we thought we'd have him on the"
03:19,480;03:22,480;"podcast to talk about his home team."
03:22,480;03:24,080;"Oh, Bobby."
03:24,080;03:29,080;"It was our brother-in-law Bobby, so enjoy that right now."
03:29,080;03:33,480;"(mimics baby-in-law)"
03:33,480;03:39,360;"- So with us today, we have a special guest."
03:39,360;03:42,640;"It is our, I'd say top three brother-in-law,"
03:42,640;03:44,280;"would you boys agree?"
03:44,280;03:45,180;"- I have two, come on."
03:45,180;03:47,200;"- Top five. (laughs)"
03:47,200;03:48,720;"(laughs)"
03:48,720;03:51,600;"But it is our sister's husband,"
03:51,600;03:53,860;"Ellie's husband, Bobby Bridges."
03:53,860;03:57,700;"And this is the point where Gregory says his name with the"
03:57,700;03:58,380;"whole body."
03:58,380;03:59,140;"There it is."
03:59,140;04:00,380;"What the hell?"
04:00,380;04:08,460;"So my first question that leads into my first question, which is Bob, we, we"
04:08,460;04:12,420;"didn't have a choice to be in the Brown family, but you did and you chose this."
04:12,420;04:13,180;"Why?"
04:13,180;04:18,020;"Well, I regretted every day, but at this point I suck."
04:18,020;04:22,100;"No, you guys are great."
04:22,140;04:25,740;"I mean, obviously I love LA, but the family is a nice icing on the cake."
04:25,740;04:28,080;"I love it."
04:28,080;04:30,380;"Hey, you're, you're the icing on the cake too, Bob."
04:30,380;04:31,620;"Thanks, Greg."
04:31,620;04:32,100;"Yeah."
04:32,100;04:33,780;"Like a very PC answer."
04:33,780;04:34,800;"The LA cake."
04:34,800;04:37,380;"Yikes."
04:37,380;04:44,140;"So Bob, for those of you who don't know, born and raised in, I want to say,"
04:44,140;04:45,060;"it was in North Carolina."
04:45,060;04:46,460;"I can never remember which Carolina, Bob."
04:46,460;04:51,580;"They're not the same Andy, but I'll, I'll, I'll handle that early slight and"
04:51,580;04:54,140;"just move on. I'm from North Carolina."
04:54,140;04:56,980;"Oh, it's at least I got it right. You did."
04:56,980;04:58,980;"I had a 50/50 shot."
04:58,980;05:01,100;"How far from Charlotte? Were you Bob?"
05:01,100;05:03,740;"About an hour. All right."
05:03,740;05:07,460;"But you were kind of in the woods of North Carolina, right?"
05:07,460;05:09,020;"That's true."
05:09,020;05:10,500;"All right. Does your town have a name?"
05:10,500;05:12,380;"Rumor had?"
05:12,380;05:16,060;"We even have a post office, my friend. Oh, is that new?"
05:16,060;05:19,180;"A little bit."
05:20,620;05:25,060;"All right. So, so you grew up in kind of the woods of North Carolina."
05:25,060;05:32,420;"Um, and, and the Panthers weren't a thing until you were probably what?"
05:32,420;05:35,260;"Like nine or 10, I would think they came in the league in 95."
05:35,260;05:37,340;"Yeah. I mean, 95. So I was 10."
05:37,340;05:38,380;"That's right."
05:38,380;05:44,220;"So then did you get into football with the Panthers or were you already a football fan?"
05:44,220;05:47,820;"I would say more or less with the Panthers."
05:47,820;05:54,460;"I would say that as I remember it now, I was like sort of a sports fan, but like when I was like"
05:54,460;05:59,900;"kid, like young, it was all the Braves, the dad loved the Braves, watched the Braves all the time."
05:59,900;06:06,380;"You know, this was their heyday. This was like Maddox glavin those guys. I mean, I remember watching"
06:06,380;06:11,900;"the last out of the World Series we wanted 95. So I was all about the Braves. You know, you got"
06:11,900;06:16,780;"college basketball. Everybody talks about UNC going on. And then honestly, at this time,"
06:16,780;06:23,500;"I was a Hornets fan. So I remember my dad came to a game in one of those years and around that time period"
06:23,500;06:27,660;"with a friend of his who got tickets and going to see the Hornets playing"
06:27,660;06:32,300;"Michael Jordan in the Bulls. And I remember that I still got the ticket saved"
06:32,300;06:38,460;"in my scrap box thing. Anyway, so football is far off the radar. Like my grandpa was a Redskins fan."
06:38,460;06:42,540;"Like the Redskins were kind of the team of the territory. But I didn't really pay attention to it."
06:42,540;06:46,700;"We didn't have a team. It was like baseball. And then I was personally a little bit in the Hornets."
06:46,700;06:48,200;"and you know, you had stuff going on."
06:48,200;06:50,660;"So no, but well, not on the radar all as far as"
06:50,660;06:51,220;"anything else."
06:51,220;06:52,620;"Yeah, because that's how it was morning."
06:52,620;06:57,900;"Like, what's the, the, the Redskins were the actual like team of the area?"
06:57,900;06:59,020;"Oh, yeah."
06:59,020;07:00,340;"Unofficially, but big time."
07:00,340;07:02,140;"Were they, are they the closest?"
07:02,140;07:02,700;"I don't know."
07:02,700;07:08,740;"I think arguably geographically, yeah, but like culturally that was the thing."
07:08,740;07:11,300;"Like there, there's still a little bit of friction there."
07:11,300;07:14,740;"There are still like holdout Redskins made in the Carolinas for sure."
07:14,740;07:15,260;"Wow."
07:15,260;07:17,860;"There aren't even Redskins fans in DC anymore."
07:17,860;07:24,460;"I had a question about the Hornets."
07:24,460;07:26,460;"Is that the Muggsy Bogs era?"
07:26,460;07:28,560;"This memory."
07:28,560;07:29,160;"Yeah."
07:29,160;07:30,160;"Yeah."
07:30,160;07:30,660;"Yeah."
07:30,660;07:35,060;"Anyway, the way it played out was basically like, you know, this is a couple of years down the road,"
07:35,060;07:38,860;"but when the Hornets thing happened and then they fucking left and everybody was pissed."
07:38,860;07:39,360;"Right."
07:39,360;07:40,760;"Oh, wait."
07:40,760;07:42,160;"Hey, we're allowed to curse on this podcast."
07:42,160;07:42,660;"Oh, yeah."
07:42,660;07:43,460;"Oh, fuck."
07:43,460;07:43,860;"Yeah."
07:43,860;07:44,860;"Anyway."
07:44,860;07:50,660;"When the f*cking hornet's owner f*cking left town, um, I got, I was already starting to get into the pan and Thursday"
07:50,660;07:54,060;"You know they have that early burst of success in their second season. They did"
07:54,060;07:57,460;"Jaguars as well"
07:57,460;08:01,460;"But man the hornet's leaving and then the Braves dynasty kind of falling apart"
08:01,460;08:04,140;"It was like perfect timing for me. They wanted to high school"
08:04,140;08:08,580;"It was like then all of a sudden all living on the Panthers in the football. All right"
08:08,580;08:12,060;"Yeah, because yeah, like Steve like Bob was saying"
08:13,100;08:18,580;"The second year for both because they both came in at 95 and in both teams second year randomly"
08:18,580;08:22,100;"They both made it to the conference championship of each"
08:22,100;08:25,820;"Each conference obviously"
08:25,820;08:31,780;"Patriots playoff game against the Jaguars were like right they even went out because it's such a piece of shit"
08:31,780;08:35,100;"Yeah, so so actually both teams lost to"
08:35,100;08:36,980;"the"
08:36,980;08:42,140;"Obviously the eventual teams won Super Bowl and that was the role that the Patriots played the Packers"
08:42,500;08:44,500;"Yeah"
08:44,500;08:46,060;"So"
08:46,060;08:52,500;"But that was kind of a strange thing where it because it was a bit of an anomaly too. They didn't have a winning season"
08:52,500;08:59,180;"Outside of that for a while like in 90 they started 95"
08:59,180;09:04,140;"They had that winning season of 96 and then the next one wasn't until 2003. Who was their quarterback?"
09:04,140;09:08,340;"Burline"
09:08,340;09:10,980;"And before that"
09:11,740;09:13,740;"Greg"
09:13,740;09:20,460;"I have no idea started with the team. How about Bob? Do you know the original starting quarterback for Kyle"
09:20,460;09:25,140;"I'm pants as well. Oh, I don't remember. That's one Gary Collins. I was gonna say"
09:25,140;09:33,500;"First pick right yeah, I think so wait now we didn't pick him in the very first year. We yeah 95"
09:33,500;09:36,700;"But he wasn't one overall he was five for some reason"
09:39,220;09:43,820;"Fair enough. Yeah, that's a whole nother story with that fucking guy in his drunken nonsense"
09:43,820;09:48,620;"I do used to drive there was a report at once about him driving around Charlotte drunk"
09:48,620;09:51,280;"Just yelling obscenities and racial slurs out the window"
09:51,280;09:57,760;"Right in Carolina. It was super annoying actually when he when he easy now"
09:57,760;10:03,020;"It was annoying when he went to the Giants and like semi resuscitates career for a few years"
10:03,020;10:06,560;"Everybody's like really this fucking washout asshole. Yeah"
10:06,560;10:07,560;"Yeah."
10:07,560;10:08,560;"Goodness."
10:08,560;10:17,320;"So, yeah, so we're kind of getting into the Panthers right now in 2001, and this is the"
10:17,320;10:19,640;"end of the George Seafert era."
10:19,640;10:22,280;"Did you have any comments about that?"
10:22,280;10:26,920;"Because I actually read about George Seafert recently randomly."
10:26,920;10:31,880;"I mean, when you first hit this, like, I probably would have done it no matter what the game"
10:31,880;10:36,520;"was, but when you told me when it was, I was actually kind of excited to do this because"
10:36,520;10:39,720;"Because the thing, yeah, the interesting thing about this game is like,"
10:39,720;10:46,520;"it's kind of interesting what we just talked about with the Aikors connection and like the randomness and like the connections."
10:46,520;10:54,120;"Because then this moment was like, this was the very, this was the lowest moment in the entire franchise's history."
10:54,120;10:56,720;"Yeah, this game could qualify, right?"
10:56,720;11:00,720;"This game truly, it was like the capstone of the lowest period."
11:00,720;11:05,120;"So like end of C for the 1 in 15 season, it was ultra embarrassing."
11:05,120;11:07,920;"It was like winning that first game against Minnesota."
11:07,920;11:09,440;"We lost 15 straight."
11:09,440;11:12,880;"The team totally gave up on George Seeker,"
11:12,880;11:14,800;"which is like kind of the subtext of all of it."
11:14,800;11:17,640;"Like truly they like literally weren't playing."
11:17,640;11:18,640;"- Right."
11:18,640;11:20,600;"- Guys were not like chilling up and trying hard."
11:20,600;11:22,080;"Guys were faking injuries."
11:22,080;11:23,400;"It was like super embarrassing"
11:23,400;11:26,320;"'cause like the team had that initial high"
11:26,320;11:28,800;"and like folks in the Carolina's really excited."
11:28,800;11:30,960;"And I remember that being like a really embarrassing"
11:30,960;11:33,120;"low point of like, are they gonna lose the fan base?"
11:33,120;11:37,240;"I actually looked this up today and prepped for this at that final game this game against the pads"
11:37,240;11:39,580;"I think the only of 16,000 people in this"
11:39,580;11:46,480;"You know, well, it was it wasn't just that they were bad"
11:46,480;11:52,520;"It was like it was that they openly gave up and like that was the public talking point of like how embarrassing this team and this"
11:52,520;11:54,520;"Coach and the morale were"
11:54,520;11:56,960;"the other thing that happened here is"
11:56,960;12:01,160;"The Reka Ruth thing overshadowed all this together remember that"
12:01,160;12:03,280;"- Oh, that was just here?"
12:03,280;12:05,520;"- No, it wasn't, well, the incident wasn't this year,"
12:05,520;12:08,200;"that was '99, but this, he was still playing out,"
12:08,200;12:11,280;"and I remember, I looked it up today to confirm this."
12:11,280;12:14,120;"It was in this middle of this shit show season"
12:14,120;12:15,640;"that he was actually big."
12:15,640;12:17,080;"- Wow."
12:17,080;12:19,320;"- And so that got all dreads back up,"
12:19,320;12:21,400;"and it was just like the fucking low point"
12:21,400;12:22,800;"for the franchise."
12:22,800;12:24,320;"- Yeah."
12:24,320;12:25,520;"Good Lord."
12:25,520;12:27,920;"- I mean, we got Chris Wankie trotting himself out there."
12:27,920;12:29,400;"- Yep."
12:29,400;12:30,720;"- Oh man, the team game up,"
12:30,720;12:32,800;"But the interesting thing is then after this"
12:32,800;12:35,320;"was what began really like,"
12:35,320;12:38,240;"I mean, in my personal like kind of experience"
12:38,240;12:39,880;"the golden age of Panthers football,"
12:39,880;12:41,320;"like, and you know, interestingly,"
12:41,320;12:43,000;"it put us on a crossroads to meet again"
12:43,000;12:45,320;"that Super Bowl two years later, the Jake D'Womb era."
12:45,320;12:46,160;"- Exactly."
12:46,160;12:48,960;"- Because then Fox comes in, he cleans things up."
12:48,960;12:51,400;"This is then me going right from end of high school"
12:51,400;12:53,400;"and college and all of those seasons,"
12:53,400;12:54,880;"but I remember quite fondly."
12:54,880;12:58,920;"- Yeah, and just to go back to see for real quick,"
12:58,920;13:03,080;"I was reading, and I was reading because it's the,"
13:03,080;13:05,240;"we're all locked out right now,"
13:05,240;13:08,640;"but I was reading a book by Michael Lombardi,"
13:08,640;13:11,080;"who was the old GM of the Patriots."
13:11,080;13:13,440;"And before that, he was actually the GM of the 49ers,"
13:13,440;13:16,360;"and his whole thing about Seifert was that,"
13:16,360;13:20,920;"'cause he took over for Walsh, the 49ers,"
13:20,920;13:21,840;"when they were at Bill Walsh,"
13:21,840;13:22,960;"when they were winning all those Super Bowls"
13:22,960;13:25,360;"and everything, and they were that dynasty."
13:25,360;13:26,440;"And he took over from them,"
13:26,440;13:27,960;"and basically what he was saying is that he knew"
13:27,960;13:32,040;"how to run that system, but he didn't know how to create it himself."
13:32,040;13:36,920;"So Bill Walsh created this system and ran it successfully with Montana"
13:36,920;13:42,200;"forever. And then Seifert took over and kept it going. And want to see"
13:42,200;13:46,280;"Super Bowl the first year he in, like when he was the head coach of the 49ers,"
13:46,280;13:51,960;"got to the conference championship a few times, one another Super Bowl, and"
13:51,960;13:54,800;"then lost in the division around a couple of times and then moved on. And that"
13:54,800;13:57,680;"was like moving from Montana to young and everything like that."
13:57,680;14:02,680;"So I think from what I remember of him coming in,"
14:02,680;14:07,280;"there was a lot of high hopes from Carolina Panthers fans."
14:07,280;14:08,920;"Is that something you remember?"
14:08,920;14:13,120;"Or am I just making that up as like an outsider?"
14:13,120;14:14,040;"- No, that's right."
14:14,040;14:16,200;"I mean, it was interesting because he,"
14:16,200;14:19,360;"like Richardson who the owner at the time"
14:19,360;14:22,800;"was like already known as a pretty patient owner."
14:22,800;14:24,600;"And so, you know, we started out with Dom Capers"
14:24,600;14:26,440;"who like say what you want about the guy."
14:26,440;14:28,480;"was pretty popular and pretty energetic"
14:28,480;14:30,980;"and the theme to that initial success."
14:30,980;14:32,800;"And I was, it didn't work out"
14:32,800;14:36,360;"and you had a bunch of mediocre to bad seasons and left,"
14:36,360;14:38,760;"but it was literally light and respected"
14:38,760;14:40,880;"for starting the franchise."
14:40,880;14:44,160;"And then they clearly at that moment had higher hopes"
14:44,160;14:45,960;"and were kind of aimed big"
14:45,960;14:47,720;"and were like, we're gonna get this coach"
14:47,720;14:49,720;"with the Champions of Pedigree."
14:49,720;14:52,080;"We think our team's around quickly."
14:52,080;14:53,520;"And then it was just a shit show."
14:53,520;14:54,440;"And it was really clear,"
14:54,440;14:56,280;"this is a guy who was used to coaching"
14:56,280;14:58,520;"basically ready-made championship team,"
14:58,520;15:01,800;"which newsflash was not the Carolina Panther Circuit 2000."
15:01,800;15:03,600;"(laughing)"
15:03,600;15:04,440;"- This is true."
15:04,440;15:09,320;"So I think outside of this,"
15:09,320;15:12,480;"well, actually no, before I get to that,"
15:12,480;15:16,440;"as a Panther fan, how do you view the Patriots?"
15:16,440;15:19,160;"Like what do you think of the Patriots?"
15:19,160;15:25,080;"- Yeah, I mean, I would say--"
15:25,080;15:26,760;"- You don't have to hold back."
15:26,760;15:28,920;"This is a pro-pages podcast,"
15:28,920;15:33,920;"but where we scan the whole gamut of their cheaters"
15:33,920;15:36,800;"to they get wrong."
15:36,800;15:37,640;"- Right."
15:37,640;15:40,080;"- Yeah, I don't think there's honestly a lot there."
15:40,080;15:43,800;"I mean, that Super Bowl we played was,"
15:43,800;15:45,440;"at the end of the day, it kind of gets forgotten"
15:45,440;15:48,160;"in the whole big spectrum of things."
15:48,160;15:50,440;"It ends up being a really exciting game."
15:50,440;15:53,280;"- And we were like clear underdog"
15:53,280;15:57,240;"and ended up coming within the field goal."
15:57,240;16:00,800;"And so it's not like there were like hard feelings per se."
16:00,800;16:03,320;"And then beyond that, it's like then how often do we meet?"
16:03,320;16:04,160;"You know what I mean?"
16:04,160;16:06,960;"It's like NFC, the only other game I really remember"
16:06,960;16:10,600;"in all the stretch was like, I think 2013,"
16:10,600;16:13,360;"13 or 15, but I think 13, we have this game"
16:13,360;16:14,280;"where we played you guys."
16:14,280;16:15,120;"- Oh yeah."
16:15,120;16:18,320;"- I just remember the equally non-called"
16:18,320;16:21,080;"the whole ""Dong Me"" and ""The End Zone"" to win that game."
16:21,080;16:23,080;"- Yeah, we all remember that too."
16:23,080;16:25,320;"Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I remember that one."
16:25,320;16:28,840;"And Brady was yelling at the rest on the way out."
16:28,840;16:31,000;"I'm going to go super pissed and Belichick."
16:31,000;16:32,880;"Super pissed. Yeah."
16:32,880;16:34,400;"So was it passing appearance, pop?"
16:34,400;16:36,960;"It was."
16:36,960;16:42,400;"I mean, it was definitely clearly within the boundaries of being called to hold."
16:42,400;16:44,000;"OK."
16:44,000;16:45,000;"Fair."
16:45,000;16:46,280;"Well, you don't get a call."
16:46,280;16:48,320;"You know, that's you don't get a recall."
16:48,320;16:49,760;"It's into the game. Yeah."
16:49,760;16:51,040;"It's going to like make or break."
16:51,040;16:55,240;"It was like literally the game like ending play you're it was home in Carolina"
16:55,240;16:59,280;"Yeah, that's one of those one of those plays man. They're probably not calling that shit in the Super Bowl"
16:59,280;17:02,960;"You know, yeah, and then they review it and then they're like we're gonna"
17:02,960;17:06,240;"Let it stand fuck it whatever"
17:06,240;17:11,360;"Also a super fucking legit play from peakly who knew he was yeah"
17:11,360;17:19,280;"I could have been called a hole. Yeah, and I think he probably took a calculated risk knowing that it was Gronkowski"
17:19,520;17:23,960;"And you may as well because there are times where he get the call"
17:23,960;17:28,320;"Or this motherfucker is fucking spiking on your fucking face"
17:28,320;17:33,760;"So I was looking this up too, and I feel like"
17:33,760;17:39,960;"Outside of this one game in 2001 the Patriots and Panthers don't really play"
17:39,960;17:42,760;"like boring games"
17:42,760;17:44,680;"you know"
17:44,680;17:46,680;"there was"
17:48,480;17:51,200;"It was one in 2009 apparently that I don't remember at all"
17:51,200;17:56,160;"The Patriots won at home 20 to 10, but the other ones"
17:56,160;17:59,240;"those"
17:59,240;18:03,760;"2013 when we're talking about 24 20 with the Luke Keely"
18:03,760;18:08,520;"2017 more recently. I think that was one of"
18:08,520;18:16,680;"Stefan Gilmour's first game. Wasn't it? Yeah, and the Panthers exposed. Yep"
18:16,680;18:23,920;"Yeah. Yeah. And the Panthers won that one right. The end 33 30 on some dubious."
18:23,920;18:30,720;"There was like a defensive holding penalty calls after cam got sacked on"
18:30,720;18:33,960;"third down or something like that. You kept the drive alive and they went and"
18:33,960;18:40,280;"kicked the field goal. And then of course, the Super Bowl. So there haven't been"
18:40,280;18:45,200;"many games where they haven't been exciting. So I almost, when I was looking"
18:45,200;18:53,580;"this up kind of wanted to put the Panthers in that kind of low key nemesis isn't the right"
18:53,580;18:57,160;"word but just kind of like it is almost a bit of a rivalry."
18:57,160;19:00,320;"Even though they don't play each other very often."
19:00,320;19:03,740;"It's true although this game and that team are long dead."
19:03,740;19:08,240;"I mean I would now thinking back about this put Panthers history in three eras and this"
19:08,240;19:13,280;"game is the very this was the dead end of the first era of Panthers football."
19:13,280;19:19,180;"Okay, and then the John Fox era was really the second era and then the like Ron Rivera cam Newton era"
19:19,180;19:25,680;"Which honestly maybe is now maybe we call it the end of the third era right now. Yeah, you know those those are the arrows so far"
19:25,680;19:27,680;"Yeah, apparently that"
19:27,680;19:34,160;"The pant is it sold out every home game since 2002 so starting in that second era"
19:34,160;19:40,160;"Wow, yeah, that makes sense that makes sense from my perspective from a like upward trajectory of the franchise and like"
19:40,360;19:46,600;"What I said about the Redskins thing earlier, like that was like that was an actual conscious narrative by the franchise of the"
19:46,600;19:52,300;"They knew they were constantly under threat actually win fans over and there were a lot of conscious decisions"
19:52,300;19:57,660;"So calling them the Carolina Panthers was a very calculated decision like they've been Charlotte, North Carolina"
19:57,660;19:59,260;"And Charlotte's you know, it's too much on the border"
19:59,260;20:04,100;"But it was very conscious to try to grow a large fan base knowing that an uphill battle decline"
20:04,100;20:07,620;"with college basketball with the red skins with baseball"
20:08,560;20:13,480;"And honestly, it's really since 2002 and up that they've actually been able to successfully"
20:13,480;20:17,080;"like they basically put that argument to rest that they weren't going to be able to thrive"
20:17,080;20:18,640;"as a small market franchise."
20:18,640;20:20,360;"Yeah, I would agree with that."
20:20,360;20:24,160;"So is Charlotte Pantherstown?"
20:24,160;20:33,600;"Just because Raleigh Durham, not really in my experience, so I live in Durham and that"
20:33,600;20:36,640;"is definitely like college basketball."
20:36,640;20:41,800;"Yeah, like I'm a C Duke and C state are definitely the highest priority"
20:41,800;20:48,660;"Is that a percent football fans that are local or probably they're like yeah, I'm a Panthers fan, but it's not like"
20:48,660;20:55,080;"You get Patriots fans back home. We're like ride or die, you know, I"
20:55,080;21:01,760;"Think that's totally true and I think that that part of the state will always put college sports first and foremost"
21:01,760;21:07,480;"I think Charlotte and Western or Carolina are different and honestly the thing that gets forgotten to what I just said is like"
21:07,480;21:13,440;"A huge part of their fan base is South Carolina, which has always been more football territory anyway"
21:13,440;21:17,520;"Yeah, and like they do draw a huge base of their support there"
21:17,520;21:24,240;"Particularly like the black portion of the fan base is really really heavily draws on like"
21:24,240;21:29,760;"population of South Carolina, which part of the reason why cam has been such a big deal. Yeah"
21:29,760;21:30,600;"- Yeah."
21:30,600;21:36,140;"- So are you glad Cam's gone?"
21:36,140;21:38,680;"- No, I'm super sad."
21:38,680;21:39,520;"- Good."
21:39,520;21:40,520;"- Hey, we get it."
21:40,520;21:43,440;"- No, it's a very sad moment for the franchise"
21:43,440;21:44,600;"and for everybody."
21:44,600;21:45,600;"- Yeah, good."
21:45,600;21:48,080;"- What do you think about Bridgewater?"
21:48,080;21:50,640;"- I mean, it's a savvy signing,"
21:50,640;21:52,320;"like, you know, if you look at the market"
21:52,320;21:53,680;"or the leagues at right now, sure."
21:53,680;21:55,520;"It's like a decent contract."
21:55,520;21:58,080;"It's like, it makes sense."
21:58,080;22:02,120;"And like, you know, you got to view this through the prism of newish owner who wants"
22:02,120;22:04,640;"to make his mark and new coach, sure fine."
22:04,640;22:09,320;"But at the same time, from a standpoint of what we've accomplished, like, it's tough."
22:09,320;22:12,960;"And it's really sad to see things in this way."
22:12,960;22:16,200;"And you know, the injury has really derailed the last two years."
22:16,200;22:20,160;"And like, I still look back on that stupid ass preseason game last season when they played"
22:20,160;22:21,960;"Cam and didn't need to any hurt his butt."
22:21,960;22:23,600;"Yeah, against the past."
22:23,600;22:24,600;"Against the finishes."
22:24,600;22:29,420;"can't help but wonder how things play out differently with everybody with Ron, with"
22:29,420;22:33,820;"Cam the season. It's hard to stomach that. And I've been a little on the outside of it"
22:33,820;22:38,460;"the last year and a half, but it's just, it's just tough thinking about it should have played"
22:38,460;22:43,860;"out differently. And Cam, I mean, I would posit Cam's the most important player in franchise"
22:43,860;22:48,500;"history in many ways. And he doesn't get, I think in retrospect, it'll be interesting"
22:48,500;22:53,940;"to see how his narrative plays out because it's tough because he's been under constant"
22:53,940;22:57,860;"fire the whole time that he's been our quarterback and a lot of it has been"
22:57,860;23:04,660;"undeserved in my opinion. Yeah, I agree. I don't know if he doesn't like do"
23:04,660;23:08,980;"himself that many favors with his. I do put his foot in his mouth five times"
23:08,980;23:14,260;"a season. And he hit the way like his have you seen his like cryptic"
23:14,260;23:20,180;"uh fine. Oh yeah. Oh, it's so stupid. Like I'll say if I could talk to Cam,"
23:20,180;23:22,900;"I would be like, hey man, look, I love you. And let me tell you all the reasons"
23:22,900;23:25,620;"I'm a huge fan also. Let me tell you three stupid ass things"
23:25,620;23:28,620;"Man, can you put that shit out?"
23:28,620;23:38,540;"Well the fucking Instagram font or whatever it is, you know, I'll do the social media thing, but I knew what the font is and it's"
23:38,540;23:42,500;"I don't know man"
23:42,500;23:46,680;"You know the fashion things interesting. I think it's more the like"
23:46,680;23:52,660;"He didn't do himself favors early on with like the pouting and it's like hey"
23:52,660;23:56,700;"man, it's actually good for you to be fucking pissed, but you're not taking notes on how"
23:56,700;24:02,580;"that's accepted. Like Brady can be pissed, but like you can't, you can't, it just came"
24:02,580;24:06,820;"across as pouty early in his career. And I think it's from a guy who like was used to"
24:06,820;24:12,580;"just being successful. And like honestly, the thing that the narrative that was wrong"
24:12,580;24:16,140;"was that it impacted the team. Because I really don't think it ever did. I think that the"
24:16,140;24:20,140;"players always had his back and understood where he's coming from and took it the right"
24:20,140;24:25,820;"way of I do really fucking wants to win. But from a broader narrative standpoint, he just"
24:25,820;24:32,000;"like that shit really sank him. But then I mean, we could spend a whole nother podcast"
24:32,000;24:37,100;"going into the way which all of this shit was unfairly judged through a lens of race"
24:37,100;24:42,740;"and like the way his like charisma and sort of defiance and like fashion. Like, honestly,"
24:42,740;24:45,660;"all of that stuff is like he's really unfairly criticized for."
24:45,660;24:49,660;"Sounds like you just saw your own podcast Bob."
24:49,660;24:50,660;"Yeah maybe."
24:50,660;24:51,660;"Maybe one day."
24:51,660;24:54,660;"Probably the time on your hands."
24:54,660;24:59,660;"Alright so my last question we may have already touched on this."
24:59,660;25:03,660;"What is your favorite Patriots Panthers game?"
25:03,660;25:07,660;"Favorite Patriots Panthers game."
25:07,660;25:10,660;"Yeah we kind of talked through them a little bit."
25:10,660;25:16,660;"I mean the honorable mention that 2013 game I remember well"
25:16,660;25:19,900;"Ellie and I were living with Williamsburg I was watching on my TV and I remember"
25:19,900;25:23,980;"you know you have those memories watching a football or any sports where like the"
25:23,980;25:28,620;"game happens and like you win or whatever happens and like you just have"
25:28,620;25:33,020;"that fucking high like I remember it was like it was like I think it was Sunday"
25:33,020;25:36,580;"night football and it was like mad fucking late it was like 11 I had to be"
25:36,580;25:39,700;"up ridiculously or for school in exterior I drank like fucking eight"
25:39,700;25:44,420;"or something. I was like, this is stupid. I'm gonna feel like shit tomorrow. But I had to just,"
25:44,420;25:48,660;"I just had to go out. I went and fucking took a walk around the neighborhood and put my headphones"
25:48,660;25:54,100;"and so I was just so gacked up. And I just remember that. But that, I mean, I still can't put that"
25:54,100;26:00,820;"in first place because like that's Super Bowl. The 2003 just mitts so much. Like it really just"
26:00,820;26:06,260;"sparked, for me personally, it sparked like a turbocharged phase of like, I mean, I would say"
26:06,260;26:10,820;"Panthers and football, but honestly sports fandom in general like I don't without that"
26:10,820;26:15,480;"I don't know if I become a read ESPN every several times every day comes sports fan. I really don't"
26:15,480;26:22,200;"Yeah, I would agree with you that probably what happened to me too in 2001 with the Patriots"
26:22,200;26:29,420;"Superloh there right yeah, absolutely. Yeah, I've always thought that of like would I be a huge?"
26:29,420;26:33,300;"Football slash Patriots fan if it wasn't for the Pats"
26:34,220;26:38,220;"Because it was Red Sox City before all this happened, you know."
26:38,220;26:43,820;"Oh, yeah. The Patriots were always that laughing stock of, you know, they'll eventually fuck this up somehow"
26:43,820;26:46,220;"as you some matter of how they're going to do it. Yeah."
26:46,220;26:51,220;"Which I think is probably pretty common in a lot of a lot of towns with a lot of sports, you know, a lot of teams."
26:51,220;26:54,220;"I was like Bob with the Bruins when I was a little kid."
26:54,220;26:59,220;"I have my first Bruins game ticket for 97 when the fleet center opened."
26:59,220;27:00,220;"Oh, yeah."
27:00,220;27:01,220;"Oh yeah."
27:01,220;27:02,220;"Sweet center."
27:02,220;27:03,220;"Right?"
27:03,220;27:05,220;"Jesus, that's a throwback."
27:05,220;27:09,220;"Do you boys have any other questions for Bob?"
27:09,220;27:10,220;"Oh yeah."
27:10,220;27:12,220;"All right, let's hear it."
27:12,220;27:18,420;"Who's your favorite Panthers player both all time and now?"
27:18,420;27:20,220;"All time is Steve Smith."
27:20,220;27:21,940;"Of course."
27:21,940;27:27,820;"I like he really represented that second era of Panthers football in so many ways."
27:27,820;27:30,940;"It was like the underdog status, the chip in his shoulder."
27:30,940;27:32,420;"It was the fact that like the Panthers"
27:32,420;27:33,700;"don't have a lot of swagger,"
27:33,700;27:36,020;"but Steve Smith had a fucking mountain of swagger"
27:36,020;27:37,540;"and wasn't afraid to tell you."
27:37,540;27:39,860;"There's just so many moments."
27:39,860;27:43,100;"Like I always remember the moment"
27:43,100;27:45,700;"when he like destroyed Fred Smoot on the Vikings"
27:45,700;27:48,740;"and ruined his career and told him to ice up after the game."
27:48,740;27:50,140;"- I forgot about that."
27:50,140;27:52,620;"- Well, in the playoff run,"
27:52,620;27:54,060;"they went to the Super Bowl to play"
27:54,060;27:57,180;"that I'll always remember is we played the Rams"
27:57,180;28:00,460;"in the divisional round and it went to double over time."
28:00,460;28:01,660;"And that was like low key."
28:01,660;28:02,500;"It was interesting."
28:02,500;28:04,140;"It was past the like,"
28:04,140;28:05,460;"ratio and turf Rams,"
28:05,460;28:07,180;"but it was still like kind of the remnants of that"
28:07,180;28:08,380;"with Mark Bulger."
28:08,380;28:09,700;"And there were 12 before that year"
28:09,700;28:12,420;"and like on paper a lot better than us."
28:12,420;28:13,540;"And I remember double over time."
28:13,540;28:14,420;"I just remember the,"
28:14,420;28:15,260;"it was like,"
28:15,260;28:17,420;"I think it was the first play of double over time."
28:17,420;28:19,020;"And it was just like,"
28:19,020;28:20,040;"Steve Smith,"
28:20,040;28:23,060;"straight up,"
28:23,060;28:24,300;"slant route up there,"
28:24,300;28:26,540;"the cut through the corner back in the safety,"
28:26,540;28:28,460;"just streaking down the field, catching the ball"
28:28,460;28:29,340;"into the end zone."
28:29,340;28:31,740;"And I was watching the play at some friend's house,"
28:31,740;28:34,820;"and things got heated, right?"
28:34,820;28:37,140;"It was a back and forth game."
28:37,140;28:39,460;"But I'll never forget that play."
28:39,460;28:42,020;"And I remember my friend's mom after that."
28:42,020;28:43,260;"We were over there with a bunch of guys,"
28:43,260;28:45,620;"not all of whom were actual football fans."
28:45,620;28:46,900;"It was like me and my friend Daniel"
28:46,900;28:48,500;"and a bunch of other kids we just hung out with."
28:48,500;28:51,180;"And after the game, everybody gradually moved away"
28:51,180;28:53,100;"from the room that I was watching the game in"
28:53,100;28:55,580;"because of my composure."
28:55,580;28:59,900;"I can't remember a friend's mom saying to me later after that game"
28:59,900;29:03,420;"She's like if the pants are the if the Panthers have lost this game at all"
29:03,420;29:07,000;"I don't think I would have let my sons hang out with you anymore"
29:07,000;29:15,400;"So definitely definitely Steve Smith like he's in my mind the most iconic player in my sister"
29:15,400;29:22,820;"And finally enough his first season was this 2001 season it was it was and made the Pro Bowl as a return man"
29:23,020;29:28,860;"Exactly. Yeah, then 2003 was the Super Bowl season was really has break out of the receiver. Yeah. Yeah, we"
29:28,860;29:31,420;"Yeah, yeah"
29:31,420;29:33,740;"current, I mean"
29:33,740;29:35,740;"if we're counting last season"
29:35,740;29:38,540;"um"
29:38,540;29:46,300;"I mean wow kekley, it's just like i'm not ready to process his retirement so i'll put that there but honestly like also low key like"
29:47,020;29:51,820;"Greg Olson, and he's one of the rare players who's come to the Panthers, who is a transplant,"
29:51,820;29:55,100;"who wasn't drafted by us, has become, I would argue, like in the like,"
29:55,100;30:01,260;"I would go so far as like top 10 pantheon in terms of like important voices for the franchise."
30:01,260;30:02,780;"Wow, who drafted Greg Olson?"
30:02,780;30:05,260;"The Bears."
30:05,260;30:07,420;"Oh, that's right. Yeah, they did. Yeah."
30:07,420;30:09,020;"I've always associated with the Panthers."
30:09,020;30:10,700;"Yeah, you see, exactly."
30:10,700;30:16,540;"And I don't, I can't really think of another guy for the Panthers who's in that level"
30:16,540;30:21,980;"with the franchise who we didn't draft. Like they low key have had a lot of success with like"
30:21,980;30:28,380;"franchise level players they drafted. The franchise not so much which is why I think Olson stands"
30:28,380;30:33,420;"out so much and like it's also an indicator of like how sour things have gotten in the past"
30:33,420;30:39,420;"three to four years with ownership and the management that like he went out pretty vocally being like"
30:39,420;30:45,820;"yeah hook these guys and like when Cam posted his shit about recently about like don't try to"
30:45,820;30:47,420;"I pretend like I asked you for this trade."
30:47,420;30:48,260;"- Oh, that's right."
30:48,260;30:49,900;"- Like, responded to that shit and was like,"
30:49,900;30:51,060;"yeah, that sounds right."
30:51,060;30:54,400;"And like, Olsen has enough capital"
30:54,400;30:57,300;"to publicly fucking call the team out on shit like that."
30:57,300;31:01,340;"But anyway, sad to see both those guys go."
31:01,340;31:03,660;"- So it's kind of almost feels like"
31:03,660;31:05,540;"another parallel with the Patriots this year,"
31:05,540;31:07,140;"and it feels like they're almost kind of"
31:07,140;31:09,340;"cleaning house as well with Brady leaving"
31:09,340;31:14,140;"and everybody else seeming to be getting signed the other way."
31:14,140;31:15,500;"- Yeah, new era, man."
31:15,500;31:19,380;"Yeah. So we feel your love."
31:19,380;31:20,940;"Who's your least favorite panther?"
31:20,940;31:23,860;"Also Steve Smith."
31:23,860;31:26,700;"That's a really interesting question."
31:26,700;31:28,700;"Oh man, there's a lot."
31:28,700;31:32,620;"The fact you have about that."
31:32,620;31:37,780;"No, I'm trying to think about that for a moment of like who pissed me off the most"
31:37,780;31:38,420;"of the year."
31:38,420;31:39,260;"Jimmy Clausen."
31:39,260;31:40,220;"Ooh."
31:40,220;31:44,060;"Boston was just like not to even be considered a, you know what I mean?"
31:44,060;31:46,020;"She's like, this guy, get the fuck out."
31:46,020;31:49,100;"Least favorite panther."
31:49,100;31:51,820;"Man, who was really frustrating over the years?"
31:51,820;31:56,340;"- I mean, Greg Hardy, but that was more like,"
31:56,340;31:58,340;"what an idiot."
31:58,340;32:01,380;"- Yeah, not like frustrating as much as like, fuck that guy."
32:01,380;32:02,740;"- Yeah, no, what a, what a, what a,"
32:02,740;32:04,380;"what a, what a just like not good person."
32:04,380;32:09,780;"I would say Least favorite panther."
32:13,860;32:15,100;"I'm trying to figure out the guys,"
32:15,100;32:17,380;"but they're always the guys who you never trusted, right?"
32:17,380;32:19,260;"Like in the big moment who are always like,"
32:19,260;32:21,980;"you know what, you just, nope, get off the field."
32:21,980;32:26,740;"- Like a record all type of guy."
32:26,740;32:29,460;"- Yeah, I would say every number two receiver"
32:29,460;32:33,060;"in Panthers history, except for Moose and Muhammad."
32:33,060;32:35,500;"- Yeah, that's funny."
32:35,500;32:36,660;"That's a good one."
32:36,660;32:37,500;"It is true."
32:37,500;32:39,940;"And if you look at like that team"
32:39,940;32:43,820;"that Cam Newton took to the Super Bowl, the 15 and one team,"
32:43,820;32:44,820;"What a joke."
32:44,820;32:45,820;"Yeah."
32:45,820;32:47,460;"The receiving core is laughable."
32:47,460;32:49,820;"It's truly so names."
32:49,820;32:57,220;"It was a I mean, Ted again was basically the number one tag in 10 touchdowns that season"
32:57,220;32:59,020;"Devin Funchiss, right?"
32:59,020;33:00,500;"Oh, yeah."
33:00,500;33:03,860;"And then from there, it's dudes like you wouldn't even recognize their name."
33:03,860;33:04,860;"No."
33:04,860;33:05,860;"Holy shit."
33:05,860;33:06,860;"Let's say."
33:06,860;33:07,860;"Yeah."
33:07,860;33:08,860;"All right."
33:08,860;33:10,660;"So top receiving guys."
33:10,660;33:13,660;"Let's do it by yards."
33:13,660;33:15,780;"Greg Olson led the team in receiving the arts."
33:15,780;33:16,420;"Yeah."
33:16,420;33:16,900;"That's it."
33:16,900;33:20,020;"Ted Ginn Jericho, Cottrey."
33:20,020;33:21,940;"Oh, that's right."
33:21,940;33:22,620;"It's one song."
33:22,620;33:23,380;"It's a lot of country."
33:23,380;33:24,460;"I love Cottrey."
33:24,460;33:25,580;"That's an NC State guy."
33:25,580;33:26,420;"Oh, there you go."
33:26,420;33:31,060;"Homegrown boy, Devin Fungis and then Corey Brown."
33:31,060;33:33,260;"Who is that cousin?"
33:33,260;33:34,420;"Bagley from."
33:34,420;33:36,620;"They called him Billy Brown."
33:36,620;33:37,540;"Yeah."
33:37,540;33:39,020;"Bailey Brown."
33:39,020;33:39,620;"Yeah."
33:39,620;33:42,700;"A bunch of dudes that really didn't really didn't have business starting."
33:42,700;33:44,620;"and then you fell much less on the Super Bowl team."
33:44,620;33:45,460;"- Yeah."
33:45,460;33:46,660;"- Yeah, you're not kidding."
33:46,660;33:49,420;"And after that, you're full back Mike Tolbert."
33:49,420;33:52,020;"- Tolbert, love Tolbert."
33:52,020;33:56,420;"- He went to the Pro Bowl that year apparently."
33:56,420;33:59,940;"- Yeah, Tolbert, Tolbert was good people."
33:59,940;34:03,580;"His impact was probably overstated on the field,"
34:03,580;34:05,140;"but he was good people."
34:05,140;34:06,660;"- That's fair."
34:06,660;34:09,420;"So here's just a little tidbit for you."
34:09,420;34:12,300;"Just you can take to your Panthers parties."
34:12,300;34:14,380;"Steve Smith, you know, his actual name."
34:14,380;34:21,020;"Stavon, Stavon Latral Smith."
34:21,020;34:21,860;"- Your state."
34:21,860;34:24,060;"- So there you go."
34:24,060;34:28,620;"You wanna know Ray Carus' real name?"
34:28,620;34:29,460;"(laughing)"
34:29,460;34:30,300;"Yes."
34:30,300;34:31,300;"- Oh."
34:31,300;34:35,860;"- Ray, Ray Lamar Theotis Wiggins."
34:35,860;34:36,700;"- Ray."
34:36,700;34:38,420;"- Wait, what?"
34:38,420;34:40,180;"- That's why it seems like Carus."
34:40,180;34:43,220;"I think it was his stepdad or something like that."
34:43,220;34:45,660;"- I mean, Loki, there's been a lot of contribs like that,"
34:45,660;34:47,980;"but she was gonna start up in the last year or two"
34:47,980;34:49,660;"'cause he got released from jail like he did."
34:49,660;34:50,580;"- He did, yeah."
34:50,580;34:51,900;"- Oh."
34:51,900;34:52,740;"- Did I not?"
34:52,740;34:57,740;"- Yeah, and then basically decided to continue being"
34:57,740;35:00,180;"a really awful person in the public eye."
35:00,180;35:01,420;"Like he started off with, he's like,"
35:01,420;35:03,300;"""You know what, I'm gonna apologize."""
35:03,300;35:05,260;"And then took that apology really south."
35:07,340;35:10,300;"How much do you guys remember to know the story?"
35:10,300;35:13,180;"- I read about it a bit today."
35:13,180;35:18,180;"- The headline is he paid a guy, a friend of his,"
35:18,180;35:23,340;"to do a drive-by shooting at the car of his girlfriend"
35:23,340;35:27,780;"who was pregnant with his eight-month-old unborn child."
35:27,780;35:31,620;"And so she dies."
35:31,620;35:34,900;"They do an emergency C-section to deliver the baby."
35:34,900;35:39,300;"the baby however had like some re-roll palsy and other things because it's been like 70"
35:39,300;35:44,620;"minutes without air oxygen during this whole process. Anyway, the baby is still alive."
35:44,620;35:48,140;"He's a guy. His name's Chancellor. He's alive now. His grandmother or the girl's mom has"
35:48,140;35:52,140;"taken care of him. This motherfucker Ray Cruth gets out of jail and has the gall to be like,"
35:52,140;35:56,060;"""Guys, what a apologize."" And also, I'd like to get custody of my son and everybody's like,"
35:56,060;35:59,460;"""Like Charlotte Lawson. Charlotte Lawson's fucking mine."""
35:59,460;36:01,460;"I can't imagine why."
36:01,460;36:06,740;"It's like hey, man. He's been 90 years in prison. He just quietly fucking disappeared somewhere. He's just Christ"
36:06,740;36:11,320;"That's pretty bad anyway, so that's how I'm going that's a thing"
36:11,320;36:20,140;"Well, all right, there's a new leader in the clubhouse for least favorite panther"
36:20,140;36:29,460;"There's never really an argument if you come down to that. No, it's really tarnish. He truly tarnished the franchise in a way that was like"
36:30,380;36:35,620;"I don't see anybody topping that yeah, he was the first round pick too. He was wow"
36:35,620;36:39,060;"Was any good on the field"
36:39,060;36:42,340;"He was for one season and then he was like injured and shit"
36:42,340;36:45,580;"All right"
36:45,580;36:48,700;"Yeah, I didn't put a much numbers all right fuck him"
36:48,700;36:56,380;"So Bob are they Patriots here number two team now or is it like the North Carolina Panthers and Buffalo?"
36:56,380;36:59,380;"Steve"
36:59,380;37:01,380;"Steve"
37:01,380;37:04,180;"Steve there's no such thing as a number two team"
37:04,180;37:11,060;"That's there are 30 there are 32 teams and you cheer for one and you don't cheer for the other 31. All right. Well, that's my philosophy"
37:11,060;37:16,340;"Let me tweak that a little bit. Um, are you going to root for cam Newton wherever he goes this year?"
37:16,340;37:18,900;"That's we've been having with Brady"
37:18,900;37:25,460;"I'm gonna I'm gonna hope cam does well because I really think he deserves a shot"
37:25,460;37:28,420;"I think if he gets healthy, I think he can be good and"
37:28,420;37:30,420;"and"
37:30,420;37:33,380;"and I won't I won't come to do well I'm not gonna cheer for his team but"
37:33,380;37:37,220;"I hope him does well and I think it's important that he does well"
37:37,220;37:40,020;"what if he goes to the pages then will you cheer for his team"
37:40,020;37:43,140;"and I got your first team now I've already made a clear Steve"
37:43,140;37:47,620;"but I will support him and I hope he does well what about your wife"
37:47,620;37:51,220;"and your two daughters I mean they're all pages fans"
37:51,220;37:57,220;"that's that's fine I don't I don't I don't support them in that"
37:57,220;37:59,080;"She's the support of dad and husband."
37:59,080;37:59,580;"God, Bob."
37:59,580;38:00,080;"Yeah."
38:00,080;38:02,020;"Not going to win."
38:02,020;38:03,180;"Yeah, I am."
38:03,180;38:05,560;"All right, transitioning that to my next question."
38:05,560;38:06,700;"Who's your favorite brother in law?"
38:06,700;38:12,000;"All right, let's let's roll off of that."
38:12,000;38:13,260;"Who's your least favorite brother?"
38:13,260;38:14,800;"There we go."
38:14,800;38:17,860;"Is it just based on this podcast or in general?"
38:17,860;38:19,300;"Do both."
38:19,300;38:20,900;"Yeah, great."
38:20,900;38:22,260;"Great."
38:22,260;38:23,340;"Yeah, I'm going to."
38:23,340;38:25,580;"You know, this is going to be lengthy."
38:25,580;38:29,300;"I'm on the podcast. I'm gonna start next. I'm gonna do an episode on this. All right"
38:29,300;38:33,580;"I love it"
38:33,580;38:38,020;"All right, well, we've kept you long enough away from your family"
38:38,020;38:41,180;"We appreciate you doing this Bob. Thanks for joining us"
38:41,180;38:44,460;"Indeed this has been great. Yeah"
38:44,460;38:49,300;"Hope the hope the game talk is what the game talk is as good as the prelude. Oh"
38:49,300;38:53,220;"It usually isn't but yes, I appreciate that"
38:53,900;38:55,900;"We didn't really talk about the game. Yeah"
38:55,900;39:02,820;"Fair enough, but I think we'll have to have you back the next time we talk about the Panthers because that will be in"
39:02,820;39:05,020;"2003 in the Super Bowl"
39:05,020;39:10,780;"Count me in so all right. Love it and this time. We'll actually have you on for like the whole game because that one is actually"
39:10,780;39:12,460;"Probably when you'll want to watch"
39:12,460;39:19,020;"Indeed cool. All right. Thanks a lot Bob. Thanks Bob. Thanks. Bye. It's Gary on talk to you soon"
39:23,100;39:28,580;"Guess we're back. I don't know how to transition out of that. I don't remember how we ended it. So thanks Bobby"
39:28,580;39:34,580;"It's week 17, you know, you're gonna transitions down. Yeah, the endy Jesus. I do but not for"
39:34,580;39:40,820;"Interviews because they haven't ever done one before it's a good point. Yeah, so I"
39:40,820;39:44,540;"Well, I guess now that Bobby has told us how much the"
39:44,540;39:47,180;"2001 Carolina Panthers have sucked"
39:47,180;39:52,280;"We should probably start there. Don't you think I was I was personally surprised at how"
39:53,020;40:02,380;"little I knew about the man there's for one and also that this was kind of their lowest"
40:02,380;40:07,300;"of the low moments in history. And then like when Bobby said, because I hadn't watched"
40:07,300;40:11,980;"the game when we did the interview and when Bobby said that there was only like what 16,000"
40:11,980;40:17,540;"people this game? Oh, yeah, it seemed like less. Yeah, I was going to say like, I don't"
40:17,540;40:22,980;"even think it was half that and of those, they were saying like 60% were Patriots fans."
40:22,980;40:28,980;"I will say that you said they quit on a team and they actually played pretty hard from one and 14 team"
40:28,980;40:32,580;"I thought it was like, you know, you see it in score"
40:32,580;40:36,500;"Which I don't forget what I was but I was a shitload to nothing and you're like wow"
40:36,500;40:41,700;"We just rolled them over right away, but it really wasn't like that. Yeah. Yeah, I thought that the first half"
40:41,700;40:43,700;"I thought they competed"
40:43,700;40:44,900;"definitely did"
40:44,900;40:47,940;"So the the second half was hot garbage"
40:48,500;40:54,100;"Football reference says it's the attendance was 71,000. I was gonna bring that up"
40:54,100;40:59,140;"No way because I looked up to get an actual number. Yes, it's 71,907"
40:59,140;41:03,500;"Maybe as a typo. It's supposed to be one seven instead of seven one. I"
41:03,500;41:08,060;"Mean maybe they sold that me tickets, but there is like they were it was empty"
41:08,060;41:12,900;"You would like look at the lower bowl and you see some people sitting at the top of the lower bowl"
41:12,900;41:14,900;"And you're like what are you doing move down"
41:15,300;41:18,860;"So it reminded me of the few games"
41:18,860;41:21,700;"MLS games I've gone to"
41:21,700;41:27,060;"Agilets stadium for like the revolution back in the day when you get free tickets because they couldn't sell it"
41:27,060;41:30,980;"I'd how Dave disrespect the reps like I'm not I'm just I'm just"
41:30,980;41:38,360;"Equating this where they would shut down the top bowl so that it wouldn't look as empty and they put it on one side of the fields"
41:38,360;41:40,460;"Yeah opposite the camera"
41:42,380;41:45,780;"Red's considered that too. They've like blocked off part of their upper bowl"
41:45,780;41:51,480;"Right like they've like put like permanent like fencing remember Greg. We're sitting against that fencing"
41:51,480;41:56,900;"Yes, he's behind us and then like it was like like chain link fenced and then like carps over it"
41:56,900;42:04,980;"Jesus so like to like have their percentage full be higher. Yeah, they were they were social distancing before it was cool"
42:04,980;42:09,780;"Ten years before it was cool"
42:09,780;42:15,780;"So yeah, a bit about these Panthers."
42:15,780;42:20,700;"I mean, you've heard a little bit from Bob already, but as we discussed there, they would"
42:20,700;42:27,140;"finish 1 in 15, which the commentators pointed out nicely at the end of this game that they"
42:27,140;42:30,500;"won their first game of the season and then went on to lose the rest of them."
42:30,500;42:35,620;"And that was the longest losing streak in an NFL season ever."
42:35,620;42:38,420;"Nobody had lost more than 15 games in a row."
42:38,420;42:44,420;"the lions or like hold my beer. Right. Eventually that would be broken a few years after this"
42:44,420;42:51,140;"but that was for a single season right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. For one season. It was the most"
42:51,140;42:57,220;"it was the longest losing streak in one season. Who has the longest losing streak ever? Is it"
42:57,220;43:02,260;"the old bucks or was it the lions? I guess the box. I think it's the box. Yeah. I agree."
43:02,260;43:07,460;"All the Browns. I don't know what theirs look like. Those two years where they wouldn't"
43:07,460;43:13,220;"one and 32. That's got to be up there, depending on when that win game."
43:13,220;43:19,060;"Because then they go one and 15 and then I went 16 the next year."
43:19,060;43:21,380;"I'm going to say the box because fuck the box."
43:21,380;43:25,580;"Yeah, there was like, I think I looked briefly and it was like 23 straight"
43:25,580;43:29,580;"games or something. That's not great."
43:29,580;43:34,220;"Yeah, we talked about George C. Fred already."
43:34,900;43:36,060;"Well, not anymore."
43:36,060;43:37,420;"They got braiding now."
43:37,420;43:39,580;"They're about to go on a 23 game winning streak."
43:39,580;43:44,700;"What was longer the bucks losing streak or the Patriots winning streak when they"
43:44,700;43:48,460;"went like was it 0304 or they won a ton in a row?"
43:48,460;43:49,820;"One in a row, right?"
43:49,820;43:50,740;"I believe it was."
43:50,740;43:53,540;"They did win a shitload in a row."
43:53,540;43:54,140;"I remember that."
43:54,140;43:55,660;"I think it was 21 in a row."
43:55,660;43:58,060;"That's the longest active NFL win streak."
43:58,060;43:59,100;"Yes."
43:59,100;44:01,980;"We're all time."
44:01,980;44:02,580;"Yeah."
44:02,580;44:03,140;"Yeah."
44:03,260;44:10,520;"And you could say the Patriots have the most of the longest single season winning streak as well because they won 18 games in the season."
44:10,520;44:11,820;"That's true."
44:11,820;44:21,740;"So I was, I was looking up the best, the best way to describe their season."
44:21,740;44:22,700;"Yeah."
44:22,700;44:27,260;"And I don't know if you've ever been on urban the source, but it's fucking awesome."
44:27,260;44:29,420;"Wait, there's an urban for source."
44:29,420;44:29,980;"Really?"
44:29,980;44:31,980;"Or just gives you like equivalent words."
44:32,180;44:34,180;"I only knew about the"
44:34,180;44:40,180;"Yeah, I do. I suggest you go to urban the source at some point because it's so funny. So I put in dumpster fire"
44:40,180;44:46,500;"Some of this shit is hilarious trash your face. Oh"
44:46,500;44:49,780;"Oh, both salad"
44:49,780;44:57,040;"The dead man's dumpster diving oh boy"
44:57,040;45:00,460;"Necro pyro bestiality"
45:01,620;45:06,360;"Darker as you go along Alaskan fire dragon"
45:06,360;45:08,900;"Lovito sewer"
45:08,900;45:16,220;"I can read the shit all day. There's like oh my god"
45:16,220;45:19,380;"Idea"
45:26,820;45:32,060;"This whole podcast has been worth it just for that one little nugget of knowledge."
45:32,060;45:32,860;"Right."
45:32,860;45:37,660;"I wish we knew this so we could ask Bobby that question of what better describes this"
45:37,660;45:41,100;"season of these four options."
45:41,100;45:42,260;"What would you choose?"
45:42,260;45:46,060;"Dumpster fire anal backcraft."
45:46,060;45:46,940;"What?"
45:46,940;45:47,620;"Yeah, the ones."
45:47,620;45:49,620;"I don't know."
45:49,620;45:52,580;"Sudo pyro homo necro beastie."
45:52,580;45:53,180;"El Yak."
45:53,180;45:55,140;"All right."
45:55,140;45:56,220;"Now we're getting crazy."
45:56,220;46:05,740;"Yeah. So speaking of dumps of fires, this coaching staff, we talked about George C."
46:05,740;46:10,540;"for already. Some of the other coaches you may recognize Mike McCoy. Remember"
46:10,540;46:19,980;"him? Chargers coach from like 2013, 2016. He was their wider receivers coach. And"
46:19,980;46:22,400;"Then also Greg Roman you might recognize"
46:22,400;46:30,460;"Who is currently the offensive coordinator for the Baltimore Ravens and that record"
46:30,460;46:33,920;"He's in high demand. He really is"
46:33,920;46:37,880;"He wasn't back then if you look at this offense"
46:37,880;46:41,060;"because I"
46:41,060;46:45,820;"Did my best to come up with names you guys on this offense there really aren't any"
46:46,620;46:53,420;"The winky man. Yeah, former Heisman winners. That what they said. Yeah, it was really good in college. Yeah, and"
46:53,420;46:56,380;"the"
46:56,380;47:03,300;"Who are the commentators the commentator duo of Kevin Harlan and Craig James our own Craig James were doing this game"
47:03,300;47:07,700;"I did I actually like them. Yeah, yeah, they did all right"
47:07,700;47:13,340;"And that's going from Andy you know, they were great. They're definitely not the A team though"
47:13,340;47:17,980;"I will say that and I think they knew it so they would just have fun with it, which is why right?"
47:17,980;47:23,260;"Like when he calls out the block like the on the touchdown run they got called back"
47:23,260;47:27,420;"Yeah, and then rest immediately. He's like what a great block like in the play"
47:27,420;47:30,060;"Yeah, yeah, that guy"
47:30,060;47:32,700;"Yeah, that's Compton"
47:32,700;47:36,540;"Yeah, there's some love Compton wearing the visor. It's like"
47:36,540;47:42,860;"like drizzling overcast in December. There's snow in North Carolina"
47:42,860;47:50,140;"got the visor on. Yeah, it was. It was like 36 degrees and like freezing rain and you could see"
47:50,140;47:55,340;"snow around the sidelines and stuff. Yeah. I don't think it's snow down there, Greg. I'm surprised"
47:55,340;47:59,420;"anybody was able to get to the stadium. Once he figured they would have shut down the state."
47:59,420;48:09,740;"So Chris Winky, fun fact, he spent six years at the Blue Jays before going to Florida State."
48:09,740;48:14,580;"So he was 26 when he enrolled at Florida State."
48:14,580;48:18,140;"So he must have been close to 30 by the time he got drafted."
48:18,140;48:22,740;"Because I remember that he was what was the other guy that from Oklahoma State"
48:22,740;48:24,180;"and the brown."
48:24,180;48:25,540;"Yes, Brandon Wina."
48:25,540;48:27,340;"He was the same type of guy."
48:27,340;48:28,740;"Yeah."
48:28,740;48:29,740;"Huh?"
48:29,740;48:34,300;"Didn't help him much that that time in the blue jays, I don't think"
48:34,300;48:36,460;"his completion percentage."
48:36,460;48:38,940;"I looked it up with 54% on the year."
48:38,940;48:41,520;"for the families."
48:41,520;48:44,320;"- I think that's average 56."
48:44,320;48:46,860;"- Yeah, that doesn't sound right."
48:46,860;48:48,280;"- That sounds low."
48:48,280;48:50,000;"- That sounds low."
48:50,000;48:51,520;"54 is not great."
48:51,520;48:52,360;"It's easy."
48:52,360;48:55,140;"He completes just barely one of every two passes."
48:55,140;48:58,520;"And a lot of those are to the other team."
48:58,520;49:01,120;"He had 11 touchdowns and 19 interceptions."
49:01,120;49:07,080;"- Yeah, he threw a couple of bad pick sixes in this game."
49:07,080;49:07,920;"Yeah."
49:07,920;49:10,460;"You threw more than a couple."
49:10,460;49:13,660;"He just got lucky that one of them got called back for holding on the return."
49:13,660;49:16,460;"The one the tie law was so bad though."
49:16,460;49:19,100;"Just not, not the second one."
49:19,100;49:20,700;"Like got deflected right."
49:20,700;49:22,140;"And you can call that on the field."
49:22,140;49:25,320;"It wasn't a great throw, but a little lucky, but yeah, one the tie"
49:25,320;49:25,840;"law."
49:25,840;49:27,340;"It's just awful."
49:27,340;49:27,940;"Yeah."
49:27,940;49:32,660;"So he just, I don't know if it's a, uh, a flaw of his that nobody knew about,"
49:32,660;49:34,900;"but the guy couldn't throw an out pattern to save his life."
49:35,580;49:39,420;"literally the reception that he threw was on an out pattern."
49:39,420;49:44,060;"And he just hit the defensive back right in the hands with nobody in front of him."
49:44,060;49:44,980;"Oh, yeah."
49:44,980;49:45,660;"No, nobody."
49:45,660;49:46,540;"Go."
49:46,540;49:46,980;"I did."
49:46,980;49:50,260;"I have a no here, but Steve Smith was a guy that's targeting."
49:50,260;49:51,820;"And this is rookie year."
49:51,820;49:54,420;"And Bobby said it took him a couple of years, figured out, I don't know,"
49:54,420;49:56,060;"Steve Smith flashed in this game."
49:56,060;49:58,180;"A little bumbled."
49:58,180;50:01,820;"Yeah, I was just going to say, so like Bob, who was saying,"
50:01,820;50:07,240;"see Smith's first few years was more of a kick returner and once the pro bowl for kick returns in this season"
50:07,240;50:13,820;"But his kick returning in his game was God awful awful like every time he I mean"
50:13,820;50:17,720;"there was a bunch of kickoffs page scored 38 points in this game and"
50:17,720;50:22,720;"Every single one of them. He ran directly into the nearest defender and"
50:22,720;50:27,260;"Got just ragdolled every time it felt like yeah"
50:27,740;50:29,980;"Like he was like as a receiver, he was pretty solid."
50:29,980;50:32,260;"I mean, he had that one big play that got called back."
50:32,260;50:32,860;"Yeah."
50:32,860;50:35,020;"He was, I have a note on here."
50:35,020;50:37,420;"He's spinning the ball down 31."
50:37,420;50:43,180;"Every time he caught the ball, he would, he would catch it near the sidelines."
50:43,180;50:48,340;"Instead of stepping out, he would hit the guy, the defender and try to like lower"
50:48,340;50:50,700;"shoulder and try to get knocked out of bounds anyway, because he's so small."
50:50,700;50:52,540;"And then spin the ball and start yapping."
50:52,540;50:53,340;"Yeah."
50:53,340;50:55,020;"I mean, that's 31 to six."
50:55,020;50:56,020;"Yeah."
50:56,620;50:58,260;"So until forever."
50:58,260;51:01,700;"Yeah, 100% compete 100% of the time."
51:01,700;51:06,660;"I will say there weren't many plays that I thought he was but whole naked open."
51:06,660;51:12,340;"It's an interesting way to describe naked, but sure."
51:12,340;51:14,380;"That was his quote, remember?"
51:14,380;51:16,260;"Yeah."
51:16,260;51:21,020;"They made the mistake of putting him behind a desk at a half time show."
51:21,020;51:25,780;"I don't know what gives him the idea that that would go well."
51:25,780;51:31,540;"I don't think that but I think that was this quote is you got to yeah something about being but all naked open."
51:31,540;51:37,020;"We talked about ad nauseam in the episode we're all together."
51:37,020;51:39,620;"Yes, Steve. Come on. Pay attention."
51:39,620;51:41,380;"No, I was thinking a lot."
51:41,380;51:42,060;"That episode."
51:42,060;51:46,060;"No kidding. Didn't show it all. Don't worry."
51:46,060;51:50,180;"I like I like him because he's like."
51:50,180;51:55,060;"He knows a lot of like false bravado in the NFL."
51:55,580;51:58,380;"Oh, yeah. The Josh Normans of the world."
51:58,380;52:00,180;"Yeah. The come at me, bros."
52:00,180;52:05,860;"Yeah. He strikes me as like a legitimate crazy man bravado"
52:05,860;52:11,020;"where he authentically believes he's that much better than everybody."
52:11,020;52:16,860;"Yeah. And I would I would be willing to bet that he would fight literally anyone."
52:16,860;52:18,820;"Yeah. Like a hammer."
52:18,820;52:21,980;"Yeah. Just just thinking he would be able to win every fight."
52:21,980;52:25,060;"Do you think T.O. Isn't that like how do you put T.O."
52:25,060;52:31,180;"to you always a bit self-aware for me you know yeah similar but not the same"
52:31,180;52:35,260;"more like a new what he was doing almost yeah he knew what he was doing he was"
52:35,260;52:39,640;"he was like playing the media to a certain degree oh definitely whereas"
52:39,640;52:44,480;"Steve Smith is just like he's out of his mind yeah I think he was more of a"
52:44,480;52:48,520;"showman yeah like he was gonna put on a show and he was talented enough to do"
52:48,520;52:52,580;"that like he was gonna pull the Sharpie out of his sock or go stand on the the"
52:52,580;52:54,900;"the star and Dallas, you know, that's fair."
52:54,900;53:00,940;"Who else is authentic crazy man?"
53:00,940;53:03,660;"Brevada, which was the closest comp to that."
53:03,660;53:07,380;"Heinz, Ronnie Harrison's always struck me as like that."
53:07,380;53:08,860;"Now he's too quiet."
53:08,860;53:09,900;"Yeah, he was."
53:09,900;53:10,460;"But he was."
53:10,460;53:13,180;"He was fearless though."
53:13,180;53:13,620;"Yeah."
53:13,620;53:14,060;"Oh, yeah."
53:14,060;53:15,780;"In the same way that Steve Smith is."
53:15,780;53:19,060;"Hmm."
53:19,060;53:21,900;"Actually wrote a, I wrote a blog on it, Andy."
53:22,460;53:24,220;"You did on what on Steve Smith?"
53:24,220;53:28,060;"It was actually on Jalen Ramsey when he was being a clown."
53:28,060;53:29,900;"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
53:29,900;53:33,380;"What's our website called Brownboro Sports."
53:33,380;53:35,860;"She probably didn't know that."
53:35,860;53:39,740;"Apparently you've been writing recently, too."
53:39,740;53:44,300;"Isn't it?"
53:44,300;53:46,780;"Isn't it linked on the Patriots dynasty site as well?"
53:46,780;53:50,740;"Maybe."
53:50,740;53:51,740;"I don't know."
53:52,220;53:54,820;"Did you even read the blog I wrote recently?"
53:54,820;53:57,620;"They have a blog recently."
53:57,620;53:59,740;"Yeah, I have about Alex van pal."
53:59,740;54:01,500;"No, I didn't know you wrote it."
54:01,500;54:06,620;"Yeah, it's a the title of the blog is Alex van pal is your wife's favorite player."
54:06,620;54:13,020;"And it's just, it's not many words and it's just pictures of him looking like a stud."
54:13,020;54:20,100;"That the last thing you have friends could read."
54:20,300;54:22,940;"Yeah, the 50 shades of Rex or whatever it was."
54:22,940;54:24,460;"That's when it started getting weird."
54:24,460;54:25,460;"Yeah."
54:25,460;54:26,980;"That was when it started getting good."
54:26,980;54:29,820;"Yeah, then he stopped writing."
54:29,820;54:31,140;"Oh, Kobe Bryant."
54:31,140;54:33,820;"He's another one that was like authentic."
54:33,820;54:34,940;"Oh, yes."
54:34,940;54:35,700;"Yeah. Yeah."
54:35,700;54:36,900;"That's a great comp."
54:36,900;54:37,900;"Yeah."
54:37,900;54:43,140;"What about Pedro?"
54:43,140;54:46,100;"He's also a little quiet."
54:46,100;54:49,300;"He wasn't really though."
54:49,300;54:52,020;"But Manny to to there is a good comp."
54:52,020;54:53,820;"Yeah, I would give you that."
54:53,820;54:56,140;"Maybe like putting on a show."
54:56,140;54:59,860;"All right."
54:59,860;55:05,020;"Uh, speak, speaking of the Panthers game way the fuck off track yet again."
55:05,020;55:09,620;"Um, any other names you guys recognized?"
55:09,620;55:15,540;"Uh, I, I, I, I, I did not recognize was there running back."
55:15,540;55:17,740;"Richard, yeah."
55:18,340;55:19,780;"Did what was his final stat line?"
55:19,780;55:22,260;"I was a lot."
55:22,260;55:24,900;"He was that's that check."
55:24,900;55:26,900;"Crushing on though."
55:26,900;55:31,020;"He played a hundred yards by like mid second quarter."
55:31,020;55:34,100;"Twenty one carries a hundred and sixty eight rushing yards."
55:34,100;55:34,900;"Yeah."
55:34,900;55:38,980;"And like a hundred of those plus came by in the first quarter and a half."
55:38,980;55:39,460;"Yeah."
55:39,460;55:40,900;"That's not like it is."
55:40,900;55:41,820;"It was a close game."
55:41,820;55:47,340;"So just for some context, he led the lead the team in rushing"
55:47,740;55:49,580;"with 665 yards."
55:49,580;55:51,940;"And you got a hundred and seven."
55:51,940;55:53,980;"And he got almost out of the 70 in this game."
55:53,980;55:55,180;"Oh my God."
55:55,180;55:58,420;"Yeah, they had the worst rushing offense in the league and they're sitting there"
55:58,420;56:00,060;"just gashing the pages over and over."
56:00,060;56:00,860;"Yeah."
56:00,860;56:03,300;"Like we fumbled on the one yard line, right?"
56:03,300;56:04,380;"Yeah."
56:04,380;56:08,660;"So they were yeah, they were like three and gold goes and got a field"
56:08,660;56:10,060;"a lot of it or some shit like that."
56:10,060;56:11,220;"Yeah."
56:11,220;56:12,220;"So yeah."
56:12,220;56:16,180;"So the first round of the Patriots had like they got first in goal from like the"
56:16,180;56:17,140;"four or the five."
56:17,140;56:25,480;"And they actually scored the touchdown that you talked about, but they got called back for holding my Compton on the fantastic block that Craig Jameson."
56:25,480;56:28,200;"And then they end up settling for field goal."
56:28,200;56:36,320;"And then like a few plays later, Winky throws his first pick six of the game."
56:36,320;56:40,600;"Yeah, by law, who outrun Steve Smith, which I thought was pretty cool."
56:40,800;56:46,040;"If he's diff arm on the way, if you did a visual of that pick six,"
56:46,040;56:49,200;"just imagine the one on the Super Bowl on the other side of the field."
56:49,200;56:50,520;"Yeah."
56:50,520;56:52,000;"Because they are the same thing."
56:52,000;56:52,800;"Oh, row."
56:52,800;56:53,400;"Yeah."
56:53,400;56:55,280;"That throws it behind their seat or title."
56:55,280;56:56,040;"I just catches it."
56:56,040;56:56,400;"Exactly."
56:56,400;56:59,640;"Chris would be wasn't pressured at all and just through a terrible pass."
56:59,640;57:00,600;"That's true."
57:00,600;57:05,600;"Um, and so they get the, they get the ball back and literally the next play"
57:05,600;57:08,400;"when he throws another, what should have been a pick six?"
57:08,400;57:08,840;"Yeah."
57:08,840;57:15,720;"Otis Smith, which only wasn't because it got called back for holding on the return by whoever the defender was"
57:15,720;57:19,900;"So the paths get the ball unlike on the 35"
57:19,900;57:25,400;"convert a fourth in two get to fourth in goal like the two and"
57:25,400;57:31,840;"As Antoine Smith is running into the end zone. He fumbles it on the goal line and the Panthers recover"
57:31,840;57:35,320;"Then like their first"
57:35,480;57:39,400;"Play from the one-yard line was a hand off to that dude and he ran to like the 25"
57:39,400;57:44,600;"Then they give you yeah, like the 45 and this is like oh my god. Yeah"
57:44,600;57:47,320;"Yeah, it was"
57:47,320;57:49,320;"He was basically"
57:49,320;57:51,560;"The entire Panthers offense"
57:51,560;57:54,280;"Me entire game really"
57:54,280;58:00,000;"Yeah, he had more rushing yards than winky at passing yards"
58:04,560;58:07,900;"And he stopped getting the ball on the second quarter to it was crazy"
58:07,900;58:10,520;"Yeah, the guy down so bad"
58:10,520;58:15,220;"It was not great. Yeah, Carolina finished with 193 total rushing yards"
58:15,220;58:18,980;"Which is brutal and no touchdowns"
58:18,980;58:24,280;"But the name of the game was turnovers"
58:24,280;58:27,000;"Carolina had six of them"
58:27,000;58:29,400;"To the Patriots three which still not"
58:29,920;58:35,760;"I'm saying yeah, but I mean, I don't know how you guys felt about this, but watching this game. I didn't think I"
58:35,760;58:38,120;"Can see how this team on the Super Bowl?"
58:38,120;58:44,480;"Because like you said go in the middle the this game is absolute drumming ends 38 to 6 and"
58:44,480;58:51,000;"Like oh yeah, I feel like I remember them just like beating the shit out of the Panthers and kind of"
58:51,000;58:54,720;"in the passing defense. Yeah, because the"
58:56,280;59:01,040;"Pages defense outscored the Panthers offense technically because they had two pick sixes"
59:01,040;59:02,800;"but"
59:02,800;59:07,880;"They were getting gashed in the run and the commentators were talking about how you know they have to worry about"
59:07,880;59:10,360;"he was the Steelers running game and"
59:10,360;59:16,040;"The Ravens as well who'd won the Super Bowl the year before you don't want to you don't want to face them and all that stuff"
59:16,040;59:19,920;"Right exactly well. I mean I"
59:19,920;59:22,200;"think it was like"
59:22,200;59:25,880;"You can if you look at it from like Bella Chex view right where like"
59:25,880;59:30,080;"complimentary football and it's not just about the off because the offense was not very good"
59:30,080;59:33,240;"But there is a you know the defense"
59:33,240;59:40,600;"The they punted and got him down to the one right and then the defense held them and then they punted it too far and Troy Brown took that to the house"
59:40,600;59:42,280;"and that's like"
59:42,280;59:46,880;"See fence the special teams creates defense creates special teams to create touch down blah blah blah"
59:46,880;59:49,740;"Steve I was gonna make the same point"
59:50,880;59:57,480;"Damn, I believe I had a written down in my notes Bella check football"
59:57,480;01:00:03,560;"It was actually a very similar return to that Steelers game"
01:00:03,560;01:00:09,860;"Yeah, very astute of you Steve and then Troy took it right up the gut and then you're like"
01:00:09,860;01:00:11,700;"There's the punter gonna get him. Yeah"
01:00:11,700;01:00:19,560;"Dude as soon as you guys pass that first wave there wasn't somebody within like 20 yards of Troy Brown"
01:00:19,560;01:00:23,220;"That has Troy Brown ever been tackled by a punter kicker"
01:00:23,220;01:00:26,600;"Probably not never"
01:00:26,600;01:00:34,700;"Because he's never really were turned a kick against Adam and Terry apparently that's right. Yeah, oh that would be"
01:00:34,700;01:00:38,540;"That would be a matchup. I hope the home a drill with"
01:00:44,280;01:00:46,920;"Troy Brown and current after the very that would be amazing."
01:00:46,920;01:00:49,080;"- My money's on current Troy Brown, I don't care."
01:00:49,080;01:00:49,920;"- Yeah."
01:00:49,920;01:00:51,280;"- Troy Brown, he's shifty, man."
01:00:51,280;01:00:56,440;"- Well, he's our cousin, you got it bad on him."
01:00:56,440;01:00:57,400;"- Well, I guess."
01:00:57,400;01:00:58,840;"Well, speaking of Troy Brown,"
01:00:58,840;01:01:00,040;"this is probably a good time to bring this up."
01:01:00,040;01:01:03,120;"He was playing like in front of his family."
01:01:03,120;01:01:04,680;"They were talking about how..."
01:01:04,680;01:01:05,520;"- Yeah."
01:01:05,520;01:01:07,880;"- I think it was in the paper that he,"
01:01:07,880;01:01:11,360;"like this, because he's from, I think he's from North Carolina."
01:01:11,360;01:01:12,800;"- We stat-chuck this."
01:01:12,800;01:01:14,480;"I'm gonna keep getting rid of some stuff."
01:01:14,480;01:01:16,680;"- I honestly don't care about the fact"
01:01:16,680;01:01:18,400;"that there's two Carolinas."
01:01:18,400;01:01:19,560;"No offense, Greg."
01:01:19,560;01:01:20,880;"I mean, you can take offense if you want to really care."
01:01:20,880;01:01:23,280;"- You don't care that there's two?"
01:01:23,280;01:01:25,520;"- I do, but I don't care to,"
01:01:25,520;01:01:27,240;"if somebody tells me they're from one of them,"
01:01:27,240;01:01:29,440;"I'm not going to remember which one."
01:01:29,440;01:01:31,640;"- They're culturally very different, Andy."
01:01:31,640;01:01:33,120;"Maybe you should read a book."
01:01:33,120;01:01:35,560;"- Not about the Carolinas."
01:01:35,560;01:01:37,280;"- Get your head out of your ass."
01:01:37,280;01:01:40,960;"Get your dick out of your hand."
01:01:40,960;01:01:43,960;"Oh boy."
01:01:43,960;01:01:47,360;"We had to eat, baby."
01:01:47,360;01:01:53,360;"So Troy Brown comes home to his home state."
01:01:53,360;01:01:56,760;"And they're talking about how he bought like a hundred tickets for this game for"
01:01:56,760;01:01:57,760;"like friends and family."
01:01:57,760;01:02:01,060;"And I think he brought like a Pee Wee football team in the game and something"
01:02:01,060;01:02:01,560;"like that."
01:02:01,560;01:02:08,260;"And this was a great game to watch if you're a Troy Brown fan."
01:02:08,760;01:02:11,320;"Like I said, he had that 61 year apartment turn for a touchdown."
01:02:11,320;01:02:16,860;"He also eventually set the all time Patriot single season reception record,"
01:02:16,860;01:02:20,800;"which if you remember, it was like, I think it was like right before the half."
01:02:20,800;01:02:26,640;"And he had to catch that, that set the record, but then it got challenged and overturned"
01:02:26,640;01:02:27,920;"because he didn't completely catch it."
01:02:27,920;01:02:30,520;"And then they kept like showing him the camera on him."
01:02:30,520;01:02:32,280;"He just like laughing and smiling."
01:02:32,280;01:02:34,360;"You can tell he's like kind of pissed off."
01:02:34,360;01:02:35,040;"It doesn't want to show."
01:02:35,040;01:02:36,920;"He's like, God, that was that fucking record."
01:02:37,360;01:02:38,080;"And the only did it."
01:02:38,080;01:02:39,560;"They didn't say exactly."
01:02:39,560;01:02:40,060;"Yeah."
01:02:40,060;01:02:42,760;"And it didn't happen much longer afterwards, but."
01:02:42,760;01:02:47,200;"Yeah, no, like video montage."
01:02:47,200;01:02:49,600;"I was expecting it with Drew Brees."
01:02:49,600;01:02:52,960;"They stopped the fucking game and like the unplug out there."
01:02:52,960;01:02:54,080;"Where's Troy Brown's black?"
01:02:54,080;01:02:54,600;"Dude, I."
01:02:54,600;01:02:57,440;"Oh, that was the worst."
01:02:57,440;01:02:58,960;"They did it again this year too."
01:02:58,960;01:03:03,040;"Oh, when you did the touchdown record this year?"
01:03:03,040;01:03:04,040;"Yeah."
01:03:04,040;01:03:06,320;"No, no, no, no, the regular season touchdown record."
01:03:06,320;01:03:06,680;"Yeah."
01:03:06,680;01:03:11,680;"right. On a Monday night game. And I had friggin Michael Thomas."
01:03:11,680;01:03:15,920;"Who's the last? And they just pulled them in like the second quarter."
01:03:15,920;01:03:21,320;"It was like 38 nothing. And all he announces would talk about his"
01:03:21,320;01:03:24,500;"Drew Brees. Of course. Yeah. I was so mad."
01:03:24,500;01:03:30,240;"But back to why this is a great Troy Brown game is that in Tuan Smith"
01:03:30,240;01:03:33,180;"running touchdown. Like I think it was the first touchdown for the"
01:03:33,180;01:03:38,360;"conference order along. Troy Brown has his guy the"
01:03:38,360;01:03:41,420;"cornerback on like roller skates and he's like pushing"
01:03:41,420;01:03:44,020;"him all the way back in the end zone from like 25 yards"
01:03:44,020;01:03:46,900;"out. Oh yeah. That's classic Troy Brown right"
01:03:46,900;01:03:50,540;"there. Just blocking like a beast on the edge to get"
01:03:50,540;01:03:53,060;"one untouched and right. Yeah."
01:03:53,060;01:03:57,780;"There's also a good tie log game. It was a great"
01:03:57,780;01:04:01,500;"tough. I thought I thought it was a fantastic Otis Smith"
01:04:01,500;01:04:06,500;"game. He had two picks, which technically returned both for a touchdown. One guy called back."
01:04:06,500;01:04:10,660;"He broke up a ton of deep passes. We probably should have had like three or four picks in this"
01:04:10,660;01:04:20,140;"game. He just can't catch. And I was going to say this for my best, but there was one play where"
01:04:20,140;01:04:26,500;"he was lined up on the far side of the field and he came on a corner blitz and you got to watch"
01:04:26,500;01:04:30,700;"the entire thing unfold and it felt like watching like a"
01:04:30,700;01:04:35,140;"National Geographic thing where you can have the line like"
01:04:35,140;01:04:38,500;"hunting like coming down on the on the prey. You're like,"
01:04:38,500;01:04:40,380;"always going to get him. He's going to get him. You better"
01:04:40,380;01:04:42,700;"throw that football and Chris Winky just didn't even feel"
01:04:42,700;01:04:47,660;"like for a second. You got lit up. That was that was just"
01:04:47,660;01:04:50,340;"fantastic television. Yeah, because I was not a camera"
01:04:50,340;01:04:56,300;"angle and everything. Yeah. So I have a note on here."
01:04:56,300;01:05:03,780;"That missed tackle by Winky and then the high step pick six that's Otis is like pick six in the fourth quarter"
01:05:03,780;01:05:06,500;"Yeah, is the gift of Winky's career"
01:05:06,500;01:05:09,540;"You think so get a sum it up"
01:05:09,540;01:05:12,860;"Hey, you're great in the pros, but then"
01:05:12,860;01:05:18,660;"Down 31 six make it 31 eight week your third pick six of the game"
01:05:18,660;01:05:23,980;"Yes"
01:05:23,980;01:05:32,180;"No, no, not the NFL to breath then winky"
01:05:32,180;01:05:42,860;"Nicely done. You just come up with these are these are the existing. Oh, no, Chris. I wish I wish I were an Oscar Meyer winky"
01:05:42,860;01:05:46,740;"Yeah, you're you're fine. Oh"
01:05:47,980;01:05:53,780;"Is digging deep for these he's up in Zobo. It's a website called the berman files"
01:05:53,780;01:05:59,940;"No, it is you you hear a name like winky and you're like there's a nickname for that"
01:05:59,940;01:06:09,020;"Yeah, they're all amazing websites today. I know right. I will have to put all these links in the show notes so that other people can"
01:06:09,020;01:06:13,980;"Oh, there was one there was one where I didn't want to interrupt you guys on the"
01:06:13,980;01:06:14,480;"Yeah."
01:06:14,480;01:06:18,980;"We'll also."
01:06:18,980;01:06:19,420;"Yeah."
01:06:19,420;01:06:21,500;"So the dumpster fire one."
01:06:21,500;01:06:25,100;"Purple-headed Christian meat missile."
01:06:25,100;01:06:28,460;"How does that have anything to do with dumpster fire?"
01:06:28,460;01:06:29,980;"Who knows, dude."
01:06:29,980;01:06:33,380;"It's just sometimes words go well together."
01:06:33,380;01:06:36,060;"Yeah, give me that one more time."
01:06:36,060;01:06:38,100;"Purple-headed Christian meat missile."
01:06:38,100;01:06:43,180;"Kirk Cousins' real name."
01:06:43,180;01:06:44,380;"This nickname in high school."
01:06:44,380;01:06:47,260;"Holy shit."
01:06:47,260;01:06:49,560;"Whoo."
01:06:49,560;01:06:53,320;"No, I have one more thing about Troy Brown."
01:06:53,320;01:06:57,940;"Um, that I forgot to bring up at the beginning of this and before we get"
01:06:57,940;01:07:04,220;"sidetracked again, uh, before this game, um, pro bowl was"
01:07:04,220;01:07:08,700;"renounced Brady and Maloy both made the pro bowl, but Troy Brown didn't,"
01:07:08,700;01:07:12,000;"which is kind of bullshit because he had like one of the best seasons."
01:07:12,700;01:07:16,500;"receiving in the league and he was also like yeah exactly."
01:07:16,500;01:07:18,500;"So, um,"
01:07:18,500;01:07:23,420;"there's a Boston Globe article about it and everybody was pissed for him."
01:07:23,420;01:07:23,920;"Apparently."
01:07:23,920;01:07:27,020;"And, uh, this is what the, the globe had to say."
01:07:27,020;01:07:31,040;"His friends and fans were angry upon learning Troy Brown had been overlooked"
01:07:31,040;01:07:33,440;"for the AAC Pro Bowl team, but not Brown himself."
01:07:33,440;01:07:36,900;"No big deal said Brown who will officially be named an alternate to the"
01:07:36,900;01:07:37,980;"Pro Bowl later this week."
01:07:37,980;01:07:40,540;"There are a lot of great players who were selected ahead of me."
01:07:40,540;01:07:42,020;"There's nothing I can say about it."
01:07:42,260;01:07:44,900;"A lot of guys in here on the team weren't happy about it,"
01:07:44,900;01:07:46,460;"but it's out of my control."
01:07:46,460;01:07:48,020;"The important thing is that I have the respect"
01:07:48,020;01:07:50,660;"of my teammates and that we're heading into the playoffs"
01:07:50,660;01:07:52,500;"and trying to get to the Super Bowl."
01:07:52,500;01:07:54,460;"I'm not upset or angry or anything like that."
01:07:54,460;01:07:55,980;"I've just tried to go out every week"
01:07:55,980;01:07:58,900;"and do whatever it takes to help the team."
01:07:58,900;01:08:00,180;"I can Troy Brown, man."
01:08:00,180;01:08:02,660;"Oh, I give a hundred and 10%."
01:08:02,660;01:08:03,500;"Fucking love him."
01:08:03,500;01:08:05,020;"That's just who he is though."
01:08:05,020;01:08:06,620;"Oh, yeah."
01:08:06,620;01:08:07,900;"He's like, oh, this is cool."
01:08:07,900;01:08:08,740;"That's okay."
01:08:09,620;01:08:14,300;"I was always with my favorite Patience player forever. Yeah."
01:08:14,300;01:08:19,580;"Have you seen that Brendan Fraser movie where he's like the sweaty guy in the locker room?"
01:08:19,580;01:08:22,300;"Boy Brown is the sweaty guy."
01:08:22,300;01:08:26,100;"No, Brendan Fraser is where we tie in the same."
01:08:26,100;01:08:32,260;"Yeah, where is it? They're interviewing him and he's talking about, oh, I just gave 110%."
01:08:32,260;01:08:37,620;"That sounds familiar. What? Never mind."
01:08:37,620;01:08:38,880;"Do you cut this fire?"
01:08:38,880;01:08:46,080;"But I'm going to send you guys the link after and you'll be like, oh, man, that's funny."
01:08:46,080;01:08:51,760;"And every time I hear a player give him a bullshit response like that."
01:08:51,760;01:08:55,260;"That's all I don't think that's right."
01:08:55,260;01:08:56,100;"Brown is bullsey."
01:08:56,100;01:08:57,660;"Yeah, that's just who he's always been though."
01:08:57,660;01:08:59,040;"That's why I like bell check."
01:08:59,040;01:08:59,240;"Love."
01:08:59,240;01:09:02,940;"I mean, that could have been bell check, like, wrote that response for him."
01:09:02,940;01:09:03,680;"Right."
01:09:03,680;01:09:05,740;"All I care about is winning."
01:09:05,740;01:09:07,580;"I don't care about individual accolades."
01:09:07,580;01:09:11,500;"I just set my team, you know, we're going to the playoffs, right?"
01:09:11,500;01:09:16,420;"Like, yeah, that's classic Belichick and I'll take a load there for them, right?"
01:09:16,420;01:09:22,220;"I don't care about the roster bonus I get for the pro bowl, you know,"
01:09:22,220;01:09:24,300;"couple extra million."
01:09:24,300;01:09:26,420;"I just, I just like, it was just happy with play."
01:09:26,420;01:09:28,460;"I meant a drama."
01:09:28,460;01:09:28,740;"Great."
01:09:28,740;01:09:30,780;"Brown read his read his biography."
01:09:30,780;01:09:35,300;"I have not read that handy melodice to me."
01:09:35,300;01:09:35,860;"If you have it."
01:09:36,940;01:09:37,780;"Yeah, I can get it to you."
01:09:37,780;01:09:43,260;"It's a, I don't think it was written by Troy Brown, but it kind of has a feel"
01:09:43,260;01:09:45,300;"like it was so I know we had a hand in it."
01:09:45,300;01:09:47,260;"It's got some interesting stuff in it."
01:09:47,260;01:09:50,700;"I would hope you had a hand in it."
01:09:50,700;01:09:52,300;"It was very well."
01:09:52,300;01:09:53,940;"I think it was like ghost written for him, you know?"
01:09:53,940;01:09:54,940;"Yeah."
01:09:54,940;01:09:58,820;"It still it still sounds like Troy Brown is what I'm saying."
01:09:58,820;01:10:00,420;"It's a good book."
01:10:00,420;01:10:03,940;"Oh, Greg, I have a stat check note."
01:10:05,220;01:10:07,980;"What like, what was the last coach or what other coaches were"
01:10:07,980;01:10:08,780;"traded for a pick?"
01:10:08,780;01:10:10,780;"Because the commentators are talking about how Belljack"
01:10:10,780;01:10:11,780;"was traded for a pick."
01:10:11,780;01:10:12,700;"He was."
01:10:12,700;01:10:13,700;"Docker Rivers."
01:10:13,700;01:10:15,900;"And Gruden is the obvious answer, right?"
01:10:15,900;01:10:16,460;"Grooden."
01:10:16,460;01:10:17,900;"Who we'll see next week."
01:10:17,900;01:10:20,700;"But has everyone anybody since then?"
01:10:20,700;01:10:21,620;"Now I can remember."
01:10:21,620;01:10:23,860;"Docker Rivers."
01:10:23,860;01:10:25,700;"Was he?"
01:10:25,700;01:10:26,660;"Yeah."
01:10:26,660;01:10:27,220;"Yeah."
01:10:27,220;01:10:30,900;"I can't think of any off top of my head."
01:10:30,900;01:10:33,540;"I think about how many guns he really."
01:10:33,540;01:10:34,180;"Yeah."
01:10:34,180;01:10:38,180;"Oh wait, no, that's the Gerudin one."
01:10:38,180;01:10:39,180;"Wait."
01:10:39,180;01:10:40,180;"Yeah."
01:10:40,180;01:10:42,180;"Oh, here we go."
01:10:42,180;01:10:45,180;"Because they're like, yeah, I'll attract."
01:10:45,180;01:10:47,180;"And that's what grew up."
01:10:47,180;01:10:50,180;"Her med words, apparently."
01:10:50,180;01:10:53,180;"Who paid a pick for her?"
01:10:53,180;01:10:57,180;"So knowing Kansas City was interested in hiring him to succeed the retiring Dick for meal,"
01:10:57,180;01:10:59,740;"interested in hiring him to succeed the retiring Dick Fermil,"
01:10:59,740;01:11:02,060;"Edward attempted to strong arm the Jets into a contract"
01:11:02,060;01:11:05,700;"extension and include a raise. His move didn't work. The two"
01:11:05,700;01:11:08,060;"teams eventually settle on a deal in which Kansas City sent"
01:11:08,060;01:11:12,000;"the Jets a fourth, a fourth pick. I was a fourth pick or a"
01:11:12,000;01:11:14,900;"fourth round pick in exchange to release Edwards from his"
01:11:14,900;01:11:15,540;"contract."
01:11:15,540;01:11:20,900;"My home grin from the Packers to Seahawks. Eight year contract"
01:11:20,900;01:11:23,460;"value at $4 million a year in total control over football"
01:11:23,460;01:11:30,420;"operations, lured Hombre into Ciala 99. Hombre was not only coach, but also executive vice"
01:11:30,420;01:11:34,740;"president for the operations and general manager. The Packers received the Seahawks second round"
01:11:34,740;01:11:40,420;"pick 47th overall and the 99 draft. And to build Parcels."
01:11:40,420;01:11:51,300;"Yeah. Yep. He so Hombre was pre-bell check, but post-parcels? No."
01:11:53,300;01:11:55,500;"Uh, home, it was home."
01:11:55,500;01:12:00,100;"It was 99 and Parcells was right around then, right?"
01:12:00,100;01:12:01,100;"Seven."
01:12:01,100;01:12:02,500;"Yeah."
01:12:02,500;01:12:04,900;"So this is good."
01:12:04,900;01:12:06,700;"Uh, blah, blah."
01:12:06,700;01:12:09,700;"Yeah."
01:12:09,700;01:12:10,100;"Oh, yeah."
01:12:10,100;01:12:13,500;"So he just named Bill Belichick Parcells, some systems head coach and sign"
01:12:13,500;01:12:14,700;"Parcells as a consultant."
01:12:14,700;01:12:18,400;"The Patriots balked in NFL Commissioner Paul Tagli boo worked a deal."
01:12:18,400;01:12:22,300;"They gave the Patriots the Jets third and fourth round picks in 97, a second"
01:12:22,300;01:12:27,300;"and a first round in '99."
01:12:27,300;01:12:32,660;"On top of that, the Jets also donated $300,000 to a Patriots charity in exchange for New"
01:12:32,660;01:12:34,660;"England releasing Parcells."
01:12:34,660;01:12:40,700;"Okay, so for Parcells, we got a first, a second, a third and a fourth?"
01:12:40,700;01:12:41,700;"Yes."
01:12:41,700;01:12:42,700;"Wow."
01:12:42,700;01:12:46,820;"And $300,000 donated to a Patriots charity."
01:12:46,820;01:12:49,820;"And then Bellcheckers just the first rounder, right?"
01:12:49,820;01:12:58,060;"that we check was I believe so here we go. The Patriots were awarded."
01:12:58,060;01:13:00,020;"What?"
01:13:00,020;01:13:05,860;"The Patriots were awarded the Jets fifth round pick in 2001 and seventh round pick in 2002."
01:13:05,860;01:13:08,500;"That doesn't make sense."
01:13:08,500;01:13:14,980;"Oh okay now here we go NFL commissioner Paul Taglova awarded the Jets the Patriots first"
01:13:14,980;01:13:18,820;"round pick in 2000 and fourth and seventh round pick in 2001."
01:13:18,820;01:13:22,620;"And the Patriots got the Jets fifth round picking 01 and seventh"
01:13:22,620;01:13:23,460;"round picking 0-2."
01:13:23,460;01:13:24,500;"So some late picks."
01:13:24,500;01:13:26,620;"First and a first."
01:13:26,620;01:13:30,300;"This is like a you don't see coaches being traded."
01:13:30,300;01:13:32,260;"Like it does not happen."
01:13:32,260;01:13:33,580;"15 years."
01:13:33,580;01:13:34,860;"It's basically those five."
01:13:34,860;01:13:35,340;"Yeah."
01:13:35,340;01:13:35,860;"Yeah."
01:13:35,860;01:13:39,300;"And two or like one same guys going back and forth between the"
01:13:39,300;01:13:39,780;"patients."
01:13:39,780;01:13:40,460;"Well, Bell check."
01:13:40,460;01:13:44,820;"Parcels, Holngren, all within four years."
01:13:44,820;01:13:46,820;"Yeah, keep it taken."
01:13:46,820;01:13:51,820;"So maybe that was the coach trading era of the NFL."
01:13:51,820;01:13:53,820;"- Only if that'll ever come back?"
01:13:53,820;01:13:54,820;"Probably not."
01:13:54,820;01:13:58,820;"I think it was harder to find a franchise QB or a franchise coach."
01:13:58,820;01:14:02,820;"- Question."
01:14:02,820;01:14:06,820;"- I guess that goes back to question."
01:14:06,820;01:14:09,820;"Would you rather start a team with Belichick or Brady?"
01:14:09,820;01:14:13,820;"- Well, at this point, I think it's somewhat obvious, right?"
01:14:13,820;01:14:16,020;"Brady has a couple of years left."
01:14:16,020;01:14:17,820;"I'll check has however long you want."
01:14:17,820;01:14:19,340;"I'm at like from the beginning."
01:14:19,340;01:14:20,180;"Right."
01:14:20,180;01:14:20,900;"I was one."
01:14:20,900;01:14:23,740;"I probably want the coach, I would think."
01:14:23,740;01:14:29,140;"Let me just look at what's his name from the Chiefs."
01:14:29,140;01:14:29,980;"Andy Reed."
01:14:29,980;01:14:31,900;"Yeah, you like."
01:14:31,900;01:14:35,100;"He's he's he's he's been able to do it."
01:14:35,100;01:14:35,940;"It's yes."
01:14:35,940;01:14:37,820;"He's elevated any team he's been on."
01:14:37,820;01:14:38,340;"Yeah."
01:14:38,340;01:14:40,300;"I think you can say the same with Bell Parcells too."
01:14:40,300;01:14:42,740;"Parcells would always create playoff teams."
01:14:42,740;01:14:49,160;"You never quite as successful without Bellin Check, but he was still you took the Cowboys and playoffs, right?"
01:14:49,160;01:14:52,620;"Same with the Jets took them to play us. Yeah"
01:14:52,620;01:15:02,620;"All right, got anything else you want to talk about in this game you want to do best or worst"
01:15:02,620;01:15:06,340;"Let me review my notes easy"
01:15:06,340;01:15:09,140;"Did you see Chris Slade out there?"
01:15:09,860;01:15:17,060;"Yes, I didn't actually see him out there, but he was on the list of players on this team. They called them out a little bit"
01:15:17,060;01:15:23,700;"Did they? I missed this was his this was his kind of swollen song after coming to use like a trip"
01:15:23,700;01:15:25,700;"This is his last season in the NFL"
01:15:25,700;01:15:28,540;"He was actually third on the team with two and a half sacks though"
01:15:28,540;01:15:33,300;"This is the only season without not on the Patriots I"
01:15:34,060;01:15:41,860;"Did have a note that like Brady had 17 TDs 10 INTs and then throws two more in this game"
01:15:41,860;01:15:44,940;"So you end the year with what 17 and 12 and that's his pro bowl"
01:15:44,940;01:15:47,740;"Yeah, just crazy. I mean"
01:15:47,740;01:15:53,180;"Today to think about like oh, yeah, it's got 17 TDs and 12 bind teas. It's like"
01:15:53,180;01:15:55,740;"That's not even replacement level"
01:15:55,740;01:16:00,220;"I mean it was a different actually no, you're absolutely you did throw a touchdown"
01:16:00,220;01:16:02,900;"You threw on the Wiggins"
01:16:02,900;01:16:04,900;"and"
01:16:04,900;01:16:11,340;"Yes, it's like Wiggins like fell down check he got it. Oh, it's right. Yeah, he did"
01:16:11,340;01:16:17,140;"Yeah, you know you're right which I have another and he has probably important like Wiggins had a couple catches in this game"
01:16:17,140;01:16:22,120;"And then you have a huge catch against the Raiders"
01:16:22,120;01:16:26,380;"Spoiler over maybe this game or will he"
01:16:27,980;01:16:33,060;"Find him next week. So so you're right. He threw 18 touchdowns this season"
01:16:33,060;01:16:37,420;"To anybody know here's a quiz for you"
01:16:37,420;01:16:42,100;"How many did he throw in the playoffs this in 2001 touchdowns?"
01:16:42,100;01:16:49,220;"Because this surprised me one"
01:16:49,220;01:16:56,720;"Right Brown nailed it one. Yeah, David the Rams game the Super Bowl. Yeah, right before I"
01:16:57,260;01:17:03,580;"Yep, it's only touch down he threw he ran for one and so and braided through one against Pittsburgh"
01:17:03,580;01:17:10,940;"You mean Bob bloods up? Yeah, which was the same one that Brady would throw in the Super Bowl. Yeah"
01:17:10,940;01:17:14,040;"Yeah, corner route to patent in the end"
01:17:14,040;01:17:21,340;"Yeah, I looked into that Ray karoo thing a little more that we talked out talked about with Bob"
01:17:21,340;01:17:22,940;"Yeah"
01:17:22,940;01:17:26,740;"Yeah, anything juicy? Well, the only thing I think of note is"
01:17:26,740;01:17:30,820;"is how he got caught and arrested."
01:17:30,820;01:17:32,820;"- Oh boy, yeah, we didn't touch on that."
01:17:32,820;01:17:37,420;"- Yeah, so he hires the guy that shoots"
01:17:37,420;01:17:40,700;"his eight month pregnant wife or girlfriend, right?"
01:17:40,700;01:17:43,500;"She didn't die immediately."
01:17:43,500;01:17:47,220;"She went into a coma and when they like"
01:17:47,220;01:17:50,140;"arraigned him or whatever, he paid the bail,"
01:17:50,140;01:17:51,620;"like a three million dollar bail."
01:17:51,620;01:17:55,900;"So he got out and then she died after that."
01:17:55,900;01:17:58,600;"So that's when he tried to like escape"
01:17:58,600;01:18:01,520;"in the trunk of a car of a friend."
01:18:01,520;01:18:04,720;"They said when they arrested him,"
01:18:04,720;01:18:08,240;"he was like, hold up in like the trunk of a car."
01:18:08,240;01:18:11,980;"$3,900 worth of cash,"
01:18:11,980;01:18:14,260;"bottles to hold his own urine."
01:18:14,260;01:18:15,580;"This sounds familiar."
01:18:15,580;01:18:17,340;"Candy bars and a cell phone."
01:18:17,340;01:18:19,160;"Yeah, I feel like this was actually on the news"
01:18:19,160;01:18:20,560;"where they had like surrounded the cops"
01:18:20,560;01:18:21,840;"and surrounded the car and they were like"
01:18:21,840;01:18:23,080;"pulling them out of the trunk."
01:18:23,080;01:18:23,920;"Yeah."
01:18:23,920;01:18:24,760;"Where was he trying to go?"
01:18:24,760;01:18:34,920;"of it. California. And then you have that former boss in Nissan. Do you hear about that guy? No."
01:18:34,920;01:18:40,680;"Oh, yeah. He got indicted in Japan for like, thought and stuff and he like, flood the country"
01:18:40,680;01:18:49,160;"in a violin case. I'm really like, I'm on the plate with the Middle East and he's got free."
01:18:49,160;01:18:53,960;"He's always like, can't be extradited. That's the most Japanese thing ever. Everybody else"
01:18:53,960;01:18:55,280;"It's got to be a cello case."
01:18:55,280;01:18:56,520;"He's a fucking violin."
01:18:56,520;01:19:00,920;"Breaker is a car pissed in a bottle."
01:19:00,920;01:19:02,760;"Did a violin."
01:19:02,760;01:19:04,560;"He's in a goddamn Nissan probably."
01:19:04,560;01:19:08,480;"Oh, Jesus."
01:19:08,480;01:19:11,240;"Yeah, I sure remember that."
01:19:11,240;01:19:17,080;"The only other note I had was they were talking about the fans at the stadium."
01:19:17,080;01:19:21,200;"They said 40% were wearing Patriots gear."
01:19:21,560;01:19:25,700;"Yeah, and that they heard a let's go Jets fan are changed."
01:19:25,700;01:19:26,160;"Oh, yeah."
01:19:26,160;01:19:27,560;"Chagriets fans because."
01:19:27,560;01:19:29,200;"Yeah, way to give away my worst."
01:19:29,200;01:19:36,440;"So you'll touch on that because we kind of almost talked"
01:19:36,440;01:19:38,480;"about the beginning, but this game"
01:19:38,480;01:19:42,720;"did have playoff implications for the Patriots because they"
01:19:42,720;01:19:44,880;"had to win this game."
01:19:44,880;01:19:48,280;"And the Jets had to beat the Raiders for the Patriots"
01:19:48,280;01:19:51,080;"to get the number two seed in a first round buy."
01:19:51,080;01:19:57,800;"And of course, our friend fucking Ron Borges decided that would be a terrible idea."
01:19:57,800;01:20:03,240;"And so he wrote a bunch of articles in the bossing guild the week before saying,"
01:20:03,240;01:20:09,080;"""That was probably a good idea for the page to lose this game so that they would play wild card"
01:20:09,080;01:20:14,680;"weekend. What? Playing three games would be better than whoever they would face and all this extra time"
01:20:14,680;01:20:19,720;"off would be retarded."" That's Ron Borges."
01:20:20,280;01:20:21,280;"Yeah, I like."
01:20:21,280;01:20:22,680;"It's a book called Ron Bog."
01:20:22,680;01:20:30,360;"And the best thing was the day after the game, you had to do another article that basically"
01:20:30,360;01:20:36,480;"said that all the players would prefer the extra week off."
01:20:36,480;01:20:37,480;"Yeah."
01:20:37,480;01:20:39,840;"You had to walk back literally everything you said."
01:20:39,840;01:20:43,680;"Well, when they opened the game, they had a graphic up and it was like, ""Patius is the"
01:20:43,680;01:20:44,680;"number two seed."""
01:20:44,680;01:20:47,080;"I mean, there was a bunch of people like 10 and 5 or whatever."
01:20:47,080;01:20:48,080;"Yeah."
01:20:48,080;01:20:51,240;"I was like, cause I don't, I don't see the scores before I watch the games."
01:20:51,240;01:20:52,040;"Yeah."
01:20:52,040;01:20:54,200;"Cause I like to be surprised."
01:20:54,200;01:20:54,600;"I guess."
01:20:54,600;01:20:55,640;"All right."
01:20:55,640;01:20:59,400;"And I was like, man, how do we go from like number two to play on a wild car weekend?"
01:20:59,400;01:21:04,040;"And then like halfway through the, you know, second quarter, like, Oh, yeah, the jets,"
01:21:04,040;01:21:05,840;"the jets can be a gold glint today."
01:21:05,840;01:21:08,760;"Then the Patriots get a buy."
01:21:08,760;01:21:10,480;"And I was like, fucking jets."
01:21:10,480;01:21:15,680;"That anyways, I would root for the jets to lose and play on wild car weekend."
01:21:15,840;01:21:18,980;"a rob or to sort that column said, you know what?"
01:21:18,980;01:21:20,540;"We should play on walkout route weekend"
01:21:20,540;01:21:22,980;"because fuck the Jets and fuck Curtis Martin."
01:21:22,980;01:21:24,340;"I would be like, yes."
01:21:24,340;01:21:25,180;"- That's what it should have been."
01:21:25,180;01:21:26,580;"- Fuck everybody at that stadium who is chanting,"
01:21:26,580;01:21:28,340;"let's go Jets, fuck them."
01:21:28,340;01:21:33,180;"- Yeah, oh, Steve, but this will be good."
01:21:33,180;01:21:35,660;"And I'm sad that Mike's not here for this one,"
01:21:35,660;01:21:40,660;"but the Jets won it on a last second field goal."
01:21:40,660;01:21:44,460;"Thanks to the heroic scene,"
01:21:44,460;01:21:50,320;"I'm heroic seemed like a strong word for a holder on a field goal attempt, but Tom Tupa"
01:21:50,320;01:21:55,700;"I got a bad snap, but still managed to to pull it up and set it up for"
01:21:55,700;01:21:58,680;"Fox their kicker. I mean good John Hall"
01:21:58,680;01:22:00,800;"so"
01:22:00,800;01:22:04,580;"To kick the game running field goal. So the Jets 124 22 right in the game"
01:22:04,580;01:22:11,000;"Yeah, so Tom Tupa is the reason the Patriots dynasty began. That's fine"
01:22:11,000;01:22:15,680;"I mean they gave us the Raiders game, which is awesome and we'll talk about that next week all ends well"
01:22:15,680;01:22:19,040;"But fuck the Jets. I'll give you my best"
01:22:19,040;01:22:23,200;"All right best of words. You can't write it right. Come on"
01:22:23,200;01:22:26,800;"so they the commentators or"
01:22:26,800;01:22:29,440;"like Brady had a hard count and"
01:22:29,440;01:22:33,680;"It was like third and six or something like that, right? And he gets a hard count"
01:22:33,680;01:22:36,400;"and get to"
01:22:36,400;01:22:43,520;"Off sides and they're like, oh, yeah, you know, Brady's hard count is part of his arsenal and like literally while they're talking about how this"
01:22:43,520;01:22:47,480;"This hard count is part of his arsenal Brady bust out the quarterback sneak"
01:22:47,480;01:22:54,780;"I don't know if I don't I can't remember a Brady QB sneak like that"
01:22:54,780;01:22:59,400;"During the season nothing nothing stuck out on the"
01:22:59,400;01:23:06,080;"Quick not unlike the yeah, just like the the hurry up get to the line and do it quick. Yep. Yeah"
01:23:06,080;01:23:09,320;"And I was like, that's, that's his like number one."
01:23:09,320;01:23:10,320;"Yeah."
01:23:10,320;01:23:11,320;"Yeah."
01:23:11,320;01:23:16,240;"I think to be fair, Steve, neither you nor I have watched any of the games this year."
01:23:16,240;01:23:17,800;"So we could have watched them."
01:23:17,800;01:23:19,800;"I don't know if they all got articles."
01:23:19,800;01:23:20,800;"Yeah."
01:23:20,800;01:23:24,840;"And I feel like it may have came up once, but it may have been one of the games that you"
01:23:24,840;01:23:26,040;"guys were on, just me and Mike."
01:23:26,040;01:23:31,200;"It may have like the fucking early dolphins game, but yeah, no, they, they, they, they"
01:23:31,200;01:23:33,600;"hadn't happened often, if at all."
01:23:33,600;01:23:34,600;"So this is."
01:23:34,600;01:23:35,600;"No."
01:23:35,600;01:23:42,320;"the beginning of what was a legendary run of him converting on the thousand yards doing it"
01:23:42,320;01:23:46,560;"that's true one yard at a time"
01:23:46,560;01:23:52,640;"that's great all right your worst was the jet stuff yeah fuck them yeah that's fair"
01:23:52,640;01:24:00,160;"all right Greg what about you all right so my best there was a couple there was a couple"
01:24:00,160;01:24:06,640;"instances where they put in the in-game highlight package where they give you the update around"
01:24:06,640;01:24:07,640;"the league."
01:24:07,640;01:24:09,920;"You might be stealing my best, yeah."
01:24:09,920;01:24:11,480;"Well there was two."
01:24:11,480;01:24:12,480;"Okay."
01:24:12,480;01:24:15,120;"I'll leave the one I think you're going to go with."
01:24:15,120;01:24:16,280;"No, no, you can do them both."
01:24:16,280;01:24:17,920;"I'm sure I can find them both."
01:24:17,920;01:24:18,920;"Okay."
01:24:18,920;01:24:25,280;"Well, the first one was a Chris Fumatu Mahfala sighting."
01:24:25,280;01:24:26,280;"Yeah."
01:24:26,280;01:24:29,680;"Yeah, we'll get to talk about him next week, I think."
01:24:29,680;01:24:31,880;"But yeah, it was enough said."
01:24:31,880;01:24:36,320;"Chris Fairman, he's one bad ma Fala."
01:24:36,320;01:24:42,000;"It's one of that pronunciation on the first go to do."
01:24:42,000;01:24:45,640;"I've thought a lot about that man's name in my life."
01:24:45,640;01:24:46,440;"Oh my God."
01:24:46,440;01:24:47,600;"He's one of the best."
01:24:47,600;01:24:48,840;"Yeah."
01:24:48,840;01:24:49,280;"Yeah."
01:24:49,280;01:24:50,840;"Matsu ma Fala."
01:24:51,480;01:24:56,480;"- Up there with Tim Bienkopatuka and Ho-O Manau Nui."
01:24:56,480;01:25:01,400;"- So, first try."
01:25:01,400;01:25:02,600;"- How about that?"
01:25:02,600;01:25:05,960;"- So the other one was the one I think you were thinking of"
01:25:05,960;01:25:08,840;"was Keith the tractor trailer."
01:25:08,840;01:25:10,120;"(laughing)"
01:25:10,120;01:25:10,960;"- Dastes."
01:25:10,960;01:25:11,800;"- Intercepting all."
01:25:11,800;01:25:15,320;"- Intercepting a return and running at like probably 60 yards."
01:25:15,320;01:25:16,840;"- Wait, did you do the Patriots?"
01:25:16,840;01:25:17,960;"'Cause I saw that and I was like,"
01:25:17,960;01:25:20,880;"I feel like I've seen that play with them in a different jersey."
01:25:20,880;01:25:22,880;"Maybe I'm just remembering that."
01:25:22,880;01:25:25,380;"I think it was the Ted Washington when you're remembering."
01:25:25,380;01:25:26,380;"Oh, yeah."
01:25:26,380;01:25:27,380;"Wasn't that Ted Washington?"
01:25:27,380;01:25:29,380;"Yeah, the 31-0 game."
01:25:29,380;01:25:30,380;"Yeah, I think so."
01:25:30,380;01:25:31,380;"Yeah."
01:25:31,380;01:25:37,880;"But no, because, I mean, we've seen other nose tackles return, the fumbles or interceptions."
01:25:37,880;01:25:39,880;"Like we've seen Vince Wolf work do it a couple times."
01:25:39,880;01:25:41,880;"And it's always awesome."
01:25:41,880;01:25:45,880;"But I've never seen anybody move as slow as Keith Trailer did than this."
01:25:45,880;01:25:49,880;"Well, and the best part is he gets like 40 yards in."
01:25:49,880;01:25:53,480;"Yeah. And he starts looking around for something to pitch the ball to,"
01:25:53,480;01:25:55,320;"cause he could tell he was just so beat."
01:25:55,320;01:25:56,840;"He said, fuck this."
01:25:56,840;01:25:58,200;"Somebody take this thing."
01:25:58,200;01:26:00,680;"And he couldn't find it."
01:26:00,680;01:26:02,360;"So at the end, he just kind of fell over."
01:26:02,360;01:26:03,120;"Nobody tackled them."
01:26:03,120;01:26:05,600;"He just kind of like went down in the heap at the five yard."
01:26:05,600;01:26:10,680;"Like, you saw that fat man touchdowns or fat man returns at the best."
01:26:10,680;01:26:13,720;"Oh, there's so we're like the referee was out running them and like having like"
01:26:13,720;01:26:15,240;"just jog to slow down a bit."
01:26:15,240;01:26:16,960;"I just looked at that."
01:26:17,000;01:26:20,240;"He has another 62 yard return."
01:26:20,240;01:26:21,320;"That was 67."
01:26:21,320;01:26:22,440;"Wow."
01:26:22,440;01:26:24,280;"662 and 97."
01:26:24,280;01:26:25,400;"Did he score?"
01:26:25,400;01:26:26,440;"Nope."
01:26:26,440;01:26:27,480;"He hasn't scored much down."
01:26:27,480;01:26:28,520;"I bet he didn't."
01:26:28,520;01:26:30,160;"He just runs out of juice."
01:26:30,160;01:26:35,080;"And I was to say, when Wilfork does it, he actually looks like"
01:26:35,080;01:26:36,320;"at what I come about it."
01:26:36,320;01:26:37,680;"He, well, Wilfork is a"
01:26:37,680;01:26:38,880;"well, we'll talk about it."
01:26:38,880;01:26:40,320;"Got it."
01:26:40,320;01:26:41,000;"On the other hand."
01:26:41,000;01:26:41,640;"Yeah."
01:26:41,640;01:26:44,960;"He's he's thrown a stiff arm at one on one of them."
01:26:45,400;01:26:48,160;"He transfers the ball from one arm to the other."
01:26:48,160;01:26:48,440;"Yeah."
01:26:48,440;01:26:48,560;"Yeah."
01:26:48,560;01:26:49,960;"He's holding it like an actual football player."
01:26:49,960;01:26:52,960;"So they're like a loaf of bread."
01:26:52,960;01:26:56,440;"I mean, the all time worst is Leon Lett."
01:26:56,440;01:26:57,200;"Yeah."
01:26:57,200;01:26:59,240;"He put Shane to the fat man name."
01:26:59,240;01:26:59,680;"Yeah."
01:26:59,680;01:27:00,120;"He did."
01:27:00,120;01:27:00,640;"He did."
01:27:00,640;01:27:00,680;"Yeah."
01:27:00,680;01:27:02,440;"Don BB."
01:27:02,440;01:27:03,840;"Yeah."
01:27:03,840;01:27:04,600;"Nice deep dive."
01:27:04,600;01:27:05,800;"I like that."
01:27:05,800;01:27:06,800;"Yeah."
01:27:06,800;01:27:07,000;"All right."
01:27:07,000;01:27:09,120;"So what's your worst then?"
01:27:09,120;01:27:10,320;"I hadn't really thought of it."
01:27:10,320;01:27:14,680;"The only other note I had in here is when they--"
01:27:14,680;01:27:22,480;"I guess I could spin into a worst is when the they were talking about Brady and like they had, you know, they have the meetings the night before."
01:27:22,480;01:27:23,360;"Yeah."
01:27:23,360;01:27:29,440;"And they said that he was wearing baggy blue jeans and it was hanging barely on his fanny."
01:27:29,440;01:27:33,480;"And they sign the sign of the times."
01:27:33,480;01:27:33,880;"Yeah."
01:27:33,880;01:27:35,680;"And then backwards baseball cap."
01:27:35,680;01:27:36,640;"Yeah."
01:27:36,640;01:27:38,800;"It was barely on his fanny."
01:27:38,800;01:27:42,400;"They tell you the kids these days."
01:27:42,400;01:27:51,040;"That's a pretty good one. All right. I'll give you that. All right. Let's see. What's what's my best here?"
01:27:51,040;01:27:57,920;"I got a lot of worse this game. This is a sloppy game. Oh, so sloppy."
01:27:57,920;01:28:08,880;"One of my best was the infographics they put up. Just the title of one of them was panthers or pussy cats."
01:28:11,520;01:28:18,320;"It was just showing how they ranked last in like everything and the second to last and everything else."
01:28:18,320;01:28:19,920;"That's a week 17."
01:28:19,920;01:28:20,920;"Yeah."
01:28:20,920;01:28:22,720;"Yeah, it's a week 17 graphic."
01:28:22,720;01:28:25,320;"We're like, no one's watching this game, right?"
01:28:25,320;01:28:27,520;"We go with the pussycats graph."
01:28:27,520;01:28:28,520;"Yeah."
01:28:28,520;01:28:30,720;"Jokes on them is 2020."
01:28:30,720;01:28:31,720;"We're watching it."
01:28:31,720;01:28:33,720;"It was so good."
01:28:33,720;01:28:35,720;"Let's see."
01:28:35,720;01:28:37,720;"I feel like."
01:28:37,720;01:28:44,320;"Yeah, that was probably as best as going to get for stuff we haven't talked about."
01:28:44,320;01:28:50,940;"I think the worst was basically all of garbage time at the end of this game."
01:28:50,940;01:28:52,940;"There was Patriots fourth."
01:28:52,940;01:28:59,900;"So this is out of fourth quarter one Brady tried to hit patent deep on a on third down"
01:28:59,900;01:29:03,060;"up like I don't know two touchdowns already."
01:29:03,060;01:29:06,540;"Um, oh, they're up 24-6 and they just,"
01:29:06,540;01:29:08,380;"he's just like going deep just for the hell of it."
01:29:08,380;01:29:09,580;"And so they punt."
01:29:09,580;01:29:12,860;"Uh, the next play, Winky Fumbles a snap."
01:29:12,860;01:29:13,620;"The patch recover."
01:29:13,620;01:29:15,060;"And Brady scores a touchdown."
01:29:15,060;01:29:19,940;"And then, um, Oh,"
01:29:19,940;01:29:21,340;"this myth finally gets his pick six."
01:29:21,340;01:29:22,500;"This is still in the fourth quarter."
01:29:22,500;01:29:29,420;"And then at the end, like the Panthers are still kind of trying to go for it,"
01:29:29,540;01:29:35,060;"But it's like fourth in really long."
01:29:35,060;01:29:38,780;"The pass jump off sides on the fourth down play."
01:29:38,780;01:29:40,940;"And Winky drops back."
01:29:40,940;01:29:43,540;"All he's got a free play drops back"
01:29:43,540;01:29:46,220;"and gets blindsided, drops the football."
01:29:46,220;01:29:48,020;"And it literally just sits there."
01:29:48,020;01:29:51,180;"Like nobody goes to recover it because like--"
01:29:51,180;01:29:51,780;"It doesn't fucking matter."
01:29:51,780;01:29:52,660;"It's a free play anyway."
01:29:52,660;01:29:54,260;"So like eventually one of the Patriots"
01:29:54,260;01:29:55,700;"players jumps on it."
01:29:55,700;01:29:58,860;"And so-- and this is all on the play."
01:29:58,860;01:30:00,180;"It just like doesn't fucking count."
01:30:00,180;01:30:05,160;"And then so the Panthers get a do over now."
01:30:05,160;01:30:06,740;"It's like fourth and two instead of fourth and seven."
01:30:06,740;01:30:09,780;"- Well, that was a foreshadowing for Cam Newton"
01:30:09,780;01:30:11,140;"in the Super Bowl."
01:30:11,140;01:30:12,700;"(laughing)"
01:30:12,700;01:30:14,140;"- That's Panther style."
01:30:14,140;01:30:16,260;"- Nah, I don't wanna pick that up."
01:30:16,260;01:30:17,100;"- Yeah, it was, yeah."
01:30:17,100;01:30:18,500;"Wiggy's just like, - Snacks."
01:30:18,500;01:30:20,540;"- And they're watching the ball, he's like, ""Yeah, I'm good."""
01:30:20,540;01:30:22,380;"And then so they have fourth and two,"
01:30:22,380;01:30:24,260;"which they could have converted,"
01:30:24,260;01:30:26,140;"but then Winky goes and almost throws"
01:30:26,140;01:30:28,180;"yet another interception to Otis Smith."
01:30:28,180;01:30:29,800;"And I was basically how the game ended."
01:30:29,800;01:30:31,400;"And then it was just like running at the clock."
01:30:31,400;01:30:33,840;"Yeah, it was just like such a shit show."
01:30:33,840;01:30:36,120;"They had their chance on Tony because they're running back."
01:30:36,120;01:30:37,360;"It was gashing us."
01:30:37,360;01:30:38,440;"It was awful."
01:30:38,440;01:30:42,280;"It was committed a bunch of dumb penalties and when he was just"
01:30:42,280;01:30:43,880;"could not stop the Olympics."
01:30:43,880;01:30:47,200;"A couple of their honorable mentions for worse."
01:30:47,200;01:30:51,720;"Um, Steve Smith fumble on the kick return was his eighth fumble on"
01:30:51,720;01:30:52,760;"kick returns that season."
01:30:52,760;01:30:54,440;"Yeah, I had that note talking."
01:30:54,440;01:30:56,320;"Eighth and he's so made the the pro ball."
01:30:56,320;01:30:56,760;"Yeah."
01:30:56,760;01:30:57,720;"Different game back then."
01:30:57,720;01:31:03,560;"And then on the opening kickoff, Patrick Pass returned it."
01:31:03,560;01:31:04,600;"Yeah."
01:31:04,600;01:31:11,000;"Tackled as he was going out of bounds and hit the plastic tarp and slid so far that he hit"
01:31:11,000;01:31:13,000;"the benches and injured himself."
01:31:13,000;01:31:14,920;"Dude, he has jacked up the whole game."
01:31:14,920;01:31:19,720;"Like he kept playing, but tell his shoulders fucked up from like, yeah, hitting that bench."
01:31:19,720;01:31:22,520;"Yeah, because he made a couple of tackles on Steve Smith on kick returns."
01:31:22,520;01:31:26,720;"Yeah, he was all like, yeah, he would come limping off every time."
01:31:26,720;01:31:32,800;"Everyone Reggie star towards that was that falcon play in the Super Bowl or in the Super Dome"
01:31:32,800;01:31:35,600;"Yep. Oh, yeah"
01:31:35,600;01:31:37,120;"Didn't you kind of remind me that?"
01:31:37,120;01:31:40,020;"Yeah, he did he suits you know there was something yeah"
01:31:40,020;01:31:43,360;"Or am I putting the Rams old stadium?"
01:31:43,360;01:31:46,000;"Yeah, it was one of those domes. Oh"
01:31:46,000;01:31:52,280;"And I have one more cement on the outside. Yeah, I had a cement ring before they hit the"
01:31:52,880;01:32:00,400;"The actual like stadium wall and that's what he slid on in here tore shit that I mean he did that I was like that looked like"
01:32:00,400;01:32:02,760;"Reggie Bush"
01:32:02,760;01:32:06,960;"Because like he is flying and then like all the Sun is a bunch of shit"
01:32:06,960;01:32:10,860;"Yeah, there's is no way to stop. He literally was like slid on his stomach"
01:32:10,860;01:32:19,320;"Yeah, like five ten yards at full speed into the the footing of the those metal benches that they have on sidelines"
01:32:22,000;01:32:26,080;"But I had one more trivia note that I thought was pretty cool on"
01:32:26,080;01:32:29,400;"Winky's"
01:32:29,400;01:32:33,040;"Second interception the one to Otis Smith. I got called back that was tipped"
01:32:33,040;01:32:35,760;"The receiver that tipped it was Donald Hayes"
01:32:35,760;01:32:40,440;"Who the year after would actually be playing for the Patriots and catching touchdowns for them"
01:32:40,440;01:32:43,240;"Wasn't he a dolphins guy?"
01:32:43,240;01:32:46,320;"Donald no Donald Hayes was"
01:32:47,440;01:32:52,480;"With the Panthers for one two three four years. This was the last year the Panthers and then"
01:32:52,480;01:32:56,120;"You're thinking to be more year Donald driver Steve. Yeah"
01:32:56,120;01:32:58,720;"Probably true"
01:32:58,720;01:33:01,160;"Packers and for the passing of two"
01:33:01,160;01:33:10,880;"One of the many of those one hit wonders that would be on Tom Brady's list of 77"
01:33:10,880;01:33:13,640;"Receivers so many of them. Oh"
01:33:16,560;01:33:21,560;"Oh, I have one note before we wrap it up."
01:33:21,560;01:33:23,920;"- I'll give it to me."
01:33:23,920;01:33:26,640;"- The end of the second half."
01:33:26,640;01:33:27,560;"- Yeah."
01:33:27,560;01:33:31,040;"- So they had the Hail Mary Chance, the Panthers did?"
01:33:31,040;01:33:32,040;"- Yeah."
01:33:32,040;01:33:33,200;"- And the first half?"
01:33:33,200;01:33:34,360;"- Yeah, the first half."
01:33:34,360;01:33:36,840;"And the Patriots rushed one player."
01:33:36,840;01:33:40,920;"And someone bled, like literally they rushed one."
01:33:40,920;01:33:41,920;"- They did."
01:33:41,920;01:33:43,440;"- And then one of the linebackers bled said,"
01:33:43,440;01:33:45,400;"like literally the other four guys like now."
01:33:45,400;01:33:47,160;"off the end eventually."
01:33:47,160;01:33:51,640;"And he forced a fumble and the commentators."
01:33:51,640;01:33:53,400;"Even better than that."
01:33:53,400;01:33:54,440;"Is that a fumble?"
01:33:54,440;01:33:56,400;"Like, no, it's a tuck rule."
01:33:56,400;01:33:57,400;"Yes."
01:33:57,400;01:33:59,040;"It was the tuck rule."
01:33:59,040;01:33:59,540;"Yeah."
01:33:59,540;01:34:01,000;"And it came into effect yet again."
01:34:01,000;01:34:02,800;"This is the second time we've seen it this season"
01:34:02,800;01:34:06,720;"because it came into effect in the first Jets game, too."
01:34:06,720;01:34:07,720;"Yeah."
01:34:07,720;01:34:08,200;"Me, too."
01:34:08,200;01:34:09,280;"Yeah, everyone remembers--"
01:34:09,280;01:34:11,080;"I mean, you can always put into that first Jets game."
01:34:11,080;01:34:12,520;"And be like, oh, well, yeah, this is where it happened"
01:34:12,520;01:34:13,600;"at once."
01:34:13,600;01:34:16,100;"I like I don't think anyone's right thought of this."
01:34:16,100;01:34:18,980;"Yeah, but that was literally the play that ended the first half was."
01:34:18,980;01:34:19,480;"Yeah."
01:34:19,480;01:34:22,540;"It was clearly a fumble as it's clear fumble."
01:34:22,540;01:34:25,740;"It was actually a very similar kind of hit to that."
01:34:25,740;01:34:26,240;"That's exactly."
01:34:26,240;01:34:26,740;"Yeah."
01:34:26,740;01:34:31,800;"He was pulling the ball down and got hit and it got hit from his right side,"
01:34:31,800;01:34:33,300;"from a guy blitz in like free."
01:34:33,300;01:34:33,960;"Yeah."
01:34:33,960;01:34:35,260;"And got the wall."
01:34:35,260;01:34:41,160;"So you're saying the the tuck in the Patriots game, the Raiders game was a fumble to"
01:34:41,160;01:34:42,160;"then."
01:34:42,300;01:34:46,020;"No, because it wasn't because they were both called on the field."
01:34:46,020;01:34:48,220;"And you just said that this one's clearly a fumble."
01:34:48,220;01:34:52,380;"Well, in today's game, yes, it is clearly a fumble."
01:34:52,380;01:34:54,060;"Oh, is it?"
01:34:54,060;01:34:55,380;"Did they change the title?"
01:34:55,380;01:34:58,380;"Is it not even the commentator talking about the title?"
01:34:58,380;01:34:59,900;"Oh, it's just even called the."
01:34:59,900;01:35:01,500;"You'd watch the game, Greg."
01:35:01,500;01:35:01,980;"You'd know."
01:35:01,980;01:35:06,180;"I did not see that part."
01:35:06,180;01:35:09,980;"I hope I watch more than usual."
01:35:10,620;01:35:12,380;"Yeah, I'll give you credit for that."
01:35:12,380;01:35:17,580;"All right, anything else anybody wanted to touch on here?"
01:35:17,580;01:35:18,620;"I think that's all mine notes."
01:35:18,620;01:35:23,100;"Yep, foreshadowing next week, Raiders, one of my favorite games of all time."
01:35:23,100;01:35:25,500;"Yeah, I think you're not alone in that."
01:35:25,500;01:35:28,460;"The snowball."
01:35:28,460;01:35:30,380;"The snowball, that's right."
01:35:30,380;01:35:31,340;"Let it see you."
01:35:31,340;01:35:39,980;"We will see you next week for a playoff edition of the Patriots"
01:35:39,980;01:35:41,980;"Thanks for listening."
01:35:41,980;01:35:45,980;"I'm dreaming of a war."
01:35:45,980;01:35:47,980;"Stop, stop, stop, stop."
01:35:47,980;01:35:49,980;"Way on."
01:35:49,980;01:35:50,980;"Go get it."
01:35:50,980;01:35:51,980;"See you guys."

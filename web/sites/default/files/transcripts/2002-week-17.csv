00:00,000;00:06,780;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,780;00:08,200;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,200;00:12,480;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,480;00:14,240;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,240;00:15,480;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,480;00:16,480;"Go right ahead."
00:16,480;00:17,680;"I am not your mother."
00:17,680;00:24,680;"[Music]"
00:24,680;00:25,680;"Very special."
00:25,680;00:32,680;"Somebody that I think you could say is maybe not the most famous outside of this podcast,"
00:32,680;00:36,080;"but the most famous inside this podcast."
00:36,080;00:39,840;"You've heard her every week at the beginning of every podcast."
00:39,840;00:41,360;"Morning, you're not listening."
00:41,360;00:45,040;"But we finally convinced Mama Brown to come on the podcast."
00:45,040;00:46,040;"I'm on."
00:46,040;00:59,320;"Hello dear how are you? Hey mom. Hi Stevie B. I love you mom. I know. Notice how she"
00:59,320;01:03,800;"didn't say I love you too. She just told you to fuck off like 10 minutes ago."
01:03,800;01:09,960;"Oh she's hung you to fuck off. Yeah but she instinctively said your name so. I don't"
01:09,960;01:21,320;"say fuck off to anybody. So the reason we wanted to have you on is because somehow you managed to"
01:21,320;01:28,600;"instill your love of Patience football onto your three sons and your daughter too but to the point"
01:28,600;01:35,720;"that your three sons have started a podcast and have now gotten two episodes, two whole seasons"
01:35,720;01:41,720;"of episodes done of watching football games from 20 years ago. So..."
01:41,720;01:42,280;"Idiots."
01:42,280;01:45,960;"You're not alone in that."
01:45,960;01:57,560;"But I kind of want to get an idea of where it started from and if you expected this from the three of us."
01:57,560;02:01,640;"No, not at all. Actually, I didn't really think about it."
02:03,000;02:08,920;"you being even fans, I suppose. I was just like, I don't know, keeping my head above water and"
02:08,920;02:14,280;"football was the thing that kept my head above water when all you lot were little. I really liked"
02:14,280;02:18,520;"it when I first came. I think you've talked about that on one of the podcasts about me coming."
02:18,520;02:22,680;"Yeah, can we get that story right? Because I tell it over time, I don't even know if that's the"
02:22,680;02:28,920;"truth or not. Well, who the hell knows? It's all memory isn't it? It was 60, 60, 65 year old woman"
02:30,600;02:35,480;"has a variable memory, but I remember sitting with that. Do you remember that little tiny"
02:35,480;02:41,000;"television that we had? Yeah, I don't agree. What size was it? I was trying to figure out what size"
02:41,000;02:47,960;"it was. I want to buy 11 pieces of paper. 13 inch maybe. But that's the first thing that we bought"
02:47,960;02:52,280;"and Mick used to go after work and leave me, especially at the weekends because it was some kind of"
02:52,280;02:59,400;"startup. And so I just watched sports and I couldn't see the puck and I hated basketball"
02:59,400;03:04,920;"and baseball was far too long but football was god, it was gorgeous, it was just wonderful."
03:04,920;03:06,840;"Why did you hit basketball?"
03:06,840;03:15,320;"I suppose it was a lot like netball that I played but it wasn't netball does that make sense?"
03:15,320;03:20,840;"That's an English game that girls play. So there was always this kind of like netball"
03:20,840;03:23,320;"was the best sport and basketball was not."
03:23,320;03:25,560;"That's how we feel about rugby."
03:25,960;03:27,640;"Yes, mate. I don't know. Maybe."
03:27,640;03:29,480;"Or about soccer. It's not the real football."
03:29,480;03:35,480;"But anyway, so I just started watching football and I just like fell in love with the game."
03:35,480;03:37,560;"It was because there was so much to it, you know."
03:37,560;03:41,480;"And there was, you know, you could sit and you could spend a whole game just watching the line"
03:41,480;03:46,520;"and playing against each other. Never mind the quarterback."
03:46,520;03:49,640;"So I just used to watch it and then I didn't know what was going on."
03:49,640;03:54,680;"So I used to write down the signals that the refs did."
03:54,680;03:59,640;"Oh yeah. That I didn't understand and then said Mickin to ask Steve wasn't asking. I think it was"
03:59,640;04:05,080;"his name was the big sports guy that he worked with and he was like, ""Your wife wants to know about"
04:05,080;04:11,160;"that? I need to meet your wife."" This is pre-Google when you couldn't do anything."
04:11,160;04:17,480;"Yeah, you couldn't do anything. I just had to figure it out. See what he did after he made the"
04:17,480;04:24,440;"funny sign, what happened? It was great because he just kept me busy and I watched all that I"
04:24,440;04:26,720;"I watched all the professional games."
04:26,720;04:29,480;"I was actually watching college games at that point as well."
04:29,480;04:31,640;"And I knew, I think it was a Herschel Walker."
04:31,640;04:33,080;"I can't even remember who they work."
04:33,080;04:37,600;"I don't remember names, but I followed all of the college"
04:37,600;04:40,560;"stuff on the Saturday and then the stuff on the Sunday too."
04:40,560;04:42,640;"So, gone."
04:42,640;04:44,160;"- Did you have a college team?"
04:44,160;04:45,000;"Like a favorite college?"
04:45,000;04:45,840;"- No, no, no."
04:45,840;04:50,880;"- Were you a Patriots fan though?"
04:50,880;04:53,000;"- I was a Patriots fan because we went to see them."
04:53,000;04:56,920;"And we got the tickets were pretty cheap because they were awful."
04:56,920;04:57,920;"They were awful."
04:57,920;05:00,720;"So we were doing all these American things."
05:00,720;05:05,400;"So we bought Patriots gear, like wooly hats and stuff with that dreadful logo that makes"
05:05,400;05:08,560;"me shudder now every time I look at it."
05:08,560;05:12,520;"But we went down and saw the games and took peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, I do"
05:12,520;05:16,360;"believe, as is something a very, very American that you'd take to a football game."
05:16,360;05:18,440;"Who knew?"
05:18,440;05:22,600;"But after that, you had to be that because that was the first team you watched."
05:22,600;05:26,400;"So, you know, you just supported them."
05:26,400;05:28,520;"- But you have a history of supporting,"
05:28,520;05:30,880;"shall we say, the underdogs?"
05:30,880;05:32,200;"'Cause didn't-- - You're talking about,"
05:32,200;05:33,800;"you're talking West Bromish Albion,"
05:33,800;05:36,760;"you're not allowed to talk about that, that's just--"
05:36,760;05:40,840;"- I thought you were talking about your son's sports careers."
05:40,840;05:43,080;"(laughing)"
05:43,080;05:44,720;"Just your sons in general."
05:44,720;05:46,640;"- Never considered underdogs."
05:46,640;05:48,280;"We're considered never rans."
05:48,280;05:50,200;"(laughing)"
05:50,200;05:51,880;"- I don't know, Gregory, I thought I got a good run"
05:51,880;05:54,280;"money out of your soccer career such as it was."
05:54,280;05:55,080;"Yeah."
05:55,080;06:01,880;"Mom came to every UNH soccer game even though I started one game and it was senior day."
06:01,880;06:05,880;"That was all right."
06:05,880;06:07,080;"I lived on hope."
06:07,080;06:07,880;"Yes."
06:07,880;06:09,080;"It was good."
06:09,080;06:09,880;"No, it was good."
06:09,880;06:13,880;"Interestingly enough, you never let us play football when we were younger."
06:13,880;06:15,880;"No, no."
06:15,880;06:17,480;"But there was a rule."
06:17,480;06:21,680;"It was once you got to high school, you could decide on your own."
06:21,680;06:26,960;"if you wanted. The only reason I did that was because Donald Lynch is husband, Tom Lynch."
06:26,960;06:32,160;"Yeah. He played for who did he play for? I can't remember. See, Hark still."
06:32,160;06:35,920;"Bill's maybe. Yeah, I think both of those. Yeah, I don't know. He played for some team"
06:35,920;06:40,440;"anyway, and he wouldn't let his own kid play until high school. He wouldn't let. I think"
06:40,440;06:44,640;"he tried and once at eighth grade in the Little League stuff, whatever they call themselves,"
06:44,640;06:48,880;"the Rams, whatever. P-week. Yeah. And he only lasted like three weeks, and he was so appalled"
06:48,880;06:55,600;"he just left. So he let his so I said no, no, not a minor going to play. And anyway, you'd"
06:55,600;06:59,160;"have to go to like these practices and I know it was only going to you'd only allow to do"
06:59,160;07:07,880;"one thing. And soccer was the like the least amount of commitment from a parent. One practice"
07:07,880;07:11,880;"and I just used to drop you off and then pick you up again and all the parents would look"
07:11,880;07:16,180;"at that woman she just drops a kid off and picks him up again. And then I would listen"
07:16,180;07:21,040;"into Patriots games on your soccer field, on a radio."
07:21,040;07:23,260;"In a radio, yes, I used to take a little radio down"
07:23,260;07:25,020;"with me and listen to the games"
07:25,020;07:26,220;"and cheer at the wrong places."
07:26,220;07:27,060;"Do you remember that?"
07:27,060;07:27,900;"- Yeah, yeah."
07:27,900;07:29,180;"- Every time the day, Patriots got,"
07:29,180;07:30,020;"""Yes!"""
07:30,020;07:30,860;"And everyone would go, ""What the hell?"
07:30,860;07:32,420;"""There's nothing happened on this field."""
07:32,420;07:33,780;"(laughing)"
07:33,780;07:34,620;"And all new kids would go,"
07:34,620;07:35,460;"""All right, just listen to the game."
07:35,460;07:37,340;"""Just listen to Patriots."""
07:37,340;07:38,180;"Who?"
07:38,180;07:39,820;"(laughing)"
07:39,820;07:40,900;"So yeah, that's it."
07:40,900;07:44,340;"I mean, I just did it and you just picked it up, I suppose."
07:44,340;07:50,420;"I never thought you'd kind of like be this kind of level of stupidity."
07:50,420;07:51,940;"Let's be."
07:51,940;07:54,420;"You're really good at telling me."
07:54,420;07:55,380;"No, I did not."
07:55,380;07:57,140;"No, I did not."
07:57,140;07:58,540;"No, I mean, I've gone off it now."
07:58,540;08:00,740;"I don't really watch football anymore."
08:00,740;08:02,660;"Last couple of years."
08:02,660;08:05,220;"Didn't you write a strongly worded letter?"
08:05,220;08:06,220;"Gregory says something about it."
08:06,220;08:10,100;"Oh, I have this written down because I looked it up today."
08:10,100;08:10,980;"Oh, shit."
08:10,980;08:11,580;"Yes."
08:11,580;08:12,660;"This was--"
08:12,660;08:14,180;"Do you have a copy of the letter?"
08:14,180;08:21,940;"No, no, no. So to set the scene, I remember distinctly because we're in the, in like the,"
08:21,940;08:26,500;"almost like the dining room of our house because the TV in the TV room does not work."
08:26,500;08:32,580;"Because dad just said, no, fuck it. We don't need cable until the sun's come home. And then we do"
08:32,580;08:41,700;"need cable, of course. Yeah. And this is 2016. It is the wild car game dolphin Steelers,"
08:41,700;08:47,500;"Bud Dupree lights up Matt Moore, like just like to helm it to Jaw."
08:47,500;08:48,940;"Knox. Yeah. Yeah."
08:48,940;08:50,100;"Knox him out of the game."
08:50,100;08:52,580;"And mom was so pissed watching it."
08:52,580;08:54,620;"She was like, this is disgusting."
08:54,620;08:56,260;"He should be kicked out of the game."
08:56,260;08:59,540;"And I was like, boy, you should write him an email, mom."
08:59,540;09:03,220;"And she's like, yes, figure out how I can write him an email."
09:03,220;09:10,300;"So I went on like I Googled like, how do you like write formal complaints to the NFL?"
09:10,660;09:15,660;"And there's like this like text box thing that you can like submit your complaints."
09:15,660;09:22,060;"And she dictated and I typed it in and we submitted a complaint that basically said,"
09:22,060;09:23,420;"fuck you Roger Goodell."
09:23,420;09:26,700;"It is great."
09:26,700;09:30,180;"How long between the hit and the submit?"
09:30,180;09:35,060;"Uh, they don't probably like, probably like, yeah, 10 minutes, 50 minutes."
09:35,060;09:37,660;"Fresh anger was how long was that?"
09:37,660;09:38,460;"Yeah."
09:38,460;09:38,980;"Yeah."
09:40,140;09:44,060;"Well, there was like, I think they changed the rules the year after two."
09:44,060;09:47,860;"Because it was like, they changed it to like a targeting rule."
09:47,860;09:51,700;"Yeah. Yeah. And like, to this day, I think it was that email that made a difference."
09:51,700;09:54,540;"Yes. You changed the course of the league."
09:54,540;09:57,860;"It's a shame you can't write in an English accent."
09:57,860;10:05,140;"Yeah. So, mom, who is your all time favorite patriot?"
10:05,140;10:07,140;"William Agnes."
10:07,140;10:09,060;"Yeah. I know you're going to say that. Yeah."
10:09,060;10:14,060;"Yeah, I was always a defense woman really."
10:14,060;10:19,500;"I mean, apart from Drew, Drew just saved my team."
10:19,500;10:23,460;"But mostly I used to watch defenses"
10:23,460;10:24,660;"'cause I used to think they were kind of like"
10:24,660;10:25,500;"always the underdogs."
10:25,500;10:26,620;"It's still the same."
10:26,620;10:28,260;"It's like they change all the rules all the time"
10:28,260;10:29,700;"and it makes it harder and harder and harder"
10:29,700;10:31,540;"and harder to be a defensive player."
10:31,540;10:34,460;"So they never used to get very much kind of like credit."
10:34,460;10:37,860;"And I used to think my defense were wonderful."
10:37,860;10:40,100;"So I just used to, and he was my favourite one in there."
10:40,100;10:42,380;"So that was it."
10:42,380;10:44,140;"And I went, who went to a Super Bowl?"
10:44,140;10:45,340;"And I asked, it was one of my parents,"
10:45,340;10:48,460;"wasn't it at the school that got tickets to the Super Bowl?"
10:48,460;10:49,380;"And she said, what do you want?"
10:49,380;10:50,940;"I said, I want to William against,"
10:50,940;10:54,380;"shirt, Super Bowl jersey."
10:54,380;10:55,220;"That's right."
10:55,220;10:56,420;"- Yeah, Super Bowl jersey."
10:56,420;10:58,100;"- I've been waiting to steal that off you."
10:58,100;10:58,940;"- Get off it."
10:58,940;11:02,260;"- Isn't it a Po Bowl jersey?"
11:02,260;11:03,300;"- I think that's a Super Bowl one."
11:03,300;11:04,140;"- No, it's a Super Bowl."
11:04,140;11:05,660;"- It was the Eagle Super Bowl."
11:05,660;11:06,580;"- Mm-hmm, wow."
11:06,580;11:07,420;"- Trust me."
11:07,420;11:13,660;"it for a bit. Well it was really funny Jim, we used to wear those kind of things. Do you remember"
11:13,660;11:17,900;"Janice Wilkins and I went to, got tickets to a game one time and then just the two of us went?"
11:17,900;11:20,300;"Yeah, because she was two tickets or something, right?"
11:20,300;11:24,780;"No, no I don't think so but she won some or something. She had some tickets anyway and so"
11:24,780;11:30,060;"instead of taking Steve she took me because she's more of a fan than I am actually."
11:30,060;11:34,620;"So the two of us are you know kind of like not old biddies at the time but oldish biddies"
11:35,260;11:39,260;"standing in one of the end zones and the end zone areas."
11:39,260;11:40,260;"And you can see all these guys,"
11:40,260;11:42,860;"""You look at these, yeah, oh, women."""
11:42,860;11:44,540;"And then we start shouting at the game,"
11:44,540;11:46,540;"and obviously we know exactly what we're watching."
11:46,540;11:47,980;"And they're like, ""Yeah, you've got to tune now."
11:47,980;11:50,140;"What you do, you know, it's really funny."""
11:50,140;11:52,140;"But they were like, ""Oh, you've got William again."""
11:52,140;11:54,140;"""Oh, great, I'm blower. I remember him."""
11:54,140;11:56,460;"You know, whatever."
11:56,460;11:57,580;"It was quite funny, actually."
11:57,580;12:02,300;"So on the flip side of that,"
12:02,300;12:03,340;"who..."
12:03,340;12:04,860;"Not on the pages, but in general,"
12:04,860;12:06,860;"Who is your least favorite player?"
12:06,860;12:09,580;"I didn't have a player but I had what's the fat tuna guy?"
12:09,580;12:14,120;"The coach else. Yep. Always hate that tuna"
12:14,120;12:17,580;"Well, it's what they always used to call him isn't it?"
12:17,580;12:21,180;"Oh, okay"
12:21,180;12:24,060;"Maybe it was the fat tuna"
12:24,060;12:33,660;"I don't know now I just I just couldn't bear him. Couldn't bear him. Why not? He's so bully. Yes"
12:33,660;12:37,660;"Yes, I think he was. I've been listening to some of the stuff he did for... Who's that?"
12:37,660;12:43,660;"I can't remember names anyway. Who was a really good receiver in this season?"
12:43,660;12:45,660;"Terry Glenn. Terry Glenn."
12:45,660;12:54,660;"He was so awful to him. And I think that he actually destroyed Bledso's career because what happened was Bledso was playing really well."
12:54,660;13:00,660;"And then the big fat tuna came as the coach and he immediately tried to change how he played the game."
13:00,660;13:06,500;"So yeah, so he tried to kind of like just change how Bledso actually through the ball and you know all this other stuff"
13:06,500;13:09,180;"And I think the guy got so kind of like, you know"
13:09,180;13:11,020;"You talked about him chucking things around and stuff"
13:11,020;13:14,700;"He wasn't really good you used to throw really good balls when he first came"
13:14,700;13:19,460;"But he just kind of like he got inside his head and he just destroyed it. I think so"
13:19,460;13:25,980;"But you've just been listening to episode nine. I've actually listened to episode 19"
13:25,980;13:28,780;"Holy shit"
13:28,780;13:35,880;"So I'm home right now and like the other day I come and like come downstairs in the morning and she's sitting there quilting"
13:35,880;13:41,500;"Downstairs with like the cat sunbathing next door and I can hear the episode"
13:41,500;13:46,740;"She's listening to and it's like I'm like describing a story of when I got drunk and arrested"
13:46,740;13:51,500;"I'm learning a lot on this podcast"
13:51,500;13:56,500;"- I have to have learned a lot."
13:56,500;14:02,820;"- That was the first game I actually thought,"
14:02,820;14:04,500;"all the games that you've been describing,"
14:04,500;14:05,340;"that was the one I thought,"
14:05,340;14:07,260;"I need to go and watch that again."
14:07,260;14:08,500;"- Yeah, the stealers one."
14:08,500;14:10,340;"- Yeah, where he came back in and threw it,"
14:10,340;14:13,300;"and it was just, I mean, I watched him on the sidelines,"
14:13,300;14:16,940;"that whole season, walking up and down, coaching,"
14:16,940;14:20,740;"you know, and it was just really cool."
14:20,740;14:21,780;"He was awesome."
14:21,780;14:23,420;"He was a great, great guy."
14:23,420;14:24,780;"He really was."
14:24,780;14:25,740;"So yeah."
14:25,740;14:27,620;"But as soon as he left us, I stopped worrying about,"
14:27,620;14:28,620;"I mean, stop watching him."
14:28,620;14:31,420;"So I'm obviously, that's what you're fine as you go through."
14:31,420;14:33,260;"Like, if it's a guy you're very, very invested"
14:33,260;14:35,580;"in particular players as long as they play for your team."
14:35,580;14:36,420;"- Right."
14:36,420;14:37,260;"- And then as soon as they leave, you're like,"
14:37,260;14:38,540;"""I gotta give a shit."""
14:38,540;14:40,940;"Brady's breaking me, it's like, ""I don't care anymore."""
14:40,940;14:42,020;"(laughs)"
14:42,020;14:42,860;"No, don't."
14:42,860;14:43,700;"- Where are you?"
14:43,700;14:44,780;"(laughs)"
14:44,780;14:46,260;"- Don't, don't, don't."
14:46,260;14:48,340;"- She did that to Steve years ago."
14:48,340;14:50,420;"(laughs)"
14:50,420;14:52,380;"Not at all, Stevie B."
14:52,380;14:53,140;"2006."
14:53,140;14:54,580;"[LAUGHTER]"
14:54,580;14:56,380;"Susan moved to a different state, gone."
14:56,380;14:58,380;"[LAUGHTER]"
14:58,380;14:59,980;"There's a certain level of relief when you all"
14:59,980;15:01,900;"move to different states, actually."
15:01,900;15:02,900;"Hey."
15:02,900;15:03,400;"You're up Andy."
15:03,400;15:04,820;"Sorry, sorry Andy."
15:04,820;15:06,180;"You were away for a while."
15:06,180;15:07,740;"You were away from Andy."
15:07,740;15:10,060;"[LAUGHTER]"
15:10,060;15:10,560;"Yeah."
15:10,560;15:12,300;"Good."
15:12,300;15:16,980;"See, I thought your answer was going to be John Elway."
15:16,980;15:18,060;"Because I want to know--"
15:18,060;15:18,580;"Oh, why?"
15:18,580;15:24,180;"earlier memories is they're watching a Patriots Broncos game."
15:24,180;15:28,300;"Probably mid 90s, I'd say some like 10 ish."
15:28,300;15:31,900;"Um, and John L."
15:31,900;15:34,340;"Way is doing his scrambling thing."
15:34,340;15:37,920;"And I think it was one of the first times I heard you swear because you"
15:37,920;15:40,420;"yelled at the TV, rip his fucking leg off."
15:40,420;15:42,100;"Yes."
15:42,100;15:43,620;"Well, I thought that was Steve Young."
15:43,620;15:45,380;"No, it was John L."
15:45,380;15:45,860;"I remember."
15:45,860;15:47,700;"Probably both."
15:47,700;15:52,820;"Yeah. Probably both. You have to know even four young kids in the thing. I mean, I was just like,"
15:52,820;15:56,500;"football was great. I could just shout and yell and, you know,"
15:56,500;16:01,380;"he did that to Greg all the time. Yeah, I did. And it did to see father on the soccer field too,"
16:01,380;16:07,300;"all his team. Oh, no, I met at Greg when he's at home. Oh, yeah. Well, he needs it. He needs it."
16:07,300;16:13,780;"Very naughty. Very naughty. Well, sometimes sometimes a naughty boy."
16:15,220;16:19,220;"Yes, so it was just a relief to just yell."
16:19,220;16:27,220;"I was sitting there thinking the other day that when I was pregnant with Gregory, I used"
16:27,220;16:34,220;"to try and work my whole week around the fact that I could watch three games of football"
16:34,220;16:38,220;"all in a row. And I used to prop myself pretty hard. Do all the laundry, do all the food,"
16:38,220;16:43,220;"do everything else, prop myself up in that front of that little TV with a whole bunch of pillows"
16:43,220;16:47,640;"on my side and I would just lie there from like when do they turn them on 12 o'clock?"
16:47,640;16:48,640;"1 o'clock?"
16:48,640;16:52,280;"So I'd watch the 1 o'clock game then I'd watch the 4 o'clock game and then I'd watch the 7 o'clock game."
16:52,280;16:53,280;"I was in heaven."
16:53,280;16:54,280;"Yep."
16:54,280;16:55,280;"Yep."
16:55,280;16:56,280;"Yeah."
16:56,280;16:57,280;"I'm not pregnant but I do that too."
16:57,280;17:03,120;"Well you were getting it in utro dear."
17:03,120;17:05,160;"Triple headers every Sunday."
17:05,160;17:08,320;"Have you ever watched Red Zone Mom?"
17:08,320;17:11,720;"No darling that's Red Zone is when there's all these different games at one time right?"
17:11,720;17:12,720;"Yeah."
17:12,720;17:18,600;"sucks. It really does suck. You can't you can't concentrate on the game. You can't get the flow of the game. You can't get the internet."
17:18,600;17:21,960;"What do you think of fantasy football, Mom?"
17:21,960;17:27,080;"Oh, I tried that, didn't I? You did. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I was pretty crap at it too."
17:27,080;17:34,080;"You did. I know I did. You learned a lot. I did learn a lot. Yes. And I did get excited for the first. Yeah."
17:34,080;17:40,760;"That was by accident. Yes, but I did. No, I know. It's all blind luck. So don't worry about it."
17:41,440;17:45,360;"You have to know too much about the whole league I think and I wasn't. I don't do that."
17:45,360;17:47,760;"You know, I'll do the Patriots and who they play kind of one."
17:47,760;17:52,720;"I used the only thing I did with the whole league was that, what's his name,"
17:52,720;17:59,200;"Payson? Payson's? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That was the only money I earned for 11 years was"
17:59,200;18:04,080;"winning that pool twice. And I used to keep it in a pot thinking, ""Oh, I don't know what I'm"
18:04,080;18:06,800;"going to spend it on, but I've earned this money. This money is mine."""
18:06,800;18:09,200;"Awesome. It's a great time."
18:10,080;18:13,680;"I can't even remember now. Probably something nice though, Stephen. Willy"
18:13,680;18:16,960;"McGinnis Jersey. Maybe. No, that came later."
18:16,960;18:21,520;"All right, anything else?"
18:21,520;18:27,840;"Give us your best patience related moment."
18:27,840;18:35,040;"I don't remember those. Well, go on. We'll cut this part, but I have another question. Go ahead."
18:37,200;18:39,000;"I don't remember incidents."
18:39,000;18:41,120;"I don't even remember last week's game."
18:41,120;18:43,200;"I live in the moment, I enjoy it."
18:43,200;18:45,040;"I can't tell you how many Patriots,"
18:45,040;18:46,440;"Super Bowls we've won."
18:46,440;18:47,640;"And I can't remember who we played."
18:47,640;18:49,800;"I can't even remember Touchdown."
18:49,800;18:51,280;"But it's just, yeah, it is."
18:51,280;18:52,640;"So everything's new to me."
18:52,640;18:55,520;"- But, it's 'cause you're sitting so far from the TV, Mom."
18:55,520;18:56,600;"Like, yes."
18:56,600;18:57,680;"(laughing)"
18:57,680;18:58,880;"- You're hiding behind the couch."
18:58,880;18:59,800;"You barely see it."
18:59,800;19:00,920;"- I do, I say."
19:00,920;19:02,760;"What was the way I was with you, Gregory, the other day?"
19:02,760;19:03,960;"And I was, I mean, no longer going,"
19:03,960;19:06,000;"I was sitting on the stairs at your house."
19:06,000;19:07,600;"- Yeah, I'll say it for that."
19:07,600;19:08,600;"- Oh, God."
19:08,600;19:10,800;"- That was the Patriots' cheats game, yeah."
19:10,800;19:11,640;"- I do, I can."
19:11,640;19:12,640;"- Play off game, yeah."
19:12,640;19:16,480;"- Yeah, I do get very upset if they're not playing well."
19:16,480;19:19,120;"What was the, oh, probably the one moment I do remember"
19:19,120;19:22,920;"is remember when they were really losing in,"
19:22,920;19:23,880;"was it in a Super Bowl?"
19:23,880;19:25,400;"And I said I was going to go to bed"
19:25,400;19:27,280;"and Gregory was on the phone and he's like,"
19:27,280;19:30,440;"don't you dare, we can still win this."
19:30,440;19:33,760;"And then we were like some stupid amount of points down"
19:33,760;19:34,920;"and then we won it right at the end."
19:34,920;19:36,560;"- Oh, the Seahawks Super Bowl?"
19:36,560;19:38,480;"- Yeah, was that the one where we were like--"
19:38,480;19:39,480;"- Oh, the Falcons' talk?"
19:39,480;19:41,240;"- Yeah, yeah, when they came back."
19:41,240;19:43,040;"- You talked to Mom?"
19:43,040;19:43,880;"- I did."
19:43,880;19:45,020;"- You talked to anybody?"
19:45,020;19:47,440;"(laughing)"
19:47,440;19:50,160;"- I called him and I think I was my texting or calling."
19:50,160;19:52,320;"I'm saying, ""Fuck with this, this is crap."""
19:52,320;19:54,600;"I'm not too old to do in this."
19:54,600;19:56,040;"And he said, ""Don't you dare,"
19:56,040;19:58,400;"""you never leave the end of a Patriots game."""
19:58,400;20:01,040;"- Of course I remember that."
20:01,040;20:02,960;"(laughing)"
20:02,960;20:04,440;"- It definitely wasn't texting."
20:04,440;20:05,640;"- Don't call sober."
20:05,640;20:07,360;"(laughing)"
20:07,360;20:08,360;"- But yeah, they came back out."
20:08,360;20:09,960;"I suppose that's the one I remember the most."
20:09,960;20:11,240;"It was really, really cool."
20:11,240;20:14,120;"'Cause I was so sure that they'd kind of like"
20:14,120;20:16,000;"completely lost it."
20:16,000;20:17,200;"And there he pulls it out."
20:17,200;20:18,680;"He does do that well."
20:18,680;20:20,280;"- Mm-hmm, free time."
20:20,280;20:22,200;"- So yeah, that's probably one."
20:22,200;20:26,880;"- My last question is, do you hate the commentators?"
20:26,880;20:29,120;"- No, the only one I hate was Kenneth Wilson."
20:29,120;20:30,280;"Home, was that his name?"
20:30,280;20:32,680;"- I don't know."
20:32,680;20:34,280;"- I was like, ""Hey, I'm still out here."""
20:34,280;20:36,240;"- Whoa, way back, way back."
20:36,240;20:37,080;"Yes, 'cause he was--"
20:37,080;20:38,480;"- I was thinking, ""Damn, dear, Dorv."""
20:38,480;20:39,480;"- No, no."
20:39,480;20:41,160;"- You hated, dear, Dorv, as much as I did."
20:41,160;20:42,240;"- Oh, is it maybe, dear, Dorv?"
20:42,240;20:43,880;"Maybe Kenneth Walserholm is a soccer one."
20:43,880;20:44,880;"I don't know, you'll have to look it up."
20:44,880;20:46,160;"Great, you step-check."
20:46,160;20:48,400;"(laughing)"
20:48,400;20:49,240;"- How about the little--"
20:49,240;20:50,080;"- Listenings."
20:50,080;20:51,080;"- Yeah, he's in the horn."
20:51,080;20:51,920;"- I just did it."
20:51,920;20:52,760;"- Walsenholm."
20:52,760;20:53,600;"- Walsenholm."
20:53,600;20:56,040;"- Walsenholm, he's a soccer guy, man."
20:56,040;20:56,880;"- Is he?"
20:56,880;20:58,360;"Okay, so I hated him."
20:58,360;21:00,680;"from the 1950s and 60s, right?"
21:00,680;21:02,480;"You were like, ""You were a stachec."""
21:02,480;21:04,280;"- I'm a stachec guy."
21:04,280;21:06,080;"(laughing)"
21:06,080;21:08,720;"- Yeah, so Dan Deodorf, I just didn't like,"
21:08,720;21:11,560;"I don't really love any of them."
21:11,560;21:13,520;"The only guy I really liked is Tony Romo"
21:13,520;21:15,640;"has been lately, really, really good."
21:15,640;21:16,920;"I love him. - He almost good."
21:16,920;21:19,760;"- And then who was the guy that was really good like him,"
21:19,760;21:21,760;"but then got a bit-- - All insworth."
21:21,760;21:25,600;"- No. - Joe Thizeman?"
21:25,600;21:27,200;"- Thiz, no, he was his thizeman."
21:27,200;21:28,960;"He was a bit over-backed."
21:28,960;21:29,920;"Yeah, I know."
21:29,920;21:31,360;"It was a player that I liked."
21:31,360;21:31,920;"Yeah."
21:31,920;21:32,760;"Good."
21:32,760;21:34,080;"Kenneth Wolfenstein."
21:34,080;21:38,720;"English soccer."
21:38,720;21:40,240;"[LAUGHTER]"
21:40,240;21:40,760;"I know, too."
21:40,760;21:41,280;"All right."
21:41,280;21:43,520;"So yes, I don't really care about the--"
21:43,520;21:44,840;"Because Andy hates them all."
21:44,840;21:45,320;"Yeah."
21:45,320;21:46,840;"The e-diles, and he probably picked it up for me."
21:46,840;21:48,960;"I probably did shout out to them all, because they used to--"
21:48,960;21:51,080;"well, the Patriots were so bad for so long."
21:51,080;21:53,840;"And they were always kind of like berating them"
21:53,840;21:55,840;"and saying how crap they were, basically."
21:55,840;21:58,240;"And that really used to piss me off, especially if it was on the television"
21:58,240;21:59,480;"because it hardly ever was."
21:59,480;22:00,140;"That's true."
22:00,140;22:02,640;"Because we never, you know, we never were on the television for years."
22:02,640;22:03,440;"I was born with Bella."
22:03,440;22:04,840;"Yep. Always."
22:04,840;22:05,440;"Yep."
22:05,440;22:07,740;"So far we've come."
22:07,740;22:11,340;"Yeah, you've had it so easy."
22:11,340;22:11,840;"Good Lord."
22:11,840;22:13,440;"I was glad we went to that game."
22:13,440;22:15,440;"I think we took you Andy as a baby."
22:15,440;22:17,440;"And you take your mother as well."
22:17,440;22:18,340;"Because you may have a mom."
22:18,340;22:22,540;"Yeah, my mom was here and we decided to go there and we took you."
22:22,540;22:26,340;"And that was the time when it was really, really getting bad."
22:26,340;22:27,980;"It was really rough."
22:27,980;22:30,140;"And I think that was the week before they"
22:30,140;22:32,900;"were passing that doll around the stadium"
22:32,900;22:36,940;"and the female blow up doll and doing obscene things"
22:36,940;22:38,220;"to it in the stands."
22:38,220;22:40,340;"So that was when we decided we wouldn't go anymore."
22:40,340;22:42,780;"But my mother was like, real mother's there."
22:42,780;22:47,020;"Yeah, I'll just take the baby and go into the car."
22:47,020;22:49,660;"And then she said somebody'd come along and peed next"
22:49,660;22:51,820;"to the car while she was sitting in it and things like that."
22:51,820;22:55,820;"It was a really rough scene actually when they were bad."
22:55,820;22:57,820;"- That's awesome."
22:57,820;22:59,820;"- Just dreadful."
22:59,820;23:04,820;"So we stopped going for quite a long time because it was too rough."
23:04,820;23:07,820;"And then it was too expensive when they got better."
23:07,820;23:11,820;"I think I would probably want to season for a while."
23:11,820;23:16,820;"I used to get tickets from the parents at the Montessori school."
23:16,820;23:18,820;"- That's right, yeah."
23:18,820;23:20,820;"- That is cool."
23:20,820;23:21,820;"Anything else?"
23:21,820;23:23,420;"I got one last question, Mum."
23:23,420;23:24,740;"Yes, Stevie."
23:24,740;23:25,220;"My face."
23:25,220;23:26,620;"Which son do you love the most?"
23:26,620;23:28,220;"Oh, the internet!"
23:28,220;23:30,020;"Nevermind!"
23:30,020;23:33,540;"Yes. Oh, yes."
23:33,540;23:34,340;"Always."
23:34,340;23:34,820;"Yes."
23:34,820;23:36,220;"No, no favourites."
23:36,220;23:38,420;"Everybody's just like a pain in the ass, really."
23:38,420;23:42,020;"All right, who's your least favourite?"
23:42,020;23:43,820;"Yeah, I was going to say, which one you hate the most?"
23:43,820;23:46,220;"And why is it Steven?"
23:46,220;23:48,620;"Yeah, that's right."
23:48,620;23:50,620;"Steven by what margin"
23:50,620;23:54,860;"Don't let them be mean to you Stevie"
23:54,860;24:02,640;"All right anything else no thanks for coming on mom, I love you"
24:02,640;24:06,060;"Thank you very much. Bye. Bye. Bye"
24:06,060;24:17,460;"All right welcome back now that we've heard from the one and only the infamous mama Brown infamous"
24:17,460;24:28,740;"Yeah, that sounds nefarious infamous. I'd say podcast famous. Mama Brown. She's famous"
24:28,740;24:32,500;"and one of them just the pod kens, but that's probably her biggest claim to fame. Yes."
24:32,500;24:36,580;"I would think so. Yeah. It's what most people know her for, not for all the good work she's"
24:36,580;24:42,500;"done with the children of America and the children of New Hampshire being a teacher for so long."
24:42,500;24:48,140;"and us. I don't know if she put that on her resume, but yeah."
24:48,140;24:54,980;"But she in the bottom extra critical. Exactly. Also see"
24:54,980;25:02,300;"that. Definitely not the references. No, but Greg has gotten so"
25:02,300;25:07,660;"angry that mom didn't say that he was her favorite that he is not"
25:07,660;25:09,820;"with us at the moment and has nothing to do with the fact that"
25:09,820;25:12,380;"recording this at a different time than the interview with mom."
25:12,380;25:17,380;"But he might be desperate attempt to be even decent at golf."
25:17,380;25:21,060;"Yeah, yeah, it might be something to do with that."
25:21,060;25:25,340;"But he may join us later, we shall see."
25:25,340;25:27,220;"You'll have to stick around to find out"
25:27,220;25:28,980;"like how I teased that Steve."
25:28,980;25:29,820;"Nice."
25:29,820;25:31,920;"(laughs)"
25:31,920;25:36,020;"Yeah, let's talk about some football."
25:36,020;25:39,580;"'Cause we've kind of danced around it talking to mom,"
25:39,580;25:42,700;"But we are finally mercifully."
25:42,700;25:47,220;"I don't know what what would be a good adjective for where we are right now."
25:47,220;25:54,340;"Oh, what the what was that weird, the combination or whatever it was climax of the climax?"
25:54,340;25:55,020;"Yes."
25:55,020;25:57,300;"We had the climax of the 2002 season."
25:57,300;26:00,340;"That's probably a good word for this."
26:00,340;26:03,260;"That I think this game was not anti-climactic."
26:03,260;26:04,260;"Was it?"
26:04,260;26:06,060;"No, this is a great game."
26:06,060;26:06,420;"Yeah."
26:06,420;26:13,300;"I because the rest of these have been a little rough, especially."
26:13,300;26:19,180;"I think last week was probably the, the low points of the season, losing the jets at home."
26:19,180;26:20,580;"For sure."
26:20,580;26:23,240;"I mean, I think that's going to be the low point of any season losing to the"
26:23,240;26:25,580;"jets at home, but this one, especially just because of how they did it."
26:25,580;26:31,320;"And like the fact that it mattered for the playoffs and all of that."
26:31,320;26:35,360;"Um, so I think we should probably apologize again to Lisa for making her"
26:35,460;26:36,540;"I actually watched that game."
26:36,540;26:42,540;"I was all the Titans one was equally is not as bad, but like it was tougher to"
26:42,540;26:42,980;"watch."
26:42,980;26:44,340;"Yeah."
26:44,340;26:45,780;"I mean, neither of them were good."
26:45,780;26:52,380;"So I was just kind of going to watch this game more out of duty than anything"
26:52,380;26:54,300;"and just kind of skim it almost."
26:54,300;26:56,940;"But then when I got into it, I forgot to do that."
26:56,940;27:02,620;"Yeah, I forgot that I've always seen that highlight of Tom Brady hitting"
27:02,620;27:06,700;"Troy Brown in an overtime for like the game when you touched down."
27:06,700;27:08,780;"It was at my name, had the little baseball field."
27:08,780;27:09,300;"Right."
27:09,300;27:12,580;"And then when I first put this game on, I realized it was at New England."
27:12,580;27:14,860;"And I was like, Oh, this isn't that overtime game."
27:14,860;27:16,340;"No games."
27:16,340;27:17,420;"I got to remember."
27:17,420;27:18,380;"Yeah."
27:18,380;27:20,620;"I remember none of this game again."
27:20,620;27:28,140;"I still think I just blacked out for the entire 2002, 2003 area of my life,"
27:30,380;27:34,380;"which may or may not have had to do with the copious amount of drinking I did during those those two years but"
27:34,380;27:43,740;"This like I didn't realize this went to overtime and this was another one of those games where I got I think probably"
27:43,740;27:48,300;"End of the third quarter beginning of the fourth quarter and I thought"
27:48,300;27:52,860;"Wait the Patriots win this game right oh yeah"
27:52,860;27:57,660;"I actually wrote it down. There's a lot of people leaving with five minutes left in the fourth like they showed"
27:58,700;28:02,460;"The typical, like you'd see in most Browns games where people are streaming for the exits,"
28:02,460;28:05,420;"because there's like five minutes left in the fourth quarter is still down by 10."
28:05,420;28:12,620;"And people don't realize who Tom Brady is yet. And I actually wrote down the pages to win this game,"
28:12,620;28:17,100;"right? Because like it didn't quite feel just the way the game was going. It didn't feel like they"
28:17,100;28:22,620;"had enough time. Yep. But this is Tom Brady. We're talking about it was classic Brady."
28:24,220;28:28,460;"It was. So do you want to give it a watchability score for jump into this?"
28:28,460;28:34,620;"I'll give it maybe three and a half, three in the ABC Championship or four."
28:34,620;28:40,700;"It's pretty watchable. But we play like do-do for a lot of it. But it's only watchable because"
28:40,700;28:46,220;"you knew the end of it. If the Dolphins actually won it, like they definitely should have, it would"
28:46,220;28:50,780;"be like a one watchability. And the def and that they thought they were going to."
28:52,940;28:56,940;"But yeah, if the Dolphins win, they're in the playoffs."
28:56,940;28:58,940;"If the Dolphins win, they win the division. Yeah."
28:58,940;28:59,940;"Yeah."
28:59,940;29:01,940;"The playoffs and like a home playoff game."
29:01,940;29:03,940;"I think they missed the playoffs, right?"
29:03,940;29:04,940;"The Jets made it in."
29:04,940;29:05,940;"They did."
29:05,940;29:06,940;"And both the pages."
29:06,940;29:12,940;"They went from a home playoff game to not making the playoffs because they were up 10 with five minutes left."
29:12,940;29:13,940;"What a fucking collapse."
29:13,940;29:18,940;"And the game, the announcer, who have been talking about how they were like already starting to celebrate on the sidelines."
29:18,940;29:19,940;"Yeah."
29:19,940;29:21,940;"Which whoops."
29:21,940;29:27,060;"Yeah, I would probably give it a, yeah, I'd say three and a half would probably be about right."
29:27,060;29:33,940;"I wasn't going to give it a three until I learned my fun fact for this game, which we'll get into in a little bit."
29:33,940;29:37,780;"I would say you can skip the first quarter though."
29:37,780;29:43,300;"I would say that like, I don't know, it was cool watching Ricky Williams be awesome."
29:43,300;29:46,820;"So let's talk about that."
29:46,820;29:50,180;"Ricky running against us for sure. He was a beast."
29:50,980;29:55,780;"So Ricky, we talked about him last time, the Patience by the Dolphins this season."
29:55,780;30:03,860;"And I think Greg went into a deep dive for him, but didn't realize how dominant he was this season."
30:03,860;30:10,820;"He actually led the NFL rushing this season because I showed a stat where it was him and who else?"
30:10,820;30:19,620;"Oh, LT in Priest Homes. Going into the game, I think Priest Homes had already finished his last game."
30:20,740;30:24,260;"He finished with 16 hundred and fifteen yards."
30:24,260;30:28,180;"LT had one more yard than that, but still had a game to go."
30:28,180;30:32,020;"Ricky Williams coming into this game was at 17 hundred and fifty two yards."
30:32,020;30:36,340;"Uh, that maybe not coming into it, but I was like towards half."
30:36,340;30:38,340;"So then..."
30:38,340;30:40,500;"Yeah, exactly."
30:40,500;30:44,420;"Then he went for another hundred and eighty five and two touchdowns in this game."
30:44,420;30:47,140;"He had a hundred and twenty rushing yards in the first half."
30:48,420;30:50,980;"You're just fucking ridiculous."
30:50,980;30:52,820;"I had this too."
30:52,820;30:55,540;"There was a tenth all-time season from Ricky"
30:55,540;30:56,900;"like on the NFL rushing."
30:56,900;30:58,740;"Yeah."
30:58,740;30:59,060;"That's the time."
30:59,060;31:01,780;"I'm sure it's been beaten a bunch since,"
31:01,780;31:03,140;"but still that's a nice story."
31:03,140;31:04,740;"Top 10 rushing season from him."
31:04,740;31:06,660;"Almost 2000."
31:06,660;31:07,540;"All right."
31:07,540;31:09,700;"They talked a lot about Jason Taylor"
31:09,700;31:12,500;"and he had 18 sacks and he was like"
31:12,500;31:15,060;"four away from the NFL record on that too."
31:15,060;31:15,380;"Right."
31:15,380;31:16,500;"And they were talking about how"
31:17,380;31:22,340;"Why are more people considering him for MVP? And I was like, what Jason Taylor? But yeah, he was"
31:22,340;31:28,420;"having like an all star year as well. And they think the playoffs was Fox. Right. Well,"
31:28,420;31:36,180;"I mean, it is the dolphin. This is pretty massive. That's like a nowadays just to have like a"
31:36,180;31:39,620;"all time seasons from two of your players on either side of the ball and still might even"
31:39,620;31:44,820;"make the playoffs. Yeah, I don't think the Jets even get that close."
31:46,260;31:48,260;"They couldn't even get those guys or"
31:48,260;31:56,300;"Yeah, name the the best offensive player the Jets have had in the past 10 years off top your head"
31:56,300;32:01,160;"Definitely Levi on Bell. He's the biggest name"
32:01,160;32:09,020;"He's probably the best offensive player though. Has he done anything though? I'm talking like production wise has anybody actually produced"
32:09,020;32:13,100;"He's on the Jets. You know, he's got he's just you know, that's round about my legs"
32:13,100;32:16,720;"So he sucks to just gets dragged down into the black hole. Good word"
32:16,720;32:22,700;"But I can get him out of there. He's just as good as again. He's probably the most talented player. They've ever had that"
32:22,700;32:26,820;"It's quite in the past 10 years anyway. Yeah, absolutely"
32:26,820;32:31,540;"But I"
32:31,540;32:35,940;"Think the the problem like you're talking about with this this team is that"
32:35,940;32:39,140;"They literally only really had those two guys"
32:39,780;32:44,760;"He was Jason Taylor and defense and Zach Thomas to an extent as well. I'd say but on the offense"
32:44,760;32:48,940;"Yeah, but the offense was Ricky Williams and only Ricky Williams"
32:48,940;32:54,100;"Like I think how did Jay Fiele do in this game he finished with"
32:54,100;32:57,820;"You want to guess how many passing yards he had"
32:57,820;33:02,100;"You didn't have to do too much because this Ricky Williams show he's had to"
33:02,100;33:08,740;"Play action off of it. Well, this is what this is the point I make but so even with that you think like he would be"
33:09,620;33:13,140;"effective doing that, right? So how many passing yards do you think you had in this game?"
33:13,140;33:16,980;"ballpark. I don't know. 200 250. 110."
33:16,980;33:22,420;"Well, it was a completion. Right. And that that included 70.4. That included"
33:22,420;33:31,380;"give you a long of 32. Yeah, that 32 yard touchdown to I don't remember who it was."
33:31,380;33:34,660;"It was a pretty good three. Yeah, I thought he'd play. Okay. Yeah, good throws."
33:35,700;33:40,460;"He missed a lot of like what probably should have been gimmes. Yeah, how it is would be"
33:40,460;33:44,340;"Yeah, but he had that one touchdown, which I don't think was as much"
33:44,340;33:49,020;"Him as it was like Victor Green doing what he did last week"
33:49,020;33:52,160;"It was letting a long ball go literally through his hands for a touchdown"
33:52,160;33:55,180;"That's true, which I think Victor"
33:55,180;34:02,420;"Complimenting that frowns like I should have been a pick. Yeah, it absolutely should have been yet here. We are"
34:02,420;34:09,420;"I would have picked that and he had that one go right through his hands on the tip of"
34:09,420;34:10,420;"all."
34:10,420;34:12,420;"He did."
34:12,420;34:15,420;"He was like already running for the end."
34:15,420;34:16,420;"He was like on the 10 yard line."
34:16,420;34:18,420;"He was already running for the end zone."
34:18,420;34:19,420;"Yeah."
34:19,420;34:22,420;"That was and put it away."
34:22,420;34:23,420;"Yeah."
34:23,420;34:29,420;"So that was part of like the shit that was this first quarter."
34:29,420;34:36,660;"Um, like the Patriots on their first drive, get to midfield and then managed to down the"
34:36,660;34:42,540;"punt at the, the dolphins two yard line, which with Ken Walter as your punter comes around."
34:42,540;34:45,300;"This is probably the second time I can remember this season that it's happened."
34:45,300;34:46,940;"You never."
34:46,940;34:48,060;"Yeah."
34:48,060;34:50,020;"You put those 10 yards deep in the ends."
34:50,020;34:50,420;"All right."
34:50,420;34:54,540;"Actually, no, if you look in the replay, it actually did bounce in the ends on the rest of this."
34:54,540;34:58,860;"No, that was, that was a later on in the kickoff."
34:59,220;35:00,980;"We'll get to it. I thought it was a month, right?"
35:00,980;35:02,940;"No, I know. I know exactly what you're talking about."
35:02,940;35:05,300;"We'll get to that because that was a big play too."
35:05,300;35:10,500;"But yeah, so so Miami starts to drive at their own two yard lines,"
35:10,500;35:11,940;"second drive of the game."
35:11,940;35:16,500;"And for the remealy comes out and throws what basically was a gimme pick six"
35:16,500;35:17,700;"to lower the loy."
35:17,700;35:21,540;"The ball just like bounces off the receiver's helmet or something like that."
35:21,540;35:25,260;"Goes straight up and he has literally two hands on it."
35:25,260;35:29,180;"And he's on like the seven yard line with no between him and the end zone."
35:29,180;35:32,480;"And he just butter fingers it just drops it straight through his hand"
35:32,480;35:36,140;"He was like tucking it and he just fucked up to put it away in your yeah"
35:36,140;35:39,740;"Yeah, you know, you had caught it and it's bringing away and just yeah"
35:39,740;35:44,320;"And he didn't so you know the still the Miami goes three and out"
35:44,320;35:49,060;"Has to punt it so New England actually started at the Miami 39 sorry inside Miami 40"
35:49,060;35:52,060;"and then"
35:52,060;35:56,620;"They attempted to run a QB draw with"
35:57,380;36:01,100;"Patrick Edward Brady Jr. It was not like yeah, it was all like second or third down"
36:01,100;36:04,780;"For and it was like third and six or something like that"
36:04,780;36:10,860;"And they try to QB draw Brady Fumbles and Miami recovers. They don't get any points out of it"
36:10,860;36:13,780;"Yeah"
36:13,780;36:19,280;"That play call I mean looking at it now that play calls terrible, but back then they didn't maybe didn't know how"
36:19,280;36:24,660;"Absolutely awful is Tom where you're carrying and running the bad. I mean, I guess I mean you could see"
36:26,020;36:28,940;"He doesn't run with any sort of"
36:28,940;36:31,340;"grace"
36:31,340;36:33,180;"No courtesy"
36:33,180;36:39,940;"Like and he's like kind of all arms and legs too. So like yeah, it's like a newborn baby dear. Yeah"
36:39,940;36:42,740;"Maybe like a new giraffe"
36:42,740;36:45,660;"It's not it's not great. He doesn't know what to do with his hands"
36:45,660;36:53,060;"And that ball bounce right to Zach Thomas like he caught that on the run. Yeah, he was like coming in run first"
36:53,060;36:56,020;"and just bounce right to him. He's caught on the run and kept going."
36:56,020;37:01,780;"Yeah. So then, of course, Miami now starts at the 50 after that turnover."
37:01,780;37:08,980;"They get one first down and then I think this is underrated."
37:08,980;37:19,540;"But Miami would punt from the New England 35-yard line. They drove all the way down to 35"
37:20,500;37:23,700;"and punted it because they didn't want to try like a 50 year field goal."
37:23,700;37:26,820;"Yeah, and they had a very good kicker, right?"
37:26,820;37:30,900;"Alindomari. Alindomari, yeah. He's a big name."
37:30,900;37:40,100;"Yeah. And I think, like, if this was happening nowadays and you had a team"
37:40,100;37:45,940;"punting from the opponent's 35, they get eviscerated on like social media and like ESP"
37:45,940;37:50,020;"get it all that. But back then, like, it wasn't as much of a thing."
37:50,020;37:53,260;"But that that wouldn't be the only time that happens to"
37:53,260;37:58,580;"and that that three and that and that punt was"
37:58,580;38:05,140;"a touch back like a bounce in the end zone. So the page got at the 20 anyway."
38:05,140;38:09,100;"So if you miss the field, like right around 35, so it's not like it was"
38:09,100;38:13,900;"a huge deal. And then the only other thing that happened at first quarter was"
38:13,900;38:19,980;"Ricky Williams scoring his first of two touchdowns and basically running all over the Patriots."
38:19,980;38:21,940;"It was awesome."
38:21,940;38:27,060;"I mean, in this season, we've seen some pretty awesome backs, absolutely devastated us."
38:27,060;38:28,540;"Oh my God, yeah."
38:28,540;38:29,540;"Pretty strong."
38:29,540;38:32,540;"I'm a shot, healthy, run rough shot."
38:32,540;38:35,540;"And now we got to watch Ricky Williams do the same thing."
38:35,540;38:36,540;"I'm curious."
38:36,540;38:38,540;"How many rushing yards?"
38:38,540;38:39,540;"Oh boy."
38:39,540;38:43,340;"So we ended up not rushing defense this year."
38:43,340;38:45,660;"31st."
38:45,660;38:47,260;"Off."
38:47,260;38:52,220;"I don't know how you finished worse than this, but somebody did."
38:52,220;38:54,740;"Um, that's it."
38:54,740;38:56,980;"I that's a great question."
38:56,980;38:57,820;"I don't know."
38:57,820;39:02,980;"Wait, let me see if I can look this up real quick, but, uh,"
39:08,020;39:14,500;"I'm not sure but the Patriots allowed 2,198 rushing yards on the season"
39:14,500;39:17,220;"How do I find the 2002 season?"
39:17,220;39:23,220;"Yeah, here we go. We're gonna cut this out us looking for a stat. So yeah, guys stupid stats guy"
39:23,220;39:25,620;"Not a sh*t-y golfer guy"
39:25,620;39:28,260;"Give it up Greg. You're not gonna be good at golf"
39:28,260;39:32,500;"All right. Oh, I got it. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. All right, so"
39:32,500;39:34,820;"the bottom"
39:34,820;39:37,020;"Wow, that was a ton of teams."
39:37,020;39:41,060;"The bottom 11 teams gave up over 2,000 yards rushing."
39:41,060;39:47,180;"Patriots, we decided we're second to last."
39:47,180;39:48,940;"Third to last was the Arizona Cardinals."
39:48,940;39:54,380;"Behind them was the Buffalo Bills."
39:54,380;39:57,860;"Cardinals finished 5 and 11 on the season."
39:57,860;40:00,420;"Buffalo Bills finished 8 and 8."
40:00,420;40:00,780;"Let's see."
40:00,780;40:04,220;"Oh, Chicago Bears, number seven with 2,076 yards."
40:04,220;40:05,840;"And we've seen them."
40:05,840;40:07,040;"They finished four and 12."
40:07,040;40:13,880;"And the worst rushing defense in the league was the Seattle Seahawks."
40:13,880;40:15,920;"I'm."
40:15,920;40:17,640;"First, my call."
40:17,640;40:22,680;"They allowed 2,441 yards."
40:22,680;40:24,120;"Am I where we at?"
40:24,120;40:26,780;"Uh, 2,198."
40:26,780;40:27,360;"So they allowed."
40:27,360;40:28,160;"That's really big."
40:28,160;40:28,360;"Yeah."
40:28,360;40:29,720;"Not 200 yards."
40:29,720;40:32,360;"They allowed."
40:32,360;40:33,600;"God damn."
40:33,840;40:36,800;"They allowed an average of 4.9 yards per carry."
40:36,800;40:39,540;"That is brutal."
40:39,540;40:44,160;"The pages are 4.7, which is not much better, but fuck."
40:44,160;40:46,800;"Like none of those are good."
40:46,800;40:52,000;"Well, Eddie George really helped even that out because he had the fucking like two yards per carry."
40:52,000;40:55,000;"And still got 130 yards."
40:55,000;40:56,160;"That's true. Yeah."
40:56,160;41:02,000;"And they've done okay against like, you know, the bills didn't really run it."
41:02,000;41:02,840;"I don't think."
41:02,840;41:07,840;"Yeah, they're okay on some people, but all the big backs, the big names."
41:07,840;41:11,000;"Yeah, the just didn't really run it much either."
41:11,000;41:12,760;"It all that feels right."
41:12,760;41:13,760;"I don't know."
41:13,760;41:21,480;"Yeah, wasn't it wasn't a great season for this rush defense, which I mean, isn't a surprise,"
41:21,480;41:22,480;"right?"
41:22,480;41:24,480;"I mean, to be fair, did you see those blocks?"
41:24,480;41:27,280;"Do you feel they're just throwing on the reverses?"
41:27,280;41:31,920;"Yeah, I think he was."
41:31,920;41:35,080;"They had with three reverses for 60 yards."
41:35,080;41:35,920;"- Yeah."
41:35,920;41:36,760;"- Oh, yeah."
41:36,760;41:38,800;"The wider receiver was the,"
41:38,800;41:39,920;"I actually wrote this down."
41:39,920;41:44,760;"This was the only game that I can remember"
41:44,760;41:47,560;"where the pages would fall for reverses like that."
41:47,560;41:48,760;"I don't know if they were just so like"
41:48,760;41:51,280;"keyed up on trying to stop Ricky Williams, which."
41:51,280;41:52,200;"- Exactly what it was."
41:52,200;41:53,040;"I think it was good play."
41:53,040;41:53,880;"- Didn't work."
41:53,880;41:55,000;"- Yes."
41:55,000;41:55,840;"Chris Chambers."
41:55,840;41:57,080;"- I was trying to scratch that line."
41:57,080;41:59,600;"- Was the second leading rusher in this game,"
41:59,600;42:01,560;"three carries 59 yards."
42:01,560;42:06,920;"So I use averaging what almost 20 yards a carry."
42:06,920;42:08,100;"My math right there."
42:08,100;42:09,800;"Plus the 185."
42:09,800;42:12,980;"You talk at 260 yards rushing."
42:12,980;42:13,760;"Yeah."
42:13,760;42:16,600;"Um, 256 total."
42:16,600;42:20,360;"This was the most rushing yards."
42:20,360;42:21,400;"The pages allowed this season."
42:21,400;42:22,960;"If you're like, and that's the crazy part."
42:22,960;42:24,280;"You can run the ball like crazy."
42:24,280;42:25,280;"You're up."
42:25,280;42:28,600;"He scores into five minutes left and he still lose the game."
42:28,600;42:32,400;"So yeah, that's where it comes down to coaching."
42:32,400;42:36,400;"Um, because I mean, the dolphins were up big."
42:36,400;42:39,460;"They're up 21 seven at the half, right?"
42:39,460;42:42,560;"No, another Ricky Williams touchdown run."
42:42,560;42:45,940;"Patriots doing absolutely nothing."
42:45,940;42:48,060;"They are actually getting booed in the second quarter when they went three"
42:48,060;42:50,480;"and out after Ricky's second touchdown run."
42:50,480;42:55,600;"Um, and then all of a sudden they have one of those drives where."
42:57,040;43:00,840;"I guess you could say Tom Brady put the team on his back, but it was really Kevin Falk on that drive."
43:00,840;43:02,640;"Where all he did like."
43:02,640;43:03,680;"Yeah."
43:03,680;43:06,360;"Yeah, they didn't have Antoine Smith in."
43:06,360;43:07,600;"So it was all Kevin Falk."
43:07,600;43:09,840;"They was catching the ball of the backfield if they ever threw the ball."
43:09,840;43:13,240;"He had that like."
43:13,240;43:15,600;"What do they call it?"
43:15,600;43:18,480;"I don't remember what the routes call, but like where he kind of starts in the back"
43:18,480;43:23,200;"field, it goes out and then cuts back in and he beats Zach Thomas on that."
43:24,440;43:25,960;"They were definitely going after Thomas and coverage."
43:25,960;43:27,680;"He was like a big runstopper."
43:27,680;43:28,480;"Couldn't cover."
43:28,480;43:34,040;"And so like there, it was all he got them all the way down to the 10 yard line."
43:34,040;43:38,840;"And then Antoine Smith had his probably longest run of the game of about 10 yards"
43:38,840;43:40,800;"and ran in for the touchdown, which I thought was unfair."
43:40,800;43:43,200;"You know, it was amazing."
43:43,200;43:44,040;"It's a bit."
43:44,040;43:45,800;"Kevin Paul."
43:45,800;43:47,840;"Yeah, his chin strap."
43:47,840;43:49,600;"Oh my God."
43:49,600;43:50,120;"Yeah."
43:50,120;43:53,400;"The fucking fattest chin strap or like a towel in it."
43:53,920;43:54,760;"- Softly, yeah."
43:54,760;43:56,100;"Like wrap with-- - I was like,"
43:56,100;43:57,100;"I had real bangs,"
43:57,100;43:58,920;"I was like the big, big chin strap,"
43:58,920;43:59,760;"but this one,"
43:59,760;44:00,600;"and this one,"
44:00,600;44:01,440;"they look like a towel,"
44:01,440;44:02,800;"and someone just cut up a gintile,"
44:02,800;44:04,240;"wrap this chin strap in it,"
44:04,240;44:05,080;"and just bare and bare."
44:05,080;44:08,400;"- But it almost looked like it had like sticky tape on it too."
44:08,400;44:11,040;"Like it had that like texture to it on the outside."
44:11,040;44:12,880;"It was amazing."
44:12,880;44:13,720;"- I thought that was like--"
44:13,720;44:15,400;"- Yeah, it almost was like an oven mitt."
44:15,400;44:16,820;"Like an oven mitt there."
44:16,820;44:19,840;"I love that."
44:19,840;44:20,680;"Yeah, I'd forgotten about that,"
44:20,680;44:22,920;"but he was like, that was, I think--"
44:22,920;44:25,400;"- The picture I have in my head always has that."
44:25,400;44:28,560;"- You know, it's like a white goatee on the most."
44:28,560;44:29,680;"It's crazy."
44:29,680;44:30,840;"- Yeah, it's beautiful."
44:30,840;44:33,440;"- But there was a close actually"
44:33,440;44:36,200;"at the end of the first half, began a second,"
44:36,200;44:38,200;"that was looking back was huge."
44:38,200;44:40,880;"'Cause it wasn't in '21, '17, it was '21, '10."
44:40,880;44:43,400;"If you remember, Brady got him a field goal"
44:43,400;44:44,600;"right at the very end of the half,"
44:44,600;44:46,200;"like four or something yards."
44:46,200;44:48,200;"- Oh, that's right, yes."
44:48,200;44:49,040;"Now you're right."
44:49,040;44:51,320;"- And the dolphins come out in the second half"
44:51,320;44:53,660;"and they just run and run, run, run, run, run."
44:53,660;44:54,580;"- Yeah."
44:54,580;44:56,060;"- You miss that touchdown pass."
44:56,060;44:57,980;"Like, you know, they really should have had,"
44:57,980;45:02,380;"like I was wide open and then they missed the field goal there."
45:02,380;45:04,900;"- Yeah."
45:04,900;45:06,020;"- That was kind of like a six point swing lens."
45:06,020;45:07,180;"That'd be huge, right?"
45:07,180;45:08,660;"- Yeah, 'cause the other page came back"
45:08,660;45:10,060;"and kick a field goal too."
45:10,060;45:11,900;"So they're hanging in there."
45:11,900;45:13,260;"It's like 21 13."
45:13,260;45:17,100;"So they're like down a touchdown, not a big deal."
45:17,100;45:20,060;"And then I felt this to me would have been"
45:20,060;45:25,060;"the back breaker for most teams where Miami's driving."
45:25,060;45:27,700;"They were inside New England territory."
45:27,700;45:31,000;"And then I don't remember exactly how it started,"
45:31,000;45:35,460;"but there was like a tip ball and Vrable dove for it."
45:35,460;45:37,580;"And it looked like he was able to get his hand"
45:37,580;45:38,660;"underneath the ball before the ground,"
45:38,660;45:43,660;"like pop it straight up and Lori Maloy caught it"
45:43,660;45:47,100;"off that bounce and returned it to like the Miami"
45:47,100;45:51,380;"five yard line, but then he fumbled it and Jay Fiedler recovered it."
45:51,380;45:54,020;"But then after the end of all that, they ruled it incomplete."
45:54,020;45:55,900;"Anyway, like, oh, you got to be fucking kidding me."
45:55,900;45:56,900;"Nicholas."
45:56,900;46:01,620;"So instead of like either the page tapping at the five or even Miami"
46:01,620;46:03,780;"getting moved all the way back to the five."
46:03,780;46:08,900;"Yeah. Um, well, even then, but like my name would still be like tuck back at"
46:08,900;46:12,020;"their own five yard line instead of being a new new interior."
46:12,020;46:14,460;"Now all of a sudden it's just like that wipes out and they're back at like"
46:14,460;46:15,580;"the new and then 35."
46:15,580;46:22,780;"But that again, that right there, because that goes into the fourth quarter."
46:22,780;46:27,700;"And I think from there on it goes the defense holds and the jet's basically"
46:27,700;46:30,740;"going through and out from that point."
46:30,740;46:33,940;"And then again, this is where Miami skips the 50-hour field goal and"
46:33,940;46:37,580;"punt from the New England 33 yard line."
46:37,580;46:38,580;">> Yeah."
46:38,580;46:40,060;">> And I'll let that sink in."
46:40,060;46:43,220;"They punt it from the New England 33 yard line."
46:43,220;46:44,500;"That whole sequence was so dumb though,"
46:44,500;46:47,380;"because at that point they've been running the ball"
46:47,380;46:49,460;"like crazy, and then all of a sudden on that,"
46:49,460;46:51,020;"you know, first, second, third down,"
46:51,020;46:52,900;"they try to throw it on first and second"
46:52,900;46:54,380;"at the end of the third year."
46:54,380;46:55,740;"And then they try like a draw play"
46:55,740;46:57,780;"that, you know, loses even more yards."
46:57,780;47:00,140;"And they're finally like, well, it was like a 45-yard field."
47:00,140;47:01,700;"Well, now we fucked it up."
47:01,700;47:02,540;"- Yeah."
47:02,540;47:04,100;"- Now it's a 50, let's punt it."
47:04,100;47:06,420;"- Yeah, it's 40, yeah, it was third and seven."
47:06,420;47:08,660;"They ran a draw to Ricky Williams"
47:08,660;47:10,700;"that went from negative five yards."
47:10,700;47:12,100;"- But then he punted it, he ends up too."
47:12,100;47:16,380;"So it's like a net of like, no, this one he actually, he actually did."
47:16,380;47:17,540;"Uh, yeah."
47:17,540;47:23,740;"So they, they pin him at the two, which, you know, I guess makes sense."
47:23,740;47:29,820;"Um, but this is where Brady starts to look like he's hurting."
47:29,820;47:33,140;"Like he throws, he's throwing the ball and he's like grimacing."
47:33,140;47:33,700;"I'm like that."
47:33,700;47:35,580;"That sounds familiar."
47:35,580;47:41,100;"So I looked it up and I think this is why instead of giving it a three,"
47:41,100;47:48,140;"I went with a three and a half because I found an article from, it was actually from February"
47:48,140;47:49,700;"of 2004."
47:49,700;47:56,740;"So after the 2004 Super Bowl from the Boston Globe, it was Boston.com."
47:56,740;48:05,820;"And I was talking about how Brady was getting surgery for, he recently went under, went"
48:05,820;48:11,100;"Arthur's arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder to alleviate some lingering soreness."
48:11,100;48:20,060;"That soreness, where do I have the quote here, says Brady originally injured his throwing"
48:20,060;48:27,820;"shoulder December 16, 2002 at Tennessee. So two weeks ago, a time to pass the end of the first half,"
48:27,820;48:33,420;"Brady suffered a first degree separation on a hit from Tennessee's Jovan curse of his"
48:33,420;48:41,160;"throwing shoulder. So Brady completed 48% of his passes in that game, one of his three"
48:41,160;48:45,360;"games in 52 career starts in which he had completed fewer than half his attempts. And"
48:45,360;48:49,200;"of course, he was limited the following week, which we just lost last week in a whole loss"
48:49,200;48:54,720;"of the Jets, in which he completed 51%. It gets even more ridiculous. In the victory"
48:54,720;48:59,760;"over Miami in the 2002 finale, Brady re-injured the shoulder, this time sustaining a second"
48:59,760;49:05,840;"degree separation. And I know nothing about degrees and all that stuff. But that seems"
49:05,840;49:10,580;"worse. And so he's basically finishing this game on a separated shoulder."
49:10,580;49:15,840;"Well, degrees work this way, Andy. If you have a first degree and then you get another"
49:15,840;49:18,640;"first degree, yeah, then together in a second degree."
49:18,640;49:24,320;"So that was such confidence. And yet I know you're pulling that directly out of your"
49:24,320;49:33,680;"But he's playing this where we this is the fourth quarter."
49:33,680;49:37,200;"He's playing the fourth quarter with a newly"
49:37,200;49:40,160;"Reseparated throwing shoulder."
49:40,160;49:45,120;"Yeah, he definitely looks fucked up and then like every pass was maximum"
49:45,120;49:46,520;"like seven, eight yards."
49:46,520;49:48,840;"Yeah, but it was still coming out."
49:48,840;49:50,240;"Yeah, he's hot."
49:50,240;49:51,600;"Yeah."
49:51,600;49:52,080;"Yeah."
49:52,080;49:55,200;"like the first were on target and like getting where they needed to be."
49:55,200;49:55,440;"Yeah."
49:55,440;49:56,200;"Yeah."
49:56,200;49:57,760;"In between the plays you can tell you it's hurting though."
49:57,760;49:58,480;"Yeah."
49:58,480;50:06,280;"As was Troy Brown, because I think that may have been a couple of weeks ago, too, where he kind of landed on his landed on the ball."
50:06,280;50:09,800;"I thought he landed like on his tailbone or something."
50:09,800;50:14,000;"And he was like, the way he's like coming down and the ball got in between him and his tailbone."
50:14,000;50:16,520;"So he fucking landed awkwardly and kind of shutting down into the ground."
50:16,520;50:16,920;"Something like that."
50:16,920;50:17,280;"Yeah."
50:17,280;50:20,760;"And so like you could tell he was he wasn't moving right there."
50:20,760;50:21,720;"That entire game."
50:21,720;50:23,720;"That may have been last week actually against the Jets, I think."
50:23,720;50:28,620;"And so you can see him kind of having that say because he landed on like"
50:28,620;50:32,440;"price. I want to say it was like the third quarter. He, he caught a ball and"
50:32,440;50:36,180;"landed like that again. And you could see he was in serious pain, but that"
50:36,180;50:40,820;"the Patriots starting at their own to both of those guys hurt and still managed"
50:40,820;50:44,120;"to drive to midfield. I think all the completions were braided to"
50:44,120;50:48,820;"braided Troy Brown to get them out of that hole."
50:50,520;50:52,400;"But then they end up hunting."
50:52,400;50:53,880;"Maybe goes straight out."
50:53,880;50:56,440;"So it's still where we at this point."
50:56,440;51:00,480;"Patriots are still down 11, right?"
51:00,480;51:01,080;"It's still down."
51:01,080;51:02,880;"No, they were quite down 11."
51:02,880;51:04,480;"They're down a little less than that."
51:04,480;51:05,800;"This the 11 is when"
51:05,800;51:06,880;"Oh, right."
51:06,880;51:07,040;"Yeah."
51:07,040;51:10,600;"The office got to the 10 yard line of the Patriots."
51:10,600;51:14,880;"I'd pretty I'm running it primarily down there."
51:14,880;51:16,640;"Like you should be the entire time."
51:16,640;51:18,680;"Well, the only reason they managed to drive down"
51:18,680;51:20,160;"is because Brady got picked off."
51:20,160;51:24,680;"Oh, before. And so they started with, I think, a shorter field. And then, yeah, they literally"
51:24,680;51:27,240;"just ran it straight down the tip."
51:27,240;51:28,720;"I am T. Yeah."
51:28,720;51:29,720;"Yeah."
51:29,720;51:30,720;"It's fault. Yeah."
51:30,720;51:36,360;"Tip by Zach Thomas, of course, covering Troy Brown, which you don't have to happen."
51:36,360;51:42,000;"Well, they have a 33 on the 10 and they throw it. They do like a boot lag and J feet there."
51:42,000;51:48,240;"Right. You've you've run for 180 something yards already in this game. Yeah. Like your"
51:48,240;51:52,320;"offense is literally just Ricky Williams. The Patriots have not shown they can stop you once."
51:52,320;51:58,400;"And so you've got these good touchdowns pretty much game over there's like five minutes left."
51:58,400;52:07,200;"Yeah. Because we get the ball with four minutes 44 seconds and there's a 11 point deficit."
52:07,200;52:14,080;"Yeah, because when they showed the fans streaming out of the stadium, there was just about,"
52:14,080;52:16,180;"Yeah, just under five minutes left."
52:16,180;52:18,640;"And that's why, and they just kick the field goals."
52:18,640;52:21,000;"Now they're up 11, five minutes left,"
52:21,000;52:26,000;"and the Patriots' offense has put up 13 points at this point."
52:26,000;52:30,400;"So it's 24 at 13, Patriots are down big,"
52:30,400;52:34,280;"season on the line, they lose this day, it doesn't matter."
52:34,280;52:35,640;"- Yeah, when dolphins go home,"
52:35,640;52:37,840;"their dolphins go home to have a playoff game."
52:37,840;52:39,540;"- Yeah, and so this is where the Dolphins"
52:39,540;52:40,720;"are celebrating on the sidelines."
52:40,720;52:44,080;"You know, even the commentators have seen"
52:44,080;52:45,440;"they're like talking about it."
52:45,440;52:48,800;"But then the Patriots get a lifeline"
52:48,800;52:53,800;"because they're driving, they're in hurry up."
52:53,800;52:55,120;"It doesn't look like the same hurry up"
52:55,120;52:59,760;"that we're used to seeing these past 10 years or so."
52:59,760;53:03,640;"Like the play calls just seem a little slower"
53:03,640;53:04,440;"and"
53:04,440;53:05,360;"- Well, I guess they're ready to get"
53:05,360;53:07,480;"a very long lined up, is slower."
53:07,480;53:09,440;"- I think we pushed it that far down the field either"
53:09,440;53:10,440;"Cause I don't think he'd throw it."
53:10,440;53:15,280;"Uh, well you say that, but I think you've forgotten what happens on this drive where Brady"
53:15,280;53:20,280;"takes a deep shot to Givens and there's a pass interference call on dolphins defense"
53:20,280;53:24,560;"pass interference, which the announces were bullshit over."
53:24,560;53:28,400;"I thought you know, I never looked like OPI."
53:28,400;53:33,160;"I didn't think you, I thought it was a ticket attack call, but I don't like, I didn't see"
53:33,160;53:34,440;"OPI on that at all."
53:34,440;53:37,680;"I give it's like grab this jersey a little bit."
53:37,680;53:41,360;"I mean, they were both grabbing each other, but it was no like,"
53:41,360;53:45,200;"I didn't think there was anything on either side of it that they should have"
53:45,200;53:47,080;"thrown a flag for, but they did."
53:47,080;53:49,000;"I guess this is where I biased divergent."
53:49,000;53:49,080;"Yeah."
53:49,080;53:50,640;"I thought that was pretty clear."
53:50,640;53:53,960;"I mean, I like the other result and, you know, hopefully a bad call is even out, but."
53:53,960;53:54,920;"Yeah, but you're wrong."
53:54,920;53:55,560;"So that's fine."
53:55,560;54:01,120;"You know, they had this, they had this wrong call on our opponent and then that,"
54:01,120;54:06,120;"you know, holy penalty on William Guinness covering whoever it was on that"
54:06,120;54:06,960;"screen plus."
54:06,960;54:09,520;"You touched down in the Super Bowl."
54:09,520;54:11,320;"That always offered the wrong call."
54:11,320;54:12,800;"There."
54:12,800;54:13,120;"I see."
54:13,120;54:13,960;"I disagree with that."
54:13,960;54:15,040;"That was liturgical."
54:15,040;54:16,640;"That's your shitty."
54:16,640;54:18,360;"We disagree."
54:18,360;54:19,000;"Yeah."
54:19,000;54:24,720;"I'm sure Greg would say the Patriots were in the wrong on both of those"
54:24,720;54:25,440;"if he was here."
54:25,440;54:27,120;"So he can go fuck himself."
54:27,120;54:30,680;"Yeah."
54:30,680;54:35,200;"So the Patriots have now first and first and goal and like the two and the three"
54:35,200;54:42,240;"and they immediately run the patented Tom Brady hard play action, got it to the wide"
54:42,240;54:44,680;"receiver at the back of the end zone, which of course is."
54:44,680;54:47,120;"So boy Troy, Troy Brown."
54:47,120;54:48,960;"So we drew the injury."
54:48,960;54:52,720;"So now they're down five."
54:52,720;54:56,320;"So they need the two point conversion so they can get in field or range."
54:56,320;55:03,720;"And then they do, well, it's probably, I'm sick of Fourier like now, but I'm going to"
55:03,720;55:07,020;"given props for this catch because it was again another."
55:07,020;55:07,940;"Was it a play?"
55:07,940;55:08,560;"Was it even a play?"
55:08,560;55:10,300;"Actually, it was like rolled out to his right."
55:10,300;55:11,780;"So they put Brady on the run."
55:11,780;55:13,140;"Yeah."
55:13,140;55:13,620;"Yeah."
55:13,620;55:16,920;"They put Brady on their run and he found for you in the back"
55:16,920;55:19,800;"corner of the end zone and for me to hell if I catch because that"
55:19,800;55:23,060;"ball was coming in hot and it was high, but he still managed to snag it."
55:23,060;55:24,660;"So that'll patch it down three."
55:24,660;55:26,000;"So now it's a game."
55:26,000;55:27,240;"Now it's 24 21."
55:27,240;55:33,000;"Um, and the pages line up like they're going to."
55:33,000;55:36,520;"to kick the on-size kick."
55:36,520;55:38,520;"And this is the play you were thinking of."
55:38,520;55:39,640;"- Oh yeah, yeah, yeah."
55:39,640;55:44,640;"- Because now, so you're down three, right?"
55:44,640;55:47,440;"Or if you're Dave wants that in the Dolphins,"
55:47,440;55:48,720;"you're up three."
55:48,720;55:53,100;"You see if you get the ball and you run out the clock,"
55:53,100;55:54,760;"you win the division."
55:54,760;55:56,440;"- Well, Peach has still had timeouts, right?"
55:56,440;55:58,760;"They had the two minute warning and timeouts."
55:58,760;55:59,600;"- They did."
56:01,000;56:03,400;"- What do you think when we kick off something like that?"
56:03,400;56:04,760;"- Something like that, yeah."
56:04,760;56:09,000;"But so they line up as if the pages are gonna do"
56:09,000;56:12,160;"and all these kicks, but Adam and Terry kicks it deep."
56:12,160;56:14,560;"And their deep man wasn't deep enough."
56:14,560;56:16,040;"It was a Travis minor."
56:16,040;56:18,720;"Travis Fort minor, if you will, if you Chris Berman."
56:18,720;56:21,600;"You like that, I just came up with that right now."
56:21,600;56:22,760;"That wasn't bad."
56:22,760;56:24,800;"- Fort minor."
56:24,800;56:26,080;"- You don't remember Fort minor?"
56:26,080;56:30,460;"It was the rap group started by the Lincoln Park guy."
56:30,460;56:36,660;"No, no. Oh, yeah. Oh, I guarantee you remember. Hang on. Oh,"
56:36,660;56:39,220;"I just like you could have got a different ways with minor like,"
56:39,220;56:43,260;"you know, working in a mine minor like silver minor or gold minor,"
56:43,260;56:49,260;"but yeah. No, this is about the right time. Yeah, it was Mike"
56:49,260;56:52,980;"Shonoda. No, I guarantee our listeners will understand."
56:52,980;56:57,100;"Remember the name. Oh, yeah. You're guaranteed. Mom's gonna"
56:57,100;57:02,380;"remember the name of Fort Miner, the Lincoln Park guys other rap group."
57:02,380;57:06,220;"Our mother probably will remember this song because she's heard it."
57:06,220;57:10,860;"But here we go."
57:10,860;57:12,860;"I think you'll remember it too."
57:12,860;57:17,460;"You remember this one?"
57:17,460;57:22,540;"This is like a one-hit lemon, right?"
57:22,540;57:24,220;"I don't think they had a lot of success."
57:24,220;57:35,180;"He keeps talking about like all the percentages and they don't add up."
57:35,180;57:36,540;"That's the point I remember about that."
57:36,540;57:41,740;"So 80% grit and 40% of the world 39% this and 27."
57:41,740;57:43,420;"Like, dude, you're like 150%."
57:43,420;57:46,620;"What a fucking narrative, Andy, shut up."
57:46,620;57:48,540;"Go fuck yourself."
57:48,540;57:51,820;"But yeah, so Fort Minor."
57:51,940;57:57,340;"So Travis Fort Minor does not play this well."
57:57,340;58:01,780;"And I think this is a coaching issue because Vintitary kicks it over his head."
58:01,780;58:06,100;"The ball bounces in the end zone and then bounces back out onto the field of play"
58:06,100;58:07,540;"onto like the two yard line."
58:07,540;58:12,580;"And you can see Travis Minor's head like brain is kind of short circuits."
58:12,580;58:14,260;"He's like, should I pick this up?"
58:14,260;58:15,420;"Was it it was in the end zone?"
58:15,420;58:17,500;"Can I like, can I get a touch back on this?"
58:17,500;58:21,460;"And while I was thinking about it, the entire Patriots kick team is rushing"
58:21,460;58:26,020;"So he picks it up and measures to get it back to what like the four, I think."
58:26,020;58:26,620;"Yeah."
58:26,620;58:27,700;"Five ish."
58:27,700;58:30,580;"Yeah, I think I think it was right."
58:30,580;58:32,060;"Yeah, four of the five red line."
58:32,060;58:35,660;"And so not great."
58:35,660;58:40,820;"So what do you do if you're if you're a Miami Dolphins coach, you stuck your"
58:40,820;58:43,420;"old four just over two minutes left."
58:43,420;58:47,060;"You have 241 yards rushing in the game."
58:47,060;58:49,660;"You have you have two options."
58:49,660;58:51,620;"I mean, I'm Steve, you're going to be Dave Wandsat."
58:51,620;58:53,060;"So put on your mustache for a second."
58:53,060;58:55,500;"And I'm going to give you two options."
58:55,500;58:56,460;"One."
58:56,460;58:57,980;"Nice."
58:57,980;59:00,260;"You can, uh,"
59:00,260;59:04,900;"you can come with what, with what got you here in the first place."
59:04,900;59:06,620;"You can run the ball down the page."
59:06,620;59:11,140;"This roads with Ricky Williams who's having a career year, top 10 all time year."
59:11,140;59:14,380;"Or a computer said when they're preparing to kick off."
59:14,380;59:17,260;"Ooh, they have to stop Ricky Williams three times."
59:17,460;59:22,660;"Yep. Or, but you know, everybody's, you know, the Patriots are going to sell it to stop that."
59:22,660;59:29,540;"They have, they've already given up 180 yards to him, but they're going to sell it to stop it. Or"
59:29,540;59:35,220;"do you, I'm sorry, I always got through this little laughing. Do you put the ball in Jay"
59:35,220;59:40,100;"Feather's hands, who up until this point probably has all 110 passing yards that he's going to get?"
59:40,100;59:43,380;"I think you have to trust Pete Carroll, your offensive coordinator."
59:46,340;59:53,500;"And so you're going to choose what Dave wants that shows and throw it three times out of your own end zone with"
59:53,500;59:58,920;"Jay Fiedler who let's just take a quick look at how he did on the season"
59:58,920;01:00:05,540;"2024 yards 14 touchdowns 9 interceptions"
01:00:05,540;01:00:09,260;"Did they even go"
01:00:09,260;01:00:10,860;"Huh?"
01:00:10,860;01:00:14,580;"They didn't even go to the single one right? No, he did not"
01:00:15,380;01:00:20,340;"I mean at least run it on first down to get the clock moving. Yeah"
01:00:20,340;01:00:23,680;"It's down to two minute warning get to that two minute warning"
01:00:23,680;01:00:27,940;"You try to do a hard play action or you can run it again and then throw it on third down"
01:00:27,940;01:00:32,140;"Yeah, it's just I feel like that's that's easy coaching"
01:00:32,140;01:00:35,420;"What are you doing?"
01:00:35,420;01:00:37,980;"Throwing it three times"
01:00:37,980;01:00:40,060;"You have a"
01:00:40,060;01:00:42,700;"241 yards rushing they didn't even get a single x3 yard"
01:00:43,580;01:00:48,380;"Ricky Williams. I'm pretty sure since that third and 10 when they fucking"
01:00:48,380;01:00:53,900;"on third and three from the 10 and they opted to pass didn't get a single"
01:00:53,900;01:01:00,140;"yard rushing yard since then. You actually might be right. Yeah, I don't. They did eventually,"
01:01:00,140;01:01:05,340;"but by that point it did matter. And we'll get to that in a sec. But I just want to point out"
01:01:06,540;01:01:14,860;"that J. Feather had 171 more passing yards than Ricky Williams had brushing yours on the season."
01:01:14,860;01:01:22,940;"That's one of those things is a sure thing and putting the ball in Feather's hands ain't it."
01:01:22,940;01:01:30,540;"Miami makes their bed decides to lay in it."
01:01:32,380;01:01:34,180;"So then now they're punching out their own end zone."
01:01:34,180;01:01:42,660;"And I know we've given Ken Walter a bunch of shit for how bad he's been."
01:01:42,660;01:01:46,620;"But this will this may Ken Walter look good."
01:01:46,620;01:01:48,620;"Mark oils, punting from his own end zone."
01:01:48,620;01:01:50,500;"Yeah, probably by the zone."
01:01:50,500;01:01:52,500;"It's four and three on Miami 11 yard line."
01:01:52,500;01:02:02,100;"Uh, he punts for 23 yards while up three points in a game that you need to get"
01:02:02,100;01:02:05,820;"No playoffs. He puns for 23 yards."
01:02:05,820;01:02:11,460;"So New England starts their drive to tie up this game at the Miami 34 yard line,"
01:02:11,460;01:02:17,020;"which if you will recall is very similar to, um,"
01:02:17,020;01:02:21,980;"where Miami was when they punted from New England 33 at the beginning of this"
01:02:21,980;01:02:23,620;"quarter. That's a good point."
01:02:23,620;01:02:27,980;"So New England immediately goes three and out,"
01:02:27,980;01:02:31,300;"but instead of punting it from the 33 yard line,"
01:02:31,300;01:02:36,100;"I don't even know if they gained any yards on that drive, but Adam"
01:02:36,100;01:02:44,340;"Minutary comes and kicks a long longish 48 49 50 year field goal type type all game."
01:02:44,340;01:02:49,300;"And then there's you know a few seconds left, I think there's probably like 10"
01:02:49,300;01:02:52,740;"and 15 seconds off something like that something like not enough time to do"
01:02:52,740;01:02:53,860;"anything basically. Yeah."
01:02:53,860;01:02:57,140;"I actually know there's"
01:02:57,140;01:02:59,100;"what there was a minute left."
01:02:59,540;01:03:00,860;"Yeah, no, it's a minute left."
01:03:00,860;01:03:07,620;"And Miami tries to do something on the first play, but, um,"
01:03:07,620;01:03:10,020;"if you look at SAC by William Eganis for 60 yards."
01:03:10,020;01:03:16,140;"Um, and so now Miami is back on their own six yard line because they had a penalty"
01:03:16,140;01:03:16,980;"on the kickoff."
01:03:16,980;01:03:22,180;"So they started the 12, get sacked for 60 yards and they're like, you know,"
01:03:22,180;01:03:22,540;"fuck it."
01:03:22,540;01:03:26,220;"So then they give it to Ricky Williams two times and he goes for 10 yards and"
01:03:26,380;01:03:31,140;"than negative two. And the page got all time out with four seconds left because"
01:03:31,140;01:03:35,900;"and this was fucking cool. Um, did you hear them talking about how"
01:03:35,900;01:03:39,180;"Belichick wanted to do the free kick?"
01:03:39,180;01:03:44,060;"Yeah, the game, he was like, he was arguing about trying to argue about how much"
01:03:44,060;01:03:49,860;"time was left and sort of thing. Yeah. So this is, of course, a rule that only"
01:03:49,860;01:03:54,580;"probably only Belichick would know off the top of his head, like in the middle"
01:03:54,580;01:04:00,600;"of a game and know when to call it. But it hasn't happened a long time because it has"
01:04:00,600;01:04:06,400;"to be like the perfect situation. But the rule is, I found this and we'll post the link"
01:04:06,400;01:04:14,140;"in the in the show notes by a profile talk. And so here's it here. It's the NFL has a"
01:04:14,140;01:04:18,740;"little known rule called the fair catch free kick, which allows the team to fair catch"
01:04:18,740;01:04:22,460;"a punt and then line up to kick the ball in the next play from wherever the ball was"
01:04:22,460;01:04:26,060;"fair caught without the defense able to rush and block the kick."
01:04:26,060;01:04:29,600;"If the ball goes through the uprights, it's three points, just like a field goal."
01:04:29,600;01:04:35,460;"So and like the best part, because, you know, the defense can't block it."
01:04:35,460;01:04:39,640;"So you can try longer yardage field goals and the dolphins are"
01:04:39,640;01:04:42,060;"punting from their own, what?"
01:04:42,060;01:04:43,980;"Six yard line, a 16 yard line."
01:04:43,980;01:04:45,620;"Yeah, by the end of it."
01:04:45,620;01:04:52,100;"So they're trying to figure out, but like you have to have enough time left on the clock."
01:04:52,100;01:04:56,040;"So they kind of like took some time off the clock, like they put it down"
01:04:56,040;01:04:59,000;"to three seconds and they put it up to seven seconds, which like, oh, maybe"
01:04:59,000;01:05:00,680;"we'll have enough time to get the fair catch called."
01:05:00,680;01:05:03,800;"And then, uh, then they knocked it back down to four seconds."
01:05:03,800;01:05:08,480;"And by the end of it, like after the punt, uh, the time had run out."
01:05:08,480;01:05:15,440;"So like that would have been a hell of a way to end, uh, uh, not just a game,"
01:05:15,440;01:05:19,280;"but an NFL season, like imagine if that's how you lose on this."
01:05:20,160;01:05:21,880;"obscure rule. Yeah."
01:05:21,880;01:05:23,720;"In the fucking 1950s."
01:05:23,720;01:05:24,440;"Right."
01:05:24,440;01:05:27,080;"Which would have been amazing."
01:05:27,080;01:05:29,880;"So the fact that it didn't happen kind of sucks."
01:05:29,880;01:05:34,880;"But then New England wins the toss for overtime."
01:05:34,880;01:05:38,120;"And we all know it happens when patrons win"
01:05:38,120;01:05:40,960;"and over an overtime coin toss."
01:05:40,960;01:05:42,720;"And that is"
01:05:42,720;01:05:45,240;"yeah, the huge."
01:05:45,240;01:05:47,720;"Although this one was a little"
01:05:49,120;01:05:51,320;"It actually gets worse for the dolphins."
01:05:51,320;01:05:54,680;"Like, if we have any dolphins fans on here, they're probably,"
01:05:54,680;01:05:59,000;"if they're not blacked out drinking by now, they probably are about to be."
01:05:59,000;01:06:02,280;"Because New England wins the toss."
01:06:02,280;01:06:07,480;"And then Miami immediately sends a kick off out of bounds."
01:06:07,480;01:06:09,680;"Yeah, yeah."
01:06:09,680;01:06:12,160;"The dank."
01:06:12,160;01:06:16,680;"Unlike the two-yard line, too, it was like so close to being a touchback."
01:06:16,680;01:06:22,120;"But it was a kickoff out of bounds and it gets the pages start over time at the"
01:06:22,120;01:06:23,000;"old four yard line."
01:06:23,000;01:06:26,960;"And then they just like opened up the bag of tricks."
01:06:26,960;01:06:30,120;"They tried on the first play, they tried the patent wide receiver pass that"
01:06:30,120;01:06:37,200;"worked against Indianapolis last year, where Patton tried to throw deep to Troy"
01:06:37,200;01:06:42,280;"Brown. Speaking of overtime, look who we have here."
01:06:42,280;01:06:43,960;"Hello, hello, hello."
01:06:43,960;01:06:44,960;"Wow."
01:06:45,280;01:06:50,960;"Welcome back to Patriots Dynasty podcast this week 17 2002"
01:06:50,960;01:06:57,400;"How many long parties you give a Greg I give it four out of six"
01:06:57,400;01:07:00,800;"That's that's what I gave it"
01:07:00,800;01:07:02,960;"Good you want me?"
01:07:02,960;01:07:07,920;"You guys I gave it three and a half three and a half. There's a great game"
01:07:07,920;01:07:11,400;"Did you watch it?"
01:07:11,400;01:07:14,600;"Yeah, I watched the prime time highlights"
01:07:14,600;01:07:17,200;"Oh, okay. Real barn burner, huh?"
01:07:17,200;01:07:19,880;"Was at the end there. Yeah."
01:07:19,880;01:07:24,800;"It was more of just a calamity of mistakes by the dolphins."
01:07:24,800;01:07:27,200;"More anything. That's what we've been talking about. Yeah."
01:07:27,200;01:07:30,120;"I would hate to be a dolphins fan in this game."
01:07:30,120;01:07:32,000;"That's what we're talking about. Yeah."
01:07:32,000;01:07:34,520;"They because they've punted twice."
01:07:34,520;01:07:36,240;"Yeah. If they win this, they win the division."
01:07:36,240;01:07:37,680;"They get a whole playoff game."
01:07:37,680;01:07:42,520;"If they lose, they're out of the playoffs and they're out 11"
01:07:42,520;01:07:44,040;"with five minutes left to go."
01:07:44,120;01:07:46,520;"They're already celebrating on the sidelines."
01:07:46,520;01:07:49,880;"And then Brady happens."
01:07:49,880;01:07:51,800;"Well, defensive pass and fear happens."
01:07:51,800;01:07:59,160;"And then it all just falls apart for the Dolphins."
01:07:59,160;01:08:00,840;"So Patriots, where we're in overtime now,"
01:08:00,840;01:08:04,520;"the Patriots try the patent wide receiver pass first play."
01:08:04,520;01:08:06,240;"The second play is the Falk Direct Snap,"
01:08:06,240;01:08:07,840;"where Brady pretends the ball on over his head."
01:08:07,840;01:08:09,600;"That goes for 15."
01:08:09,600;01:08:14,160;"And then Falk has an incredible sideline catch,"
01:08:14,160;01:08:17,800;"which I think I was saving this take"
01:08:17,800;01:08:19,400;"for the end of this podcast."
01:08:19,400;01:08:23,000;"'Cause I thought we're gonna do our best and worst"
01:08:23,000;01:08:26,000;"for the season, but I think I'm gonna just come out with it now."
01:08:26,000;01:08:30,320;"My hot take is Kevin Falk was the MVP of this team in 2002."
01:08:30,320;01:08:34,240;"- I think you have some recency bias, Andy."
01:08:34,240;01:08:35,080;"- Nope."
01:08:35,080;01:08:37,000;"- I think he played well down the stretch,"
01:08:37,000;01:08:39,680;"but I don't know if the whole season he was the MVP."
01:08:39,680;01:08:40,640;"- He wanted to-- - Let the league"
01:08:40,640;01:08:42,720;"and kick off returns."
01:08:42,720;01:08:43,880;"- Okay."
01:08:43,880;01:08:45,560;"- They had two TDs, right?"
01:08:45,560;01:08:48,520;"- If you only play in the NFL with, yeah, two TDs."
01:08:48,520;01:08:50,800;"He's the only player in the NFL that had a receiving"
01:08:50,800;01:08:52,560;"and a kick return touchdown."
01:08:52,560;01:08:54,560;"- Okay."
01:08:54,560;01:08:57,440;"- And then like you said down the stretch"
01:08:57,440;01:08:59,880;"when everybody was falling apart,"
01:08:59,880;01:09:02,120;"we found out you weren't here for this,"
01:09:02,120;01:09:05,920;"but Tom Brady was playing on a separated shoulder"
01:09:06,840;01:09:10,180;"that he suffered in the first half of the Tennessee game,"
01:09:10,180;01:09:13,400;"which is why he played shitty in the last two weeks,"
01:09:13,400;01:09:16,800;"but then we separated it halfway through the fourth quarter"
01:09:16,800;01:09:18,600;"of this game, which we saw,"
01:09:18,600;01:09:20,800;"and you can see him physically"
01:09:20,800;01:09:22,560;"wincing every time he threw the ball."
01:09:22,560;01:09:27,040;"But literally the only person who was left"
01:09:27,040;01:09:29,960;"in actually doing anything down the stretch of this"
01:09:29,960;01:09:32,040;"on offense was Kevin Falk."
01:09:32,040;01:09:35,620;"What about Rohan Davy?"
01:09:35,620;01:09:46,440;"one of the locker room guy. Cannon of an arm. I think he's MVP. If we're just going"
01:09:46,440;01:09:52,120;"to throw out ridiculous names, Andy. All right. Give me a better name than Greg. Troy Brown."
01:09:52,120;01:09:59,620;"Troy Brown is the best player on this team all season. I do know I'm not saying that"
01:09:59,620;01:10:04,400;"because I'm not going to argue against Troy Brown. So that's like a catch. Exactly."
01:10:04,400;01:10:10,160;"Joey Brown has been like overwhelmingly impressive this year. Kevin Falva. I think he's had a decent year, but"
01:10:10,160;01:10:17,760;"I think, yeah, I think Troy Brown started really strong, but then when he got hurt, he was never the same guy this season. Yeah, but I mean,"
01:10:17,760;01:10:21,680;"like he was a good role player. Was that Steve?"
01:10:21,680;01:10:28,080;"Yeah, hurting that Chiefs game from, I remember when he missed like the fourth quarter over time and he had his career high."
01:10:28,080;01:10:29,680;"Yeah. Came back and he was."
01:10:29,680;01:10:30,480;"Yeah."
01:10:30,480;01:10:30,880;"And then he got hurt."
01:10:30,880;01:10:34,040;"But he never like, yeah, he was, he was like,"
01:10:34,040;01:10:37,040;"start to get back into who he was,"
01:10:37,040;01:10:38,120;"but then he got hurt again."
01:10:38,120;01:10:41,280;"So like, it didn't quite, like it wasn't the Troy Brown"
01:10:41,280;01:10:43,080;"that we all know he can be."
01:10:43,080;01:10:45,440;"And I think he would probably agree with that."
01:10:45,440;01:10:46,800;"- Mine is going to be Willie McGinnis."
01:10:46,800;01:10:48,280;"He was a beast all year."
01:10:48,280;01:10:49,560;"- Big Willie."
01:10:49,560;01:10:51,680;"- I mean, yeah, but this defense also gave up"
01:10:51,680;01:10:54,120;"the second most rushing yards in the league this season."
01:10:54,120;01:10:57,200;"So giving it to anybody on the defense seems."
01:10:57,200;01:10:59,200;"- I'm not going to play that at Willie's."
01:10:59,200;01:11:01,320;"- [laughs]"
01:11:01,320;01:11:03,360;"He's part of defensive line, no?"
01:11:03,360;01:11:04,960;"- No, he's played in linebacker."
01:11:04,960;01:11:06,320;"- I think he's a defensive end."
01:11:06,320;01:11:08,500;"- What is, yeah, what is he technically?"
01:11:08,500;01:11:10,120;"- I think he's, I don't know,"
01:11:10,120;01:11:11,640;"I thought he was a defensive end."
01:11:11,640;01:11:15,160;"- Yeah, defensive end."
01:11:15,160;01:11:15,980;"- That's so fun."
01:11:15,980;01:11:19,080;"(mumbles)"
01:11:19,080;01:11:26,880;"- He's also listed in 2004 as a left outside linebacker."
01:11:26,880;01:11:28,720;"And in his first two years as well."
01:11:28,720;01:11:33,280;"You have five and a half sacks that was tied for the team lead"
01:11:33,280;01:11:36,400;"with old big big Richard"
01:11:36,400;01:11:39,760;"Dick and Willie but"
01:11:39,760;01:11:42,600;"defensive MVP"
01:11:42,600;01:11:50,000;"You also had one exception and ten passes defended"
01:11:50,000;01:11:55,240;"That's oppressive. It probably just gets his mitts up there, you know like JJ SWAT"
01:11:56,160;01:12:03,440;"Yeah, I mean it's gotta be right because so it's tarell buckley with 12 and then William you get us in tie law with 10"
01:12:03,440;01:12:12,760;"Big Willie gets his hands on footballs. So I love that. He really gets his hands on balls. Yes, he does"
01:12:12,760;01:12:15,880;"Yeah"
01:12:15,880;01:12:19,880;"Yeah, so just to finish this game though the Patriots would eventually"
01:12:20,280;01:12:26,800;"Kick a out of a naturary 35-yard field goal to win it and a look on Dave Wands that's face as soon as they showed"
01:12:26,800;01:12:28,800;"That as soon as they kicked it was fantastic"
01:12:28,800;01:12:31,600;"Come on"
01:12:31,600;01:12:33,160;"Yeah"
01:12:33,160;01:12:36,960;"It reminded me of who's the Steelers coach at this point?"
01:12:36,960;01:12:42,600;"With your yeah, it had a like cower feel to it"
01:12:42,600;01:12:49,700;"Just the like the sulking with the mustaches. Yeah, they're similar looking dudes aren't they a little bit. Yep"
01:12:49,700;01:12:51,700;"But he was also like"
01:12:51,700;01:12:58,140;"One stat was like super fired up like he I wrote down here. He looked like a harball out there"
01:12:58,140;01:13:01,580;"Like screaming at the referee's and like just"
01:13:01,580;01:13:06,300;"Sticking and just like over the top just pissed off on these referees"
01:13:06,300;01:13:09,980;"Which good fuck him"
01:13:09,980;01:13:12,740;"You hate the referees"
01:13:12,740;01:13:19,060;"No, I just hit the dolphins. You want to go down there you want to go down the commentator route Andy. Let's do it"
01:13:19,060;01:13:24,940;"I love how you now bring it up. I didn't really have anything. I just figured you were all pissed off about something"
01:13:24,940;01:13:31,560;"Well, I will say that the the game that we watched"
01:13:31,560;01:13:36,640;"Whether the the feed that we watch I didn't realize at first was the German feed"
01:13:36,640;01:13:42,560;"Yes, ah, see Deutsche that was funny because it was the American like"
01:13:42,560;01:13:47,580;"Broadcast but it was must have been broadcast in Germany"
01:13:48,340;01:13:51,900;"Because the first two commercial breaks they didn't go to commercials"
01:13:51,900;01:13:55,320;"They just kind of like showed a recap of what happened in the last three games"
01:13:55,320;01:13:58,100;"commentated in German"
01:13:58,100;01:14:05,000;"Oh the Patriots blah blah blah blah blah they so they lost to the Tennessee Titans and then"
01:14:05,000;01:14:09,760;"What a German word for touchdown in German. They just sent touchdown like"
01:14:09,760;01:14:14,900;"Yep, that makes sense. Yeah, and then"
01:14:15,780;01:14:22,260;"And then every time there would be a game break like oh, let's go back to New York Jim Nance and then it wouldn't"
01:14:22,260;01:14:28,400;"Just like shots of the sideline and like of the field and stuff and just silence"
01:14:28,400;01:14:31,100;"Like oh Jim Nance. What do you got?"
01:14:31,100;01:14:35,380;"And I realized I was like much and God gladden bock"
01:14:35,380;01:14:42,160;"I realized I was like Pavlov's dog. I'm just like waiting for like oh, what's coming now?"
01:14:42,160;01:14:44,160;"We're getting a little tidbit of something else and then just"
01:14:44,780;01:14:48,860;"Nope, nope salivating for nothing. I love the German language"
01:14:48,860;01:14:55,120;"Yeah, it's a it's a language that's spoken yelled angrily, you know"
01:14:55,120;01:14:58,700;"Yes, I just crooping"
01:14:58,700;01:15:06,020;"Well, that was like a tool had that song on one of their albums that was a song might be a strong word"
01:15:06,020;01:15:09,700;"A track that was like"
01:15:10,340;01:15:16,380;"Super like it was just like a super angry guy reading like like yelling German. It sounds like really ominous"
01:15:16,380;01:15:21,220;"They have like ominous music over it, but if you look it up. He's actually just reading a recipe for how to make like"
01:15:21,220;01:15:23,780;"Brand or donuts or something like that"
01:15:23,780;01:15:28,180;"It's fantastic. Yeah, that's awesome. Yeah"
01:15:28,180;01:15:34,660;"Poor Germans, you know, what did they ever do to anybody?"
01:15:38,420;01:15:42,980;"I will give shit to the crowd in this game though because they were fucking silent all the way through this"
01:15:42,980;01:15:46,500;"And they will leave him before the game is over Greg Brown would have been appalled"
01:15:46,500;01:15:54,420;"Yeah, never leave a game early never leave a game early take your lumps. That's right. Yeah, I agree with that"
01:15:54,420;01:15:57,220;"But like they weren't even booing they were just"
01:15:57,220;01:16:00,820;"Sire yeah"
01:16:00,820;01:16:06,020;"I thought that as well. They were not nearly as fired up. Yeah, there's I mean this this game"
01:16:06,660;01:16:11,420;"Like matters as to whether or not you get in the fucking playoffs and like you're not doing anything like come on"
01:16:11,420;01:16:18,800;"Yeah, they don't know what they'd be missing if there was no fans there, you know now that I've had to"
01:16:18,800;01:16:24,700;"Suffered through a year of no fans. Yeah as soon as I get back in one of those stadiums"
01:16:24,700;01:16:29,660;"Oh boy, you think I'm not a black belt before"
01:16:33,660;01:16:37,500;"Well that that's 11 drunk tank hasn't seen anything yet"
01:16:37,500;01:16:42,520;"The Durham Bulls triple-A baseball team like all these kids turn around"
01:16:42,520;01:16:47,180;"It's great Brown just makes fucking no"
01:16:47,180;01:16:50,140;"topless"
01:16:50,140;01:16:56,700;"On top of the dugout pants on that's you know how people have been talking about like what's your benchmark for when like"
01:16:56,700;01:17:02,580;"This quarantine is over. Yeah, cuz I don't think it's gonna be like a sudden stop right?"
01:17:02,580;01:17:08,720;"It's all gonna be different for everybody when you feel like it's over mine is going back to a sporting event"
01:17:08,720;01:17:16,660;"That's pretty good one. Yeah, yeah, just going back to anything like go to a movie too or something like that"
01:17:16,660;01:17:19,300;"Hmm any of those things for me"
01:17:19,300;01:17:22,820;"Yeah, but it's gonna be great in 2022 when we actually get to do this"
01:17:22,820;01:17:25,780;"That was a funny way of saying 2024"
01:17:25,780;01:17:32,380;"I ain't playing anymore back. I'm gonna end though. We know you already got me dumb looking at that"
01:17:32,380;01:17:35,380;"Yeah, we did. I was the closest and"
01:17:35,380;01:17:44,020;"And even I said September and we're already past that because it's now October so happy also"
01:17:44,020;01:17:46,740;"predicted this this season will be canceled already Andy"
01:17:46,740;01:17:52,700;"Give it time the the Titans are doing their best. Yeah, dude tight. We're gonna go anywhere anyways"
01:17:52,700;01:17:56,460;"Let's just kick him out of the league. It's like a panhell and Josh out and suck Greg"
01:17:56,460;01:18:00,900;"Yeah, if you're not in first place and you get all these fucking"
01:18:01,500;01:18:06,780;"COVID's then you should just have to take an L for that week."
01:18:06,780;01:18:09,660;"Aren't the Titans undefeated right now in the season?"
01:18:09,660;01:18:11,580;"Yeah, but they suck, right, Steve?"
01:18:11,580;01:18:18,300;"Did you see who won AFC offensive player of the month?"
01:18:18,300;01:18:21,100;"Oh, Josh Rolla, coaster, Alan."
01:18:21,100;01:18:22,220;"That's right."
01:18:22,220;01:18:25,820;"Because these scores always points in the first half and then as you get"
01:18:25,820;01:18:27,780;"billed up by the rest in the fourth quarter."
01:18:27,780;01:18:29,500;"Look at this spin zone, Andy."
01:18:29,500;01:18:33,940;"We'll find out when we play them, I guess."
01:18:33,940;01:18:34,440;"Yeah."
01:18:34,440;01:18:37,420;"So can you find MVP, Steve?"
01:18:37,420;01:18:40,020;"We're going to have to make you do something shady."
01:18:40,020;01:18:44,020;"He should have to eat the chicken wing hat."
01:18:44,020;01:18:48,780;"Oh, sounds filling."
01:18:48,780;01:18:54,900;"So Greg, did you have anything you wanted to talk about on this?"
01:18:54,900;01:18:55,400;"Yeah."
01:18:55,400;01:18:58,780;"Do you notice the jersey I'm wearing currently?"
01:18:58,780;01:19:02,440;"Would you like to? I've noticed it, but I figured this is an audio medium."
01:19:02,440;01:19:04,020;"So we may have to explain it to our listeners."
01:19:04,020;01:19:05,260;"Okay."
01:19:05,260;01:19:09,740;"It is a Brown's Jersey with the number 10 on it."
01:19:09,740;01:19:11,180;"With a number 10 on it."
01:19:11,180;01:19:12,900;"That's what I'll give you right now."
01:19:12,900;01:19:15,660;"Can you take a guess for what name is on the back?"
01:19:15,660;01:19:17,740;"I want to say Kelly Holcomb."
01:19:17,740;01:19:19,220;"That's why."
01:19:19,220;01:19:20,220;"Correct."
01:19:20,220;01:19:22,660;"Why did I get that right?"
01:19:22,660;01:19:23,740;"Kelly fucking."
01:19:23,740;01:19:24,820;"Do you want to?"
01:19:24,820;01:19:27,340;"Why I wore this jersey today?"
01:19:27,820;01:19:33,580;"First I want to know why you have that Jersey. That's a question. I don't have an answer"
01:19:33,580;01:19:38,380;"I have no fucking clue. Fair enough. All right. Why'd you wear it today?"
01:19:38,380;01:19:41,180;"because"
01:19:41,180;01:19:43,180;"this is"
01:19:43,180;01:19:47,820;"Peak Kelly Holcomb right now. Well, that's a phrase I don't think even his mother would say but okay"
01:19:47,820;01:19:50,620;"The Browns made the playoffs. Did you know that?"
01:19:50,620;01:19:52,140;"No"
01:19:52,140;01:19:54,620;"After this week the browser - mmm-hmm"
01:19:55,180;01:19:56,780;"Because I knew they were in the hunt."
01:19:56,780;01:19:59,380;"This is their last playoff appearance."
01:19:59,380;01:20:00,980;"It's 2002."
01:20:00,980;01:20:01,300;"All right."
01:20:01,300;01:20:03,540;"So yeah, let's I think that's the perfect segue"
01:20:03,540;01:20:07,620;"because the playoffs this year were an absolute shit show"
01:20:07,620;01:20:09,220;"in the AFC East."
01:20:09,220;01:20:10,780;"We're in the OK in general."
01:20:10,780;01:20:12,340;"See this game was amazing."
01:20:12,340;01:20:13,700;"The Steelers Browns game."
01:20:13,700;01:20:14,700;"Did you see this?"
01:20:14,700;01:20:16,660;"No."
01:20:16,660;01:20:18,660;"Then why is it a shit show?"
01:20:18,660;01:20:21,540;"I'm just saying in terms of like who got in and who didn't"
01:20:21,540;01:20:24,060;"and how they figured it out."
01:20:24,060;01:20:31,020;"I think you're just butthurt because the paths didn't make no like almost every team finished like nine and seven and so like the"
01:20:31,020;01:20:34,440;"So here you go. You let's do this so I breakers"
01:20:34,440;01:20:41,900;"Yeah, so it's basically one two three four five six seven eight tie breakers had to be figured out. Oh"
01:20:41,900;01:20:45,620;"You're cool"
01:20:45,620;01:20:49,500;"So basically after this game. This was the early game"
01:20:49,500;01:20:55,360;"So the Patriots won so they were now 9 and 7 with dolphins and had the"
01:20:55,360;01:20:59,360;"tiebreaker over the dolphins because they had"
01:20:59,360;01:21:05,580;"Based on a better division record a page before and two in the division Miami was two and four"
01:21:05,580;01:21:08,120;"so if the Jets lost to"
01:21:08,120;01:21:10,760;"the Packers"
01:21:10,760;01:21:15,880;"They would finish 8 and 8 and the Patriots would win the AOC East"
01:21:15,880;01:21:18,620;"They would be as the Germans say kaput"
01:21:19,320;01:21:24,920;"Correct. We should do this the rest of this in German. At any chance we can stop."
01:21:24,920;01:21:29,640;"Let's see. We have limited German, but let's try and incorporate as much as we can."
01:21:29,640;01:21:38,360;"So the the the agreement packers were heavily favored to to invade the New York Jets."
01:21:44,440;01:21:47,840;"as if they were a Polish nation."
01:21:47,840;01:21:50,680;"But instead France."
01:21:50,680;01:21:53,220;"OK, France. Yeah, but instead the"
01:21:53,220;01:21:55,520;"what was it? The the the"
01:21:55,520;01:21:57,620;"May Magna line or something."
01:21:57,620;01:22:01,280;"The Luftwaffe. No,"
01:22:01,280;01:22:02,460;"they know this this one."
01:22:02,460;01:22:03,820;"Just drop this."
01:22:03,820;01:22:05,620;"Just a good effort."
01:22:05,620;01:22:08,460;"But so the jets actually beat"
01:22:08,460;01:22:12,220;"the heavily favored Green Bay Packers,"
01:22:12,220;01:22:18,740;"which prevented Brett Far from getting the MVP award, which"
01:22:18,740;01:22:21,620;"talked about. And you know, this is Chad Pennington coming"
01:22:21,620;01:22:22,500;"back to haunt us again."
01:22:22,500;01:22:24,020;"Chadwick pennington."
01:22:24,020;01:22:27,580;"Chadwick pennington the third Charles Chadwick pennington the"
01:22:27,580;01:22:32,980;"third. Oh, update on that square. I got a guy that I work with"
01:22:32,980;01:22:37,060;"named Chad. And I asked him today, is your full name Chadwick?"
01:22:37,060;01:22:38,700;"Nope, just Chad."
01:22:40,140;01:22:42,060;"So you now call him Chadwick, correct?"
01:22:42,060;01:22:42,860;"Yes, yes."
01:22:42,860;01:22:43,860;"Yeah."
01:22:43,860;01:22:46,460;"As you as you must be esteemed."
01:22:46,460;01:22:53,020;"So now the jets are also nine and seven in the FCE East, but they finish ahead of New England."
01:22:53,020;01:22:57,500;"In the ASE based on better record in common games."
01:22:57,500;01:23:01,820;"They were eight and four to seven and five against common opponents."
01:23:01,820;01:23:07,740;"And they beat Miami based on a better division record for and two to Miami's two and four."
01:23:07,740;01:23:09,060;"So it was just first,"
01:23:09,060;01:23:13,980;"Patriot second Miami 30, even though they're all 97 brain hurts."
01:23:13,980;01:23:16,500;"And then that's just the AFC East."
01:23:16,500;01:23:21,180;"Cleveland managed to cleanse the AFC, the 60 in the AFC over instead of Denver"
01:23:21,180;01:23:24,820;"or New England based on better conference record because Cleveland went"
01:23:24,820;01:23:28,940;"seven and five in the AFC Denver went five and seven, New England six and six."
01:23:28,940;01:23:34,100;"So Cleveland barely does that because basically because they beat the sealers."
01:23:34,500;01:23:39,380;"So instead of going six and six million time in New England, they get that tiebreaker."
01:23:39,380;01:23:45,980;"Oakland clinched the AFC first seed instead of Tennessee because Oakland beat Tennessee"
01:23:45,980;01:23:47,540;"in the regular season."
01:23:47,540;01:23:48,700;"So there was tiebreaker there too."
01:23:48,700;01:23:52,820;"But even though they finished the same record and then San Diego finished"
01:23:52,820;01:23:55,980;"your head of Kansas City and the AFC West based on better division record, even"
01:23:55,980;01:24:01,900;"though they finished with the same record, Philadelphia clinched the NFC, the one seed"
01:24:01,900;01:24:05,420;"in the NFC instead of Green Bay or Tampa Bay based on a better"
01:24:05,420;01:24:07,820;"conference record because Philadelphia went 11 and one in"
01:24:07,820;01:24:10,980;"the conference, as opposed to Green Bay going and Tampa Bay"
01:24:10,980;01:24:14,820;"going nine and three, you ran the Tampa and then Tampa Bay"
01:24:14,820;01:24:18,100;"cleansed the two seed over Green Bay, even though they had"
01:24:18,100;01:24:22,420;"the same conference record and same record because we already"
01:24:22,420;01:24:27,100;"noticed that Tampa beat Green Bay remember when Brett far"
01:24:27,100;01:24:28,860;"through a shit ton of interceptions."
01:24:29,620;01:24:35,860;"Yeah. Shocking. So they got the two seed in Green Bay was a three seed because they didn't beat the jets where they could have been the one seed."
01:24:35,860;01:24:47,940;"I feel like you can just say that there was three 12 and four teams in the NFC and then two 11 and five teams and a 10, five and one team in the AFC."
01:24:47,940;01:24:53,720;"So like the tops are super close and then there's a million eight and eight and nine and sevens, including the entire."
01:24:53,720;01:25:00,280;"AOC East and St. Louis finished, you had a Seattle in the NFC West based on a better vision record."
01:25:00,280;01:25:02,400;"It's based time. Yeah."
01:25:02,400;01:25:05,640;"So an absolute shitsh are going to that."
01:25:05,640;01:25:07,480;"But you don't even see anymore."
01:25:07,480;01:25:08,920;"I need a mind map."
01:25:08,920;01:25:10,720;"Can you draw this for me, Andy?"
01:25:10,720;01:25:11,720;"Yeah, I'll make sure."
01:25:11,720;01:25:14,960;"I'm more of like a picture learner, you know, like a picture book guy."
01:25:14,960;01:25:16,080;"Oh, we know."
01:25:16,080;01:25:21,760;"So if you could, if you just get back to me with maybe some like crayon drawings that explain,"
01:25:21,760;01:25:24,720;"You just it'll definitely be in crayon. Okay. Thank you"
01:25:24,720;01:25:26,240;"I have a wife who's a preschool teacher"
01:25:26,240;01:25:28,640;"I'm sure she has plenty of things that I can use to put this together"
01:25:28,640;01:25:33,040;"Yeah, and you know it just throwing a couple of glue sticks that I can sniff and chew on is"
01:25:33,040;01:25:42,560;"I'll be in the mail tomorrow actually rubber cement now that I'm thinking of it. That was the shit that's melt"
01:25:42,560;01:25:48,760;"Yeah, rubber says and try it get you get you feeling freaky dry erase markers. Oh"
01:25:49,600;01:25:54,880;"Love that shit. Yeah, remember they actually made like markers that smelled like like strawberry and shit. Yeah"
01:25:54,880;01:26:00,200;"That was a fucking stupid idea. No, we should be having these kids through sniff markers"
01:26:00,200;01:26:09,040;"So I mean so the browns make it yeah, yeah, and what is what is our buddy Kelly Holcomb do"
01:26:09,040;01:26:14,200;"But throw for four hundred twenty nine yards and three touchdowns in the snow in Pittsburgh"
01:26:14,200;01:26:17,860;"God damn and they lost"
01:26:17,860;01:26:25,420;"Yeah. 36 and 33. But Kelly Oke, this is the best game of his career. So I thought it"
01:26:25,420;01:26:30,540;"appropriate to wear my Kelly Holcomb jersey as you probably should because you won't get"
01:26:30,540;01:26:37,700;"another chance in a long time, I don't think. In memorandum. So if you were to buy a Brown's"
01:26:37,700;01:26:47,260;"Jersey right now. Who would it be? Well, bonk guy. Oh, yeah, Garrett. Yeah. And so I,"
01:26:47,260;01:26:52,620;"we should go as a bunch of good players. Denzel Ward. He's sick. Yeah, yeah. Let's"
01:26:52,620;01:26:59,060;"go. I want to go back to my scary because we put up a poll on Twitter after the last"
01:26:59,060;01:27:07,340;"episode asking, which was worse was the Albert Haynesworth stomping on some dude's face worse"
01:27:07,340;01:27:10,500;"or Miles Garrett bonking some dude on the head with his own helmet."
01:27:10,500;01:27:16,060;"And I was adamant that it was a 350 pound"
01:27:16,060;01:27:21,340;"runstopper stomping on your head multiple times with cleats on."
01:27:21,340;01:27:26,940;"But Twitter disagreed and it was unanimous that it was Miles Garrett."
01:27:26,940;01:27:28,660;"That's pretty much a bias."
01:27:28,660;01:27:31,820;"It's got, I linked both videos too."
01:27:31,820;01:27:36,180;"Like offensive lineman got stomped on the face."
01:27:36,220;01:27:39,400;"I have a bone to pick with our listeners who are on Twitter."
01:27:39,400;01:27:41,380;"Yeah, it's just they are incorrect."
01:27:41,380;01:27:42,560;"Yeah."
01:27:42,560;01:27:47,160;"Well, get a concussion or nothing and finish the game."
01:27:47,160;01:27:47,980;"Yeah."
01:27:47,980;01:27:50,900;"And was it, was it duck Hodges or was the other guy?"
01:27:50,900;01:27:51,580;"No, it's the other guy."
01:27:51,580;01:27:55,420;"Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, Mr."
01:27:55,420;01:27:56,160;"Duxworth."
01:27:56,160;01:27:56,800;"Yeah."
01:27:56,800;01:27:57,800;"So I mean, come on."
01:27:57,800;01:28:04,320;"So look at that wild card weekend and there was another crazy game in there."
01:28:05,680;01:28:12,940;"I'm afraid of giants and they came down from 38 14 with four minutes left in the third quarter to win 39 38"
01:28:12,940;01:28:21,420;"Yeah, this is the week that Mike Mike Vick went into to Lambo and fucking mushroom stamped"
01:28:21,420;01:28:24,500;"Yeah, the Packers he did"
01:28:24,500;01:28:29,140;"Yeah, that was his that was his coming out party. It sure was"
01:28:29,140;01:28:32,740;"What was the Super Bowl this year?"
01:28:32,740;01:28:35,100;"2002 oh, that's right. It was a"
01:28:35,100;01:28:36,100;"Yeah."
01:28:36,100;01:28:37,100;"Groodenball."
01:28:37,100;01:28:38,100;"Yes."
01:28:38,100;01:28:41,100;"Whoops."
01:28:41,100;01:28:43,100;"With that offensive lineman who I'm missing."
01:28:43,100;01:28:45,100;"That's right."
01:28:45,100;01:28:46,100;"Yikes."
01:28:46,100;01:28:48,100;"Tough luck."
01:28:48,100;01:28:51,100;"Do you want your best and worst for this game?"
01:28:51,100;01:28:59,100;"Well, I mean, let's just make this point clear that the browns had a better season than the Patriots."
01:28:59,100;01:29:04,100;"I mean, I think that needs to be on record here, like explicitly said."
01:29:04,100;01:29:10,980;"Yes with Kelly vocal leading the way yes browns had a more successful season than the Patriots they did"
01:29:10,980;01:29:14,220;"the Browns"
01:29:14,220;01:29:19,060;"Yeah, our brown Cleveland Browns. Yes, we are the Browns. Yeah"
01:29:19,060;01:29:26,340;"What a fucking dumb stick to more successful seats and then the season of the podcast"
01:29:26,340;01:29:29,860;"No, this podcast is much more successful"
01:29:29,860;01:29:33,380;"Then anything the Cleveland Browns have done in the past 20 years"
01:29:33,380;01:29:41,480;"I like how confident you are in that take Andy. I mean, we've actually probably had more"
01:29:41,480;01:29:45,500;"downloads than they had ticket sales, right? He said 400 and something."
01:29:45,500;01:29:56,220;"No, good fans. I don't know. Nobody's going to watch those games. They want to give it"
01:29:56,220;01:30:00,280;"to you while I got on the top of my head here. You gave me some advice. You got to watch"
01:30:00,280;01:30:03,000;"a game you know that you're gonna take a little minds it's not about the game so"
01:30:03,000;01:30:10,640;"I'm gonna be like shocking I mean my best is Kelly Holcomb obviously I mean I'm"
01:30:10,640;01:30:18,600;"wearing his jersey and then my worst was the chat pettingson no I'm being"
01:30:18,600;01:30:24,560;"Manning okay yeah he goes to the playoffs and just gets stomped by the Jets"
01:30:24,560;01:30:30,320;"41 to nothing. Oh, yeah. 14 of 31 for 137 yards and two pegs."
01:30:30,320;01:30:31,840;"That could have been us."
01:30:31,840;01:30:34,520;"If I'm three pegs to tie."
01:30:34,520;01:30:36,520;"He's overrated."
01:30:36,520;01:30:38,120;"He's overrated."
01:30:38,120;01:30:40,000;"Choke, he's choke artist in the playoffs."
01:30:40,000;01:30:42,240;"That was my favorite narrative."
01:30:42,240;01:30:44,320;"Oh, yeah. Last of so long, too."
01:30:44,320;01:30:44,880;"It did."
01:30:44,880;01:30:47,200;"He hit the hands of the AFC East, apparently."
01:30:47,200;01:30:47,920;"Yeah."
01:30:47,920;01:30:49,160;"It was not the Jets as the Patriots."
01:30:49,160;01:30:51,240;"Next to you. Beautiful."
01:30:51,240;01:30:52,640;"You'll love to see it."
01:30:52,640;01:30:57,960;"Well, Steve doesn't do you hate manning as much as the Jets, Steve?"
01:30:57,960;01:31:00,680;"Because I'm more of a manning hater than a Jets hater."
01:31:00,680;01:31:04,200;"No, I had the Jets claim more than hate paid men, but I hate paid men a lot."
01:31:04,200;01:31:08,920;"I also hate paid manning after football, which everyone else seems to really."
01:31:08,920;01:31:10,000;"And I like them."
01:31:10,000;01:31:11,000;"I like them now."
01:31:11,000;01:31:13,760;"I didn't like them when he was playing, but he's grown him up."
01:31:13,760;01:31:14,080;"Yeah."
01:31:14,080;01:31:17,120;"I'll always hate him, just like I'll hate everyone from the Jets."
01:31:17,120;01:31:19,920;"But see, I always secretly like his commercials, too."
01:31:19,920;01:31:21,600;"Like the cut that meat commercial."
01:31:21,600;01:31:26,120;"I mean, I never just liked him as a person."
01:31:26,120;01:31:28,120;"Yeah, he could laugh at himself, which I thought was pretty cool."
01:31:28,120;01:31:29,120;"Yeah."
01:31:29,120;01:31:32,960;"I mean, as a player, I hate LeBron, but I won't."
01:31:32,960;01:31:37,040;"I'll continue to hate LeBron after the fact because LeBron is just a phony."
01:31:37,040;01:31:43,240;"Like off the court is a fake ass bitch, you know, who is the NFL version of that?"
01:31:43,240;01:31:44,240;"Manny."
01:31:44,240;01:31:50,280;"No, Manny was self aware enough to know that like, you know, who he was."
01:31:50,280;01:31:52,120;"It's a good question."
01:31:52,120;01:31:53,840;"Who is the belty?"
01:31:53,840;01:31:58,440;"But the thing is LeBron is saying he's a transcendent that he doesn't need to be like"
01:31:58,440;01:31:59,440;"that."
01:31:59,440;01:32:00,440;"True."
01:32:00,440;01:32:03,720;"He's like, he wants people to like him."
01:32:03,720;01:32:09,520;"Like the thing with the book, that's the one that got me the most mad."
01:32:09,520;01:32:15,760;"He keeps pretending to read books, like walking into the locker room and shit, or like after"
01:32:15,760;01:32:20,120;"practice sitting on the sidelines, like no one, the only reason he's doing that, he's"
01:32:20,120;01:32:25,000;"fake reading a book so you'll think he's smart so you'll like a more that is just so like"
01:32:25,000;01:32:28,760;"so thin skinned and like just"
01:32:28,760;01:32:32,280;"un-genuine that like that drives me crazy"
01:32:32,280;01:32:37,640;"he's a bitch he's a beta he's a cock"
01:32:37,640;01:32:41,560;"he's a soy boy"
01:32:46,040;01:32:48,920;"I just listed all the millennial terms I could think of."
01:32:48,920;01:32:52,280;"I mean, this is kind of rich coming from someone who can't even read."
01:32:52,280;01:32:53,280;"I know."
01:32:53,280;01:32:56,440;"I've read 16 books this year."
01:32:56,440;01:32:59,080;"You just ask the eight fucking picture books."
01:32:59,080;01:33:03,840;"I don't like where's Waldo Counts' reading books."
01:33:03,840;01:33:06,840;"When do you get how long it takes?"
01:33:06,840;01:33:11,960;"I'd rather be thought of fool and then be like, this is the whole setting expectations"
01:33:11,960;01:33:15,440;"thing that people are like, oh, he's actually like that dumb, then to be like, oh, I'm"
01:33:15,440;01:33:20,240;"this like fucking eloquent, like reader thoughtful guy. And then you ask him about it. And he's"
01:33:20,240;01:33:23,120;"like, well, I get past the first chapter."
01:33:23,120;01:33:27,920;"What's the quote? It's better be thought of fooled and to open your mouth and remove"
01:33:27,920;01:33:29,560;"all doubt. Yeah."
01:33:29,560;01:33:30,560;"Yeah."
01:33:30,560;01:33:31,480;"Yeah."
01:33:31,480;01:33:39,320;"Which as a podcast, I think we've we've removed all doubt. Yeah, we've done a bad job at"
01:33:39,320;01:33:40,320;"that."
01:33:40,320;01:33:42,440;"I mean, that's kind of the nature of a podcast."
01:33:42,440;01:33:46,160;"I have two bests and two worsts."
01:33:46,160;01:33:48,680;"Oh, OK, let's hear them."
01:33:48,680;01:33:53,360;"Uh, players I always did like Jason Taylor loved him."
01:33:53,360;01:33:56,160;"I was a super classic guy."
01:33:56,160;01:33:57,600;"I could never like him."
01:33:57,600;01:33:58,040;"I don't know."
01:33:58,040;01:34:00,480;"He always seems to trash talk Brady all the time."
01:34:00,480;01:34:01,960;"So that always got to me."
01:34:01,960;01:34:04,400;"They showed a replay where he sacked Brady or he like hit him at"
01:34:04,400;01:34:06,320;"right as he threw it and he definitely could have body weighted him."
01:34:06,320;01:34:09,520;"You know, you could have just like put his whole body into Brady and just"
01:34:09,880;01:34:11,260;"in my head on the ground."
01:34:11,260;01:34:17,240;"But when Brady threw the interception, uh, Jason Taylor came up to him and grabbed his"
01:34:17,240;01:34:20,760;"head and kind of gave it a wiggle, which that's cool."
01:34:20,760;01:34:23,640;"That's not like Brady didn't."
01:34:23,640;01:34:24,640;"Yeah."
01:34:24,640;01:34:27,080;"Well, I mean, that's a damn tick."
01:34:27,080;01:34:28,080;"Yeah."
01:34:28,080;01:34:29,080;"I mean, it was tipped."
01:34:29,080;01:34:31,080;"Well, he never did anything."
01:34:31,080;01:34:33,560;"I agree with Steve here."
01:34:33,560;01:34:36,640;"Like it's he's not playing dirty."
01:34:36,640;01:34:39,800;"He's just like, I am defending my quarterback, but defending my core."
01:34:39,800;01:34:41,900;"He's not your quarterback and never even met the guy."
01:34:41,900;01:34:43,500;"He's my quarterback."
01:34:43,500;01:34:44,500;"This is my podcast."
01:34:44,500;01:34:45,500;"My quarterback."
01:34:45,500;01:34:46,500;"That is my quarterback."
01:34:46,500;01:34:48,000;"It's a controversial beast."
01:34:48,000;01:34:51,700;"That's my other."
01:34:51,700;01:34:55,760;"My other best is the Troy Brown touchdown, of course."
01:34:55,760;01:34:59,260;"But if you notice, he doesn't even spike the ball."
01:34:59,260;01:35:02,260;"He immediately grabs it, runs to the ref and he's already caught up at two point conversion,"
01:35:02,260;01:35:03,260;"holding up two fingers."
01:35:03,260;01:35:04,260;"Of course he is."
01:35:04,260;01:35:06,060;"He doesn't even bother celebrating."
01:35:06,060;01:35:07,980;"He goes right to what's the next play."
01:35:07,980;01:35:08,980;"Let's go."
01:35:08,980;01:35:15,340;"to be done. Yep. I didn't know he wasn't saying, Oh, yeah, that was my second touchdown."
01:35:15,340;01:35:20,200;"Because I wasn't who's. Yeah, maybe he was confused with a different"
01:35:20,200;01:35:25,740;"guy. Browned. Troy Brown is perfect in every way. Yeah, I've never met the guy"
01:35:25,740;01:35:35,140;"either by no and yeah, yeah, I think it's fair to say he is. He is what he looks"
01:35:35,140;01:35:39,380;"like, yeah. And then the worst was, I don't know if you noticed"
01:35:39,380;01:35:41,860;"either. And you like, I'll check had his hands on his head like"
01:35:41,860;01:35:45,060;"he was tired the whole game. You look super nervous the whole"
01:35:45,060;01:35:50,860;"time. He did. Yeah. He looked very unbell check in. Yeah. Although"
01:35:50,860;01:35:54,060;"they were talking, they talked a bit about like what the locker"
01:35:54,060;01:35:58,940;"room was like. And they were saying that at halftime, you"
01:35:58,940;01:36:02,740;"know, they they throw it down to the guy in the field. German"
01:36:02,740;01:36:09,220;"guy. Nope. They were saying that the team was very quiet in the locker room at half"
01:36:09,220;01:36:13,540;"time and they were asking if it was a quiet resolve or something else. Turns out it was"
01:36:13,540;01:36:21,540;"a quiet resolve. But they were also talking about how Belichick the entire season had"
01:36:21,540;01:36:26,740;"not brought up the previous year Super Bowl like not once. Except for I think it was either"
01:36:26,740;01:36:31,260;"before this game or before. It must have been before this game. Like the week before he"
01:36:31,260;01:36:34,980;"He brought the trophy in, put it down on the table during a team meeting."
01:36:34,980;01:36:37,620;"And basically said, like, this is what we're playing for."
01:36:37,620;01:36:38,580;"And then walked out of the room."
01:36:38,580;01:36:42,060;"Fucking typical ballot check."
01:36:42,060;01:36:43,340;"Great."
01:36:43,340;01:36:44,300;"This coach ever right Greg?"
01:36:44,300;01:36:45,060;"Mm."
01:36:45,060;01:36:46,940;"I don't know if that would motivate me."
01:36:46,940;01:36:50,500;"It's like, uh, yeah, no shit, coach."
01:36:50,500;01:36:54,540;"I just got another word and you ain't ever seen it before."
01:36:54,540;01:36:56,460;"Cause you were not a 2001 team."
01:36:56,460;01:36:57,900;"I just had another word."
01:36:57,900;01:36:58,700;"So this Greg."
01:36:58,700;01:37:00,700;"I"
01:37:00,700;01:37:06,980;"Will get to the season best and worse in a second. Let me do my best on worse"
01:37:06,980;01:37:11,140;"There is more glovegate in overtime no less"
01:37:11,140;01:37:18,660;"Was he rod dogging it today or was he no"
01:37:18,660;01:37:23,300;"I think you were the gloves all season and said it like didn't affect anything"
01:37:23,300;01:37:26,540;"You just decided to walk clearly did if they didn't make the playoffs"
01:37:27,100;01:37:30,880;"It didn't though. That's how it bring shoulder had something to do with that"
01:37:30,880;01:37:36,620;"That's why he ended up getting in that other chick pregnant was he's like, you know what no gloves here on"
01:37:36,620;01:37:39,820;"I don't care what anybody says"
01:37:39,820;01:37:48,460;"Goddamn this podcast has changed its tone since Greg showed up. I have to say"
01:37:48,460;01:37:54,860;"Well, yeah, I would be like on the radio the next day saying Tom Brady didn't wear claws"
01:37:54,860;01:38:00,980;"We'll be in the playoffs right now beating the shit out of Peyton Manning. Yeah. Oh my god. Yeah"
01:38:00,980;01:38:04,740;"Greg from Worcester, you're on I"
01:38:04,740;01:38:10,780;"Don't think go check that good. He shouldn't have brought out the Super Bowl trophy. That wouldn't motivate me"
01:38:10,780;01:38:14,380;"All right, I'll let you I'll shut up and let you go start. Thanks"
01:38:14,380;01:38:20,320;"Can we fight a bill Belichick and hire Dave Wandstak because he seems to have a better control of his team"
01:38:23,660;01:38:25,260;"What are you messing with Andy?"
01:38:25,260;01:38:28,520;"- Rojas Devi needs to get more playing time."
01:38:28,520;01:38:31,820;"- Oh, actually talking about Rojas Devi"
01:38:31,820;01:38:35,860;"and the German broadcast instead of showing commercials,"
01:38:35,860;01:38:37,660;"just showing random ass shit."
01:38:37,660;01:38:41,820;"They showed this recap of a Patriots Dolphins game from,"
01:38:41,820;01:38:44,780;"I don't know when, must be 2000 season maybe?"
01:38:44,780;01:38:48,020;"- I was gonna say either 2000 is like 99, yeah."
01:38:48,020;01:38:50,020;"Where it was kind of the same situation"
01:38:50,020;01:38:53,100;"where I think it was late in the season."
01:38:53,100;01:38:56,460;"And I think the Dolphins had, if they won, they were in the playoffs."
01:38:56,460;01:38:58,020;"So it probably was 2000."
01:38:58,020;01:39:06,340;"And something happened on the last play of the game where they decided to say it was all in German, but something."
01:39:06,340;01:39:13,380;"But basically it sounded like a half hour after the game was ended and they were like the dolphins were celebrating in the locker room."
01:39:13,380;01:39:19,500;"They brought everybody back out because the last play didn't count and gave the Patriots one last play, which was a hail."
01:39:19,500;01:39:22,240;"Mary that you want to guess who through the Hail Mary?"
01:39:22,240;01:39:24,640;"You're glad so."
01:39:24,640;01:39:25,680;"Don't know."
01:39:25,680;01:39:26,220;"No."
01:39:26,220;01:39:28,140;"You might go Bishop."
01:39:28,140;01:39:29,560;"Michael Bishop."
01:39:29,560;01:39:31,800;"Oh, I thought that was Rohan Davey."
01:39:31,800;01:39:33,200;"No, it was Michael Bishop."
01:39:33,200;01:39:34,240;"She's even better."
01:39:34,240;01:39:38,640;"So my Michael Bishop through a Hail Mary and it was an absolute"
01:39:38,640;01:39:40,040;"duck and Atlanta on the 20-yard line."
01:39:40,040;01:39:42,760;"So they came back out half hour later."
01:39:42,760;01:39:45,040;"They show guys and like their flip flops and stuff like just"
01:39:45,040;01:39:46,160;"didn't bother getting dressed."
01:39:46,160;01:39:48,320;"And they did that one last play."
01:39:48,320;01:39:49,520;"And that's what I'd end up being in there."
01:39:49,520;01:39:50,880;"I'm like, I can't believe we came."
01:39:50,880;01:39:52,600;"We went half an hour for that garbage."
01:39:52,600;01:39:53,760;"It was amazing."
01:39:53,760;01:39:54,160;"Yeah."
01:39:54,160;01:39:56,760;"Yeah, that is ridiculous."
01:39:56,760;01:39:57,520;"Ridiculous."
01:39:57,520;01:39:58,800;"Absolutely ridiculous."
01:39:58,800;01:40:01,520;"Um, so my best."
01:40:01,520;01:40:07,960;"Was, um, it was the same thing as the German highlight thing where they're"
01:40:07,960;01:40:11,600;"showing the two games of the dolphins before this one."
01:40:11,600;01:40:15,040;"They beat the Raiders in week 15, which is good for them."
01:40:15,040;01:40:16,000;"Because the Patriots couldn't do that."
01:40:16,640;01:40:19,040;"But then they went to Minnesota and lost the Vikings."
01:40:19,040;01:40:20,760;"And did you see how they lost the Vikings?"
01:40:20,760;01:40:28,120;"It was an end around to Randy Moss who beat the defender who came into the"
01:40:28,120;01:40:31,520;"backfield with a spin move and then threw a touchdown pass."
01:40:31,520;01:40:33,940;"It was fucking amazing."
01:40:33,940;01:40:36,680;"I will put that on the, uh, I'll put that in the show."
01:40:36,680;01:40:39,840;"And it's linked to the, the highlight cause I actually probably have it here"
01:40:39,840;01:40:40,120;"somewhere."
01:40:40,120;01:40:41,480;"Let me see if I can pull it up for you boys."
01:40:41,480;01:40:44,120;"Cause this was like a play in a half."
01:40:44,480;01:40:45,680;"I actually missed that little break."
01:40:45,680;01:40:47,080;"I was like in a drink or something."
01:40:47,080;01:40:49,520;"I just saw the last second field goal that they lost on too."
01:40:49,520;01:40:51,120;"And if I can suck this year, right?"
01:40:51,120;01:40:52,400;"We talked about them earlier."
01:40:52,400;01:40:57,000;"They, yeah, they were not good, but they, I think they were like top of the"
01:40:57,000;01:41:00,880;"league and offense, but also in turnovers and lowest, like Bond"
01:41:00,880;01:41:02,560;"League and defense of everything."
01:41:02,560;01:41:03,920;"But this is like here."
01:41:03,920;01:41:05,400;"Whoop."
01:41:05,400;01:41:08,160;"And then look at that throw."
01:41:08,160;01:41:08,960;"Wow."
01:41:08,960;01:41:10,440;"Absolute time."
01:41:10,440;01:41:11,760;"I found."
01:41:11,760;01:41:12,560;"Yeah."
01:41:12,800;01:41:14,120;"I had a space."
01:41:14,120;01:41:18,320;"It's a rainy moss, hucking touchdowns to beat the dolphins the week before this."
01:41:18,320;01:41:21,160;"Mike Tyson, sitting there."
01:41:21,160;01:41:23,120;"Yeah."
01:41:23,120;01:41:24,200;"We want it only."
01:41:24,200;01:41:26,840;"But so that was that was my best."
01:41:26,840;01:41:30,760;"My other I don't know if it's a best or worst."
01:41:30,760;01:41:34,000;"Ted Johnson got injured and the backup for him."
01:41:34,000;01:41:37,280;"I'm going to try attempt his name."
01:41:37,280;01:41:39,680;"Maga Lua to a telly"
01:41:39,680;01:41:44,320;"was playing middle linebacker for part of this game until Tijons came back."
01:41:44,320;01:41:46,120;"And I just thought that was an amazing name."
01:41:46,120;01:41:48,920;"Ooh, like a little mug of Lua to a telly."
01:41:48,920;01:41:54,080;"Yes, we and just has him as Ola to tell a"
01:41:54,080;01:41:57,120;"to you I T. E. L. E. Yeah."
01:41:57,120;01:42:00,280;"It just has him as Ola to tell a"
01:42:00,280;01:42:03,440;"Oh, oh, that's what. Yeah, that must be what they call them."
01:42:03,440;01:42:06,800;"Then I woke them up in pro football references."
01:42:06,800;01:42:11,560;"- That must be his anglicized name."
01:42:11,560;01:42:12,800;"- There was his full name perhaps."
01:42:12,800;01:42:13,640;"- Yeah."
01:42:13,640;01:42:15,800;"- And they just call him Oolik 'cause it's hard to do."
01:42:15,800;01:42:18,560;"Let's see."
01:42:18,560;01:42:24,600;"Another best was all of the fish puns that were--"
01:42:24,600;01:42:25,600;"- Fish puns."
01:42:25,600;01:42:27,120;"- That was showed up in the crowd."
01:42:27,120;01:42:30,800;"Yeah, there was a couple of squished the fish pictures"
01:42:30,800;01:42:32,480;"like signs of people holding up."
01:42:32,480;01:42:35,440;"And then they kept going back to this group of four ladies"
01:42:35,440;01:42:40,200;"with handmade shirts, page is logo, drawn as if Steve Brown had drawn them."
01:42:40,200;01:42:42,800;"And then it says gone fishing on."
01:42:42,800;01:42:45,360;"We're on the salmon."
01:42:45,360;01:42:46,240;"Yeah."
01:42:46,240;01:42:48,320;"So, so I don't know if you guys have any."
01:42:48,320;01:42:50,360;"Oh, it's up the top of the head."
01:42:50,360;01:42:53,600;"Not bad."
01:42:53,600;01:42:57,160;"We're on the salmon."
01:42:57,160;01:43:01,480;"I don't know if you guys have any favorite fish jokes, but now would"
01:43:01,480;01:43:02,360;"probably be the time to do it."
01:43:02,360;01:43:04,160;"No."
01:43:04,160;01:43:04,520;"Yeah."
01:43:05,040;01:43:06,040;"Keep this moving."
01:43:06,040;01:43:08,760;"My mind is what do you call a fish with no eyes?"
01:43:08,760;01:43:13,920;"So I get that D minus."
01:43:13,920;01:43:15,200;"So it's not good."
01:43:15,200;01:43:16,640;"Steve, did you?"
01:43:16,640;01:43:20,000;"Are you are you a little tired today?"
01:43:20,000;01:43:23,520;"No, you seem like impatient with us."
01:43:23,520;01:43:26,400;"It's just you."
01:43:26,400;01:43:27,760;"It's fine until you showed up."
01:43:27,760;01:43:30,560;"We're going along."
01:43:32,920;01:43:36,880;"Well, if let's talk about something we're here for you."
01:43:36,880;01:43:37,360;"Okay."
01:43:37,360;01:43:40,320;"I want to talk more about what we're doing in German."
01:43:40,320;01:43:43,120;"Can you like, could we talk a lot more about Germans and Germany?"
01:43:43,120;01:43:43,440;"Yeah, sure."
01:43:43,440;01:43:46,480;"So here's what the Germans wanted to be a really quick war."
01:43:46,480;01:43:49,880;"So they tried and they, but they had already had World War I."
01:43:49,880;01:43:52,440;"So they knew that they weren't going to be able to just like go right in because"
01:43:52,440;01:43:55,160;"the French border was, um,"
01:43:55,160;01:43:57,080;"fortified."
01:43:57,080;01:43:57,760;"Yeah."
01:43:57,760;01:44:00,720;"So what they tried to do is try to go up through Belgium and back around,"
01:44:00,720;01:44:05,760;"but Belgium unbeknownst to them had built these huge, like"
01:44:05,760;01:44:10,320;"fortresses into, into their hillside."
01:44:10,320;01:44:13,400;"And that got bogged down and then everything went ship from there."
01:44:13,400;01:44:14,440;"Yeah."
01:44:14,440;01:44:16,440;"And we can keep going if you'd like."
01:44:16,440;01:44:19,840;"I've listened to all of the, uh, did you see that guy?"
01:44:19,840;01:44:24,400;"Andy with who the bald dude that painted his head silver."
01:44:24,400;01:44:25,600;"Oh, yeah."
01:44:25,600;01:44:28,480;"Did an actual and great fucking past logo on his head."
01:44:28,480;01:44:29,880;"So look like he was wearing a helmet."
01:44:30,000;01:44:31,320;"He's a big old fat ball dude."
01:44:31,320;01:44:34,280;"Yeah, we just repeat the head like a helmet and the cost."
01:44:34,280;01:44:36,960;"He was like a he was like the Patriots fireman."
01:44:36,960;01:44:39,240;"Ed, I thought for a while like he was at every game."
01:44:39,240;01:44:43,800;"I've seen him in a bunch of games like sent like since after that."
01:44:43,800;01:44:47,160;"Uh, I guess my worst is probably."
01:44:47,160;01:44:50,080;"Just the stats in this game."
01:44:50,080;01:44:51,600;"The Patriots should not have won this."
01:44:51,600;01:44:56,040;"I have a screenshot of two minutes and 42 seconds left in the game."
01:44:56,040;01:44:59,840;"This is where the dolphins have the ball on their own four yard line and"
01:44:59,840;01:45:02,200;"decided to throw it three times."
01:45:02,200;01:45:04,640;"Here's the stats so far in the game."
01:45:04,640;01:45:08,640;"The dolphins have 241 rushing yards at this point"
01:45:08,640;01:45:12,240;"to the Patriots 91 and 350 total yards to the Patriots"
01:45:12,240;01:45:15,200;"280 and the Patriots have turned the ball over twice."
01:45:15,200;01:45:18,320;"And at this point, this is where the dolphins decided"
01:45:18,320;01:45:21,240;"to throw the ball three times out of their own end zone"
01:45:21,240;01:45:22,940;"with Jay Fiedler."
01:45:22,940;01:45:26,520;"Fiedler and the roof, who as we've decided had"
01:45:27,780;01:45:31,380;"171 more passing yards than Ricky Williams had rushing yards."
01:45:31,380;01:45:35,080;"So maybe wrong decision."
01:45:35,080;01:45:41,840;"Did you know that this, um, this Miami team was brought to you by McDonald's."
01:45:41,840;01:45:42,840;"Did you know that?"
01:45:42,840;01:45:43,840;"I did not."
01:45:43,840;01:45:44,600;"Why was that?"
01:45:44,600;01:45:49,480;"Uh, James McNite, Randy McMichael and Scott McGarron."
01:45:49,480;01:45:53,720;"She's like that."
01:45:53,720;01:45:55,600;"Give me a smile."
01:45:55,600;01:46:03,280;"Oh, he's trying. He's pulling out all the stuff. Oh, Greg, you missed my Travis Fort"
01:46:03,280;01:46:09,840;"minor joke. Steve's not like minor. I remember that. He made me play Fort"
01:46:09,840;01:46:16,240;"minor. Remember Fort minor, Steve? Isn't that now? Remember the Lincoln Park kind"
01:46:16,240;01:46:21,560;"of right? It was the guy. It was the rapper from Lincoln Park. Yes. I remember the one"
01:46:21,560;01:46:30,360;"song once Andy played it. Everybody does. Yeah. All right. So I think that wraps up this game and the season. Did you guys have any"
01:46:30,360;01:46:38,680;"best and worst for for this 2002 season or the podcast in general? Well, I didn't prepare anything Andy. Maybe if you had"
01:46:38,680;01:46:47,960;"said before we recorded that we were going to do this. So my worst like Steve said is Greg. Why? It's the last episode. What did you"
01:46:47,960;01:46:49,720;"expect for us to talk about."
01:46:49,720;01:46:52,700;"Okay. Well, then we've done a"
01:46:52,700;01:46:55,780;"statement of consideration when I do my best of words."
01:46:55,780;01:46:58,080;"Oh, you get to go first."
01:46:58,080;01:46:58,880;"Go ahead."
01:46:58,880;01:47:00,280;"You're going first."
01:47:00,280;01:47:01,160;"Oh, Greg, you go first."
01:47:01,160;01:47:01,760;"All right."
01:47:01,760;01:47:02,360;"All right."
01:47:02,360;01:47:03,880;"My worst is Andy."
01:47:03,880;01:47:05,600;"And my best is Steve."
01:47:05,600;01:47:07,960;"Come on, Stevie, baby."
01:47:07,960;01:47:09,160;"Hit me with the back."
01:47:09,160;01:47:12,560;"My best is myself in my worst."
01:47:12,560;01:47:16,840;"You can't have two words to start out."
01:47:16,840;01:47:17,840;"this works."
01:47:17,840;01:47:25,640;"My worst is some of these games that not going to stop the run and just get lost."
01:47:25,640;01:47:30,440;"I think my worst is your guys like pessimism about this season."
01:47:30,440;01:47:32,040;"I think this is a decent season."
01:47:32,040;01:47:33,760;"There's some good games."
01:47:33,760;01:47:37,880;"Chiefs game, Bears game, this game, those are all barn burners."
01:47:37,880;01:47:38,880;"And you know what?"
01:47:38,880;01:47:39,880;"You're spoiled."
01:47:39,880;01:47:45,640;"And it's your winning privilege is showing."
01:47:45,640;01:47:49,100;"Okay. Patriots privilege."
01:47:49,100;01:47:50,980;"Well, I like that."
01:47:50,980;01:47:53,600;"Oh, it's privilege."
01:47:53,600;01:47:55,340;"Yeah, that might be you have."
01:47:55,340;01:47:57,500;"That may have to be the name of our new podcast."
01:47:57,500;01:47:58,940;"Patriots privilege."
01:47:58,940;01:48:00,340;"I mean, it's true."
01:48:00,340;01:48:06,180;"It is just expect everything handed on a silver platter every year."
01:48:06,180;01:48:07,740;"Yeah."
01:48:07,740;01:48:10,540;"You're a wouldn't we don't even know what you got?"
01:48:10,540;01:48:14,700;"I mean, I think this season was better than I would ever have thought it would be"
01:48:14,700;01:48:16,900;"before we started it."
01:48:16,900;01:48:18,540;"But it was also super frustrating."
01:48:18,540;01:48:20,140;"I'm sure Bell check both the same way of them"
01:48:20,140;01:48:21,980;"not being able to stop the run at all."
01:48:21,980;01:48:22,820;"- Yeah."
01:48:22,820;01:48:23,660;"- We just fucked everything up."
01:48:23,660;01:48:24,500;"- The running, yeah."
01:48:24,500;01:48:27,100;"I mean, even this game, Ricky Williams of Buck 85."
01:48:27,100;01:48:28,180;"- Cool."
01:48:28,180;01:48:29,700;"That's what I'm saying."
01:48:29,700;01:48:30,900;"- Don't run through this."
01:48:30,900;01:48:33,180;"- How does it everybody else?"
01:48:33,180;01:48:34,660;"- I love Ricky."
01:48:34,660;01:48:35,500;"- Patience."
01:48:35,500;01:48:38,380;"- Well, I mean, that will come to fruition early next year,"
01:48:38,380;01:48:39,380;"won't it?"
01:48:39,380;01:48:40,740;"This whole"
01:48:42,380;01:48:44,100;"- I think it's gonna be a solid check versus the team"
01:48:44,100;01:48:46,340;"in the locker room, won't it?"
01:48:46,340;01:48:48,140;"- Not the place. - Spoiler alert."
01:48:48,140;01:48:49,780;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:48:49,780;01:48:50,620;"- I think it's gonna be a loyal point."
01:48:50,620;01:48:51,780;"- Tune in next time."
01:48:51,780;01:48:54,700;"- So yeah, I think what we're gonna do"
01:48:54,700;01:48:59,180;"is we're going to take a break from game recaps"
01:48:59,180;01:49:03,380;"for maybe a week or two and do some of the stuff"
01:49:03,380;01:49:04,220;"we've saved up."
01:49:04,220;01:49:09,220;"We have some other semi-related episodes."
01:49:09,660;01:49:14,020;"erotic erotic novel reviews oh we have to do that too"
01:49:14,020;01:49:16,940;"We have a"
01:49:16,940;01:49:19,680;"Novel that is like a fucking stupid show on him"
01:49:19,680;01:49:26,140;"I think we're talking about different things, but yeah the cam Newton book"
01:49:26,140;01:49:30,140;"So yeah, we'll have a fourth and loud review"
01:49:30,140;01:49:32,420;"We'll have"
01:49:32,420;01:49:37,340;"Greg's deep dive into oh these will not necessarily these Miami dolphins, but"
01:49:37,940;01:49:41,340;"You're Miami Dolphins and the Richie and Kogmedo"
01:49:41,340;01:49:47,540;"scandal bully ball that was that was a throwback one. Well actually have my con for that one"
01:49:47,540;01:49:53,380;"Yeah, that was a good episode"
01:49:53,380;01:50:01,800;"I think we I think we I think we went below the surface a little bit there and we kind of we got into why Andy's so mad"
01:50:01,800;01:50:04,300;"all the time"
01:50:04,300;01:50:13,220;"that the common day is this is a good thing. I think I'm out of the world. I mean, that's"
01:50:13,220;01:50:21,100;"how you see in the vow. No. Have you seen the vowel? Is it a HBO about the the next see him?"
01:50:21,100;01:50:24,660;"It's a documentary about the next theme cult. I've heard of that ship, but I've ever seen"
01:50:24,660;01:50:31,740;"it. Never heard of it. Oh, it's sweet. Well, what I'm getting at is we should brand ourselves."
01:50:31,740;01:50:34,740;"It makes some sort of weird sex thing, right?"
01:50:34,740;01:50:38,740;"Yeah, with my initials."
01:50:38,740;01:50:40,740;"We're just brothers."
01:50:40,740;01:50:44,740;"Why don't we just like brand browns on our brown eye?"
01:50:44,740;01:50:47,740;"Yeah, well, how big is your brown eye?"
01:50:47,740;01:50:49,740;"You can put the whole word on."
01:50:49,740;01:50:51,740;"How big is yours?"
01:50:51,740;01:50:53,740;"Yeah, not big enough."
01:50:53,740;01:50:56,740;"We're talking subconferences here."
01:50:56,740;01:50:57,740;"Yeah."
01:50:57,740;01:50:58,740;"Yeah."
01:50:58,740;01:50:59,740;"Yeah."
01:50:59,740;01:51:00,740;"Yeah."
01:51:00,740;01:51:02,540;"It's big and only getting bigger."
01:51:02,540;01:51:04,100;"Oh boy."
01:51:04,100;01:51:07,260;"Uh, browns on browns indeed."
01:51:07,260;01:51:09,260;"On browns."
01:51:09,260;01:51:11,860;"Look at the browns jersey today."
01:51:11,860;01:51:12,860;"Yup."
01:51:12,860;01:51:13,860;"Yup."
01:51:13,860;01:51:14,860;"Yup."
01:51:14,860;01:51:16,860;"Talking about your brown hole."
01:51:16,860;01:51:23,980;"Well, that feels like a fitting end to the 2002 season."
01:51:23,980;01:51:24,980;"That's I."
01:51:24,980;01:51:25,980;"Talking."
01:51:25,980;01:51:31,340;"talking about it buttholes because I don't care how what privilege I have that still feels like"
01:51:31,340;01:51:38,220;"it felt like a slog going through some of these games so oh that's because you watched me"
01:51:38,220;01:51:45,020;"here's a little pro tip just don't watch the games they lose"
01:51:45,020;01:51:53,260;"well fortunately that's not going to be an issue soon coming up here yeah slog results"
01:51:54,220;01:51:56,500;"Yeah, I'm pretty excited."
01:51:56,500;01:51:58,980;"These next two years are going to be a."
01:51:58,980;01:52:01,740;"Yeah, they're going to be a fun watch."
01:52:01,740;01:52:02,380;"They are."
01:52:02,380;01:52:04,340;"Yeah, let's make a prediction."
01:52:04,340;01:52:06,820;"Who do you think your favorite player is going to be in the next two years?"
01:52:06,820;01:52:12,340;"Just based on like, or maybe like an unsung hero that you mean outside of Troy Brown."
01:52:12,340;01:52:13,420;"That's what you're saying."
01:52:13,420;01:52:13,900;"Right."
01:52:13,900;01:52:15,340;"Like mine's obviously tie law."
01:52:15,340;01:52:17,060;"And I think that's going to be reinforced."
01:52:17,060;01:52:23,260;"But I was thinking that I'm really interested to watch Richard Seymour come into his own."
01:52:23,260;01:52:25,340;"because he was starting to say, well, this year."
01:52:25,340;01:52:26,180;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
01:52:26,180;01:52:29,140;"But he was like a perennial pro baller these next few years."
01:52:29,140;01:52:32,580;"And I want to see his dominance up close."
01:52:32,580;01:52:34,780;"I would say Rodney Harrison."
01:52:34,780;01:52:36,780;"This is probably going to be an interesting thing to watch too,"
01:52:36,780;01:52:40,220;"like you said, because he comes in for Loy and Maloy"
01:52:40,220;01:52:42,060;"and kind of take her out of the spot"
01:52:42,060;01:52:44,540;"and becomes kind of the heart of that defense"
01:52:44,540;01:52:47,180;"and setting that tone."
01:52:47,180;01:52:51,140;"But when does Vince Wilfork come into the picture?"
01:52:51,140;01:52:53,740;"And he goes a rookie in '04, yeah."
01:52:53,740;01:52:58,220;"All right, so I think he'll be interesting to watch too."
01:52:58,220;01:52:59,060;"Love his events."
01:52:59,060;01:53:00,860;"I think he's receiving the Indians."
01:53:00,860;01:53:02,220;"Ooh."
01:53:02,220;01:53:04,340;"Because I was always in the huge guy for him."
01:53:04,340;01:53:05,300;"Yeah, that's right."
01:53:05,300;01:53:05,820;"That's right."
01:53:05,820;01:53:09,140;"Or be on Brant even like if you decided to rookie receivers"
01:53:09,140;01:53:11,420;"because both of them got to go around."
01:53:11,420;01:53:12,460;"That's true too."
01:53:12,460;01:53:15,060;"That's a good point."
01:53:15,060;01:53:15,940;"Well, shit."
01:53:15,940;01:53:18,100;"Well, I guess you want to find out."
01:53:18,100;01:53:18,940;"That's right."
01:53:18,940;01:53:23,020;"next season on the page is dai-zi park that uh"
01:53:23,020;01:53:26,220;"done done done done done done done done"
01:53:26,220;01:53:29,260;"boom boom boom boom boom"
01:53:29,260;01:53:37,180;"i think i just mixed two songs that i think you did"
01:53:37,180;01:53:41,020;"i think those are kind of whisked a couple ended with the fucking swiping"
01:53:41,020;01:53:43,780;"- I was trying to hold on, so I was killing."
01:53:43,780;01:53:46,380;"- Well, we, yeah, we saw."
01:53:46,380;01:53:47,220;"God damn."
01:53:47,220;01:53:51,180;"And as always, if you've enjoyed this."
01:53:51,180;01:53:52,420;"- Yes, baby."
01:53:52,420;01:53:57,420;"- If you've enjoyed this season, this episode, any of it,"
01:53:57,420;01:54:00,780;"leave us, let us know, leave us a review,"
01:54:00,780;01:54:03,020;"ratethispodcast.com/patspot."
01:54:03,020;01:54:05,380;"And since nobody's doing that,"
01:54:05,380;01:54:07,940;"we might try and make it easier for next season."
01:54:07,940;01:54:09,860;"We'll find some ways of,"
01:54:09,860;01:54:12,460;"Are we going to do that?"
01:54:12,460;01:54:18,020;"We might have a phone number that you can text and/or leave us a voicemail at."
01:54:18,020;01:54:22,900;"We should just do what they do for the voter registration and just send like six things"
01:54:22,900;01:54:27,860;"in the mail every single day, even though I'm already fucking registered."
01:54:27,860;01:54:30,220;"God damn it dude."
01:54:30,220;01:54:31,220;"I got it."
01:54:31,220;01:54:32,220;"There's an election."
01:54:32,220;01:54:34,380;"You have to be a valid to every single person."
01:54:34,380;01:54:35,380;"Okay."
01:54:35,380;01:54:36,380;"Yeah."
01:54:36,380;01:54:37,380;"Sure."
01:54:37,380;01:54:38,380;"But just send it once for God's sake."
01:54:38,380;01:54:40,780;"No, we're going to send it multiple times to anybody that we can."
01:54:40,780;01:54:43,780;"So if your address is on the internet and you're listening to this,"
01:54:43,780;01:54:45,280;"expect to see some mail from us soon."
01:54:45,280;01:54:48,540;"And we'll accept your hand written."
01:54:48,540;01:54:53,460;"Oh, do you guys want to make predictions for the November election?"
01:54:53,460;01:54:55,940;"No."
01:54:55,940;01:55:04,620;"Jesus Christ, Greg."
01:55:06,820;01:55:09,040;"Can you have it like a wrecking ball, I believe the song is?"
01:55:09,040;01:55:10,960;"That's the scribes that episode."
01:55:10,960;01:55:13,240;"But times you guys start."
01:55:13,240;01:55:15,280;"7 15 ish."
01:55:15,280;01:55:16,680;"Okay."
01:55:16,680;01:55:18,000;"That's not too bad."
01:55:18,000;01:55:20,200;"Now we talked about the entire game."
01:55:20,200;01:55:25,880;"Uh, well, if you looked at the WhatsApp, you'll see that he his car broke down"
01:55:25,880;01:55:27,480;"on his way home."
01:55:27,480;01:55:30,280;"So he wasn't able to to get home in time for it."
01:55:30,280;01:55:32,520;"Or maybe even though he did."
01:55:34,320;01:55:41,440;"even though he stayed up to watch the game, taking notes on how shitty Victor Green was for nothing."
01:55:41,440;01:55:42,000;"Yeah."
01:55:42,000;01:55:44,080;"He could have had it and read in that spot."
01:55:44,080;01:55:45,360;"Victor Green was not good."
01:55:45,360;01:55:46,080;"Yeah."
01:55:46,080;01:55:46,880;"He was bad."
01:55:46,880;01:55:48,640;"Yeah."
01:55:48,640;01:55:50,160;"All right."
01:55:50,160;01:55:51,120;"Good."
01:55:51,120;01:55:54,480;"I'm going to start doing this every week and just show up halfway through."
01:55:54,480;01:55:59,040;"Well, the thing is like you can't just join anymore."
01:55:59,040;01:55:59,840;"I have to let you in."
01:55:59,840;01:56:01,360;"So we'll see how that goes."
01:56:01,360;01:56:02,160;"Oh, that's true."
01:56:02,160;01:56:02,960;"Oh, that's a good point."
01:56:03,520;01:56:07,200;"So without you, we'll just not let you in."
01:56:07,200;01:56:08,800;"Okay, that's fair."
01:56:08,800;01:56:12,080;"I fixed my golf swing, Steve."
01:56:12,080;01:56:13,200;"Oh, yeah."
01:56:13,200;01:56:13,960;"Uh huh."
01:56:13,960;01:56:14,800;"Cool."
01:56:14,800;01:56:18,480;"I don't have to aim like 60 yards left anymore."
01:56:18,480;01:56:23,040;"I mean, it's still pretty erratic, but at least now I can aim straight"
01:56:23,040;01:56:24,880;"and hit it straight sometimes."
01:56:24,880;01:56:27,200;"Very excited about that."
01:56:27,200;01:56:32,520;"No, you just wear that Kelly Holcomb jersey golfing because that makes sense."
01:56:32,880;01:56:34,880;"Didn't let you do that."
01:56:34,880;01:56:36,880;"He's accurate."
01:56:36,880;01:56:38,880;"You're just playing the wrong courses, dude."
01:56:38,880;01:56:42,880;"You want to when we play?"
01:56:42,880;01:56:46,880;"I don't know. I don't know if there's anything there Thanksgiving or whatever."
01:56:46,880;01:56:48,880;"Yeah, we should try and find that out."
01:56:48,880;01:56:52,880;"I've been team. I'm playing Columbus Day if you have that off."
01:56:52,880;01:56:55,880;"And Friday Saturday after that."
01:56:55,880;01:56:58,880;"When's Columbus Day?"
01:56:58,880;01:57:00,880;"Monday the 12th of October."
01:57:00,880;01:57:07,160;"October after next yeah. I don't know. That's probably my next time."
01:57:07,160;01:57:15,000;"Are you playing an tournament that day, Steve? Yep. I think I have it."
01:57:15,000;01:57:18,120;"We have this nice guest room."
01:57:18,120;01:57:24,120;"Yeah, it's coming nice. Look at that. It's very professional."
01:57:24,120;01:57:26,680;"Again, it looks like a real bedroom instead of a fucking this."
01:57:26,960;01:57:28,300;"Remember was on this wall?"
01:57:28,300;01:57:31,480;"And see little tucked in back in there."
01:57:31,480;01:57:34,920;"Oh, Stevie's growing up."
01:57:34,920;01:57:38,640;"Here, no more giant cocks there now."
01:57:38,640;01:57:39,640;"Well, you're lying bad."
01:57:39,640;01:57:42,120;"Hey, fucking God."
01:57:42,120;01:57:46,720;"About damn time, not drawn ones anyway."
01:57:46,720;01:57:51,240;"All right, fellas, I will see you next week."
01:57:51,240;01:57:52,160;"Yeah."

01:57:52,600;01:57:56,640;"So play with your mic when you're on this, because it's like constant, like"
01:57:56,640;01:58:00,520;"Yeah, we can hear that. Okay."
01:58:00,520;01:58:04,480;"You're not gonna happen."
01:58:04,480;01:58:08,200;"I will. I'm sorry. I just have fidgety hands."
01:58:08,200;01:58:08,600;"That's all."
01:58:08,600;01:58:09,160;"I know you do."
01:58:09,160;01:58:09,840;"I know we do."

01:58:10,360;01:58:13,120;"Yeah, that's why I will try my best."
01:58:13,120;01:58:16,440;"All right, guys."

01:58:27,640;01:58:32,120;"So we've got a couple of weeks of leeway before we got to jump in in 2003."

01:58:34,200;01:58:36,960;"But we can do a special Thanksgiving episode."
01:58:36,960;01:58:41,520;"We can do a special Thanksgiving episode."
01:58:41,520;01:58:42,560;"Yeah."

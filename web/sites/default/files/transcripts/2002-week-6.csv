00:06,840;00:11,000;"you have the choice not to. My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:11,000;00:15,800;"to be funny, but really, they're just being stupid. You still want to listen? Go right"
00:15,800;00:18,000;"ahead. I am not your mother."
00:18,000;00:28,840;"Welcome back to the Turkish Dynasty Parkers. I'm your host Andrew Brown. With me today we"
00:28,840;00:30,320;"We have the Brown brothers."
00:30,320;00:31,440;"How are you doing boys?"
00:31,440;00:34,640;"- There's that docile tone I was looking for, nice."
00:34,640;00:36,320;"Oh, docile's already looking for,"
00:36,320;00:41,320;"'cause that means like calm and house trained basically."
00:41,320;00:44,000;"- Yeah, you're the most domesticated of the Browns."
00:44,000;00:46,160;"- Yeah, that's a good word for it."
00:46,160;00:49,600;"- Yeah, you're the left side of Greg's face right now."
00:49,600;00:53,120;"- And Greg is the right side of his face."
00:53,120;00:54,600;"- Yeah."
00:54,600;00:55,760;"- That feels about right."
00:56,840;01:03,560;"duality of human nature. Yes, so for those who can't see Greg, you're welcome that this is an audio"
01:03,560;01:09,240;"medium because he has only shaved half his face and the other half has grown wild"
01:09,240;01:15,800;"and it looks fucking hideous and how his wife has her left him I'm not quite sure maybe it's"
01:15,800;01:22,520;"because she's physically not able to be my guess. Harry like animal. How long did you go on the"
01:22,520;01:33,400;"the beer, Greg. April 5th. And it is now June 18th. So a"
01:33,400;01:34,400;"whole of two months."
01:34,400;01:36,020;"Yeah, looks that way."
01:36,020;01:39,200;"Yeah, it's pretty good. And the hair too. You did post a"
01:39,200;01:42,760;"picture in the family WhatsApp today. And I really appreciated"
01:42,760;01:47,120;"the the serial killer eyes that you put into it. Have you been"
01:47,120;01:47,840;"practicing that?"
01:47,840;01:49,320;"It comes naturally."
01:49,320;01:51,800;"Or is that just? Yeah, that's just how you take pictures."
01:51,800;01:53,680;"You're talking to me."
01:53,680;01:57,080;"No, I'm talking to the serial killer who shaved half his face."
01:57,080;01:57,400;"Yeah."
01:57,400;01:58,000;"I'll tell you."
01:58,000;01:59,240;"I'll pull it out."
01:59,240;02:01,360;"Oh boy."
02:01,360;02:02,760;"Give me a second here."
02:02,760;02:05,080;"All right."
02:05,080;02:05,720;"Continue."
02:05,720;02:11,240;"Where were we speaking of serial killers?"
02:11,240;02:14,320;"This is going on this."
02:14,320;02:18,680;"Patriots are hosting the Green Bay Packers."
02:18,680;02:19,200;"What?"
02:19,200;02:21,200;"We haven't even drafted Aaron Hernandez yet."
02:21,200;02:26,200;"Hosted led by the noted serial killer Brett Fabra."
02:26,200;02:29,480;"- Hey, what?"
02:29,480;02:31,600;"- Brett Favre killed the dude."
02:31,600;02:33,440;"- All right, I'm sure he's killed a lot of multiple dudes."
02:33,440;02:35,160;"Isn't that why you have to be a serial killer?"
02:35,160;02:37,680;"'Cause serial means more than one, isn't that right?"
02:37,680;02:42,440;"- Maybe, that's a good question."
02:42,440;02:43,280;"- We gotta have hot takes."
02:43,280;02:45,880;"We gotta keep up with sports stock radio."
02:45,880;02:47,640;"So, the hot takes."
02:47,640;02:50,800;"- So your hot take is Brett Favre has killed multiple people."
02:50,800;02:53,000;"Yes. Okay. What are you figuring out?"
02:53,000;02:56,000;"I'm going to work shopping. I feel like it works, but yeah."
02:56,000;02:57,400;"I wouldn't. Yeah. Okay."
02:57,400;03:00,320;"I think you're going to pick anybody on the game pack or team."
03:00,320;03:03,000;"Who would it be? You could have saved us the Ravens game, Andy."
03:03,000;03:05,280;"Come on. Have you seen?"
03:05,280;03:07,560;"Did you see the picture? Yes."
03:07,560;03:08,840;"Do you see the picture? What?"
03:08,840;03:09,840;"Yeah. Yes."
03:09,840;03:15,080;"Not firsthand. No, I've heard it describes."
03:15,080;03:18,880;"I looked it up as as research for this episode."
03:19,960;03:22,760;"Of course. You are dedicated to this podcast."
03:22,760;03:24,920;"What can you describe it to me, please?"
03:24,920;03:31,720;"Um, I mean, small, well, it's not small, small, but it's not big."
03:31,720;03:36,720;"He's circumcised. Okay."
03:36,720;03:41,720;"I think he was trying to chub it up because the picture he has it like in his hand."
03:41,720;03:45,400;"He's like, giving it the old, you know, squeeze job."
03:45,400;03:47,520;"The old five fingers. Yeah. Okay. Yeah."
03:49,360;03:54,000;"And I listened to the voice smells that he left on that fine young lady's"
03:54,000;03:58,000;"message machine. Oh, is it the same lady that Joe Thaisman hit on?"
03:58,000;04:02,200;"No, no, that was Susie Colber."
04:02,200;04:05,960;"Yeah, this is Jen Sturger or something like that. Yeah."
04:05,960;04:08,360;"That's a sideline reporter for the Jets."
04:08,360;04:10,720;"It was pretty sad."
04:10,720;04:12,880;"Actually, yeah, let's get right into it."
04:12,880;04:16,440;"Yeah. So, yeah, Greg, you're the deep dive guide."
04:16,440;04:18,640;"It was your deep dive on Brett Favre this week."
04:18,640;04:19,960;"Is that what you're telling us?"
04:19,960;04:20,860;"Yeah."
04:20,860;04:26,560;"I didn't just look at his his pictures just out of having a good time."
04:26,560;04:29,560;"Well, I mean, that's part of the process, right?"
04:29,560;04:31,720;"I leave no stone unturned."
04:31,720;04:33,320;"Greg, I'd already seen it."
04:33,320;04:35,920;"I leave no cock, I'm looked at."
04:35,920;04:40,320;"I believe that's a Brown family motto, isn't it?"
04:40,320;04:47,600;"I think this is this is the only time the Patriots play far or Brady plays"
04:47,600;04:52,940;"far on the Packers, right? You would think but no, huh. On the"
04:52,940;04:55,780;"Packers because I was going through the 2006 season today and"
04:55,780;04:59,900;"they play them again there. Okay. Well, first of all, I would"
04:59,900;05:05,140;"like to make an apology to Steve. Oh, Jesus. Okay. You can"
05:05,140;05:09,020;"believe that. You know what? Yeah, I don't hear it. Well, last"
05:09,020;05:12,860;"episode, Steve said that this was the season he started hating"
05:13,780;05:20,420;"Brett Favre because Brett Favre losing in week 17 was the reason the Patriots didn't make a playoffs"
05:20,420;05:25,220;"Yeah, and I said no, no, no, no, that's the year he played for the Jets, right?"
05:25,220;05:28,020;"It turns out it's both years"
05:28,020;05:29,860;"It really"
05:29,860;05:30,900;"Yeah"
05:30,900;05:38,900;"Yeah, both both the times that the Patriots missed the playoffs in this dynasty were because of Brett Favre losses in week 17"
05:38,900;05:40,980;"Really?"
05:40,980;05:46,900;"Mm-hmm. I knew I hated him for a reason. Oh my god. You're not wrong because this is a very formula"
05:46,900;05:50,540;"year for me where like I love and hate people"
05:50,540;05:57,180;"Spoiler alert we had David Gibbons first touchdown pass or catch in this game"
05:57,180;06:01,540;"Yeah, I was in the NFL ever"
06:01,540;06:08,180;"Yep, touchdown. I'll be no time, but that was not true. They said that the commentator said that"
06:08,180;06:14,100;"But he actually caught a pass before that. Oh, Steve Brown fact checking the fact checkers. Look at"
06:14,100;06:20,100;"Yeah, I was growing up in front of our well. I'm a huge David Gibbons guy as you remember. I used to have his jersey"
06:20,100;06:26,100;"Yeah, he's a student. You look like the only Jersey you ever had. Yeah, I loved David Gibbons. Wow"
06:26,100;06:32,020;"And again this season and the ones that followed and this is a formula of"
06:32,020;06:35,860;"Year for me. Yeah, I hate that far. I love David Gibbons"
06:37,220;06:40,900;"See for me, this was like the last season. I just don't remember any of it."
06:40,900;06:47,620;"And I was actually talking to Ryan's story who we had on the other week. And he was saying the"
06:47,620;06:53,540;"same thing. He said he missed more games this season than he did than he has for like the rest"
06:53,540;07:00,820;"of the Dynasty era combined. Because I invited him on for this one, just a stat check, just pulling"
07:00,820;07:08,020;"back the kimono and he said he couldn't go he couldn't join us and he remembers"
07:08,020;07:13,220;"only thing remembers about this game is that he didn't watch it because he had to go apple"
07:13,220;07:18,100;"picking and that made him angry so just me reminding him about it."
07:18,100;07:23,300;"Yeah okay. I'm gonna cock that's a cock move story if you're listening."
07:23,300;07:26,420;"Oh I don't think he is he doesn't know how to use"
07:28,020;07:33,540;"technology. Apple picking, that's like classic. I'm growing up move. Right."
07:33,540;07:35,700;"That's a fall Saturday activity."
07:35,700;07:39,140;"That's what I'm saying. Yeah. But if you're like growing up and like"
07:39,140;07:44,340;"getting in a relationship rather than like blacking out on weekends, you know,"
07:44,340;07:49,540;"it may have been that. Yeah. So when we have a month next, I'm hoping this losing"
07:49,540;07:53,220;"tree continues so we can have them on during another page. It's lost because that feels about"
07:53,220;07:56,940;"right. We'll ask him what his favorite apple orchard is. Yeah,"
07:56,940;08:03,780;"and who you like apple cider, David Kibbons or Granny Smith."
08:03,780;08:09,340;"Or who? Granny Smith, Granny Smith."
08:09,340;08:14,100;"I'm a red delicious guy. What do you guys?"
08:14,100;08:16,100;"A good question."
08:16,100;08:18,740;"The red delicious is terrible. It's too"
08:18,740;08:20,820;"- It's not a great apple."
08:20,820;08:23,980;"- Too mealy, you're just getting ones"
08:23,980;08:25,620;"that aren't in the perfectness."
08:25,620;08:26,460;"- Red, red, red."
08:26,460;08:28,540;"- Red delicious are just not good."
08:28,540;08:29,620;"- They're pretty soft."
08:29,620;08:31,180;"- I like them soft."
08:31,180;08:33,860;"- I like Macintosh."
08:33,860;08:36,380;"I like Granny Smith, you know?"
08:36,380;08:37,220;"- I don't need a lot of apps."
08:37,220;08:38,780;"- Get on my Honeycrisp level."
08:38,780;08:39,980;"Honeycrisp are good."
08:39,980;08:41,980;"Honeycrisp are the tits."
08:41,980;08:43,860;"Anything else is kind of a wrong answer,"
08:43,860;08:46,420;"unless you have some like one of those fancy like hybrid."
08:46,420;08:47,500;"- I'm gonna be truthful."
08:47,500;08:49,900;"Red delicious is the only one that I knew."
08:49,900;08:54,060;"So I said that I'm sure it's not my favorite."
08:54,060;09:00,020;"Yeah, no, I've done a bunch of apple picking in my life."
09:00,020;09:03,540;"But do you know, I think apples actually have more"
09:03,540;09:06,940;"DNA than humans do or something like that."
09:06,940;09:09,460;"Yeah, something crazy."
09:09,460;09:12,500;"I'll give you some DNA and he opened wide."
09:12,500;09:13,180;"You will."
09:15,620;09:22,840;"Speaking of Brett Favre, Greg, did you want to talk more about speaking of opening wide or just, I guess, not that wide."
09:22,840;09:24,380;"Go on, Greg, about his penis."
09:24,380;09:26,900;"Well, well, first, hang on."
09:26,900;09:31,740;"I want you to tell me about why he lost us, the playoffs this year."
09:31,740;09:33,220;"OK, yeah."
09:33,220;09:36,460;"So we were we were tied."
09:36,460;09:42,780;"Well, actually we yeah, we were tied with a record, but the Jets had the tiebreaker going into week 17."
09:43,900;09:47,200;"The Packers are 12 and three at the time going into that game."
09:47,200;09:50,200;"And we're like, oh, it's a pretty good chance."
09:50,200;09:54,160;"All the Patriots got to take care of business and the one o'clock and then the"
09:54,160;09:58,680;"four o'clock as long as the Packers beat the Jets, which they should have their"
09:58,680;09:59,320;"favorites."
09:59,320;09:59,840;"Right."
09:59,840;10:02,000;"And they just got their doors blown off."
10:02,000;10:04,120;"It was like 41 17 or something like that."
10:04,120;10:06,640;"Oh, was there anything at stake for the Packers?"
10:06,640;10:08,640;"Like were there any seating at stake for them?"
10:08,640;10:10,480;"Uh, I don't think so."
10:11,140;10:13,780;"I mean, they first in their division."
10:13,780;10:16,140;"So it might have been like, yeah, I did it."
10:16,140;10:22,440;"I did a quick read of like their Wikipedia and it touched on this, but not from a"
10:22,440;10:23,260;"page standpoint."
10:23,260;10:30,780;"And basically, Brett Favre was a favorite to win his fourth MVP award this year."
10:30,780;10:36,460;"But because the Packers lost so badly to the Jets in the season finale, they"
10:36,460;10:42,600;"think that may have swayed voters and far have lost the MVP award by two votes to Raiders"
10:42,600;10:46,140;"quarterback Rich Gannon and former Patriots draft pick Rich Gannon."
10:46,140;10:47,140;"Interesting."
10:47,140;10:48,140;"Yeah."
10:48,140;10:51,820;"But the 2008 one was worse."
10:51,820;10:54,540;"So that was the one where he was on the Jets."
10:54,540;10:57,980;"Yeah, that was definitely Matt Castle here."
10:57,980;11:01,980;"And then he went, he went, they were playing the dolphins in week 17."
11:01,980;11:02,980;"Sure."
11:02,980;11:04,340;"Chad Pennington, baby."
11:04,340;11:09,940;"Chad Pennington, who had been cut from the Jets to make room for Brett Fauff."
11:09,940;11:17,460;"Yeah. And then it was like 24/17. There's like four minutes left and the Jets are driving"
11:17,460;11:20,660;"and Fars obviously throws an interception."
11:20,660;11:22,180;"Sure."
11:22,180;11:25,620;"Jets lose. Patriots are out of the playoffs. Dolphins go through."
11:25,620;11:29,220;"That I remember. That's the one I remember too."
11:29,220;11:30,020;"I don't even know."
11:30,020;11:31,780;"Come on, Brett. Just do it once."
11:31,780;11:34,540;"And he just it was just such typical Brett farm."
11:34,540;11:35,580;"That was so mad at him."
11:35,580;11:39,700;"I just feel that I remember being bad having to root for Brett"
11:39,700;11:41,900;"farm and then him failing me anyway."
11:41,900;11:42,460;"Yeah."
11:42,460;11:43,460;"Fuck was the point of all this."
11:43,460;11:47,540;"Yeah, I feel I've just been blocking that out because it's such a like a."
11:47,540;11:49,740;"I hate Brett farm."
11:49,740;11:51,700;"I hate the jets, but I love paid."
11:51,700;11:56,060;"And if like the guy I hate and the team I hate when we get in and play"
11:56,060;11:59,340;"offs, but like I just must have been short circuited to my brain and just"
11:59,340;12:00,340;"totally forgot that shit."
12:01,460;12:04,100;"where your black out drunk is basically the same thing."
12:04,100;12:09,820;"Ooh, speaking of blacking out drunk, this game was 28 to 3 in the third quarter."
12:09,820;12:14,940;"Does that bring back non-members for you?"
12:14,940;12:17,860;"Not the Patriots again."
12:17,860;12:20,820;"This Packers game that we watched this week."
12:20,820;12:22,060;"Yeah."
12:22,060;12:25,180;"I was trying to score right."
12:25,180;12:27,060;"It was a final score of 28 10, I think."
12:27,060;12:27,980;"28 to 10."
12:27,980;12:28,420;"Yes."
12:28,420;12:28,780;"Yeah."
12:28,780;12:31,340;"I'm still lacking the third loss on the trot."
12:31,340;12:32,260;"Is that right?"
12:32,260;12:32,700;"Yeah."
12:32,700;12:33,340;"Oh, yeah."
12:33,340;12:34,740;"It's the longest season."
12:34,740;12:35,340;"Should be bad."
12:35,340;12:36,540;"All on a par."
12:36,540;12:38,580;"This is in New England, right?"
12:38,580;12:39,100;"Yeah."
12:39,100;12:39,580;"New England."
12:39,580;12:41,260;"And their new stadium."
12:41,260;12:46,180;"In their all blues, which I thought were sharp, fantastic."
12:46,180;12:47,860;"I don't know why they don't wear those more often."
12:47,860;12:48,380;"Yeah."
12:48,380;12:51,500;"The blue, the dark blue top and the dark blue pants together."
12:51,500;12:54,300;"Well, they're going to that this year permanently, right?"
12:54,300;12:55,460;"Yeah, because that was our color."
12:55,460;12:56,140;"That's crazy."
12:56,140;12:56,660;"Yeah."
12:56,660;12:58,420;"We want to talk about some notable players"
12:58,420;13:00,780;"from this Packers squad."
13:00,780;13:01,620;"- Yeah."
13:01,620;13:03,020;"- Yeah, one last thing I want to talk about,"
13:03,020;13:05,340;"Brett Favre is there was some karma"
13:05,340;13:07,300;"for him fucking over the Patriots."
13:07,300;13:13,700;"Basically the Packers made 12 and four,"
13:13,700;13:16,180;"but still went to the wild card"
13:16,180;13:18,440;"against Brett Favre's former team,"
13:18,440;13:20,740;"the Atlanta Falcons, the Atlanta field,"
13:20,740;13:23,180;"and the Packers lost."
13:23,180;13:25,100;"- Well, if they're playing the wild card,"
13:25,100;13:28,400;"there probably was something that staked in that game."
13:28,400;13:33,000;"Yeah, there must have been then either that or the, the, the whoever was in first"
13:33,000;13:35,680;"place and the division was two games ahead of them."
13:35,680;13:37,040;"No doubt it."
13:37,040;13:40,400;"They show the lions and the game breaks."
13:40,400;13:43,400;"Uh, what weren't the Vikings like 15 to one this year?"
13:43,400;13:46,760;"Wasn't this that year with Randy Moss and Donny Culpever?"
13:46,760;13:47,480;"Was that 2002?"
13:47,480;13:49,520;"This isn't the Michael Vick game."
13:49,520;13:51,560;"Is it the Michael Vick game?"
13:51,560;13:52,720;"Yeah."
13:52,720;13:52,720;"Yeah."
13:52,720;13:54,960;"We're going to Lambo and beat him in Lambo."
13:54,960;13:56,120;"I believe it was."
13:56,120;13:57,520;"It is."
13:58,000;14:02,620;"Yeah. The Packers had never lost a home playoff game at Lambo until the"
14:02,620;14:04,520;"first time came to town."
14:04,520;14:08,280;"I remember thinking, watching that game and being like, yo, Mike Vick is the"
14:08,280;14:14,960;"future. She kind of was to a certain degree until it should happen."
14:14,960;14:16,080;"Yeah. Yeah."
14:16,080;14:21,680;"But all right. Well, do you want to finish up on Brett far before we move to"
14:21,680;14:22,880;"this, the rest of this game?"
14:22,880;14:25,040;"Yeah, if you got more Brett far, let's just go."
14:25,040;14:26,200;"Oh, I got a lot."
14:26,480;14:34,080;"Well, give it to me. Like statistically, Brett Favre is just so interesting, like his stats over his career."
14:34,080;14:35,080;"That's true."
14:35,080;14:39,760;"Because this dude played 17 straight seasons where he started every game."
14:39,760;14:45,240;"That's which is just in its own right, like an incredible stat, right?"
14:45,240;14:46,280;"It's true."
14:46,280;14:47,480;"Right. Yeah."
14:47,480;14:55,600;"He put he has the longest streak ever of consecutive starts or something like 18 and a half seasons."
14:56,080;14:56,580;"Right."
14:56,580;15:01,080;"And just because he played so much in the way he played,"
15:01,080;15:06,080;"he has all sorts of records on both ends of the spectrum."
15:06,080;15:06,680;"Oh, yeah."
15:06,680;15:07,840;"They're all just like--"
15:07,840;15:10,360;"Yeah, he finishes career with the most touchdowns,"
15:10,360;15:14,200;"but also the most interceptions ever,"
15:14,200;15:16,880;"by a huge margin too."
15:16,880;15:17,880;"Why?"
15:17,880;15:20,720;"This is-- people talk about records"
15:20,720;15:22,480;"that will never be broken."
15:22,480;15:24,320;"This one's broken."
15:24,320;15:25,840;"You think so?"
15:25,840;15:28,840;"Okay, his all time interceptions."
15:28,840;15:31,320;"Yeah, he has 336."
15:31,320;15:35,520;"The guy in second George Blender has 277."
15:35,520;15:36,400;"Wow."
15:36,400;15:37,880;"Um, I have a question for you."
15:37,880;15:40,160;"How many is James Winston have?"
15:40,160;15:41,200;"Yeah."
15:41,200;15:44,240;"That's why I tell you you're the guy who's even close to catch it up."
15:44,240;15:45,200;"That's a 10 years."
15:45,200;15:47,840;"You have to, you have to play."
15:47,840;15:51,680;"You have to be good enough to throw that many interceptions, right?"
15:51,680;15:52,520;"Yeah."
15:52,520;15:53,520;"So that's a good point."
15:53,520;15:56,100;"Then you have to look bad enough to throw that many exceptions."
15:56,100;15:57,340;"So it's like a catch 22."
15:57,340;15:58,740;"That's why I'll never be broken."
15:58,740;16:02,100;"So I agree."
16:02,100;16:05,220;"But James Winston just went 30 and 30."
16:05,220;16:09,300;"Which I feel like is, is what you have to do."
16:09,300;16:11,340;"To be able to."
16:11,340;16:13,340;"Yeah, we got to do that for 10 years."
16:13,340;16:14,380;"And now he's a backup."
16:14,380;16:16,020;"Yeah, that's a great point."
16:16,020;16:17,140;"He's not even starting anywhere."
16:17,140;16:20,260;"Everyone's like, you see 30 interceptions ride the goddamn pine."
16:20,260;16:23,300;"So they're like, Hey, I, I,"
16:23,420;16:25,100;"I know you're just a gunslinger."
16:25,100;16:27,100;"You know, he does out there making plays."
16:27,100;16:28,100;"I get it."
16:28,100;16:29,660;"- He just got Lasik, so I mean,"
16:29,660;16:33,180;"maybe he'll throw less than 30 this year, you know?"
16:33,180;16:34,700;"- For real, but how many does James have"
16:34,700;16:35,540;"in how many seasons?"
16:35,540;16:40,020;"- He has 88 over two, over..."
16:40,020;16:41,860;"- It's like four or five seasons."
16:41,860;16:43,060;"- Yeah, he's never gonna make it."
16:43,060;16:44,340;"- Never, not that pace."
16:44,340;16:46,220;"- I mean, does he need 300s?"
16:46,220;16:47,580;"- Yeah, exactly."
16:47,580;16:49,660;"- Greg's right, that's an incredible record."
16:49,660;16:52,580;"Even they are passing more now."
16:52,580;16:55,100;"But I feel like the interception."
16:55,100;16:56,380;"But the throwing us in receptions."
16:56,380;16:57,540;"Yeah. Yeah. Exactly."
16:57,540;16:58,340;"Yeah."
16:58,340;17:00,340;"You want to hear some other notable names on this list?"
17:00,340;17:10,660;"Pete Manning is ninth with 251 Eli Manning, 12 with 244."
17:10,660;17:15,500;"All the way down at number 41 is Tom Brady."
17:17,700;17:21,900;"And he threw up a ton of interceptions this game and this season."
17:21,900;17:24,940;"He's been turning the ball over like crazy."
17:24,940;17:26,000;"It's true."
17:26,000;17:31,140;"But, um, and I only know it's because I was looking it up today, but how many,"
17:31,140;17:33,780;"what's the most interceptions in the season you think Tom Brady's ever"
17:33,780;17:39,340;"thrown probably this one, 13, 15, Jesus."
17:39,340;17:44,460;"You guys are, uh, big Brady fans apparently."
17:44,460;17:45,700;"What is it?"
17:46,180;17:47,780;"It's more than that."
17:47,780;17:49,580;"- 20?"
17:49,580;17:53,900;"- The most reception he has ever thrown in a season is 16."
17:53,900;17:58,980;"- 16, that's a perfect stat actually,"
17:58,980;18:00,860;"'cause I have this written down."
18:00,860;18:01,780;"This is funny."
18:01,780;18:08,340;"In those 17 seasons with 16 starts in each season,"
18:08,340;18:11,900;"11 of those, he averaged more than an interception a game."
18:11,900;18:13,500;"So 16 plus."
18:13,500;18:14,500;"(laughs)"
18:14,500;18:19,500;"He had 29 interceptions in 2005."
18:19,500;18:20,500;"Wow."
18:20,500;18:25,500;"In 1993, he made the Pro Bowl with 19 touchdowns and 24 picks."
18:25,500;18:29,500;"What the fuck did you make the Pro Bowl?"
18:29,500;18:30,500;"What?"
18:30,500;18:38,500;"He has the most ever pick sixes with 31 and he also has the most career fumbles with 166."
18:38,500;18:43,500;"He's just a turnover machine."
18:43,500;18:47,060;"His combined turnovers are like over 500."
18:47,060;18:47,900;"- Yep."
18:47,900;18:51,860;"He has almost exactly as many touchdowns as he did turnovers,"
18:51,860;18:52,700;"I think."
18:52,700;18:55,900;"He had like 508 touchdowns and like 502 turnovers."
18:55,900;18:58,300;"- That's insanity."
18:58,300;18:59,340;"- Yeah."
18:59,340;19:03,380;"So another interesting thing I looked into was like how"
19:03,380;19:06,300;"he was faring coming into this game."
19:06,300;19:10,020;"So I looked at his playoffs from the previous year."
19:10,020;19:11,020;"- Oh yeah."
19:11,020;19:14,580;"He threw seven interceptions in two games."
19:14,580;19:17,140;"Oh, good Lord."
19:17,140;19:19,380;"And the divisional against the Rams."
19:19,380;19:20,940;"He threw six picks."
19:20,940;19:24,700;"Whoa, the Rams deep wasn't that good either."
19:24,700;19:25,300;"Oh, that's right."
19:25,300;19:25,820;"Yeah."
19:25,820;19:26,020;"Yeah."
19:26,020;19:28,620;"The season before they were actually touched on that briefly."
19:28,620;19:33,740;"Oh, I'm telling you, yeah, the Rams defense was was so highly"
19:33,740;19:34,860;"rated coming into the Super Bowl."
19:34,860;19:35,100;"I see."
19:35,100;19:38,020;"Well, he didn't throw a single pick or from blitz against us in this game."
19:38,020;19:40,980;"me through three touchdowns on like 170 yards throwing."
19:40,980;19:41,620;"Yeah."
19:41,620;19:42,060;"Yeah."
19:42,060;19:45,060;"Both him and Brady had like almost exactly the same amount of"
19:45,060;19:49,820;"passing yards, but Brady had three picks and no touchdowns and far"
19:49,820;19:50,020;"back."
19:50,020;19:50,740;"Well, that's the thing."
19:50,740;19:54,340;"Far views to win, you know, like I want to say you only had like"
19:54,340;20:01,220;"one losing season, at least up to a certain point in Green Bay."
20:01,220;20:02,180;"That's a stat."
20:02,180;20:03,140;"It's not have."
20:03,500;20:04,540;"Well, he had one losing season."
20:04,540;20:06,540;"He was four and 12 in 2005."
20:06,540;20:08,100;"Yeah."
20:08,100;20:10,820;"So I mean, he was a successful, like winning quarterback."
20:10,820;20:14,740;"So only other losing season was with Minnesota in 2010."
20:14,740;20:15,580;"He was five and eight."
20:15,580;20:18,980;"And that was his last season, right?"
20:18,980;20:19,900;"I think so."
20:19,900;20:23,380;"It's first season of Minnesota was incredible."
20:23,380;20:25,100;"Yeah."
20:25,100;20:28,700;"And he was also like a tough son of a bitch, too."
20:28,700;20:29,980;"I'll give him that."
20:29,980;20:32,740;"I hate him, but you got to respect that starting streak."
20:32,740;20:34,240;"And he was a tough son of a bitch."
20:34,240;20:34,660;"Yeah."
20:34,660;20:39,340;"That game when he was on the jets that he lost to the dolphins, he was playing that"
20:39,340;20:41,960;"game with a torn biceps and his throwing arm."
20:41,960;20:43,620;"Whoa."
20:43,620;20:44,180;"Yeah."
20:44,180;20:44,620;"What?"
20:44,620;20:45,620;"Yes."
20:45,620;20:48,420;"How is that a thing?"
20:48,420;20:49,540;"I don't know."
20:49,540;20:50,300;"I don't know."
20:50,300;20:57,940;"I mean, to be fair, I actually, and I'll see if I can run to link this in the, um,"
20:59,080;21:05,040;"in the show notes, but when they came back from commercial one of these, there was a"
21:05,040;21:11,440;"video of some like trainer or something giving Brett Favre something out of like a little"
21:11,440;21:14,000;"those little punch pads."
21:14,000;21:16,160;"That was definitely some sort of painkiller."
21:16,160;21:21,040;"Was this before he went to rehab for that?"
21:21,040;21:22,040;"Pretty sure it wasn't to rehab."
21:22,040;21:25,600;"Yeah, he got addicted to painkillers and went to rehab."
21:25,600;21:28,360;"And but they literally like they they were just showing him on the sawing thing"
21:28,360;21:31,360;"He just scored a touchdown something so they were coming back from commercial"
21:31,360;21:34,720;"I'm still like the VW commercial like thing over it"
21:34,720;21:37,920;"You know when they come back and they're showing like shots of the stadium stuff and they're showing"
21:37,920;21:41,840;"Some trainers something giving him some sort of pain killing"
21:41,840;21:50,240;"Okay, he goes to rehab addicted to painkillers and comes out addicted to real comfortable jeans"
21:52,960;21:55,220;"addicted never takes a pain away."
21:55,220;21:57,620;"I've been saying that all week."
21:57,620;22:02,200;"Oh, God, because you can change it, you know, you can do whatever you want."
22:02,200;22:07,240;"Yeah, like Steve Brown, real slappable face."
22:07,240;22:13,840;"I feel like you're just substituting my name for your wife."
22:13,840;22:17,240;"Yeah, I feel like I feel like Kelly's heard this before."
22:17,240;22:19,600;"Well, hers is slappable butt cheeks."
22:19,600;22:22,680;"But yeah, it does follow similar vein."
22:22,680;22:27,680;"Oh, good Lord."
22:27,680;22:29,680;"I love Brett Farve."
22:29,680;22:31,680;"He annoyed me."
22:31,680;22:33,680;"He's just a regular dude."
22:33,680;22:34,680;"I'm with you."
22:34,680;22:35,680;"I'm with Steve."
22:35,680;22:40,680;"There's something about him that just -- and I think -- I don't know exactly what it is,"
22:40,680;22:47,680;"but when I was watching this game, I had this similar feeling to watching whenever the pages would play Eli Manning."
22:47,680;22:54,100;"I just felt like he wasn't beating you because he's Brett fucking fireman like he's not I"
22:54,100;22:59,080;"Don't know there's something about him. He's just like he doesn't look like he's actually very good"
22:59,080;23:04,320;"But he's just getting lucky and the pages of beating themselves and like it just didn't feel"
23:04,320;23:08,620;"I don't know it did as a person as a person not a player"
23:08,620;23:14,120;"Well, I mean you've always had a soft spot for people to send dick pics. So I can understand why you"
23:16,480;23:21,320;"I'm just saying hanging out with Brett fire would probably awesome like as a teammate. I bet he's the best"
23:21,320;23:25,080;"He's just fucking around all the time. He doesn't take himself too seriously"
23:25,080;23:27,840;"He's just has a cannon for an arm"
23:27,840;23:34,820;"He's just out there having fun. You know back to our football. He is that's why that's a big part of why I hate Brett"
23:34,820;23:37,440;"far is how much of his"
23:37,440;23:40,400;"medium-sized dick all the commentators suck"
23:43,960;23:49,840;"He never does any wrong, you know, that's true actually I remember like thinking I just like them"
23:49,840;23:53,400;"And I'm pretty sure it's because of the whole like retirement will you retire?"
23:53,400;23:59,040;"Willy not oh yeah, and that was because like ESPN caught covered it ad nauseam"
23:59,040;24:02,720;"Yeah, I think I think Stephen you're touching on"
24:02,720;24:05,680;"on kind of what I'm feeling is I"
24:05,680;24:08,280;"feel like he"
24:08,680;24:13,480;"Just kind of like didn't play football almost correctly. I don't think that's the right word"
24:13,480;24:16,640;"But it's the closest I can figure right now play correctly"
24:16,640;24:23,040;"No, but it's just like everything he did was bad form like he's he's back every every completion"
24:23,040;24:25,980;"He may he was back pedaling away from something just like hocking it up"
24:25,980;24:29,320;"Decimal coverage and it just fucking works for some reason"
24:29,320;24:34,760;"That's how I always felt that that Eli Manning was it's just like first down he would"
24:35,360;24:40,640;"Almost or an exception second down he would sail at six yards over his attempted receiver and the third down"
24:40,640;24:46,060;"He would just hook up a Hail Mary and it would connect for some reason and then they keep doing it again and rinse and repeat"
24:46,060;24:48,060;"And that's all I know I feel"
24:48,060;24:54,920;"Elies in a whole different class for me. It was not only because because Eli sucks, right?"
24:54,920;24:59,620;"I mean even touchdowns interception. He's at 50/50 at least Brett far"
24:59,620;25:01,620;"I've got to add in the fun bowls to get to one-to-one"
25:04,820;25:11,140;"Brett Favre and like Peyton Manning are on a similar level to me. Like you know you kind of hate them. You know, they're good"
25:11,140;25:16,620;"Now I've come around manning's like legitimately good Brett Favre was like ah"
25:16,620;25:19,420;"Shucks good"
25:19,420;25:27,780;"So maybe Brett calm with the middle brother that the Manning's never had yeah, I mean imagine if you know I far was Cooper Manning Cooper"
25:27,780;25:29,780;"That's the thing"
25:29,780;25:31,780;"Isn't he the younger brother?"
25:31,780;25:36,180;"I don't actually I don't care. It's the we're talking about the Manning's here. This is a page wait till"
25:36,180;25:41,760;"Peyton's son gets here. Oh God apparently he's like the"
25:41,760;25:47,420;"Quarterback in like middle school. I didn't even name him Archie as well"
25:47,420;25:50,920;"Maybe that's gonna be right. That all right"
25:50,920;25:55,180;"That's enough about breath. This is not a breath our podcast is a page podcast"
25:55,180;25:58,820;"So let's let's talk about some other pack"
25:58,820;26:01,020;"- Yeah. - Speaking of pages."
26:01,020;26:05,620;"The Pro Bowl is on this team, Brett Favre, of course,"
26:05,620;26:07,020;"because he threw as many touchdowns"
26:07,020;26:08,700;"he did in interceptions this year."
26:08,700;26:10,300;"Stat check, is that right?"
26:10,300;26:14,460;"Do that out of the way, 2002?"
26:14,460;26:15,460;"Why is that not working?"
26:15,460;26:17,180;"- It comes stats guy, let's go."
26:17,180;26:18,940;"This is stats over storylines."
26:18,940;26:19,940;"(laughing)"
26:19,940;26:21,620;"- 27 touchdowns, 16 interceptions."
26:21,620;26:23,820;"So one of the few years he threw more"
26:23,820;26:24,860;"touchdowns in his interception."
26:24,860;26:27,700;"So he made the Pro Bowl, he made the Pro Bowl a 102-03."
26:27,700;26:28,740;"So this is kind of his peak."
26:28,740;26:32,900;"Uh, he also had a second 95, nine, six, nine, seven."
26:32,900;26:33,140;"Yeah."
26:33,140;26:33,560;"Yeah."
26:33,560;26:37,060;"And it's third peak with those seven, eight, oh nine, which also the, uh,"
26:37,060;26:39,660;"pro bowl with three different teams."
26:39,660;26:40,600;"Yeah."
26:40,600;26:42,540;"I mean, he's, he's had two different peaks."
26:42,540;26:44,260;"Like me, like Brady's had two careers."
26:44,260;26:45,820;"You could say, right far, same idea."
26:45,820;26:47,180;"I'm taking the three."
26:47,180;26:47,500;"Yeah."
26:47,500;26:48,860;"95, nine, six, nine, seven."
26:48,860;26:52,780;"You made the pro bowl was all pro and then 01, 02, 03 made the pro bowl."
26:52,780;26:54,260;"And then, oh, seven, oh, eight, oh nine."
26:54,260;26:58,300;"He made the Pro Bowl for the Packers, the Jets, and the Vikings."
26:58,300;26:59,780;"It's pretty impressive."
26:59,780;27:06,300;"It's also like a weird parallel between Brett Favre, Vener and Rogers and Tom Brady"
27:06,300;27:10,300;"and Jimmy G. And where they diverge where Pat's just traded away the young"
27:10,300;27:13,540;"quarterback and the pack made the switch."
27:13,540;27:14,660;"That's true."
27:14,660;27:19,620;"Because Brett Favre, he like he was not, he didn't leave and was washed up."
27:19,620;27:21,260;"He played well."
27:21,260;27:22,140;"It's true."
27:22,140;27:22,700;"He kept going."
27:22,780;27:25,820;"So maybe we'll see if that happens with Brady and."
27:25,820;27:28,320;"Instead of what this point is done, right?"
27:28,320;27:29,020;"They kicked away."
27:29,020;27:30,780;"Jimmy G and Jimmy G did pretty well."
27:30,780;27:35,260;"But I wonder what will happen if Aaron Rodgers had been traded away."
27:35,260;27:37,260;"For a second round pick."
27:37,260;27:39,740;"Well, it might have hardly stayed on the Packers."
27:39,740;27:41,820;"Now we have Jordan up, right?"
27:41,820;27:42,940;"Yeah, sure."
27:42,940;27:46,020;"Which is like the same situation as Rodgers and far."
27:46,020;27:48,060;"Yeah, that's different."
27:48,060;27:48,980;"For your repeats."
27:48,980;27:50,860;"Imagine being like a lion's fan, though."
27:50,860;27:52,460;"Oh."
27:52,460;28:00,060;"Whenever we get I have a real hardcore really good front lines and and I texted him because in this game"
28:00,060;28:02,060;"we were watching the head game breaks and"
28:02,060;28:07,340;"They must have they picked Joey Harrington the first round this year. I think"
28:07,340;28:11,260;"And they brought him in the week before and he had won and"
28:11,260;28:18,820;"Then like game break right in the first quarter like Joey Harrington throws touchdown lines around seven nothing and then another game break"
28:18,820;28:24,180;"like a couple of minutes to another. Yeah. Right at the very end. Not if you saw this"
28:24,180;28:29,940;"is like second last note. Besides when they're calling out the tech crew, you know it's a blowout."
28:29,940;28:35,860;"It cuts out as 24 24 and running the ball."
28:35,860;28:44,420;"I'm going to go from like right up there with the Browns. I'm like, oh man."
28:45,460;28:48,380;"our far dominated the lions."
28:48,380;28:52,580;"I'm pretty sure the lions never won in those 17 seasons at Lambo."
28:52,580;28:53,860;"I think it's something like that."
28:53,860;28:57,140;"And then they just go right to Brett Favre or Aaron Rodgers."
28:57,140;29:02,900;"And then remember the Hail Mary is just God."
29:02,900;29:03,580;"Yeah."
29:03,580;29:06,380;"That's what the bills are going to be this year."
29:06,380;29:08,060;"Yeah."
29:08,060;29:15,340;"So other pro bowlers on this this pack of steam running back on"
29:15,340;29:16,180;"I'm on green."
29:16,180;29:18,660;"I'm not even forgotten about, but do with a good runner."
29:18,660;29:20,680;"Also wide receiver, Donald Driver,"
29:20,680;29:23,720;"tight end Bubba Frank's, great name, Bubba Frank's."
29:23,720;29:25,860;"I feel like you should have his own hot dog company,"
29:25,860;29:28,800;"but the last one is not the case."
29:28,800;29:32,540;"Guard Marco Rivera and free safety, Darren Sharper."
29:32,540;29:35,260;"Oh, the hottest hit in safety in the league dude."
29:35,260;29:36,100;"- Exactly."
29:36,100;29:40,460;"In more ways than one we found out."
29:40,460;29:42,380;"- Oh, yeah."
29:42,380;29:43,460;"Careful."
29:43,460;29:47,420;"So I'd read the offensive and defensive stars, but you just heard them."
29:47,420;29:52,180;"They're all the guys that made the Pro Bowl except for defensive end."
29:52,180;29:54,140;"Anybody want to tackle this name?"
29:54,140;29:54,780;"Yep."
29:54,780;29:56,900;"Kabir Gabbah Biamila."
29:56,900;29:59,980;"Muhammad Kabir Ola-Rawajah."
29:59,980;30:01,620;"Kabah Biamala."
30:01,620;30:04,660;"I see John Chris Fumatou Mahfala."
30:04,660;30:07,820;"I love Babbah Biamala."
30:07,820;30:09,340;"I had his jersey."
30:10,180;30:11,020;"- What? - It?"
30:11,020;30:12,340;"- Just because of his name, yeah."
30:12,340;30:13,820;"- From that place in Lawrence"
30:13,820;30:15,140;"that we would go and get the jerseys."
30:15,140;30:17,220;"- Oh yeah. - Yeah."
30:17,220;30:18,580;"- He's a legend."
30:18,580;30:20,340;"- Yeah, he was a monster too."
30:20,340;30:23,180;"- You guys wanna guess what country he's from?"
30:23,180;30:24,260;"- No, Steve."
30:24,260;30:29,100;"- Not in this climate, I don't."
30:29,100;30:30,780;"- Ivory Coast."
30:30,780;30:32,420;"- United States, you dickhead."
30:32,420;30:34,680;"(laughing)"
30:34,680;30:37,660;"- He was born in LA."
30:37,660;30:39,020;"- That's a nice setup."
30:39,020;30:41,020;"Yeah, that's too good."
30:41,020;30:43,020;"Two parents of..."
30:43,020;30:45,020;"I don't know."
30:45,020;30:49,020;"The other player of note on this team,"
30:49,020;30:51,020;"I don't know if you noticed,"
30:51,020;30:55,020;"was backup quarterback Doug Peterson."
30:55,020;30:57,020;"Yes, I had written that down."
30:57,020;31:01,020;"Yes, that Doug Peterson, who was"
31:01,020;31:05,020;"a very mediocre quarterback in the NFL"
31:05,020;31:07,020;"and was the backup to Brett Favre this year,"
31:07,020;31:10,780;"field even once. What do you think of him as a coach Andy?"
31:10,780;31:17,020;"I think he's pretty good. Anybody who's anybody who's not scared of Bill Belichick,"
31:17,020;31:21,420;"I think you have to give props. And I think the way he coached that's your role. He showed"
31:21,420;31:26,780;"he wasn't. I think it would be the first time you've like complimented a coach other than Bill"
31:26,780;31:32,380;"Belichick. Give me another coach who I should have complimented Andy Reed. I love Andy Reed."
31:33,180;31:34,780;"I don't think we've ever talked about him now."
31:34,780;31:35,980;"Mike Tomlin."
31:35,980;31:37,580;"I don't like Mike Tomlin."
31:37,580;31:39,580;"I think he's overrated."
31:39,580;31:41,580;"I like Tomlin."
31:41,580;31:43,100;"And he's good at coach."
31:43,100;31:45,580;"I don't think he's as good as..."
31:45,580;31:46,580;"You know what?"
31:46,580;31:47,580;"Yeah, really good."
31:47,580;31:48,580;"He's fast-linking."
31:48,580;31:54,300;"On Tomlin, I think we talked about this with Steve, but his ability to keep the lid on"
31:54,300;31:57,020;"Antonio Brown for like three or four years."
31:57,020;31:58,260;"Yeah, that's fair."
31:58,260;32:02,660;"What a masterclass in coaching because as soon as he's gone, it's just like, ""Boom!"""
32:02,660;32:04,660;"You know"
32:04,660;32:09,980;"It wasn't overnight even Big Ben. He's like kind of a dick head - yeah, there's a lot of big"
32:09,980;32:15,620;"I mean, I bet juju Smith's sister is the same way. He seems crazy as well. No, he's lovely"
32:15,620;32:19,300;"My common wants you to believe"
32:19,300;32:31,660;"All right, so do we want to talk about this game yeah, actually well, this is usually we give well you skipped over one important player"
32:31,660;32:38,700;"there. Terry Glenn. Oh, right. Oh, all right. Yeah, I was going to bring him up later. That's"
32:38,700;32:46,540;"fine. Let's, uh, we can talk about Terry Glenn. Nouncers did all goddamn game. Yeah. And the, uh,"
32:46,540;32:52,700;"they weren't the only one to notice him. The crowd would boo him, um, voraciously every time his"
32:52,700;32:58,780;"name was announced over the day. Yes. But did you notice the booze for Glenn weren't as voracious"
32:58,780;33:03,820;"as the cheers for Troy Brown. Oh, God. Yeah. Yeah. Because this is Troy Brown's first game back"
33:03,820;33:10,300;"from injury since probably the losing season three started. Yeah, right. For sure. Because"
33:10,300;33:15,580;"the last time we saw he had an air still winning. Yeah, he had hurt in that. Remember, he had those"
33:15,580;33:21,260;"like the first three quarters, like 15 catches and was rushing everybody in the yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
33:21,260;33:25,660;"Yeah. Super frustrating for him to get hurt in that game. And he was back and everyone was"
33:25,660;33:30,940;"love in him. Yes. And but he wasn't like fully back. I don't think because he wasn't returning"
33:30,940;33:36,700;"punts. Yeah, I noticed that too. Who did okay, but he wasn't he wasn't a Troy Brown."
33:36,700;33:43,980;"No. Troy Brown might be the best punt return we ever had. I mean,"
33:43,980;33:49,900;"element is up there for a while. I think it went up there too. In terms of punting returning,"
33:49,900;33:55,980;"Dave mega was good in terms of being a decent human being. I'd probably give that to Troy Brown."
33:55,980;34:00,860;"Troy Brown's an absolute sternum sample of humanity."
34:00,860;34:05,980;"Yeah. And also, Dave mega said that bar real fucking law."
34:05,980;34:13,020;"Don't be here. I was right, Greg. Yeah. Pretty sure it's a blog about that somewhere."
34:13,020;34:15,860;"Oh, dude, it's horrific."
34:15,860;34:17,140;"Shit, he did."
34:17,140;34:20,940;"Yeah, he was not a great dude."
34:20,940;34:24,260;"Who's actually who's who's a better person?"
34:24,260;34:25,940;"This here's a set of for failure."
34:25,940;34:28,020;"Darren Sharper, Dave Megget."
34:28,020;34:31,020;"Oh, boy."
34:31,020;34:33,420;"Was Darren Sharper in jail?"
34:33,420;34:34,100;"Yes."
34:34,100;34:36,620;"Then I'd say Dave Megak, because he isn't."
34:36,620;34:37,940;"I don't know."
34:37,940;34:39,820;"Wait, Dave Megget's not in jail?"
34:39,820;34:41,780;"I didn't think so."
34:41,780;34:45,580;"He asked me. You tell me, Stachek. All right, I'm a"
34:45,580;34:48,620;"Stachek that if he's out of jail, I'm starting to fucking change"
34:48,620;34:52,620;"dot org. Well, he does that, Steve, you want to talk about"
34:52,620;34:58,020;"this game a little bit? I guess this was, I think the game"
34:58,020;35:02,380;"was, it's one of those games that happens every once in a while"
35:02,380;35:07,540;"these days, but yeah, it's been happening the last three games"
35:07,540;35:10,920;"here where the page is a very uncharacteristically."
35:10,920;35:15,740;"Sloppy, turning the ball over and getting a lot of penalties."
35:15,740;35:18,900;"So in this way, they lost the turn over the balls."
35:18,900;35:21,060;"Yeah, exactly."
35:21,060;35:25,020;"So it just kills drives and it's probably what, you know,"
35:25,020;35:26,060;"Browns fans are used to."
35:26,060;35:29,180;"Like, yeah, obviously we know how this goes, but that's a great"
35:29,180;35:29,500;"comp."
35:29,500;35:30,100;"We're used to."
35:30,100;35:30,500;"Yeah."
35:30,500;35:33,940;"And that's turning that actually zero to four in this game."
35:34,940;35:38,300;"And they had 12 penalties for 126 yards."
35:38,300;35:41,780;"And one of those turnovers was like a screen that just,"
35:41,780;35:44,820;"Kevin Falk dropped and everyone stood around and watched the"
35:44,820;35:45,820;"UFC and take it out."
35:45,820;35:46,820;"Exactly right."
35:46,820;35:52,220;"That was the epitome of unpatriot like is a questionable play"
35:52,220;35:55,420;"and all the patients stopped except for like Richard Seymour"
35:55,420;35:58,660;"on like their field goal getting hands to the feast penalty,"
35:58,660;36:01,220;"giving them a first down and the chase score to touchdown,"
36:01,220;36:02,660;"which then they won a score to show."
36:02,660;36:03,660;"Yeah."
36:03,660;36:05,620;"of a ton of rushing yards too, right?"
36:05,620;36:09,780;"But that was like, again, I thought they played pretty well early."
36:09,780;36:11,500;"Yeah, it was 36 for 158."
36:11,500;36:15,020;"But the first quarter was 0-0."
36:15,020;36:15,620;"Yeah."
36:15,620;36:18,500;"They got the first score, 3-0 in."
36:18,500;36:20,780;"Then that-- I think it was that dumb, you know,"
36:20,780;36:22,660;"would have been 3-3, but then it was 7-3."
36:22,660;36:24,620;"And then there was that--"
36:24,620;36:26,100;"I think that the screen pass."
36:26,100;36:27,100;"And that was 14-3."
36:27,100;36:28,500;"And then it's kind of snowball from there."
36:28,500;36:30,780;"And they couldn't like write the ship."
36:30,780;36:32,780;"But I think like that's like a"
36:32,780;36:40,860;"Epidemic of the Patriots before 2001, right? I think yeah, it was just I bet everyone watching that game then all like up"
36:40,860;36:43,380;"There we go, you know, this is just back to normal"
36:43,380;36:48,840;"Yeah, last and like last last couple games or losing streak here and"
36:48,840;36:51,920;"because you're a commentator we're touching on it they"
36:51,920;36:54,900;"Showed us down. Let me see if I took a"
36:55,140;36:59,060;"Really like Brady was forcing picks, you know, there's a lot of bad decisions on his part"
36:59,060;37:02,780;"He just like look like I have a note if he played like this last year"
37:02,780;37:05,000;"You know they wouldn't gonna Super Bowl"
37:05,000;37:07,900;"He probably wouldn't have started a second year that would come back to dream blood"
37:07,900;37:13,420;"So like right he's these last couple of games. He's made a bunch of just boneheaded decisions"
37:13,420;37:16,620;"Like what are you doing dude? Yeah, and actually speaking of that"
37:16,620;37:20,700;"Like make your time warp noise"
37:21,900;37:28,760;"Oh, you want to update Dave Megate is in jail. Oh, yes, okay, so the year 2040"
37:28,760;37:30,920;"Oh good and what about"
37:30,920;37:33,920;"What's this face sharper?"
37:33,920;37:36,680;"They said he got"
37:36,680;37:43,160;"He was like 2012 or 13 so might that he only got 20 years"
37:43,160;37:45,680;"you know, he like"
37:45,680;37:49,720;"There's up to like 16 women that have said he's sexually assaulted"
37:50,880;37:58,880;"in four states. He's like, he's like a legitimate psychopath. Yeah. Yeah."
37:58,880;38:03,880;"Does all the stories are the exact of the same and he like drugs them and then rapes them."
38:03,880;38:12,880;"It's fucking horrific. Cool. Like I'm bringing that down. So who do you think is a better person?"
38:12,880;38:15,960;"- That's Brett Favre."
38:15,960;38:19,960;"'Cause all it did was show his dick to people."
38:19,960;38:22,720;"- Now Brett Favre doesn't seem like such an asshole, does he?"
38:22,720;38:25,240;"(laughing)"
38:25,240;38:27,320;"- I do think that was sucked under the rug a little bit."
38:27,320;38:30,520;"Like, ah, you know, just a gun slinger shooting a shot."
38:30,520;38:33,840;"- If it's an unsolicited dick pic,"
38:33,840;38:38,840;"like pales in comparison to 16 rapes in four states."
38:38,840;38:41,160;"- It does."
38:41,160;38:42,840;"America right, but yes."
38:42,840;38:48,040;"But let's not let's not encourage unsolicited dick pics to our fans."
38:48,040;38:50,960;"No, no, solicited dick pics."
38:50,960;38:52,320;"Yes. Yes."
38:52,320;38:54,240;"If you want to send Greg any you just."
38:54,240;38:57,440;"And if I can give a if I give out your phone number at the end of this."
38:57,440;39:00,280;"Greg has a blanket solicit."
39:00,280;39:01,000;"Yeah, he's just."
39:01,000;39:03,880;"He's open if you want to text Greg any pictures."
39:03,880;39:07,160;"Well, do you want to hear my theory on this on sending dick pics?"
39:07,160;39:08,120;"No, I want to hear you."
39:08,120;39:09,320;"Of course I do."
39:09,320;39:12,320;"So the key is, right?"
39:12,320;39:20,320;"You have to do something like slightly humorous so that if it ever sees the light of day,"
39:20,320;39:23,320;"that you can be like, ""All right, that's just funny too."""
39:23,320;39:29,320;"So what I would do is take a picture facing down, be like, ""Yo, check out my new shoes."""
39:29,320;39:32,320;"But then just my penis is in the corner."
39:32,320;39:37,320;"It's plausible deniability."
39:37,320;39:41,020;"or like a reflection of like your TV, but it's not on."
39:41,020;39:42,120;"Yes, exactly."
39:42,120;39:42,820;"Something like that."
39:42,820;39:44,120;"I'll just try to sell my TV."
39:44,120;39:47,120;"Yeah, which I think is actually happened before."
39:47,120;39:50,020;"Where are we going with this?"
39:50,020;39:55,720;"We were talking about Tom Brady and how badly he's played."
39:55,720;39:56,720;"Yes."
39:56,720;40:01,520;"And the commentators were actually talking about this."
40:01,520;40:04,720;"He said he had it as good as it could be right from the beginning."
40:04,820;40:10,420;"Do you think that he is the kind of guy though that you can put everything on his back the way they've done"
40:10,420;40:13,620;"During the course of this season ask him to throw the ball"
40:13,620;40:17,780;"40 50 times and do it all I mean John Elway"
40:17,780;40:21,540;"Really was not john Elway until drell Davis came along"
40:21,540;40:27,140;"Even frat far, you know until he ended up with the mont green on this team"
40:27,140;40:33,140;"It was difficult for him to get it going a little bit as I just don't believe in that one side of the approach that we've seen"
40:33,540;40:38,100;"So far from the Patriots. I know they've had trouble running the ball, but I don't think that's the right approach"
40:38,100;40:48,140;"First of all that bidding but a ding with the scores in the bottom. Yep, that's nostalgia. That made me"
40:48,140;40:52,940;"I'm not back. Never isn't it? Yes, you know the beginning of my romance with"
40:52,940;40:55,700;"Chris Collins worth"
40:55,700;41:00,420;"Why do you do not like Chris Collins worth Chris Collins worth not a big fan Chris Collins worth. Oh my god"
41:00,420;41:02,420;"I like everybody who is though."
41:02,420;41:03,420;"He'd eat everybody."
41:03,420;41:06,180;"Yeah, every and Greg and there's two people right there."
41:06,180;41:07,180;"Your brothers."
41:07,180;41:08,180;"Yeah, I can't stand either."
41:08,180;41:09,860;"Yeah, I can't believe we're still doing this."
41:09,860;41:11,940;"I like, I think Colin's worth great."
41:11,940;41:12,940;"You're fucking me."
41:12,940;41:14,580;"I think he's good."
41:14,580;41:15,580;"Not great."
41:15,580;41:16,940;"But he, but I like him."
41:16,940;41:17,940;"I like him."
41:17,940;41:18,940;"He'll call people out."
41:18,940;41:19,940;"Yeah."
41:19,940;41:23,060;"That grew in Mr. Super duper positive."
41:23,060;41:25,060;"Aikman can barely get through a sentence."
41:25,060;41:27,460;"Well, Aikman's just so boring to you."
41:27,460;41:34,140;"He never have like a thought of his own, you know, at least columns where it's like, I mean, that's a valid point"
41:34,140;41:36,860;"He's brought up there too. Yeah, especially for 2002"
41:36,860;41:39,420;"Cold take at this point now"
41:39,420;41:44,980;"Yeah, but at the point of time and it's a fair point the Patriots have been on a big losing streak"
41:44,980;41:50,940;"They they open the season with three games where they're throwing the ball everywhere and spreading people out and everyone's like"
41:50,940;41:55,260;"Whoa, what is this and then they go to like 13 10 and 10 points, you know?"
41:55,660;42:01,940;"Yeah, and you win the previous season on playing like a defensive game with a good rushing attack"
42:01,940;42:04,220;"And now they've like kind of switched it this year"
42:04,220;42:07,020;"We're trying to throw the ball all around the place and they're not doing as well"
42:07,020;42:09,620;"It's a completely valid point for him to make I mean"
42:09,620;42:16,740;"Conversations before where it was weird though hearing aikman"
42:16,740;42:22,180;"Ca and Collins were together in the same booth and Dick Stockton those three women the booth"
42:22,180;42:28,820;"Which if you caught at the very end if you watch all the way through this whole game to the last couple of seconds"
42:28,820;42:32,020;"Which I did spoiler alert Steve. I did not"
42:32,020;42:39,280;"The only reason dick Stockton is in there is because Joe Buck is doing the"
42:39,280;42:42,060;"NLCS playoff games"
42:42,060;42:46,620;"You're supposed to be a part of this. Yeah, oh, it's you it was still buck and ackman"
42:46,620;42:51,640;"It would have been buck ackman in Collins worth. Oh fucking kill me. I'm glad it wasn't yeah"
42:51,640;42:54,120;"- Nick Stockton was pretty good actually, I thought."
42:54,120;42:56,200;"- Yeah, Nick Stockton was the saving grace of this."
42:56,200;42:57,040;"- Way better than."
42:57,040;42:59,660;"- Fucking Joe Buck."
42:59,660;43:01,040;"- Greg, what's your thought about Joe Buck?"
43:01,040;43:02,040;"You love him too?"
43:02,040;43:04,060;"- Mm, I don't love him."
43:04,060;43:06,240;"He's a little bit better."
43:06,240;43:10,440;"Like, I've heard interviews with him not in the booth"
43:10,440;43:13,240;"and he's like self-aware, which makes us hear him less."
43:13,240;43:15,040;"But he's, it sounds like,"
43:15,040;43:16,520;"I don't like the commentators that try"
43:16,520;43:19,480;"and like be intentionally dry."
43:19,480;43:22,720;"Like, some are all, some are all to me the worst."
43:22,720;43:24,560;"- You talked about this in the Super Bowl episode."
43:24,560;43:27,320;"- Yeah, it's like, it gets a thing back then"
43:27,320;43:29,160;"or to be like non-emotional."
43:29,160;43:30,360;"- Right, yeah."
43:30,360;43:31,920;"- I don't like that, like give me some--"
43:31,920;43:32,920;"- I hate that too."
43:32,920;43:33,920;"- Give me some juice."
43:33,920;43:38,280;"- And Tony Romo has gone in the exact opposite direction"
43:38,280;43:40,640;"where he's almost too much involved."
43:40,640;43:42,920;"Like, ooh, I don't know."
43:42,920;43:43,920;"- I like it."
43:43,920;43:44,760;"I love him."
43:44,760;43:46,160;"- But like, 'cause they're all thinking"
43:46,160;43:47,520;"of this feeling the same way."
43:47,520;43:54,080;"So Greg, if that if that pissed you off, I bet you don't want to hear my thoughts on the referees in this game."
43:54,080;43:55,440;"Well, that's here."
43:55,440;44:00,400;"There you want me to you want me to just do it for you."
44:00,400;44:01,320;"Yeah, go ahead."
44:01,320;44:05,400;"Well, the referees, which is absolutely reprehensible."
44:05,400;44:08,400;"Oh, that's too big of a word for you."
44:08,400;44:10,840;"And yeah, because that yeah, I've had too much wine for that."
44:10,840;44:11,720;"That's what it word."
44:11,720;44:14,240;"All right, go ahead, Andy."
44:14,240;44:15,440;"Tell me what your thoughts are."
44:16,320;44:18,420;"The referees, I think, learned a new trick in this game."
44:18,420;44:20,360;"And that was a pass interference."
44:20,360;44:25,560;"They must have read that recently in referee monthly or something and what it"
44:25,560;44:28,760;"was, because they were calling it almost an every deep ball."
44:28,760;44:33,920;"And I don't even think they would have been called in today's NFL, but"
44:33,920;44:36,120;"they were calling pass interference on fucking anything."
44:36,120;44:40,880;"They were it was and it was a lot of, you know, on the Packers."
44:40,880;44:44,420;"Like for the Packers, at least I thought that as well was a little one"
44:44,420;44:46,220;"side and very tikki tacky."
44:46,220;44:48,900;"He calls worth is calling it out too though."
44:48,900;44:51,540;"That's why I like calls on both sides."
44:51,540;44:55,820;"But yeah, I think that the Packers ended up probably with more"
44:55,820;45:00,620;"pass inference calls overall, but like all the ones they call like none of"
45:00,620;45:02,620;"them were actually legitimately pass in fairness."
45:02,620;45:08,620;"There was one awful review to it was like a third down where like he"
45:08,620;45:12,620;"went out, Donald Driver caught the ball and kind of fumbled it out of bounds."
45:12,940;45:14,380;"Yeah, didn't have control."
45:14,380;45:15,020;"I didn't watch it."
45:15,020;45:16,620;"I called it incomplete on the field,"
45:16,620;45:20,180;"and then they overturned it for some reason, which was stupid."
45:20,180;45:23,460;"Yeah, but again, I watched these live where I watch these on Plex."
45:23,460;45:26,020;"And I was at 30 second skip button."
45:26,020;45:27,660;"Oh, it was the 10."
45:27,660;45:30,180;"It was three minutes of just."
45:30,180;45:32,900;"Walking thing, play over over again."
45:32,900;45:36,540;"Oh, well, then see that I was getting around."
45:36,540;45:41,260;"I can agree with like process related things, right?"
45:41,260;45:43,500;"if you're like all the review process blows,"
45:43,500;45:44,380;"then needs to be fixed."
45:44,380;45:47,180;"But to just be like, oh, these rats suck."
45:47,180;45:50,660;"Like they're humans, you know?"
45:50,660;45:52,500;"- I agree, but to learn a new thing."
45:52,500;45:55,260;"- You and I could not do a better job."
45:55,260;45:57,660;"- Well, I could, I've done it."
45:57,660;45:59,020;"- And you keep part of this game."
45:59,020;46:00,980;"(laughing)"
46:00,980;46:01,900;"- Keep part of this game was when"
46:01,900;46:05,060;"Tylog got hurt and Ben Kelly came in."
46:05,060;46:05,980;"Yes."
46:05,980;46:07,980;"- Yeah, who remembers Ben Kelly?"
46:07,980;46:11,220;"- I do from last season because I had a note in two games."
46:11,220;46:14,180;"'cause he was returning kicks and the note was,"
46:14,180;46:16,140;"who the fuck is Ben Kelly?"
46:16,140;46:16,980;"To we can run."
46:16,980;46:19,220;"- This is my first time getting Ben Kelly in my life."
46:19,220;46:22,820;"What an anonymous name to, for an anonymous corner back."
46:22,820;46:25,100;"So he came back and like, oh, there's Ben Kelly."
46:25,100;46:27,460;"- But he has that, that first, like he comes in"
46:27,460;46:30,180;"and Brett Favre picks on him and then he has a pretty good,"
46:30,180;46:32,620;"pass he has his head around, he's got the guy on his back"
46:32,620;46:33,940;"and he's like fighting for the ball."
46:33,940;46:34,780;"- Almost picks it up."
46:34,780;46:36,020;"- And they call the eye on him."
46:36,020;46:37,580;"- That was the worst one."
46:37,580;46:39,780;"- And then they just go after him."
46:39,780;46:43,420;"And then Brett Farb just goes after Ben Kelly immediately over and over again,"
46:43,420;46:44,900;"all the way down to like the five yard line."
46:44,900;46:45,260;"Yeah."
46:45,260;46:46,100;"As you should."
46:46,100;46:47,020;"Yeah."
46:47,020;46:48,860;"It's a raw."
46:48,860;46:53,580;"The injury was the, the announcer's like, Oh,"
46:53,580;46:55,940;"we think he's going through a concussion protocol because they're doing the"
46:55,940;46:57,460;"finger in front of his face and stuff."
46:57,460;46:59,340;"He doesn't look like he's raw there."
46:59,340;47:01,940;"The official word is the wind is knocked out of him."
47:01,940;47:03,020;"Yeah."
47:03,020;47:05,100;"That's also like a blood cell."
47:05,100;47:06,260;"We can cussed."
47:06,260;47:08,420;"And it's well, right?"
47:08,420;47:10,340;"the wind knocked out of him too. Yeah, it"
47:10,340;47:13,020;"like claps lung. Yeah, yeah, literally the"
47:13,020;47:14,820;"wind knocked out of Jesus. You were thinking"
47:14,820;47:16,220;"that just so wrong."
47:16,220;47:18,020;"So you got a stinger, okay."
47:18,020;47:22,380;"Or just hockey is an upper body injury."
47:22,380;47:25,180;"But yeah, I don't there weren't really any"
47:25,180;47:27,860;"Patriots that had good games."
47:27,860;47:28,540;"Tyler."
47:28,540;47:30,940;"Tyler did play pretty well."
47:30,940;47:33,300;"He played OK, and so I got hurt and then"
47:33,300;47:34,500;"like that's that's bad."
47:34,500;47:36,980;"You had a big third downstop in that first"
47:36,980;47:38,100;"quarter to you know, you did."
47:38,140;47:38,640;"Yeah."
47:38,640;47:40,440;"Uh, Terry Glenn."
47:40,440;47:42,540;"Did not have a good game."
47:42,540;47:47,420;"I thought watching Brett Favre throw to Terry Glenn is the reason I hate Brett Favre."
47:47,420;47:50,260;"And also Terry Glenn, because Terry Glenn would give up on a route and Brett Favre"
47:50,260;47:52,740;"would throw it anyway, even though it was triple covered."
47:52,740;47:53,940;"He never completed it."
47:53,940;47:56,500;"The fuck are both of you doing?"
47:56,500;47:56,820;"He did."
47:56,820;48:00,260;"He had eight targets with three catches for 19 yards."
48:00,260;48:02,060;"Yeah, he had an awful drop too."
48:02,060;48:05,220;"He was like, would have been way open if he actually tried hard."
48:05,220;48:06,460;"And then he hit him in the hands."
48:06,460;48:07,980;"He just dropped it anyways."
48:07,980;48:09,720;"Yeah, not great."
48:09,720;48:12,660;"But Brett Favre, his second touch of the game,"
48:12,660;48:15,060;"was his 300th all time."
48:15,060;48:19,460;"They said there's only 400 touchdown quarterbacks"
48:19,460;48:20,620;"at that point."
48:20,620;48:21,660;"There were."
48:21,660;48:23,380;"And what was like Frank Tarkin's turners up."
48:23,380;48:25,420;"How many are there now?"
48:25,420;48:28,180;"Probably like 70, would be my guess."
48:28,180;48:29,820;"I'm going to say--"
48:29,820;48:30,620;"Snapchat."
48:30,620;48:32,220;"42."
48:32,220;48:33,100;"Yeah."
48:33,100;48:35,900;"Got a guess before you Google it, Greg."
48:35,900;48:37,160;"I'm saying 42."
48:37,160;48:43,060;"I'm saying like 300 or three in 2002."
48:43,060;48:44,380;"I'm saying 18."
48:44,380;48:46,660;"I'm saying 10."
48:46,660;48:48,860;"Greg, Andy, you just said 70."
48:48,860;48:51,860;"Well, that was a joke."
48:51,860;48:54,220;"Oh, I was going off to your gas."
48:54,220;48:55,860;"What would there be?"
48:55,860;48:57,100;"Five prices right?"
48:57,100;48:57,900;"Well, let's go."
48:57,900;49:01,460;"Oh my God."
49:01,460;49:04,700;"See, yeah, come on, Greg."
49:04,700;49:05,700;"What you got?"
49:05,700;49:11,020;"Do you want me to give you the stat or are you still guessing? No, I guess 10 Stephen gets 42"
49:11,020;49:17,620;"Guess what 18? Yeah, there are 12 quarterbacks that have three"
49:17,620;49:22,240;"Can we name them? Yeah, Brett five France, Arkington"
49:22,240;49:25,180;"Yeah, manning Tom Brady"
49:25,180;49:30,960;"I'm right now who damn Reno. He was in that montage during the game and there"
49:30,960;49:34,460;"420 sweet dude"
49:35,020;49:37,020;"Sweet nice"
49:37,020;49:42,340;"Who else has been really good for a lot of those there was four of them giving to us in the game"
49:42,340;49:45,340;"I just paid attention friend talking to"
49:45,340;49:51,980;"It was Frank dark and then damn, you know Brett Favre and we were talking about them earlier. I think"
49:51,980;49:54,820;"Doug Peterson"
49:54,820;49:58,380;"He has 40"
49:58,380;50:02,500;"John L. Way, yes, oh yeah"
50:03,980;50:09,040;"Okay, so the rest of them are all within what they're either active"
50:09,040;50:12,440;"They're all out in a is the other"
50:12,440;50:18,560;"No, wow, I thought that too quick because I did that montage. I was like can't believe mountains not on there"
50:18,560;50:22,160;"She's actually playing with Jerry rice through breeze will be on there"
50:22,160;50:25,040;"True reason number one. Oh"
50:25,040;50:27,720;"Right, of course. Yeah, so I think Ryan"
50:27,720;50:28,800;"That's not one through five."
50:28,800;50:31,980;"We got breeze, Brady, Manning, Farr, Marino."
50:31,980;50:36,980;"You're missing six, seven, eight, nine and 11."
50:36,980;50:38,880;"And the rest of those are active?"
50:38,880;50:40,040;"Correct."
50:40,040;50:41,160;"Matt Ryan."
50:41,160;50:42,800;"Matt Ryan is 11."
50:42,800;50:43,640;"Nice."
50:43,640;50:47,200;"They're gonna be playing for a little bit."
50:47,200;50:49,160;"So I gotta be sure of them were drafted"
50:49,160;50:51,760;"and traded together on draft day."
50:51,760;50:53,720;"Rothace burger."
50:53,720;50:54,560;"Rothbears one of them,"
50:54,560;50:56,080;"but that's not what I was thinking of."
50:56,080;50:56,920;"Eli."
50:56,920;50:57,560;"Eli."
50:57,560;51:00,120;"- Yeah, and Phil, and Phil Phil Rivers."
51:00,120;51:03,640;"Eli has 300 touchdowns. - Three 66."
51:03,640;51:05,400;"- It doesn't even mean there's many interceptions"
51:05,400;51:06,320;"he has touchdowns."
51:06,320;51:07,960;"(laughing)"
51:07,960;51:08,800;"- Oh, literally."
51:08,800;51:12,200;"- So who else are we missing?"
51:12,200;51:14,240;"- We talked about him earlier."
51:14,240;51:15,080;"- James Woodson."
51:15,080;51:18,780;"(laughing)"
51:18,780;51:21,680;"- We talked about him earlier."
51:21,680;51:22,840;"We've talked about a lot of people."
51:22,840;51:24,400;"- Rat farf."
51:24,400;51:26,480;"- You might have mentioned him, but."
51:26,480;51:30,360;"Um, Chad Pennington."
51:30,360;51:31,120;"Time's up."
51:31,120;51:32,020;"Aaron Rodgers."
51:32,020;51:33,520;"Oh, of course."
51:33,520;51:35,220;"God damn."
51:35,220;51:37,660;"Yeah, we do Carson Palmer is 294."
51:37,660;51:38,820;"Wow."
51:38,820;51:42,560;"Vinny test of early 275."
51:42,560;51:43,300;"Love that."
51:43,300;51:44,360;"Warren, move on."
51:44,360;51:44,840;"I know."
51:44,840;51:45,700;"Blood."
51:45,700;51:46,900;"So it was too long."
51:46,900;51:48,400;"I was just going to ask where blood."
51:48,400;51:48,760;"So it was."
51:48,760;51:49,540;"Yeah."
51:49,540;51:51,200;"So he's he's right there."
51:51,200;51:52,140;"He's not going to doorstop."
51:52,140;51:52,800;"Boomer."
51:52,800;51:54,440;"Two forty seven."
51:54,440;51:55,640;"All right."
51:55,800;52:00,040;"So, James is 116 with 121 touchdown."
52:00,040;52:02,600;"For now, for now."
52:02,600;52:05,840;"Would you guys be mad or what would you what would your opinion be if the"
52:05,840;52:07,760;"Pat signed Cam Newton?"
52:07,760;52:11,160;"You talked about this a little bit on that Panthers episode."
52:11,160;52:11,760;"Yeah."
52:11,760;52:14,400;"Doesn't make that change my opinion significantly."
52:14,400;52:16,400;"Really?"
52:16,400;52:17,040;"And what?"
52:17,040;52:17,480;"Yeah."
52:17,480;52:19,760;"Cause he's like, dude, Cam Newton's good."
52:19,760;52:20,880;"I agree."
52:20,880;52:22,040;"He gets a bad rap."
52:22,040;52:24,520;"And I think he's right."
52:24,520;52:29,920;"I agree. I just don't think the Patriots are in a position."
52:29,920;52:35,920;"But like my name free agent quarterback right now."
52:35,920;52:40,360;"Yeah, but I'd rather like if we have to go to a backup, I almost would rather be comfortable"
52:40,360;52:42,720;"going to Cam Newton than Brian Ware."
52:42,720;52:44,720;"Who gives you a better chance to win?"
52:44,720;52:46,320;"He's not going to send it back up."
52:46,320;52:47,320;"He has to be a star."
52:47,320;52:48,320;"Yeah."
52:48,320;52:50,320;"Well, if he wants, let me ask you."
52:50,320;52:52,720;"But like there's no starting jobs left in the NFL."
52:52,720;52:55,980;"I mean Bell check obviously give him a chance to compete. That's what I'm saying"
52:55,980;53:01,400;"I would love him you get him at a bargain right now like of all the free agent quarterbacks. You talking about"
53:01,400;53:04,520;"the red rocket whatever his name is"
53:04,520;53:06,720;"All in signed"
53:06,720;53:10,020;"Joe Flacco's yeah all those guys. I was like please no"
53:10,020;53:14,280;"Right, but cam Newton. I'm like and you could be alright. Yeah"
53:14,280;53:19,440;"Yeah, you could like theoretically make a super bowl of cam Newton and the other part is you don't have to like"
53:20,000;53:25,000;"Switch your offense for me there like some of those quarterbacks. Yeah, can run but he can also throw"
53:25,000;53:29,560;"And he's like I don't know. He's just so high upside that it's like alright"
53:29,560;53:35,760;"We have a chance in any game where it's like Andy Dalton. You're like, oh, just don't blow this, you know"
53:35,760;53:44,440;"Yeah, I know such a like what have you done for me recently like this fantasy football season the one that just ended"
53:44,440;53:45,680;"my"
53:45,680;53:49,560;"Mike two quarterbacks were Andy Luck and Cam Newton"
53:49,560;53:52,120;"And I was like, yeah, I'm sitting fine"
53:52,120;53:57,160;"And then luck retired stuff for the season and can do doesn't play snap and I was absolutely screwed the whole year"
53:57,160;54:01,040;"But like going into the year you like yeah, Andrew Luck and Cam Newton"
54:01,040;54:04,680;"Yeah, oh, yeah, we have the top 15 quarterbacks in the league"
54:04,680;54:10,420;"I would sign him if there was a stipulation in the contract that he can't write in the stupid hieroglyphics on his phone"
54:12,480;54:15,320;"What like how has his publishers not been like dude?"
54:15,320;54:18,540;"Just drop drop the fucking stupid font"
54:18,540;54:23,840;"Not doing you any favors in the public that might be part of the reason he's not signed right now"
54:23,840;54:28,040;"Well if you play on the pictures no social media at all anyways, right?"
54:28,040;54:34,000;"Well, it the thing about it, right? It's like the perception Matt matters as much as anything"
54:34,000;54:39,200;"We've seen it with Kaepernick of is this guy gonna come in and keep his head down and play right?"
54:39,200;54:42,360;"I thought a pager's care less about that though. Yeah"
54:42,360;54:44,360;"I think you probably right it'll"
54:44,360;54:49,280;"Sell that one anything it like that if you're his publicist right you say dude"
54:49,280;54:55,440;"This is an easy win if you just drop the hieroglyphics like if you want to dress funny. That's fine"
54:55,440;55:02,280;"You know yeah, whatever the style is a big thing to you, but the hieroglyphics like what just drop it"
55:02,280;55:05,080;"You're gonna make more money. Yeah, he's already made a ton of mine"
55:05,080;55:09,440;"So I don't really care is because he came out on those looking contracts are crazy. Yeah, it's true"
55:09,440;55:11,440;"That's true, but I don't even know if that's it"
55:11,440;55:15,980;"Like again, the legislature like or anybody really gives a shit in terms of like"
55:15,980;55:20,960;"The business side of things. I think they think anybody's been like oh"
55:20,960;55:25,920;"If you drop this you'll make more money because I don't think this well your quarterback is like the face of your franchise"
55:25,920;55:28,200;"If it's some other random player, maybe not but"
55:28,200;55:35,760;"But that's that's part of that bad stigma, you know, I mean yeah cares if you write some stupid hard"
55:35,760;55:37,760;"I actually didn't know that until just now"
55:38,080;55:39,080;"I'm sure it is hilarious."
55:39,080;55:48,680;"I've seen his post game interviews which are equally, I'm just assuming it looks like"
55:48,680;55:49,680;"how he dresses."
55:49,680;55:52,880;"So I already got out."
55:52,880;55:54,480;"I need to look it up."
55:54,480;55:59,080;"Well, like I don't care as long as you throw the goddamn ball."
55:59,080;56:03,920;"And again, my point early, I think he can be a better chance of women than Hoyer."
56:03,920;56:05,920;"I mean, we know what Hoyer is."
56:05,920;56:07,200;"a lot don't get me wrong. I love"
56:07,200;56:07,840;"Hoyer, but"
56:07,840;56:09,760;"Cam Newton probably will give you a"
56:09,760;56:10,800;"better chance to win."
56:10,800;56:12,940;"Yeah, but you got a sign as a starter"
56:12,940;56:13,680;"if you're signing them."
56:13,680;56:15,280;"I don't think I mean at some point"
56:15,280;56:16,400;"Cam Newton's good, big while there's"
56:16,400;56:17,480;"no starting jobs left."
56:17,480;56:19,120;"Where am I going to go or have the"
56:19,120;56:20,720;"best chance to start is probably where"
56:20,720;56:22,400;"they're starting Jared Stidham who"
56:22,400;56:23,840;"could be a boom or a bust."
56:23,840;56:25,760;"Right."
56:25,760;56:26,960;"So yeah,"
56:26,960;56:28,760;"we'll count it out."
56:28,760;56:30,160;"People talk about Kaepernick"
56:30,160;56:31,720;"getting black ball, but how the hell"
56:31,720;56:33,280;"is Cam Newton not been?"
56:33,280;56:34,680;"Yeah, who doesn't MVP?"
56:35,240;56:40,300;"And like he was injured. It wasn't like he was sucked and he sucked but because he's like a foot fracture"
56:40,300;56:47,020;"And he won the MVP like within the last like three four years. Yeah, I took a team to a Super Bowl like he's legit good"
56:47,020;56:50,120;"like extremely good. Yes"
56:50,120;56:57,180;"Hey, I don't get it. I know like you see ESPN writing all these articles who's gonna sign Kaepernick dude"
56:57,180;57:04,660;"That's what drives me crazy about ESPN is like it's just so like transparently clickbait where you"
57:04,660;57:15,260;"You have like the same quarterback who is everybody knows is legit good who's also not signed talk about him, you know, but that's not what drives clicks."
57:15,260;57:16,260;"Yeah, exactly."
57:16,260;57:17,460;"And it's the same with talk."
57:17,460;57:24,660;"They're the bullshit points so that you'll argue with them and call in and they can get an hour of sort of content over it."
57:24,660;57:26,660;"We will never do that on this podcast."
57:26,660;57:26,860;"Yeah."
57:26,860;57:28,860;"You're on page."
57:28,860;57:29,260;"Correct."
57:29,260;57:32,960;"We watch games from 20 years ago."
57:33,860;57:36,300;"- Subscribe each play in depth."
57:36,300;57:39,220;"I actually have something I wanna say that I think"
57:39,220;57:41,260;"about this podcast with a hot take."
57:41,260;57:44,420;"- Okay, what was your first hot take?"
57:44,420;57:46,940;"- That it was a regular breath."
57:46,940;57:48,580;"- That he's a serial killer, yeah."
57:48,580;57:49,620;"- But yes. - But a real killer."
57:49,620;57:53,300;"- I think he meant the whole thing, the whole concept."
57:53,300;57:55,420;"And that was so long ago, I can't remember."
57:55,420;57:57,980;"- What concept of what?"
57:57,980;58:00,180;"- This whole podcast."
58:00,180;58:01,580;"- Yeah."
58:01,580;58:05,940;"Episode one season one. I only stayed for half it. I went to the bar"
58:05,940;58:13,620;"Podcast you left. Yeah, it's not a good sign for listeners"
58:13,620;58:22,300;"Terrible on the podcast is you did as week one versus the Bengals who cares. I wasn't importantly not Steve Brown. I"
58:22,300;58:25,980;"Do have a hot take though"
58:25,980;58:29,100;"the refs taking their hat off as"
58:30,340;58:32,340;"As a penalty flag is dumb"
58:32,340;58:36,380;"Yeah, they should just have multiple flags"
58:36,380;58:43,460;"No, just throw the goddamn flag. What are you taking a hat off for that one specific penalty? That's fair"
58:43,460;58:48,340;"What where is that a goddamn rule? There's so many stupid fucking rules"
58:48,340;58:50,300;"Well"
58:50,300;58:55,380;"The tight end wasn't covering up the offensive line tackle so that's a"
58:56,060;59:01,320;"You have to know there's a second penalty call. That's why they throw like live during the play. I"
59:01,320;59:08,420;"Don't get it. What do you mean? No the the guy going out of bounds and touching it illegally"
59:08,420;59:14,860;"They're supposed to throw the hat for some reason. Yeah as well as if there's a second penalty and they don't have a second flag"
59:14,860;59:20,600;"No, no, they will also do that to legal touching penalty. They throw their hat off. Yeah"
59:20,600;59:24,480;"Gunner runs out of bounds and doesn't come back in they throw their hat"
59:24,480;59:28,960;"This is the worst part in this game. They did it but the guy didn't throw his hat off"
59:28,960;59:30,980;"So the rest huddle and the ref"
59:30,980;59:35,600;"How many throws have up yeah, that's it's a way you can see them laughing in their huddle"
59:35,600;59:38,380;"The call if you're up to take your hat off and throw the ground"
59:38,380;59:45,280;"Which was absolutely no purpose and those people should ask penalty to get negated"
59:45,280;59:49,520;"The amazing the average catch to yeah baller"
59:50,560;59:55,540;"Don't they do that if there's two if there's a second penalty to yes"
59:55,540;01:00:00,760;"Which is why they should carry multiple flags. They should carry yellow flag and a red flag. Yes"
01:00:00,760;01:00:03,920;"Well, but no, but that's a challenge flag Andy. Yeah"
01:00:03,920;01:00:06,700;"We'll get rid of challenge flags make those"
01:00:06,700;01:00:12,560;"purple every play review make those make those pink for breast cancer awareness and"
01:00:12,560;01:00:16,760;"Then the red flag would be if you have a second"
01:00:18,480;01:00:24,400;"Personal foul and you're kicked out of the game. So red flag should be a pink and redder too similar colors"
01:00:24,400;01:00:28,400;"You can have both of those you know was worse conversations. They've probably had"
01:00:28,400;01:00:32,400;"What about for the colorblind?"
01:00:32,400;01:00:38,240;"So no red and green the point Steve this is pretty problematic now that I think about it all right blue"
01:00:38,240;01:00:43,520;"Blue flag like in like an indoor soccer you get a blue card and you have to sit out for two minutes"
01:00:43,760;01:00:50,160;"I've had a lot of those. Yeah, you have a lot of those referees all like being in door because you just hack"
01:00:50,160;01:00:56,240;"And then I tell them how to do their job correctly surprise surprise Andy hates refs"
01:00:56,240;01:01:02,240;"News 11 at least you're consistent Andy you hate all refs"
01:01:02,240;01:01:08,640;"Yeah, oh, yeah, no me and referee's not gonna law which is great because I I used to be a um flag football ref in"
01:01:08,640;01:01:11,120;"in college for the flag for like the"
01:01:11,680;01:01:15,760;"What's it like football that they were doing for everyone hated you. Yeah, they definitely did"
01:01:15,760;01:01:22,400;"Now it's never the head referee. So thank you. And now they still did. Yeah, good. Fucking all refs"
01:01:22,400;01:01:29,040;"I hated myself so worked out well. All right, you guys gonna do uh play of the game. Um"
01:01:29,040;01:01:31,440;"Yes"
01:01:31,440;01:01:34,480;"Because I don't think we'll have the same one. Yeah, I went on else"
01:01:34,480;01:01:41,200;"All right, steve give me your play of the game. Oh, I actually have like four. So i'm what you guys got first"
01:01:41,200;01:01:48,640;"pick one you prick. No, I don't you guys go first. So I don't pick yours because you Greg. I didn't I know didn't watch the game."
01:01:48,640;01:01:50,560;"Yeah, it doesn't have one Greg."
01:01:50,560;01:01:53,760;"This is like whatever touchdown he saw on the fucking highlights."
01:01:53,760;01:01:59,200;"Well, isn't that a valid choice for play the game? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. So I'm not gonna take that from me, Greg."
01:01:59,200;01:02:06,400;"All right. Yeah, Greg, maybe you should go first. All right. I'll go first. Whatever play we scored our touchdown on. That was my play of the game."
01:02:06,400;01:02:09,000;"David Givens first catch."
01:02:09,000;01:02:16,440;"David Givens first catch four yards touchdown with 6.03 left in the third fourth quarter."
01:02:16,440;01:02:17,880;"Garbage time."
01:02:17,880;01:02:19,440;"But you know Brown was right."
01:02:19,440;01:02:21,640;"Touchdowns are touchdowns."
01:02:21,640;01:02:24,840;"He was actually his second catch of the game."
01:02:24,840;01:02:27,040;"And his third he had three catches on the game."
01:02:27,040;01:02:28,040;"Yep."
01:02:28,040;01:02:30,240;"But he went right back to him after that touchdown."
01:02:30,240;01:02:32,200;"Shout out David Givens."
01:02:32,200;01:02:34,000;"David Cumin's guy."
01:02:34,000;01:02:35,800;"From?"
01:02:35,800;01:02:39,600;"I don't know Notre Dame Notre Dame. Oh, yeah, they mentioned it"
01:02:39,600;01:02:43,080;"Yeah, I used to have the Notre Dame hat if you remember back in the day"
01:02:43,080;01:02:47,340;"Oh, that's right. Yeah, I was like big in another day because I loved it. David Givens"
01:02:47,340;01:02:51,880;"God, I said that why I thought you were just she now. Yeah"
01:02:51,880;01:02:54,680;"David Givens"
01:02:54,680;01:02:56,600;"Droughton draft pick"
01:02:56,600;01:02:58,600;"Yeah, he was their last"
01:02:58,600;01:03:00,720;"Last pick they kept saying"
01:03:01,760;01:03:03,760;"You wasn't Mr. O'Rellivant though, was he?"
01:03:03,760;01:03:06,880;"253 overall. Yeah"
01:03:06,880;01:03:10,080;"What was Brady who was somewhere in that range, right?"
01:03:10,080;01:03:12,640;"1.9"
01:03:12,640;01:03:14,320;"What is it?"
01:03:14,320;01:03:16,320;"199. Oh wow"
01:03:16,320;01:03:22,320;"Yeah, so there's used 253 out of 261 picks. You know what the guy is good after"
01:03:22,320;01:03:26,440;"It was good for a long time. We've already talked about give-ins and his like touchdown streak in the playoffs"
01:03:26,440;01:03:31,240;"We have yeah, we talked about this in one of the playoff episodes"
01:03:31,240;01:03:35,760;"Oh, good. He caught a total of four touchdowns at college."
01:03:35,760;01:03:40,840;"Really? Yeah. I think they didn't throw the wall back then."
01:03:40,840;01:03:43,720;"Yeah, Notre Dame. They're like a run heavy offense."
01:03:43,720;01:03:46,400;"I wish he'd stayed. No, it'd been sweet."
01:03:46,400;01:03:50,440;"He's him and Malcolm Mitchell are like the same person in my memory."
01:03:50,440;01:03:55,760;"Give ins was way better than Malcolm Mitchell, but the same type of receiver for sure."
01:03:55,760;01:03:59,560;"And Mitchell was good. He just had same trajectory too though."
01:03:59,560;01:04:04,040;"of like exactly played really well for a short stint and then had a really bad"
01:04:04,040;01:04:07,320;"injury and we never saw him again. I'm telling you, you're about to find out"
01:04:07,320;01:04:12,200;"given played well for longer than a short stint, you played out as a rookie contract then left."
01:04:12,200;01:04:16,440;"That's what I'm saying though is that Malcolm Mitchell only played. Malcolm Mitchell was going"
01:04:16,440;01:04:22,440;"to be that guy but his knee fell apart. Yeah, yeah, I agree. Oh yeah, same type of receiver, same."
01:04:22,440;01:04:26,520;"Yeah, almost personality too. All right, Andy, what's your play of the game?"
01:04:27,320;01:04:32,040;"So my play of the game was the replay they showed of"
01:04:32,040;01:04:35,560;"Tyla and Loyam Malloy"
01:04:35,560;01:04:40,280;"Ganging up on the gunner on a punt return"
01:04:40,280;01:04:43,160;"And they were talking about how"
01:04:43,160;01:04:48,920;"Tyla lulled him into his false sense of security and loyam Malloy came out of nowhere and just lit this guy up"
01:04:48,920;01:04:55,240;"Multiple times like lit him up so he fell over and then hit him like three times while he was on the ground just wouldn't let him up"
01:04:55,880;01:04:56,880;"Yeah, he blindsided."
01:04:56,880;01:04:59,980;"The competition is something along the lines of, I think Laura"
01:04:59,980;01:05:01,180;"Malloy got confused."
01:05:01,180;01:05:03,820;"He thought that was Terry Glenn and it wasn't."
01:05:03,820;01:05:08,860;"Also in that same vein where the Packers guy didn't call Fair"
01:05:08,860;01:05:09,320;"Catch."
01:05:09,320;01:05:10,380;"Yes."
01:05:10,380;01:05:11,860;"And lawyer was a fucking joke."
01:05:11,860;01:05:13,340;"That was the bucket, right?"
01:05:13,340;01:05:13,820;"It was."
01:05:13,820;01:05:16,300;"It was it was bad."
01:05:16,300;01:05:19,540;"Like he timed that ball coming in the hit absolute perfect."
01:05:19,540;01:05:20,540;"And he bottled it."
01:05:20,540;01:05:21,780;"And yeah, and he just."
01:05:21,780;01:05:24,140;"Found the back to the five who couldn't recover."
01:05:24,140;01:05:27,560;"We could cover that though to a different game new game. Yeah, I agree"
01:05:27,560;01:05:31,000;"That was my play the game killing cons"
01:05:31,000;01:05:38,740;"I was gonna be terrifying. You just have to look up in the air. Yeah, I'm just wait for someone to just light you up"
01:05:38,740;01:05:43,180;"I would call for a catch every time I think yeah, right fuck it"
01:05:43,180;01:05:50,620;"Yeah, I definitely would and then even if you do catch and start running like everybody has a full head of steam coming right at you"
01:05:50,620;01:05:52,740;"Yeah, yeah"
01:05:52,780;01:06:00,420;"Certain players you can tell have that like instinct where I think they can keep like one eye on the ball and one eye on the field"
01:06:00,420;01:06:04,260;"Yeah, like the true good punter returners can like not"
01:06:04,260;01:06:07,620;"They know what's coming. Oh, yeah, of course"
01:06:07,620;01:06:12,660;"Like if they can catch it and immediately make a move because they know that guy is coming hard on their right sort of thing, right?"
01:06:12,660;01:06:15,140;"Yeah, yeah, what was the guy in the pads that?"
01:06:15,140;01:06:17,740;"We drafted high"
01:06:17,740;01:06:21,380;"That cornerback from Alabama was reason. Oh, yeah"
01:06:21,380;01:06:23,140;"Yeah, yeah, he went to the Ravens."
01:06:23,140;01:06:24,460;"Yeah."
01:06:24,460;01:06:28,260;"And he could tell he didn't have it."
01:06:28,260;01:06:29,980;"He like the ball was in the air and you could tell"
01:06:29,980;01:06:30,980;"he was just like nervous."
01:06:30,980;01:06:33,260;"He's like staring the ball down because he,"
01:06:33,260;01:06:36,100;"I think he like he fucked up some early ones"
01:06:36,100;01:06:37,420;"and that just killed them."
01:06:37,420;01:06:38,260;"Yeah."
01:06:38,260;01:06:38,900;"And it'd be like,"
01:06:38,900;01:06:40,420;"Calamfairy catching no ones around him"
01:06:40,420;01:06:41,660;"or like getting lit up."
01:06:41,660;01:06:43,060;"Oh, I like it."
01:06:43,060;01:06:43,900;"Yeah."
01:06:43,900;01:06:46,180;"We're best."
01:06:46,180;01:06:47,260;"- Virus Jones or something like that."
01:06:47,260;01:06:48,100;"- That was it."
01:06:48,100;01:06:49,780;"- Virus Jones, virus of virus."
01:06:51,180;01:06:52,900;"See, this is why I had you guys go first."
01:06:52,900;01:06:54,900;"Those two were in my plays of the game."
01:06:54,900;01:06:56,060;"Oh my God."
01:06:56,060;01:06:56,740;"What a surprise."
01:06:56,740;01:07:02,740;"Well, now I have one that I watched it all the way through and I saw this and I"
01:07:02,740;01:07:03,180;"loved it."
01:07:03,180;01:07:04,700;"OK, let's hear it."
01:07:04,700;01:07:07,580;"Way, way deep in."
01:07:07,580;01:07:14,100;"This is between my, the stadium is empty note in Joey Harrington blew it note."
01:07:14,100;01:07:16,660;"So we get our"
01:07:16,660;01:07:18,660;"- We get our first sack, I think."
01:07:18,660;01:07:20,660;"- Oh yeah, a wrap-up."
01:07:20,660;01:07:22,660;"- Yeah, Bobby Hamilton gets it."
01:07:22,660;01:07:26,660;"- Yeah, he comes up and he's doing some of his hands."
01:07:26,660;01:07:28,660;"Look at, he's making like a motion,"
01:07:28,660;01:07:30,660;"like he's rolling his hands over each other."
01:07:30,660;01:07:34,660;"And I was like, is he celebrating a sack down,"
01:07:34,660;01:07:37,660;"you know, 28 to 10 with a minute and a half left"
01:07:37,660;01:07:39,660;"or like what an asshole."
01:07:39,660;01:07:41,660;"And then I realized he's calling time out."
01:07:41,660;01:07:42,660;"- Oh, that's right."
01:07:42,660;01:07:43,660;"- Oh, like, he's like,"
01:07:43,660;01:07:44,500;"all you can time out."
01:07:44,500;01:07:45,780;"And that's like, right."
01:07:45,780;01:07:46,280;"Yeah."
01:07:46,280;01:07:49,020;"I like that."
01:07:49,020;01:07:50,180;"Yes, that was a good one."
01:07:50,180;01:07:52,820;"But even like, at least Bobby Hamilton's playing hard"
01:07:52,820;01:07:55,780;"all the way through the whistle and understanding,"
01:07:55,780;01:07:57,540;"because I was third down, they have"
01:07:57,540;01:07:59,100;"to punt out their own end zone."
01:07:59,100;01:08:01,220;"Maybe we'd block a punt and get a touchdown."
01:08:01,220;01:08:04,580;"And it's kind of like 17, 28."
01:08:04,580;01:08:05,340;"Yeah."
01:08:05,340;01:08:07,540;"I mean, the Patriots went down throwing too."
01:08:07,540;01:08:09,380;"They didn't just take a knee at the end."
01:08:09,380;01:08:11,580;"They got the ball back and they were still"
01:08:11,580;01:08:13,140;"trying to throw it down the field,"
01:08:13,140;01:08:17,460;"even though they were down 28 10 with like under a minute left."
01:08:17,460;01:08:20,500;"Also Brett Farr played this whole game, which I thought was a little strange."
01:08:20,500;01:08:21,700;"Are you going to tell Brett Farr?"
01:08:21,700;01:08:22,300;"He can't you?"
01:08:22,300;01:08:25,220;"Yeah, it's a little Tom Brady ish too."
01:08:25,220;01:08:28,220;"They kept showing all of his like celebrations on touchdowns."
01:08:28,220;01:08:31,820;"And he's like head-butting people in the face and stuff and just like we did this"
01:08:31,820;01:08:34,900;"going 300 with like linemen still though."
01:08:34,900;01:08:37,980;"But like even after like they had a rushing touchdown, he's like grabbing a lineman,"
01:08:37,980;01:08:39,900;"head-butting them in the face and like pushing them around."
01:08:39,900;01:08:40,700;"Yeah."
01:08:40,700;01:08:41,940;"He's the best."
01:08:42,300;01:08:47,260;"You just I like that part of Brett farm. I generally don't like Brett farm though. No here"
01:08:47,260;01:08:51,800;"I have a take on this Steve. You don't like the way that media treats Brett farm"
01:08:51,800;01:09:00,700;"That's that's not unfair. I think you're right and you would that's why I love to appreciate a more measured"
01:09:00,700;01:09:06,560;"Approach to Brett farm. Yeah, it's the same thing with Brady. That's why people hate him. Do you think that Brady's awesome?"
01:09:06,560;01:09:09,460;"They think that the media"
01:09:10,780;01:09:16,660;"Slobs is not below bit which is pretty but the problem is like Brady like his knob deserves to be slobbed"
01:09:16,660;01:09:22,140;"You know like the performance on the field deserves the knob slobbing"
01:09:22,140;01:09:24,300;"So does refar does it though?"
01:09:24,300;01:09:29,220;"You just you're the one who told us he has as many turnovers as he has touchdowns. He's a one-to-one machine"
01:09:29,220;01:09:33,180;"Yeah, he's also one MVP's he's one super bowl"
01:09:33,180;01:09:36,720;"Like cuz the media slobbing is not be I think like"
01:09:37,100;01:09:41,840;"Fourth all time in teams are just voting worth all time in yards. He's the first all time"
01:09:41,840;01:09:47,020;"Interception wait, I'm sorry. We're you the one that told us that he won an MVP throwing more interceptions and touchdowns"
01:09:47,020;01:09:49,120;"Yeah, no, he made a parole ball"
01:09:49,120;01:09:52,980;"That's that's that's knob slobbing whoa center. Yeah"
01:09:52,980;01:09:58,100;"I'm just saying"
01:09:58,100;01:10:03,300;"you need to no, I think I keep obvious Brady because he's"
01:10:04,300;01:10:08,520;"Like too consistently good and it's always crushing dreams as opposed"
01:10:08,520;01:10:11,260;"I mean I get a little bit of the media knob slobbing"
01:10:11,260;01:10:13,260;"but like the media knob sobbing is"
01:10:13,260;01:10:18,520;"Because he's doing so well the Brett fire of knob slobbing was undeserved"
01:10:18,520;01:10:23,900;"Based on his plate. He was I'm not saying he's bad and not good. He was good"
01:10:23,900;01:10:26,700;"but"
01:10:26,700;01:10:30,260;"They made him to be oh and they just dismiss his mistakes"
01:10:30,260;01:10:31,860;"like, oh, he's just a gunslinger."
01:10:31,860;01:10:34,660;"And anytime we scramble out the pocket and to only Brett"
01:10:34,660;01:10:36,140;"fire can make that play."
01:10:36,140;01:10:37,460;"Oh, it's true."
01:10:37,460;01:10:41,220;"How many times that play he makes when he's in Minnesota."
01:10:41,220;01:10:43,020;"And he sure."
01:10:43,020;01:10:44,940;"Great touchdown, but you don't."
01:10:44,940;01:10:45,900;"But they don't."
01:10:45,900;01:10:46,460;"They don't play."
01:10:46,460;01:10:47,780;"Don't play as everything."
01:10:47,780;01:10:48,420;"They don't."
01:10:48,420;01:10:52,940;"They don't count the flips out of the coin when he rolls out and throws a fucking million pick sixes too."
01:10:52,940;01:10:55,620;"Like, yeah, Brett fire plays a risky game."
01:10:55,620;01:10:57,540;"Sometimes he makes big plays like that."
01:10:57,540;01:10:59,060;"And sometimes he throws pick six."
01:10:59,260;01:11:03,340;"That's why he has a one to one turnover to interception and turnover to touchdown ratio."
01:11:03,340;01:11:04,380;"Here's a hot take."
01:11:04,380;01:11:05,180;"There's no measure."
01:11:05,180;01:11:07,340;"They're always like, wow, what a great play by Brad Farr."
01:11:07,340;01:11:08,020;"If I only throw something."
01:11:08,020;01:11:11,540;"Oh, you know, poor man's version of Pat Mahomes."
01:11:11,540;01:11:15,460;"Uh, okay."
01:11:15,460;01:11:16,860;"Their games are very similar."
01:11:16,860;01:11:17,140;"Yeah."
01:11:17,140;01:11:20,460;"He's Pat Mahomes, but with more mistakes, he's Pat Mahomes."
01:11:20,460;01:11:25,300;"If Pat Mahomes couldn't read a coverage, he's more charismatic than Pat Mahomes, though."
01:11:25,300;01:11:25,900;"Yeah."
01:11:25,900;01:11:26,540;"I don't know."
01:11:26,540;01:11:27,540;"Pat Mahomes."
01:11:27,540;01:11:28,380;"Pat Voiciness."
01:11:28,380;01:11:37,340;"still pretty young. Dude, he is like, he's football. You know, I'm saying, that's why a lot of people relate to him is because he's just like a normal dude that happened to me really good."
01:11:37,340;01:11:40,340;"He's like, no, I was right. Huh?"
01:11:40,340;01:11:43,100;"He was right. You know, exactly."
01:11:43,100;01:11:45,780;"He's a real comfortable dude."
01:11:45,780;01:11:50,020;"He is exactly real comfortable painkillers."
01:11:50,020;01:11:53,740;"Yeah. And Brady's over here, like Mr. Flexibility."
01:11:53,740;01:11:54,580;"Oh, yeah."
01:11:54,580;01:11:56,260;"a lot of ice cream like that."
01:11:56,260;01:11:57,080;"- Like that's right."
01:11:57,080;01:11:58,660;"- To his super bowl, super model life."
01:11:58,660;01:11:59,660;"- Yeah."
01:11:59,660;01:12:01,660;"- He is, he's a fucking, he's a,"
01:12:01,660;01:12:03,460;"Brady's a robot."
01:12:03,460;01:12:04,300;"- Yeah."
01:12:04,300;01:12:06,060;"- Brett Favre is a normal person."
01:12:06,060;01:12:07,980;"- I'm not debating that."
01:12:07,980;01:12:09,620;"- Well, if I played football,"
01:12:09,620;01:12:12,020;"I would definitely be addicted to painkillers."
01:12:12,020;01:12:15,180;"I don't think you need to play football."
01:12:15,180;01:12:16,020;"- So, yeah."
01:12:16,020;01:12:17,300;"So let's do excuse now."
01:12:17,300;01:12:21,400;"- They make me feel good."
01:12:22,420;01:12:24,580;"It made me real comfortable."
01:12:24,580;01:12:29,320;"Real comfortable painkillers."
01:12:29,320;01:12:33,380;"Yeah."
01:12:33,380;01:12:36,720;"One of my favorite things to do is prescription drugs that I do."
01:12:36,720;01:12:37,220;"I know."
01:12:37,220;01:12:37,720;"I know."
01:12:37,720;01:12:38,420;"Yeah."
01:12:38,420;01:12:41,860;"It talked a lot about that on this podcast."
01:12:41,860;01:12:44,860;"I feel like we should probably have a spinoff podcast."
01:12:44,860;01:12:46,820;"We'll just Greg and all the drugs he's done."
01:12:46,820;01:12:50,020;"I could have joined a football league just to rationalize it."
01:12:51,580;01:12:54,660;"You play soccer rationalize that but I got bad knees. I need all the yeah"
01:12:54,660;01:13:02,460;"Okay, I do have bad knees. You're right dude. There you go. That's a good point Andy break out the cocaine. I'm not broken"
01:13:02,460;01:13:06,060;"Systems broken"
01:13:06,060;01:13:09,580;"You're broken also blame big pharma"
01:13:09,580;01:13:12,060;"so"
01:13:12,060;01:13:14,060;"Who got next week?"
01:13:14,060;01:13:17,100;"Well, I have one more play of the game. Oh wait"
01:13:17,100;01:13:23,980;"Do you want butter? I don't know. This one's a ball here. You're a list of every single fucking play on my guy"
01:13:23,980;01:13:28,740;"I get all the games. We'll see if I is it a loyal Maloy timed up sack? No"
01:13:28,740;01:13:31,860;"it is"
01:13:31,860;01:13:36,800;"Third and ten twelve minutes fifty seconds left. No, I have you talking about braids in the shotgun"
01:13:36,800;01:13:39,340;"drops back to pass and"
01:13:39,340;01:13:46,020;"The right end comes off clean Matt light did not have a good game in this he did not like a Baja B. Amila"
01:13:46,860;01:13:48,580;"And the US pretty good."
01:13:48,580;01:13:54,060;"Basically has Brady dead to rights, you know, blind side strip sack."
01:13:54,060;01:13:57,740;"And Brady somehow manages to pass the ball to his left hand."
01:13:57,740;01:14:00,140;"So he doesn't drop it."
01:14:00,140;01:14:04,780;"And takes a couple steps to his left, puts it back in his right hand and rifles"
01:14:04,780;01:14:11,100;"the ball to our boy, Troy Brown, who's very excited to make this catch."
01:14:11,100;01:14:12,100;"Well, certain."
01:14:12,100;01:14:13,340;"Yeah."
01:14:13,340;01:14:14,180;"Yeah."
01:14:14,380;01:14:15,940;"13 yards keeps the drive alive."
01:14:15,940;01:14:20,260;"And I'm pretty sure I don't go on the score of this, but at the same point,"
01:14:20,260;01:14:24,940;"this was like one of those Brady trying to do his Brett Favre impression."
01:14:24,940;01:14:28,300;"Actually, I think it was the third, the field goal drive."
01:14:28,300;01:14:33,940;"It may have been right after the limit right in Tylah combo, punk coverage."
01:14:33,940;01:14:35,180;"Yeah, I think you're right."
01:14:35,180;01:14:36,900;"And fault headers."
01:14:36,900;01:14:38,740;"We blitz pick up on that."
01:14:38,740;01:14:42,180;"I don't know if they, they highlighted it in the commentary where they did."
01:14:43,260;01:14:47,780;"Like Kevin Falk took on a linebacker just don't."
01:14:47,780;01:14:49,500;"It was just a straight up."
01:14:49,500;01:14:52,220;"Just a lot of like backs cut them, you know?"
01:14:52,220;01:14:55,540;"Yeah, no, he's like, yeah, got under his pads"
01:14:55,540;01:14:57,780;"and just stoned straight up."
01:14:57,780;01:14:58,620;"There you go, Greg."
01:14:58,620;01:15:01,300;"Well, Matt, like it's beat like a rug."
01:15:01,300;01:15:04,620;"Just my favorite thing to like see highlights of"
01:15:04,620;01:15:08,740;"is running backs, making huge blocks."
01:15:08,740;01:15:09,740;"Yeah."
01:15:09,740;01:15:11,780;"Because you know, it like goes under the radar."
01:15:11,780;01:15:15,100;"It was actually an interesting going back to last week."
01:15:15,100;01:15:22,820;"Um, I think it was, it was Ricky Williams talking about Mike Dica and how like their relationship."
01:15:22,820;01:15:27,380;"Oh, and he said that he like, he made like a huge block on one play."
01:15:27,380;01:15:32,540;"And then he came off the field and Mike Dica said to him, like, that's the best play I've seen you make all season."
01:15:32,540;01:15:33,380;"You keep doing that."
01:15:33,380;01:15:35,780;"You're going to be like a great player in this league."
01:15:35,780;01:15:36,580;"Damn."
01:15:36,580;01:15:39,780;"And what I was just like, that's when I knew that like we were going to be a fit."
01:15:39,780;01:15:41,420;"Now that's pretty cool."
01:15:41,420;01:15:48,840;"if you can't let's pick up you can't start for the Patriots. Yep. Right. You get the"
01:15:48,840;01:15:54,100;"video for me here, Andy. Yeah, here you go. Let's get him parked down there. Oh, yeah,"
01:15:54,100;01:15:59,340;"Kevin. Yeah, did he just like, wash them out? He pushes them in the line. Yeah, but this"
01:15:59,340;01:16:07,500;"play was like, it's definitely Kevin Paul. Troy Brown. He's fucking sad. That might have"
01:16:07,500;01:16:11,340;"been Troy's first catch of the game. Watch Kevin Paul. No, it wasn't. You got the first"
01:16:11,340;01:16:17,940;"catch the game. But just like do it pushes him backwards. Yeah. But"
01:16:17,940;01:16:20,760;"Brady watch, watch, brace hands on this play. Tucks it to his"
01:16:20,760;01:16:26,460;"other hand. puts it back two steps balls out. First down on"
01:16:26,460;01:16:29,460;"third and 10. Keeps you dry. There was another play later in the"
01:16:29,460;01:16:32,140;"game where he like avoids two guys and he throws it incomplete."
01:16:32,140;01:16:35,420;"But like, yeah, that was a good one too. One, two. And like it"
01:16:35,420;01:16:39,500;"showed his this started to be where you could kind of see his"
01:16:39,500;01:16:45,020;"like elite in the pocket movement. Right. I mean, even up to this point, you hadn't"
01:16:45,020;01:16:49,580;"quite seen that yet that we're so used to have like his pre natural sense of like, there's"
01:16:49,580;01:16:54,860;"a guy coming up, let me take one step up and he goes right behind me sort of thing. There's"
01:16:54,860;01:16:58,860;"a little bit more of that in this game. Yeah, I think the same same as the pun return thing,"
01:16:58,860;01:17:04,380;"right? Yeah. Keeping your eyes down feel, but also like feeling pressure. Yeah. That's a"
01:17:04,380;01:17:07,740;"great comp, Greg. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's super rare."
01:17:07,740;01:17:12,700;"I wanted this good because I know we talked about Brady practicing his play action as well"
01:17:12,700;01:17:18,300;"Like a few weeks ago. I wonder if this is something that he has to practice as part of that too"
01:17:18,300;01:17:21,420;"Because if you ever see his like"
01:17:21,420;01:17:24,220;"Workout videos and shit online these days, it's all about"
01:17:24,220;01:17:28,860;"like he's just in his shell and he's you know and his helmet"
01:17:28,860;01:17:32,620;"He's dropped back to passing has guys just like punching him with boxing gloves on while"
01:17:32,620;01:17:36,300;"He's like eating his head downfield and like moving around as if he's in a pocket"
01:17:36,380;01:17:40,940;"Is that one of that was like an active part of the things that he works on during the offseason?"
01:17:40,940;01:17:43,580;"And then he lengthens his hamstrings by"
01:17:43,580;01:17:47,500;"Who's sending him vigorously? Yeah, me too. Yeah"
01:17:47,500;01:17:50,780;"It's all about length, Andy"
01:17:50,780;01:17:55,580;"At least as I'm getting as he gets tackled he thinks length and liability length and liability"
01:17:55,580;01:17:57,340;"Oh, yeah"
01:17:57,340;01:17:59,340;"And he drinks a ton of water too"
01:17:59,340;01:18:01,820;"That's why he doesn't get some word"
01:18:01,820;01:18:09,100;"We can say it's about working that part of that part of his whole his whole book did not help him in that like regular guy sort of approach either."
01:18:09,100;01:18:14,860;"Yeah, right far as out there doing like the copper like what a sleeve shit ads."
01:18:14,860;01:18:21,380;"Regular guys like yeah copper that sounds good kills like you know that'll be great for my arthritis."
01:18:21,380;01:18:26,700;"Raise like now bro just a little water and stretch a bunch and stopping from us."
01:18:27,260;01:18:29,260;"Everybody hates stretching. I've never"
01:18:29,260;01:18:32,460;"I love stretching"
01:18:32,460;01:18:35,180;"Stretching I love it. I feel so good"
01:18:35,180;01:18:38,700;"Yoga is different. I'm on team Andy. I don't I love stretching though"
01:18:38,700;01:18:43,020;"That's just stretching though because if I don't stretch I just I feel like I'm a hundred years old"
01:18:43,020;01:18:45,580;"So when you go play soccer you stretch before"
01:18:45,580;01:18:48,780;"Yes"
01:18:48,780;01:18:54,140;"Well, I now I'm also kicking 40s door down so I kind of have to otherwise"
01:18:55,420;01:19:01,660;"Bad very bad things will happen. I think stretching helps me poop better. So I'm kind of a big stretcher"
01:19:01,660;01:19:03,900;"I've never had a problem pooping not gonna"
01:19:03,900;01:19:10,280;"You need it, but like I'm more relaxed just in general, you know, you should try like the Asian pooping like"
01:19:10,280;01:19:15,060;"Sliding a squat. Yes squat on top of the toilet seat. Yeah, I'm also with that"
01:19:15,060;01:19:19,900;"See what I'm going in there. I'm going to wow like I my bathroom my sanctuary"
01:19:19,900;01:19:24,820;"So I'm you know, I'll bring a book or I'll bring my phone or something, you know, maybe bring my computer bring a guitar"
01:19:24,820;01:19:26,460;"just just to around a bit."
01:19:26,460;01:19:30,780;"Just me myself and my turds."
01:19:30,780;01:19:31,780;"Love it."
01:19:31,780;01:19:34,580;"I agree. I'm on a schedule."
01:19:34,580;01:19:36,020;"So it's nice."
01:19:36,020;01:19:38,860;"I'm not rather wall on the clock as well."
01:19:38,860;01:19:40,460;"Four or five times today."
01:19:40,460;01:19:43,140;"I'm going to get a little 10, 15 minute break."
01:19:43,140;01:19:44,420;"I can just fuck around on my phone."
01:19:44,420;01:19:46,100;"You guys ever."
01:19:46,100;01:19:53,620;"Like you like you'll like sit down and you won't sit far enough back."
01:19:54,140;01:19:58,620;"and it kind of pinches your, your old wiener there."
01:19:58,620;01:20:01,500;"And then you stand up and you realize that you haven't peed."
01:20:01,500;01:20:03,420;"And then you turn around and pee."
01:20:03,420;01:20:07,420;"No, no, because I'm a fucking grown up."
01:20:07,420;01:20:08,460;"What the hell?"
01:20:08,460;01:20:11,740;"Do you just, did you not learn how to do this growing up?"
01:20:11,740;01:20:12,140;"Yeah."
01:20:12,140;01:20:15,180;"How do you not notice that you're pinching your dick and you can't?"
01:20:15,180;01:20:17,180;"I've actually thought about this a lot."
01:20:17,180;01:20:17,900;"Like I've never."
01:20:17,900;01:20:20,380;"Shit, but not piss."
01:20:21,580;01:20:28,140;"Even if I paid like 20 minutes beforehand, like a little bit of P comes out just in my relaxation, you know, I got"
01:20:28,140;01:20:28,540;"relax."
01:20:28,540;01:20:32,540;"I could have a little bit of drip drips of Pete and then the poop comes out."
01:20:32,540;01:20:35,820;"This is not where I thought this episode would go, by the way."
01:20:35,820;01:20:41,820;"But well, it's only ever happened to me under the influence of marijuana, but it's happened."
01:20:41,820;01:20:47,980;"I think I think that's what's happening. I'm not positive, but I"
01:20:49,260;01:20:51,100;"Show it up and be like, oh, I forgot to pee."
01:20:51,100;01:20:53,700;"And then I'll turn around and pee."
01:20:53,700;01:20:56,540;"How many times are you talking, Greg?"
01:20:56,540;01:20:58,620;"I don't know, like, five to 10 maybe."
01:20:58,620;01:20:59,620;"We're my life."
01:20:59,620;01:21:01,420;"We're my life."
01:21:01,420;01:21:02,060;"Once a month."
01:21:02,060;01:21:05,380;"Jesus."
01:21:05,380;01:21:06,820;"Yeah, no, it never happened to me."
01:21:06,820;01:21:09,940;"I guess we could put a poll out on our social media"
01:21:09,940;01:21:12,300;"and find out how many people have forgotten to piss"
01:21:12,300;01:21:13,700;"all their shit."
01:21:13,700;01:21:14,860;"I don't know if I want that poll."
01:21:14,860;01:21:16,060;"So those are all the last but yeah."
01:21:16,060;01:21:17,500;"Everyone I have asked."
01:21:17,500;01:21:21,500;"You ever pitched your dick off on the front of the toilet like a shitting and forgotten?"
01:21:21,500;01:21:22,500;"Oh, God."
01:21:22,500;01:21:25,600;"Everyone I've said the same reaction."
01:21:25,600;01:21:27,400;"So I think I'm in the minority."
01:21:27,400;01:21:28,900;"I think you might be."
01:21:28,900;01:21:34,160;"The closest I've got is I will sit there for too long and cut off circulation to my legs"
01:21:34,160;01:21:35,500;"and I can't stand up anymore."
01:21:35,500;01:21:36,500;"Oh, yeah."
01:21:36,500;01:21:38,660;"We have a picture of Greg with that."
01:21:38,660;01:21:39,660;"Yeah."
01:21:39,660;01:21:40,660;"Oh, that's right."
01:21:40,660;01:21:42,220;"Because he falls asleep on the toilet."
01:21:42,220;01:21:43,220;"Yeah."
01:21:43,220;01:21:45,900;"The biggest red ring around your ass all the time."
01:21:45,900;01:21:46,900;"Yeah, that was funny."
01:21:46,900;01:21:53,620;"How long have you thought was the fact that you posted that into the Brown family chat? I did that it"
01:21:53,620;01:21:58,500;"Oh, yeah, I think Kelly did whoa. No, I think it was Greg. Mom. I'm pretty sure it's Kelly"
01:21:58,500;01:22:01,460;"That's brutal. Oh"
01:22:01,460;01:22:08,780;"Everyone's in that photograph. Yeah, I'm surprised not in the family calendar. It's a man. I actually printed it out and posted it up"
01:22:08,780;01:22:11,460;"around"
01:22:11,460;01:22:16,300;"My town just put on polls and said, you know, have you seen this this these cheeks?"
01:22:16,300;01:22:18,660;"They're not missing. I just wanted you to see them."
01:22:18,660;01:22:23,380;"So let's just give our listeners some context here."
01:22:23,380;01:22:28,180;"We were out drinking in Boston, staying at like a hotel."
01:22:28,180;01:22:33,860;"And I left early because I was like, two bamboos old."
01:22:33,860;01:22:39,460;"So I went back to the hotel by myself, got into the bathroom,"
01:22:39,460;01:22:42,540;"was on the toilet in the bathroom."
01:22:42,540;01:22:47,540;"And I think what happened was I was marijuana again."
01:22:47,540;01:22:51,260;"Unbelievable, but it's a good thing."
01:22:51,260;01:22:54,340;"One of the guys who was staying in the same hotel room"
01:22:54,340;01:22:55,660;"came back like an hour later"
01:22:55,660;01:22:58,580;"and I was still sitting there with my pants and my ankles"
01:22:58,580;01:23:00,180;"with like a bowl in my hand."
01:23:00,180;01:23:06,700;"So he like grabbed me and like dragged me to the bed"
01:23:06,700;01:23:08,580;"and like threw me face down."
01:23:08,580;01:23:11,380;"And then there was a picture with like my pants"
01:23:11,380;01:23:18,060;"on my ankles of just my butt cheeks for this huge red circle for the toilet seat because"
01:23:18,060;01:23:23,900;"I hadn't put the seat down at the rim."
01:23:23,900;01:23:31,740;"Oh, one picture of like me sitting on the toilet and you can see the seats not down."
01:23:31,740;01:23:33,300;"Oh my God."
01:23:33,300;01:23:35,940;"Nice on the rim, bro."
01:23:35,940;01:23:37,700;"That's even worse."
01:23:37,700;01:23:38,700;"Hang on."
01:23:38,700;01:23:45,900;"on so so back in your other story for getting to pee is that is the rim down on that one is the"
01:23:45,900;01:23:53,820;"seat down in those three days it is I think that's my problem yeah maybe you should just not"
01:23:53,820;01:23:59,340;"straight and see let's just raw dog it from here in here on here on out you should just squat every"
01:23:59,340;01:24:07,740;"time problem solve yeah I think there is something to squat him I'm not gonna rule it out uh"
01:24:07,740;01:24:09,540;"Uh, all right."
01:24:09,540;01:24:14,340;"Speaking of, um, coil turds, you guys want to do your best and worst?"
01:24:14,340;01:24:18,140;"Oh, you know, we haven't done speaking of coil turds."
01:24:18,140;01:24:19,380;"Um,"
01:24:19,380;01:24:20,460;"trophy thing, right?"
01:24:20,460;01:24:23,180;"Yeah, we haven't, we haven't given this game a watchability score."
01:24:23,180;01:24:27,020;"It's a little I think we'll start with Greg because, um,"
01:24:27,020;01:24:31,740;"that way you can get the watchability score of the highlights of this game."
01:24:31,740;01:24:37,660;"Well, the highlights are worth watching, I think the uniform or unique"
01:24:37,660;01:24:38,940;"- Cool, cool."
01:24:38,940;01:24:41,100;"The prime time is on."
01:24:41,100;01:24:42,660;"- Well, you have to keep you interesting."
01:24:42,660;01:24:45,500;"- Yeah, the prime time is on YouTube, so."
01:24:45,500;01:24:47,700;"- True Chris Perham in classic."
01:24:47,700;01:24:49,580;"- Yeah, that's what I'm saying."
01:24:49,580;01:24:53,540;"- I think I'm gonna bow out of these ratings"
01:24:53,540;01:24:56,020;"even that I don't watch the games."
01:24:56,020;01:24:57,740;"(laughing)"
01:24:57,740;01:24:59,380;"- I give us a watchability of the highlights"
01:24:59,380;01:25:01,340;"'cause they're always like four Lombardi's."
01:25:01,340;01:25:02,660;"Some are like six though."
01:25:02,660;01:25:04,980;"Let me tell you how long they are too."
01:25:04,980;01:25:05,820;"- Yeah, I mean."
01:25:05,820;01:25:07,180;"- Longer the highlight, the better."
01:25:07,180;01:25:09,780;"Yeah, it was a pretty good highlight, I guess."
01:25:09,780;01:25:12,380;"Four?"
01:25:12,380;01:25:13,260;"What are we out of six?"
01:25:13,260;01:25:14,740;"(laughs)"
01:25:14,740;01:25:16,820;"Just let me not do these ones."
01:25:16,820;01:25:18,900;"(laughs)"
01:25:18,900;01:25:22,580;"You're setting much better when you do it."
01:25:22,580;01:25:25,060;"A little bit of you struggle throws."
01:25:25,060;01:25:26,060;"All right, fine."
01:25:26,060;01:25:28,380;"From here on out, Andy, I'm just gonna give you"
01:25:28,380;01:25:29,460;"one word answers."
01:25:29,460;01:25:30,300;"Four."
01:25:30,300;01:25:31,140;"Okay, great."
01:25:31,140;01:25:32,220;"That's all I need."
01:25:32,220;01:25:33,060;"Four."
01:25:33,060;01:25:33,900;"Okay, that's pretty high."
01:25:33,900;01:25:35,900;"Steve, what would you give this?"
01:25:35,900;01:25:39,260;"Ooh, uh, like a two."
01:25:39,260;01:25:40,700;"- Yeah, that's where I was having."
01:25:40,700;01:25:43,580;"- Some novelty to it, but honestly,"
01:25:43,580;01:25:45,500;"the Patriots are so sloppy, you know,"
01:25:45,500;01:25:50,500;"it's just a blow out after that fumble screen pass."
01:25:50,500;01:25:54,660;"And then it just went, it just snowballed"
01:25:54,660;01:25:56,500;"and was frustrating."
01:25:56,500;01:25:59,020;"- Yeah, anytime the Patriots are down"
01:25:59,020;01:26:02,220;"and it's garbage time, which I feel doesn't happen often."
01:26:02,220;01:26:03,700;"Like even these other losses,"
01:26:03,700;01:26:05,500;"they've still been in it at the end."
01:26:05,500;01:26:10,220;"this one was like it's 20 to 3 and there's no chance they're coming back. It's in the rain."
01:26:10,220;01:26:15,500;"The like Greg said the uniforms were nice with the blues and everything and there was a couple of"
01:26:15,500;01:26:21,100;"good plays there but I think two is probably about as generous as you can get when you lose the"
01:26:21,100;01:26:27,020;"turnover battle four to nothing and you commit 12 penalties for 126 yards."
01:26:27,020;01:26:34,620;"Yeah. Yeah I mean we could do best and worse. Does anybody have a best?"
01:26:34,620;01:26:39,740;"I've already done them all in the play of the game maybe I've used all my notes"
01:26:39,740;01:26:43,340;"Help three of them"
01:26:43,340;01:26:47,380;"I come on. I had some good breath for our stats in there. That's true"
01:26:47,380;01:26:50,740;"I"
01:26:50,740;01:26:52,460;"Have some worse"
01:26:52,460;01:26:54,900;"Aaron Sharper"
01:26:54,900;01:26:58,620;"Well, then Kelly"
01:26:59,700;01:27:04,420;"The Patriots red zone defense they so to show to stat last season"
01:27:04,420;01:27:11,100;"The touchdown percentage the Patriots allowed a touchdown 39% of red zone"
01:27:11,100;01:27:16,580;"Appearances by the other teams offense, which was good for third in the NFL"
01:27:16,580;01:27:20,540;"This season they've allowed a touchdown 79%"
01:27:20,540;01:27:26,780;"Wow teams which is good for 31st red zone TD percentage is"
01:27:27,980;01:27:29,980;"Statistically random year to year though, right?"
01:27:29,980;01:27:36,140;"Is it yeah, I don't know how do you how do you quantify it being statistically random?"
01:27:36,140;01:27:40,140;"That dude Bill Barnwell any ESPN is all about that"
01:27:40,140;01:27:47,380;"What makes it I can see that just yeah like a good red zone defense last year does not predict a good"
01:27:47,380;01:27:52,660;"Red zone defense this year. I mean you're gonna be good next year either. Yeah, see what you're saying"
01:27:52,660;01:27:55,580;"Yeah, I mean I think if you're a decent run"
01:27:56,380;01:28:01,100;"defending team, you probably have a slightly, I want to have that correlates with having"
01:28:01,100;01:28:02,660;"a better red zone defense."
01:28:02,660;01:28:05,920;"Was it one of the pastries over storylines?"
01:28:05,920;01:28:08,580;"Yeah, we'll have to write that down Greg."
01:28:08,580;01:28:15,380;"If you have mom, we'll what's the p-value on statistical correlation year to year."
01:28:15,380;01:28:21,300;"Yeah, for or is there a correlation between run defense and red zone defense?"
01:28:21,300;01:28:24,820;"All right, because the last four"
01:28:24,820;01:28:27,220;"Russia's the Patriots have faced"
01:28:27,220;01:28:29,460;"week three, Priest Holmes ran for 180 yards."
01:28:29,460;01:28:32,420;"Week four, LT ran for 217."
01:28:32,420;01:28:34,620;"Week five, Ricky Williams ran for 105."
01:28:34,620;01:28:37,140;"And this week, I'm on Green ran for 120."
01:28:37,140;01:28:39,820;"- So stuff."
01:28:39,820;01:28:43,540;"- That's not gonna correlate into a good defense in any phase."
01:28:43,540;01:28:45,260;"- No."
01:28:45,260;01:28:50,140;"- And on the other side of the ball, Tom Brady has performed"
01:28:50,140;01:28:55,420;"probably just as bad. In his first 14 quarters, he had 11 touchdowns, 200"
01:28:55,420;01:28:59,820;"exceptions. His last nine quarters, he's had two touchdowns and seven"
01:28:59,820;01:29:04,900;"interceptions. And his completion presenters dropped from 70% to under"
01:29:04,900;01:29:14,060;"60, 58 and he sucks. But the worst in this game, they showed a sign."
01:29:14,060;01:29:18,220;"This is had to be in garbage time. Somebody must have been a pack of"
01:29:18,220;01:29:21,940;"fan and he came from Green Bay. And a big old picture of Brett"
01:29:21,940;01:29:25,060;"Favre on it. And the sign says you've just been farved."
01:29:25,060;01:29:32,860;"Oh, and Greg's boy Chris Collinsworth decided with the yellow"
01:29:32,860;01:29:38,940;"markup thing that they do to cross out the R because we're in"
01:29:38,940;01:29:40,220;"New England. So it's five."
01:29:40,220;01:29:48,100;"I like the answer. Do you think he put that on the caption of his"
01:29:48,140;01:29:51,260;"dick pick to Jen Sturger and like you've just been far."
01:29:51,260;01:29:52,980;"You've just been farmed."
01:29:52,980;01:29:57,660;"No, that should be the name of the 30 for 30."
01:29:57,660;01:30:03,060;"Is in his name the most like inferior infuriating spelling ever?"
01:30:03,060;01:30:04,060;"That's what I mean."
01:30:04,060;01:30:04,700;"Haveray."
01:30:04,700;01:30:05,020;"Yeah."
01:30:05,020;01:30:05,460;"Person."
01:30:05,460;01:30:05,860;"Farmed."
01:30:05,860;01:30:07,940;"It has to be a typo, right?"
01:30:07,940;01:30:10,860;"Like somewhere along the line on a birth certificate, it was a typo."
01:30:10,860;01:30:11,700;"Oh, yeah."
01:30:11,700;01:30:14,300;"Like when it's family came over and they were like Staten Island."
01:30:14,300;01:30:14,860;"Yeah."
01:30:14,860;01:30:15,460;"Like farmed."
01:30:15,460;01:30:15,860;"Yeah, sure."
01:30:15,860;01:30:17,380;"I'll fuck it and just like throw something down."
01:30:17,380;01:30:25,040;"Because if I got here five like some some you can be like alright. Yeah, like you double hat and you know pronunciation"
01:30:25,040;01:30:27,040;"But there's no way you pronounce"
01:30:27,040;01:30:29,600;"F A V re as far"
01:30:29,600;01:30:35,640;"Right does it doesn't make any sense the R sounds become comes before the V sound"
01:30:35,640;01:30:39,120;"It drives me crazy"
01:30:39,120;01:30:44,920;"It actually like did I watched the football life breath our and when they announced him"
01:30:45,800;01:30:49,760;"When you got drafted they pronounce his name wrong they were like Brett favor"
01:30:49,760;01:30:59,260;"I think at some point you just got to fix it, you know"
01:30:59,260;01:31:05,520;"Right my best is Troy Brown's back catching balls. Yeah"
01:31:05,520;01:31:10,720;"My worst is frying Kelly's in defending balls"
01:31:11,280;01:31:19,380;"That's fair now Brown there is the last name I can get behind. Oh, of course"
01:31:19,380;01:31:27,080;"How you spell it? You ever had anybody fuck your name up yes? Oh, I've had people ask how to spell it yeah"
01:31:27,080;01:31:31,980;"But I don't like the color, you know, oh the other thing. Here's my"
01:31:34,840;01:31:37,160;"Have you ever oh there's a double-sided?"
01:31:37,160;01:31:42,880;"Coin here right cuz sometimes of the bar you'll get drinks put on your tab that aren't your drinks and"
01:31:42,880;01:31:49,080;"Trying to argue that in a bar at like two in the morning when you're drunk. It's really hard like no"
01:31:49,080;01:31:55,380;"I don't drink that. I don't drink Jack and coke. You see dude. They're on your nose. You know the brown in here"
01:31:55,380;01:31:58,480;"I just leave bars"
01:32:00,760;01:32:04,760;"Just collect all the browns on the whatever browns are flowing out come to you."
01:32:04,760;01:32:08,320;"I just say, hey, you guys figured this all out."
01:32:08,320;01:32:13,720;"I go to my car show up and they go, what's with you tab,"
01:32:13,720;01:32:17,960;"Bunder and say Brown, like the color and look at me like, yeah, no shit."
01:32:17,960;01:32:20,440;"But I say that every single time."
01:32:20,440;01:32:23,480;"So like, yeah, that's the dumbass who says Brown, like the color."
01:32:23,480;01:32:27,480;"I've always wondered how like what's stopping people from just like putting it"
01:32:27,480;01:32:28,400;"under a different tab."
01:32:28,400;01:32:29,120;"There's nothing."
01:32:29,640;01:32:30,140;"Right."
01:32:30,140;01:32:34,640;"They make a Smith, which Smith, John."
01:32:34,640;01:32:36,440;"Well, you just overhear someone at the bar"
01:32:36,440;01:32:38,600;"putting saying their name and he just used their--"
01:32:38,600;01:32:39,600;"so the rest of the night."
01:32:39,600;01:32:40,100;"Yeah."
01:32:40,100;01:32:41,600;"It happens."
01:32:41,600;01:32:43,840;"And I wouldn't do it because I'm a--"
01:32:43,840;01:32:44,440;"A Brown."
01:32:44,440;01:32:47,640;"And we are virtually upstanding citizens like Troy."
01:32:47,640;01:32:48,640;"Yeah."
01:32:48,640;01:32:50,520;"Yeah, we have a name to protect."
01:32:50,520;01:32:51,020;"Mm-hmm."
01:32:51,020;01:32:53,200;"Troy, if you're listening, we'd never let you down."
01:32:53,200;01:32:58,760;"All right, my best in this game was the banter between the three."
01:32:58,760;01:33:00,840;"Well, actually, it was more, more columns worth in Eggman."
01:33:00,840;01:33:06,280;"They were explaining how Eggman was a good wet ball thrower."
01:33:06,280;01:33:08,880;"And there's a bad wet ball thrower."
01:33:08,880;01:33:09,960;"Oh, right."
01:33:09,960;01:33:10,320;"You're right."
01:33:10,320;01:33:13,000;"And columns were because he didn't grip the laces and columns worth."
01:33:13,000;01:33:16,160;"Quote was you're one of the great wet ball throwers, even though he wasn't."
01:33:16,160;01:33:18,440;"I feel like they secretly hated each other."
01:33:18,440;01:33:23,840;"It felt that way because then Eggman was relentless about columns worth hair to"
01:33:23,840;01:33:25,240;"the point where columns were like."
01:33:26,520;01:33:30,080;"Definitely got self conscious about it and kept bringing it up about how he had fixed his hair."
01:33:30,080;01:33:32,160;"It was a little awkward in that booth for a bit."
01:33:32,160;01:33:35,340;"Yeah, that dick was like, why don't I get myself into?"
01:33:35,340;01:33:37,080;"How does Joe Buck do this?"
01:33:37,080;01:33:39,380;"And Joe Box like, I don't have any feelings."
01:33:39,380;01:33:39,920;"So I'm good."
01:33:39,920;01:33:42,920;"Steve Brad."
01:33:42,920;01:33:48,840;"I feel I have to say, I feel like Steve Brad has come into his own in season two of this podcast."
01:33:48,840;01:33:55,560;"And they would just put more beers into it, you know, more effort drinking move our hand."
01:33:55,920;01:33:59,000;"Yeah, as it should be. Yeah. You weren't before."
01:33:59,000;01:34:02,360;"We're in that lineup episode, you know."

01:34:09,320;01:34:15,360;"Don't ruin it. Next week, the Patriots still at home hosting the Denver Broncos."
01:34:15,360;01:34:16,960;"I don't have a lot of high hopes."

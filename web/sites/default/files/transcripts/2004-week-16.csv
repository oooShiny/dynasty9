00:08,160;00:12,360;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,360;00:14,200;"they're just being stupid."
00:14,200;00:15,440;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,440;00:16,440;"Go right ahead."
00:16,440;00:18,640;"I am not your mother."

01:00,480;01:01,280;"Muscle's shared."
01:01,280;01:02,400;"Yeah."

01:03,440;01:05,520;"Yeah, Mr. Pushup."

01:08,960;01:13,840;"Even through COVID, you boy getting his pushups going."
01:13,840;01:14,160;"Okay."

01:19,360;01:21,120;"yeah, no, I had COVID."
01:21,120;01:23,360;"Oh, oh, that's that's badass, right?"
01:23,360;01:24,320;"I'm recovering."
01:24,320;01:25,840;"Pushups while you had COVID."
01:25,840;01:28,480;"Wow, you're a true inspiration, Greg."
01:28,480;01:32,440;"Dude, I'm like Goggins or whatever that dude's name is."
01:32,440;01:34,920;"You're like ICU nurses right now."
01:34,920;01:35,920;"Yeah."
01:35,920;01:38,240;"But he's like that cat hanging from the branch."
01:38,240;01:39,880;"Yeah, we're stuck."
01:39,880;01:45,280;"I wake up at like 4 a.m. and I do like an hour of meditation in yoga."
01:45,280;01:52,920;"And then I read 50 pages of my book before I start my day, you know, having a nice healthy"
01:52,920;01:55,920;"breakfast of chia seeds and herbal tea."
01:55,920;01:57,920;"Yeah herbal tea."
01:57,920;02:02,920;"That sounds like a nice day."
02:02,920;02:04,920;"Have you guys got COVID yet?"
02:04,920;02:06,920;"Yeah, remember?"
02:06,920;02:07,920;"Yeah, recently."
02:07,920;02:09,920;"No, not recently. Christmas time."
02:09,920;02:10,920;"Christmas time. Yeah."
02:10,920;02:11,920;"Oh, yeah."
02:11,920;02:12,920;"When everybody got it."
02:12,920;02:13,920;"Hey, everybody got it."
02:13,920;02:14,920;"Yep."
02:14,920;02:15,920;"It's rearing its ugly head."
02:15,920;02:17,920;"Well, you didn't get it then."
02:17,920;02:18,920;"I got it."
02:18,920;02:19,920;"Christmas time?"
02:19,920;02:20,920;"Oh, no."
02:20,920;02:26,400;"This is my first go-through, but everybody at works getting it their cancel and shit left in right Wow"
02:26,400;02:28,800;"Yeah"
02:28,800;02:32,320;"Yeah, it seems like it's it's making its way around again"
02:32,320;02:38,320;"Can we go back very anti-soon to that nickname you start you said at the beginning Andy we easy f baby"
02:38,320;02:39,640;"Yeah"
02:39,640;02:44,900;"What did you call yourself breezy f baby Craig if you don't say the baby don't say it at all"
02:44,900;02:48,200;"I remember you specifically calling yourself this for a while"
02:49,960;02:56,700;"That's my little wayne's calm self. Yeah, I know oh yeah, but that's what you were also calling yourself right I"
02:56,700;03:02,180;"Know I don't give myself nicknames, but I was called that yes"
03:02,180;03:07,680;"Was called that yes by myself"
03:07,680;03:10,880;"Oh by my fans"
03:10,880;03:15,360;"Yeah, you I'm always they're all saying the same thing, you know, I'm an influencer"
03:15,360;03:18,920;"Like Goggins your man"
03:18,920;03:20,320;"- Yeah."
03:20,320;03:24,580;"- All right, well, where are we in history?"
03:24,580;03:26,960;"- Two thousand weeks."
03:26,960;03:29,360;"- Four weeks, 16, right after Christmas."
03:29,360;03:31,440;"- Hey, after Christmas, Merry Christmas guys."
03:31,440;03:32,920;"Merry Christmas."
03:32,920;03:35,440;"If you had to guess what you got on Christmas 2004,"
03:35,440;03:36,360;"what do you think you got?"
03:36,360;03:38,360;"- A little bit of a question."
03:38,360;03:42,800;"I would say a 30 rack of some sort of soda."
03:42,800;03:44,440;"- Oh yeah, that's a good one."
03:44,440;03:46,920;"- A large box of sugary cereal."
03:46,920;03:51,640;"Mm-hmm and some sort of patrons paraphernalia. Yeah"
03:51,640;03:54,480;"Yeah, I forgot something Patriots"
03:54,480;03:57,080;"2004"
03:57,080;04:01,760;"That was right when we moved into the new house. Yeah, because they were in the new house yet in the new house. Yeah"
04:01,760;04:08,920;"Because I remember the first Christmas in the new house. I got one little like iPod minis. It's definitely new house. No"
04:08,920;04:16,600;"Yeah, I write it was 94 definitely new house. No, yeah, no definitely. We'll see. I watched all the super old in the house for sure"
04:16,600;04:19,800;"That's true. That's a lot by a decade. It's not a big deal."
04:19,800;04:23,400;"Yeah, I have a point still saying that's probably so what I got for Christmas."
04:23,400;04:25,200;"Price."
04:25,200;04:26,000;"So that's not a two."
04:26,000;04:32,600;"No, yeah, case of soda in a box of sugary cereal, because we were not either of those in our normal day to day."
04:32,600;04:34,600;"Because mom was a health nut."
04:34,600;04:35,720;"Yeah, it's been horrible."
04:35,720;04:38,880;"Just starting to get suspicious that Santa wasn't real."
04:38,880;04:40,920;"You know, 14, 15."
04:40,920;04:44,920;"Early high school."
04:44,920;04:45,760;"You know, yeah."
04:45,760;04:48,240;"Wait a second. Some of these things aren't adding up."
04:48,240;04:51,120;"I'm wearing those kids in the school bus for a while."
04:51,120;04:55,920;"Explain the Jews to me."
04:55,920;05:06,160;"You know, we did get for Christmas that year though, kicking the shut of the jets."
05:06,160;05:07,200;"That's right."
05:07,200;05:08,480;"They kicked the shut of them in this game."
05:08,480;05:10,400;"Yeah. Pretty good jets too."
05:10,400;05:12,720;"Yeah. In theory."
05:12,720;05:16,240;"So there was some talk about that in the media"
05:16,240;05:22,340;"because the New York media as they are want to do"
05:22,340;05:24,400;"have been critical of the jets"
05:24,400;05:27,480;"for their inability to beat quality opponents apparently."
05:27,480;05:32,120;"And so Chad Pennington of course,"
05:32,120;05:34,080;"you know, the leader of the locker room"
05:34,080;05:36,120;"and also Kevin Mulay,"
05:36,120;05:38,520;"who had a super dirty hit in this game,"
05:38,520;05:39,880;"but we'll get to that later."
05:41,280;05:43,280;"were sharp in response to media criticism,"
05:43,280;05:45,760;"the two of them said, ""My wife, following the Jets"
05:45,760;05:47,780;"""went over Houston referencing New York's earlier"
05:47,780;05:49,280;"""to feed of the Chargers."""
05:49,280;05:51,480;"San Diego is nine and three, we're nine and three."
05:51,480;05:53,460;"San is San Diego, not a good team,"
05:53,460;05:57,680;"which you know, it makes sense because they had--"
05:57,680;05:58,680;"- A lot."
05:58,680;06:00,440;"- Yeah, so they beat the Chargers,"
06:00,440;06:03,360;"but they had also lost to the Steelers"
06:03,360;06:05,280;"who are fucking wagon this year."
06:05,280;06:06,520;"So everybody's losing the steals,"
06:06,520;06:08,080;"including these Patriots, right?"
06:09,560;06:11,520;"but there was still that whole chatter about,"
06:11,520;06:13,760;"you know, the Jets can't beat a good team."
06:13,760;06:15,740;"And so,"
06:15,740;06:19,680;"Chad Pennington coming back from a"
06:19,680;06:24,080;"- Rotator injury to his rotator cuff, I think they said."
06:24,080;06:25,400;"- And so they said."
06:25,400;06:27,680;"- He had his own little spat with the media"
06:27,680;06:30,920;"because the week before this, they played Seattle."
06:30,920;06:33,000;"And I think it was his first game back, maybe something like that."
06:33,000;06:34,200;"- It was."
06:34,200;06:36,480;"- And so he,"
06:36,480;06:37,920;"he'd been getting a whole bunch of flack"
06:37,920;06:41,800;"about not playing well before the injury or during the injury or because of the injury or whatever."
06:41,800;06:46,960;"And came out in that game through three touchdowns, no interceptions."
06:46,960;06:50,120;"They beat the pants off the Seahawks."
06:50,120;06:54,400;"And then he decided he wasn't going to talk to the media after a win."
06:54,400;06:59,360;"And then had like a whole, a whole bunch of like during the week, a whole bunch of like"
06:59,360;07:05,000;"back and forth with the media base being like, it's, it's an honor for you guys to be covering"
07:05,000;07:07,160;"such elite athletes and all sorts of like."
07:07,360;07:08,800;"I like to respect that."
07:08,800;07:09,640;"Yeah, yeah."
07:09,640;07:10,960;"We're on team chat right now."
07:10,960;07:12,040;"Yeah, absolutely."
07:12,040;07:13,200;"You're fucked."
07:13,200;07:13,960;"Yeah."
07:13,960;07:15,320;"You make meters soft, dude."
07:15,320;07:16,600;"Oh, you don't want to talk to me?"
07:16,600;07:18,040;"I'm just going to slander you, bro."
07:18,040;07:19,760;"And then, you know, he's like--"
07:19,760;07:20,120;"Right."
07:20,120;07:21,040;"And it comes out."
07:21,040;07:22,200;"He's like, you know, what do you say?"
07:22,200;07:23,760;"Here's the quote I have."
07:23,760;07:25,760;"""Life is all about inconvenience."
07:25,760;07:28,240;"And as athletes, we face inconvenience a lot of the time,"
07:28,240;07:29,160;"especially when we lose."
07:29,160;07:31,560;"So I thought, how appropriate to have a big win"
07:31,560;07:34,240;"and create a little inconvenience for you reporters."
07:34,240;07:34,960;"That's what I did."
07:34,960;07:35,920;"And it was out of fun."
07:35,920;07:36,760;"It was out of jest."
07:36,760;07:39,000;"It wasn't out of malice or being mad or anything like that,"
07:39,000;07:40,800;"but obviously it created a commotion."
07:40,800;07:42,640;"- In New York?"
07:42,640;07:43,480;"- No."
07:43,480;07:44,480;"(laughing)"
07:44,480;07:45,680;"- Yeah, it's true."
07:45,680;07:49,240;"- Which full respect for him for doing that."
07:49,240;07:55,920;"Sadly, it was short lived because he would then come out"
07:55,920;08:00,120;"in this game and not play particularly well."
08:00,120;08:01,480;"- He played terrible."
08:01,480;08:05,320;"- One touchdown, two interceptions, three sacks."
08:05,320;08:07,280;"Not agree."
08:07,280;08:09,560;"Like 200 yards, he was like struggling."
08:09,560;08:10,560;"252."
08:10,560;08:14,840;"But most of those came in garbage time, I think, at the end there."
08:14,840;08:19,280;"Even their touchdown, Scarvish time was saying Tana Moss and Earthwood and Moreland."
08:19,280;08:20,840;"So that's the real problem."
08:20,840;08:29,000;"This secondary is still a bunch of foregrounds, rookies, and just the drags of Patriots corner"
08:29,000;08:30,000;"back."
08:30,000;08:34,120;"So I remember, you know, all that talk about, you know, they were super beat up and they"
08:34,120;08:40,120;"still like drag their team to the playoffs. I completely forgotten about Don Davis, though,"
08:40,120;08:46,200;"who has showed up a few times recently as the linebacker who was converted to play safety"
08:46,200;08:50,280;"and is now like Eugene Wilson went down halfway through this game. So he's like starting"
08:50,280;08:59,000;"in safety at this point, wearing number 51, looking like basically Geron Mayo. He's not a small dude,"
08:59,000;09:02,520;"He's not like a undersized blind back of my knees looks of it"
09:02,520;09:06,680;"But out there playing faith he almost has a pick"
09:06,680;09:13,080;"Eugene does get a pick in this game, right? Yeah, he does eventually come back and he gets a pick. Yeah"
09:13,080;09:18,760;"And they also there was one play to they picked up where Troy Brown still playing slot receiver"
09:18,760;09:23,160;"but well slot receiver and also slot corner back like nickel corner and"
09:23,160;09:27,560;"There was one play that they sent him in on a blitz. Yeah"
09:27,560;09:32,760;"I saw that. He's not, he's not even just like playing cover quarter. He's out there blitzing."
09:32,760;09:38,680;"They showed his stats. He had like 15 tackles, three interceptions on the season so far."
09:38,680;09:43,800;"Five passes defense too. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like playing like a legitimate nickel corner."
09:43,800;09:47,160;"Yeah. Is it lead these type of team interceptions or something like that?"
09:47,160;09:50,200;"Yeah. Yeah. Amazing. Any place."
09:50,200;09:51,880;"Belichick's got Troy Brown or Earthwood,"
09:51,880;09:54,480;"and then all of a sudden they've got to play both of them."
09:54,480;09:56,520;"- Right, yeah, yeah, exactly."
09:56,520;09:57,720;"- The secondary, so trash."
09:57,720;09:59,560;"It's kind of a pankton."
09:59,560;10:01,840;"You know, I'm gonna talk shit, you gotta back it up."
10:01,840;10:03,520;"And he comes out and says secondary."
10:03,520;10:06,280;"But they did shut down Curtis Martin pretty good, right?"
10:06,280;10:07,120;"- They did, yeah."
10:07,120;10:10,240;"He was the league leader in rushing"
10:10,240;10:12,920;"coming into this game and they held him to"
10:12,920;10:14,320;"like some real small amount."
10:14,320;10:15,800;"He was like 33 yards, I think."
10:15,800;10:16,640;"- Yeah, exactly."
10:16,640;10:17,800;"- Yeah."
10:17,800;10:18,640;"On 13 carries."
10:18,640;10:21,120;"- That's 18 for 46 yards."
10:21,120;10:21,800;"Yeah."
10:21,800;10:23,160;"So I mean, in Bennington's defense,"
10:23,160;10:26,000;"he was just having to sling it a shitload."
10:26,000;10:28,140;"Yeah, but I mean, he also wasn't even"
10:28,140;10:29,040;"slinging a shitload."
10:29,040;10:32,280;"It was just like he was 22 or 36."
10:32,280;10:35,040;"And Brady was 21 to 32."
10:35,040;10:37,840;"It was just the Patriots went on such long sustained drives"
10:37,840;10:42,520;"that there was no time for the Jets to really do anything."
10:42,520;10:44,920;"I mean, he's actually the best season"
10:44,920;10:46,440;"of Curtis Martin's career."
10:46,440;10:46,800;"Yeah."
10:46,800;10:48,520;"Yeah, he actually broke his--"
10:48,520;10:49,400;"Brady."
10:49,400;10:55,660;"He broke his Jets record in this game for most rushing errors and then had another game to go on the season."
10:55,660;10:59,120;"Corey Dillon broke the Patriots franchise record."
10:59,120;10:59,720;"Exactly."
10:59,720;10:59,920;"Yeah."
10:59,920;11:01,100;"Well, yeah."
11:01,100;11:06,320;"So it sort of occurred as Martin, but it was set by him last year in 2003."
11:06,320;11:09,240;"But yeah, neither have great games."
11:09,240;11:16,080;"Dillon had 29 for 89, but this Jets team, this Jets defense was like, uh, it's about a status."
11:16,080;11:22,520;"they come. They had allowed 200 yard games running back this season. One was to Corey"
11:22,520;11:30,200;"Dillon the first time they met. The other one was to, um, I've got who's the bills running"
11:30,200;11:35,700;"back this year. McGay heat. I think it was McGay. Yeah. I think it's injured. Travis."
11:35,700;11:42,720;"Travis Henry. He's the best. No, I don't think it's Travis. I think it was McGay. The fertile"
11:42,720;11:53,280;"crescent. Big hen. There's no John Abraham in this game either. Correct. He was a beast."
11:53,280;11:57,360;"Yeah, it didn't seem to matter like this was a this was a defensive struggle as most of"
11:57,360;12:04,320;"the games against her members team were like the pages went 9 and 2 against her."
12:04,320;12:11,840;"But the average score was 20 to 13. Pat's the low scoring game less than the touchdown."
12:11,840;12:13,280;"I've already figured them out at the end there though."
12:13,280;12:15,040;"Eventually yeah."
12:15,040;12:17,520;"Kind of in that like late second half."
12:17,520;12:25,520;"Yeah the Patriots have already lost their two games to her med words"
12:25,520;12:30,320;"in this podcast for the last this podcast."
12:30,320;12:33,440;"We will not see a loss to her med words again."
12:33,440;12:35,760;"That's excellent. Every time we stop there you can just"
12:35,760;12:36,880;"chalk it up as a W."
12:36,880;12:38,160;"That is correct."
12:38,160;12:39,120;"Pencil it in baby."
12:40,080;12:42,080;"No, he is from the market."
12:42,080;12:44,080;"Yeah, you probably could actually."
12:44,080;12:44,880;"Yeah, because it's history."
12:44,880;12:48,720;"Some other coaches on this jets team."
12:48,720;12:53,680;"Not many you would think, you know, with how good they were on defense."
12:53,680;12:55,920;"You might have some like names come out of it."
12:55,920;13:00,640;"But offensive line coaches Doug Morone, the bills and jags head coach."
13:00,640;13:05,920;"And then the linebackers coach was Bob Sutton."
13:05,920;13:06,640;"Do you remember him?"
13:08,560;13:15,200;"He was the absolutely hated defensive coordinator for the Chiefs in 2018."
13:15,200;13:22,480;"When they lost to the Pats in the AFC Championship game and their defense was atrocious, they"
13:22,480;13:27,440;"literally fired him after that game because of how bad the Chiefs were on defense apparently."
13:27,440;13:34,880;"It wasn't like the Gronk third down one, right? The third and 10 where they did like three of them."
13:34,880;13:40,320;"Yeah, yeah, that was one. Okay. Yeah. So that defense."
13:40,320;13:41,760;"There's element, by the way."
13:41,760;13:45,120;"Element had two of them, didn't he? You can bronch had one."
13:45,120;13:46,240;"Oh, that was a sweet one."
13:46,240;13:48,880;"I thought you were talking about the Gronk deflected interception."
13:48,880;13:52,400;"Take our call back for the off sides."
13:52,400;13:58,480;"Yeah. Yeah. It's bad coaching. You guys lining up off sides."
13:58,480;14:00,720;"I don't know about coaching. It's just a dumb ass player,"
14:00,720;14:02,360;"I'm gonna dumbass play."
14:02,360;14:04,400;"(laughing)"
14:04,400;14:06,440;"- We watched that game with mom at Greg's house."
14:06,440;14:08,120;"That was hilarious as well."
14:08,120;14:09,800;"- Oh yes, I've seen videos."
14:09,800;14:11,600;"- I couldn't really think what to watch either"
14:11,600;14:14,480;"the game or mom, 'cause they're both so entertaining."
14:14,480;14:17,600;"- Yeah, well, wasn't mom watching it from like your stairs?"
14:17,600;14:19,160;"- Yeah, in the living room."
14:19,160;14:21,080;"- Get like notching up stairs."
14:21,080;14:22,560;"'Cause we got more intense."
14:22,560;14:23,400;"- Yeah, I get it."
14:23,400;14:28,080;"We all have our things when it comes to watching."
14:28,080;14:30,200;"- I mean, Greg, we're twirling this shit out of our hair."
14:30,200;14:31,040;"- Yep."
14:31,040;14:32,080;"- Oh, you twirl your hair too?"
14:32,080;14:33,000;"- Oh, so bad."
14:33,000;14:34,920;"- I knew Greg was a big hair twirler."
14:34,920;14:36,360;"- Greg, like you get bald spots,"
14:36,360;14:38,360;"you do it so much sometimes, right?"
14:38,360;14:40,120;"- No, especially during like hockey season."
14:40,120;14:41,260;"- Bald spots, Steve."
14:41,260;14:43,840;"- That's what I've heard."
14:43,840;14:45,800;"- That sounded very defensive, Greg."
14:45,800;14:46,640;"- Right?"
14:46,640;14:48,000;"- Like I see you're wearing a hat right now."
14:48,000;14:50,320;"(laughing)"
14:50,320;14:51,920;"- My hair was falling out in college,"
14:51,920;14:55,400;"but that was just stress related that was not."
14:55,400;14:57,560;"- We're twirling a goddamn hair too, which I know."
14:57,560;14:58,840;"This is what we're saying."
14:58,840;15:00,440;"We're all on team Greg. Don't worry."
15:00,440;15:04,120;"I do have to trim my eyebrow hair so I don't pour all that."
15:04,120;15:06,640;"Oh, God. Yeah."
15:06,640;15:09,880;"You know, dad's got those crazy, bushy eyebrows."
15:09,880;15:11,520;"Yeah, I have this."
15:11,520;15:15,560;"Now my eyebrows are just fighting a war for the middle of my forehead."
15:15,560;15:19,200;"So I got a shave between them on a regular basis."
15:19,200;15:20,640;"You should go full uni, Andy."
15:20,640;15:21,720;"No, I can't do it."
15:21,720;15:22,240;"Why not?"
15:22,240;15:23,080;"I can't do it."
15:23,080;15:24,200;"Can't do it."
15:24,200;15:25,640;"It's cool now."
15:25,640;15:26,640;"No, it's not cool now."
15:26,640;15:28,120;"Yeah, it will never be cool."
15:28,440;15:29,840;"Tell us the Anthony Davis."
15:29,840;15:33,600;"I will also tell it to his"
15:33,600;15:34,280;"Tweet him."
15:34,280;15:34,920;"Caterpillar."
15:34,920;15:36,600;"We sure he'd no one else on Twitter"
15:36,600;15:37,520;"and start to tweet that to"
15:37,520;15:41,280;"Undoubtedly."
15:41,280;15:43,320;"It's like a trademark Andy starting a new"
15:43,320;15:44,600;"job. You got to come in and like"
15:44,600;15:46,200;"fire from the hip."
15:46,200;15:48,000;"Yeah. You know, get your name out there."
15:48,000;15:51,520;"So the brown guy, I'm not about to take"
15:51,520;15:54,720;"any sort of facial hair"
15:56,880;16:00,520;"Comments from from Greg Brown who showed you people love that"
16:00,520;16:05,720;"Yeah, I'm gonna work as a half-beard guy right exactly yeah"
16:05,720;16:12,860;"Gave a presentation to the sea level people with half a beard on your face. What's this thing is bad publicity Andy?"
16:12,860;16:17,920;"That's the that's what pettings do it. He's just during the pocket and the good publicity going yeah"
16:17,920;16:21,860;"By not speaking he knows it's gonna generate a lot more publicity than speaking"
16:22,520;16:23,920;"and you can click ""Yes."""
16:23,920;16:26,880;"The New York media has fallen right into this trap."
16:26,880;16:27,720;"- Sure."
16:27,720;16:29,840;"That sounds right."
16:29,840;16:31,400;"I kind of want the Jets to be good again"
16:31,400;16:34,360;"just so I can hear them like lose their minds, you know?"
16:34,360;16:35,360;"- Oh, I do not."
16:35,360;16:37,080;"It's the last thing I want."
16:37,080;16:37,920;"- I don't know."
16:37,920;16:41,000;"Sad Jets fans are just, they're fantastic."
16:41,000;16:43,440;"- They are, but there's also,"
16:43,440;16:45,060;"there's like levels of sadness"
16:45,060;16:47,520;"where low expectation sadness is one thing,"
16:47,520;16:51,280;"but high expectation sadness, that hits different, you know."
16:51,280;16:52,680;"- That is fair."
16:52,680;16:54,400;"- And I want to see some of that again."
16:54,400;16:56,140;"- Yeah, but you know what really hits hard"
16:56,140;17:01,140;"is like the just continual no expectations sadness."
17:01,140;17:03,520;"You know, that shit will fester."
17:03,520;17:05,000;"- Yeah, I think Steve has a point."
17:05,000;17:09,160;"- Out fans, Trevor, you know, that kid's very sad."
17:09,160;17:12,040;"- But they're so kind of like lovable about it"
17:12,040;17:14,480;"and there's something about the Jets that is just it's so--"
17:14,480;17:16,200;"- No one's feeling bad for them."
17:16,200;17:17,760;"- Well, I think it's just 'cause they have such"
17:17,760;17:20,360;"a complex about it too,"
17:20,360;17:22,760;"because they're New York City, you know?"
17:22,760;17:24,560;"They're New York, so they should be the best."
17:24,560;17:26,820;"They're the best city in the world."
17:26,820;17:28,360;"So there are football teams, you should be the best."
17:28,360;17:29,920;"And it just, because of the music."
17:29,920;17:31,320;"- You know, we are, it is, bro."
17:31,320;17:32,160;"- Exactly, yeah."
17:32,160;17:33,560;"- It's a shit-called team."
17:33,560;17:35,080;"- They should be the teams."
17:35,080;17:35,920;"Everything."
17:35,920;17:41,200;"- So I think there's just this extra piece of it"
17:41,200;17:42,200;"that's just so much better."
17:42,200;17:44,280;"- Yeah, he's been telling you how many rings they have."
17:44,280;17:45,120;"- Yeah."
17:45,120;17:45,960;"- Yeah."
17:45,960;17:47,080;"- From '47 rings, bro."
17:47,080;17:55,360;"one shot from pre 1916. Yeah. Good fucking Bernie Williams. Yeah. Oh, man."
17:55,360;18:01,080;"Here Dallas is trying to get a second NFL team. I saw that. Yeah,"
18:01,080;18:05,480;"that's just what they need. Hell yeah, dude. I think Jerry Jones would"
18:05,480;18:09,960;"focus on his own team. A little bit. Well, it wouldn't be him, right? It"
18:09,960;18:12,480;"would be. Why would you put two in Dallas? So that's the dumbest"
18:12,480;18:14,400;"shit ever. I don't know. Why would you put two in New York?"
18:14,480;18:16,480;"Put another one in Texas. There's a million cities."
18:16,480;18:18,480;"I think Dallas is pretty huge. That's probably why."
18:18,480;18:20,480;"Why don't I just put one in St. Louis?"
18:20,480;18:22,480;"Yeah."
18:22,480;18:25,480;"Give one to Canada."
18:25,480;18:28,480;"Give Buffalo to Canada. Give them to Toronto. Be fine."
18:28,480;18:31,480;"I think they might get upset about that."
18:31,480;18:32,480;"That's okay."
18:32,480;18:34,480;"I got to say, Bill's fans."
18:34,480;18:36,480;"They don't know what to do with themselves these days."
18:36,480;18:37,480;"They don't."
18:37,480;18:39,480;"They just don't know how to handle."
18:39,480;18:41,480;"It's fine. It's like the first time you get drunk."
18:41,480;18:45,760;"You know, you just like, wow, what is going on?"
18:45,760;18:49,320;"They haven't met the puke in stage yet, though."
18:49,320;18:50,000;"That's true."
18:50,000;18:50,280;"Yep."
18:50,280;18:53,440;"Well, you would think that the 13 seconds would have been kind of."
18:53,440;18:54,520;"That's a good point."
18:54,520;18:55,560;"I'll bring him back down."
18:55,560;18:55,880;"Yeah."
18:55,880;18:56,560;"Yeah."
18:56,560;19:00,520;"Did you see Josh Allen pimping that home run in the charity softball game?"
19:00,520;19:01,240;"No."
19:01,240;19:01,800;"No."
19:01,800;19:07,480;"Oh, dude, it might be the best pip job on a home run I've ever seen."
19:07,480;19:10,040;"Really?"
19:10,240;19:12,360;"The place was like packed too."
19:12,360;19:14,800;"It was like thousands of people there."
19:14,800;19:19,800;"And he just like smashes one and like 360s out of it"
19:19,800;19:23,880;"and like starts like doing like WWE stuff to the crowd."
19:23,880;19:26,480;"And it was just so smooth and perfect."
19:26,480;19:29,320;"And was like, wow, this guy's a promised pro."
19:29,320;19:30,400;"Oh boy."
19:30,400;19:31,240;"Don't tell Steve."
19:31,240;19:32,080;"- But it is."
19:32,080;19:35,360;"- Steve's still on the wheels are gonna fall off Josh Allen train."
19:35,360;19:36,200;"- Oh yeah."
19:36,200;19:38,240;"- No, he, you must have jumped off that wagon."
19:38,240;19:39,480;"- Don't point it'll come."
19:39,480;19:41,980;"- When he's older, even though--"
19:41,980;19:42,820;"- I love it."
19:42,820;19:43,660;"- I love it."
19:43,660;19:44,500;"All right, what about Tana Hill?"
19:44,500;19:45,580;"- Yeah, Tana Hill sucks."
19:45,580;19:46,420;"- Yeah, I don't know."
19:46,420;19:47,260;"- Yeah, he sucks."
19:47,260;19:50,740;"- Well, let's do a quick little sojourn"
19:50,740;19:52,820;"into the draft then,"
19:52,820;19:54,660;"to talk about current day."
19:54,660;19:56,460;"- Well, I believe we predicted"
19:56,460;20:01,100;"Steven, I think you said wide receiver, right?"
20:01,100;20:03,300;"- No, I said trade up for the fat boy"
20:03,300;20:04,140;"that the Eagles got."
20:04,140;20:05,820;"- Oh, that's right, yeah, the defensive lineman."
20:05,820;20:06,660;"Greg, you said--"
20:06,660;20:08,020;"- Game is millions."
20:08,020;20:10,180;"You said wide receiver?"
20:10,180;20:11,020;"- Yeah."
20:11,020;20:13,620;"- And I said, because you do pick that,"
20:13,620;20:16,620;"they were gonna draft an offensive lineman"
20:16,620;20:17,780;"that nobody had ever heard of."
20:17,780;20:19,060;"- You even called the trade back in."
20:19,060;20:21,100;"You said trade back and draft an offensive lineman."
20:21,100;20:22,700;"- Yeah, I think I probably did."
20:22,700;20:25,140;"- Yeah, but you didn't predict who it was."
20:25,140;20:26,540;"So it's wrong."
20:26,540;20:29,380;"- I said it was somebody nobody had ever heard of."
20:29,380;20:30,700;"- That's a, that's not obviously a kid."
20:30,700;20:33,940;"- There's a lot of people no one's ever heard of Andy."
20:33,940;20:36,500;"- Not picked in the first round or is it just one?"
20:36,500;20:42,260;"specialties. Just the fact his name is strange too. It's perfect."
20:42,260;20:45,660;"It's like they're they're fucking with us. You know, his jersey is"
20:45,660;20:48,180;"jersey because he's the first round pick a strange one. It's"
20:48,180;20:51,860;"perfect. That he doesn't wear gloves and he's an offensive"
20:51,860;20:55,740;"lineman. He's amazing. It's got the old school helmet too. Yeah."
20:55,740;21:00,700;"Chattanooga. You can get behind that. Tell me that ain't a blue"
21:00,700;21:05,940;"collar place to go. Chattanooga. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Damn. I'm 100%"
21:05,940;21:06,940;"I'm bored."
21:06,940;21:07,940;"Oh yeah."
21:07,940;21:08,940;"Great pick."
21:08,940;21:18,100;"So yeah, give me the most useless thing in football media is the draft grade."
21:18,100;21:19,700;"So I want to hear yours."
21:19,700;21:23,700;"Dude, the best part about the draft is you can just watch the highlights that show the"
21:23,700;21:26,140;"best parts in your fucking hype city."
21:26,140;21:27,140;"Yeah."
21:27,140;21:30,100;"I remember Nikhil Harry highlights still, you know?"
21:30,100;21:34,060;"If they ever do it or not, who knows, but it's the best."
21:34,060;21:36,980;"So obviously a plus of only watch awesome highlights of the dudes."
21:36,980;21:37,980;"Yeah."
21:37,980;21:39,740;"Do you see how fast T1 Thornton is?"
21:39,740;21:41,260;"That guy is wicked fast."
21:41,260;21:42,260;"He's going to be a nice film."
21:42,260;21:46,540;"He's got that little shimmy right off the line."
21:46,540;21:49,340;"He's got that first little stutter step and then he can get by you."
21:49,340;21:50,340;"Yeah."
21:50,340;21:53,620;"He's also probably like a paper bag, you know, just floating in the wind."
21:53,620;21:54,620;"Yeah."
21:54,620;21:57,300;"So we can't bring him a buffalo because Mike had blown away."
21:57,300;22:01,340;"But other than that, I mean, he's like 17 games you can play Matt."
22:01,340;22:03,140;"- Big quad paper bag, Thornton."
22:03,140;22:06,160;"- If he can get you, he can be sweet."
22:06,160;22:07,260;"That's the real question."
22:07,260;22:08,940;"He knows they can catch you or not."
22:08,940;22:10,060;"- Yeah."
22:10,060;22:11,660;"- Go ahead and let them not trap the linebackers."
22:11,660;22:12,500;"- That's better."
22:12,500;22:14,340;"- I don't like that."
22:14,340;22:16,060;"I think our linebackers are bad."
22:16,060;22:17,860;"I don't know."
22:17,860;22:19,100;"I think they out on red shirted last year."
22:19,100;22:19,940;"- Yeah, you don't even know."
22:19,940;22:20,780;"That guy who got red shirted."
22:20,780;22:22,100;"- Why would you say they red shirted though?"
22:22,100;22:24,500;"But there was no one good starting ahead of them."
22:24,500;22:26,460;"So why red shirt them if they're good?"
22:26,460;22:29,140;"Because they're rookies."
22:29,140;22:31,540;"And also one of the guys coming off the ACL."
22:31,540;22:34,420;"Yeah, they're like top pick with a camera."
22:34,420;22:35,060;"I don't know."
22:35,060;22:38,500;"I think you're you're you're you're viewing things through your"
22:38,500;22:39,940;"Patriots colored glasses."
22:39,940;22:42,420;"You know, I think I just watched their highlight their college highlight."
22:42,420;22:42,980;"That's right."
22:42,980;22:43,860;"So a plus."
22:43,860;22:45,220;"I was going to see."
22:45,220;22:48,180;"Have you seen Ronnie Perkins highlights?"
22:48,180;22:49,700;"They're fantastic."
22:49,700;22:50,500;"Yeah, they're sweet."
22:50,500;22:52,580;"But does that guy's going to be the next Willie McGinnis, bro?"
22:52,580;22:53,140;"Exactly."
22:53,140;22:54,580;"Get on board, Greg."
22:54,580;22:55,940;"Choo-choo."
22:55,940;22:58,260;"We also drafted the next Troy Brown, right?"
22:58,260;22:59,460;"Oh, they were comparing one guy."
22:59,460;23:01,220;"Yeah, the defensive Troy Brown."
23:01,220;23:02,220;"Wow."
23:02,220;23:03,420;"Who can play offense?"
23:03,420;23:06,380;"So he will be the defensive Troy Brown."
23:06,380;23:07,620;"Sign me up."
23:07,620;23:09,500;"And he's going to be."
23:09,500;23:10,340;"Huh?"
23:10,340;23:11,580;"Which one was that?"
23:11,580;23:13,140;"Jack Jones."
23:13,140;23:14,460;"Marcus Jones, I think."
23:14,460;23:15,380;"That's going to be tough."
23:15,380;23:16,140;"They both coming in."
23:16,140;23:18,660;"The last name, Jones, and the quarterbacks already named Jones."
23:18,660;23:19,140;"Yeah."
23:19,140;23:19,740;"We'll play in the same."
23:19,740;23:21,060;"And they also have Jonathan Jones"
23:21,060;23:22,140;"in the defensive backfield."
23:22,140;23:24,060;"And that in that same position also."
23:24,060;23:25,660;"It's going to be a mess."
23:25,660;23:26,540;"A mess of Jones."
23:26,540;23:31,700;"So no, I think this is this is where we can do the the bell"
23:31,700;23:34,640;"track genius playing chess."
23:34,640;23:36,540;"Yeah, I'm gonna have the same name on the back."
23:36,540;23:37,240;"Exactly."
23:37,240;23:39,440;"And give them all like very similar numbers."
23:39,440;23:41,240;"Just 30, 30, 33."
23:41,240;23:42,740;"It's actually three guys."
23:42,740;23:43,240;"Yeah."
23:43,240;23:45,640;"Well, no, you just put them out there and then the quarterback"
23:45,640;23:47,900;"looks around and he's like, I don't know which one's which they're all"
23:47,900;23:49,740;"pretty small and undersized guys too."
23:49,740;23:49,940;"Yeah."
23:49,940;23:51,540;"You know, 55 man roster."
23:51,540;23:54,940;"Going over on it again."
23:55,940;24:00,140;"In my head, those two guys are the same person."
24:00,140;24:03,460;"And to approve and otherwise, two guys named Jones"
24:03,460;24:05,780;"and the third and fourth round playing the same position"
24:05,780;24:08,300;"are in my head the same thing."
24:08,300;24:11,220;"So yeah, they have also have awesome highlights."
24:11,220;24:12,740;"We could fast."
24:12,740;24:13,580;"Nope."
24:13,580;24:14,980;"One guy does it's a pun returner."
24:14,980;24:18,140;"Catch is it, puns returns, please DB."
24:18,140;24:18,820;"Oh, man."
24:18,820;24:22,740;"Dude, we got a kid for my over 30s men's soccer team."
24:22,740;24:25,620;"Like, yeah, not the most competitive shit in the world."
24:25,620;24:29,500;"This one kid wants to like be on the team and he sent the guy who's"
24:29,500;24:32,700;"running the team sent him his his highlight video."
24:32,700;24:34,340;"Nice."
24:34,340;24:35,860;"Yeah."
24:35,860;24:39,940;"He's actually pretty good, but I give him a lot of shit for having a highlight"
24:39,940;24:40,780;"video."
24:40,780;24:41,660;"Fuck that."
24:41,660;24:42,900;"That's only because you don't have one."
24:42,900;24:43,260;"Yeah."
24:43,260;24:45,740;"I guess, but"
24:45,740;24:46,460;"highlights to me."
24:46,460;24:48,700;"Make it also like who's recording the shit."
24:48,700;24:50,260;"Oh,"
24:50,260;24:51,740;"I was over 30."
24:51,740;24:52,820;"Fuck it."
24:53,700;24:54,900;"Hey, it are over at the early week."
24:54,900;24:55,740;"We used to have one like a,"
24:55,740;24:58,460;"he would just like set up GoPros in the corner of the, the goal."
24:58,460;24:58,980;"You remember me?"
24:58,980;25:02,620;"Well, that makes sense because you don't have to move it for a goal."
25:02,620;25:03,620;"You know, yeah."
25:03,620;25:06,060;"Boom, Don, GoPros according it."
25:06,060;25:06,860;"Yeah."
25:06,860;25:09,660;"You just looked like you're like, have you seen me?"
25:09,660;25:11,540;"Um, any of the USFL."
25:11,540;25:12,940;"I have not."
25:12,940;25:18,020;"The day of the helmets on the cameras on the helmets of the players."
25:18,020;25:18,900;"Oh, cool."
25:18,900;25:19,900;"No, it's bad."
25:19,900;25:21,580;"Oh, is this terrible?"
25:22,500;25:27,420;"I don't know if like they don't have good enough quality cameras, but oh boy."
25:27,420;25:29,100;"It's super shaky."
25:29,100;25:30,740;"Super shaky quality."
25:30,740;25:31,580;"It's terrible."
25:31,580;25:32,820;"Not good."
25:32,820;25:36,220;"That used to be a member NFL 2K five."
25:36,220;25:39,740;"You could play as first person and I always want to see a camera angle from"
25:39,740;25:40,860;"then ever since then."
25:40,860;25:43,620;"The ones on the rest are bad."
25:43,620;25:45,220;"Those no, those were great."
25:45,220;25:45,740;"Remember?"
25:45,740;25:47,100;"They're kind of bad quality."
25:47,100;25:47,900;"No, they're great."
25:47,900;25:51,620;"I mean, well, this is back in like the 2003, 2004 when they had them."
25:51,820;25:53,820;"I remember one ref got plunked right in the face."
25:53,820;25:54,140;"Yep."
25:54,140;25:56,340;"When he was wearing it, that shit was no swatch TV."
25:56,340;25:57,740;"That was worth it just for that."
25:57,740;25:58,060;"Yeah."
25:58,060;25:59,340;"It was amazing."
25:59,340;26:01,060;"All right."
26:01,060;26:01,940;"Tell me more about it."
26:01,940;26:02,980;"Nobody there."
26:02,980;26:04,460;"No, like I turned it on."
26:04,460;26:06,260;"I watched like 10 minutes of a game the other day."
26:06,260;26:10,660;"And like I honestly was like, are they allowing fans at this thing?"
26:10,660;26:13,300;"That's how few people were there."
26:13,300;26:14,780;"It was sad."
26:14,780;26:15,620;"Yeah."
26:15,620;26:16,300;"That's not good."
26:16,300;26:19,420;"Oh, oh, speaking of no fans."
26:19,540;26:23,700;"Tell me about this Jets game, Steve. Only fans?"
26:23,700;26:26,260;"Jets fans aren't real fans, so there's no fans there."
26:26,260;26:30,460;"Too shame. Well, there weren't any by the end of this game because"
26:30,460;26:32,100;"the Boobers were out at halftime."
26:32,100;26:33,260;"Yes, I had a question."
26:33,260;26:35,820;"Your quarter, half-brag Google."
26:35,820;26:37,020;"Oh, they should be good."
26:37,020;26:41,700;"It does because Corey Dylan's rushing record still stand for the fats."
26:41,700;26:43,420;"Yes, because it only means."
26:43,620;26:48,020;"- I think it does because he was the last of like the"
26:48,020;26:51,920;"work horsebacks, right?"
26:51,920;26:53,700;"Pages don't do that anymore."
26:53,700;26:55,340;"- Has anyone beat Curtis Martin's"
26:55,340;26:57,780;"or is Curtis Martin number two still?"
26:57,780;27:00,380;"- Stat check?"
27:00,380;27:01,900;"- Doesn't look like a stat check."
27:01,900;27:03,700;"- No, the other stat check guy we have on this,"
27:03,700;27:04,700;"if I can crew. - Yeah."
27:04,700;27:06,100;"- I have to unplug."
27:06,100;27:10,940;"I know we pay a bunch of them to put my microphone in."
27:10,940;27:12,980;"So you can either get stat check"
27:12,980;27:14,780;"or speaking, don't answer that question."
27:14,780;27:15,700;"I know you're answering."
27:15,700;27:16,540;"- Wait, I'm sorry."
27:16,540;27:17,380;"No, just go back."
27:17,380;27:19,700;"- Are you going with this Greg?"
27:19,700;27:20,780;"This is an easy one."
27:20,780;27:24,300;"- And then my third question is,"
27:24,300;27:26,340;"is Jim Nance still third?"
27:26,340;27:30,900;"Because I don't even know he played in the Patriots."
27:30,900;27:31,980;"- Really?"
27:31,980;27:33,060;"- Yeah."
27:33,060;27:34,260;"- That's a different Jim Nance."
27:34,260;27:35,220;"- Oh."
27:35,220;27:36,180;"- Yeah."
27:36,180;27:37,820;"- No, it's same Jim Nance."
27:37,820;27:39,060;"- The commentator?"
27:39,060;27:39,900;"- Yeah."
27:39,900;27:41,220;"- Yeah, same guy."
27:41,220;27:45,900;"Yes, so right now, Corey Dillon for rushing in a season,"
27:45,900;27:50,900;"Corey Dillon, 2004, 1635 yards, number one."
27:50,900;27:54,340;"Curtis Martin 1995 with 1487 yards is number two,"
27:54,340;27:57,020;"and you're right, so you Jim Vance number three."
27:57,020;27:59,340;"There is no way you're gonna guess number four."
27:59,340;28:01,900;"- Steven Ridley."
28:01,900;28:03,500;"- God damn it, first try."
28:03,500;28:06,180;"(laughing)"
28:06,180;28:08,540;"2012, 1263 nights."
28:08,540;28:10,060;"- Yeah, he was good for a little bit there."
28:10,060;28:11,100;"- Not bad, not bad."
28:11,100;28:14,300;"And then Craig James, Jim Nance, and John Stevens."
28:14,300;28:18,100;"Number eight, 2016."
28:18,100;28:20,700;"- San Veno, no."
28:20,700;28:24,700;"2016."
28:24,700;28:25,540;"- Mm-hmm."
28:25,540;28:28,540;"- A surprise on Jarvis Greenhouse."
28:28,540;28:31,860;"- No, but he's on, he's number 16."
28:31,860;28:37,860;"- The season 16th is the last 1,000-year-old rusher"
28:37,860;28:40,540;"- I've been charged greenhouse with 1,008 yards."
28:40,540;28:43,300;"- It's not more. - In 2016."
28:43,300;28:45,180;"- Who?"
28:45,180;28:46,380;"- It's not Morris, right?"
28:46,380;28:48,100;"Or Moretti? - Nope."
28:48,100;28:52,260;"- With 1,161 yards, Leggara Blunt."
28:52,260;28:53,140;"- Oh yeah. - To go along"
28:53,140;28:56,140;"with 18 touchdowns, which I believe is"
28:56,140;28:58,180;"the record for touchdowns in a season."
28:58,180;28:59,620;"- Oh, Blunt. - Oh, Blunt."
28:59,620;29:01,460;"- We're out of line."
29:01,460;29:02,840;"- Blunt forced trauma, baby."
29:02,840;29:06,700;"- What a turnaround that guy had from punching that dude"
29:06,700;29:16,380;"Oregon. Right. Here's an interesting one though. The least amount of rushing yards in a season"
29:16,380;29:23,740;"by a New England patriot. Number one, Lee Johnson, the punter. 2001 negative 19 yards."
29:23,740;29:29,500;"That makes sense. Number two, 1997, Troy Brown with negative 18 yards."
29:31,260;29:35,820;"on one carry. It's less sense. Negative 18 yards on one carry. That's"
29:35,820;29:39,340;"how it must have been like an end around or something. That's ridiculous."
29:39,340;29:41,180;"Or a trick play that went wrong or something."
29:41,180;29:45,340;"Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Matt Gutierrez is on here in 2007."
29:45,340;29:49,500;"Five carries negative 13 yards."
29:49,500;29:54,940;"I don't think that Jim Nance is a commentator is the same Jim Nance on that list."
29:54,940;29:59,020;"Pro. Yeah. Can you stat check that? Because I thought Jim Nance, the football player was black."
30:00,460;30:06,700;"I'm looking at the commentator Jim Nance, and there's nothing on his Wikipedia about him playing football."
30:06,700;30:08,220;"What's his middle name?"
30:08,220;30:10,620;"James William Nance III."
30:10,620;30:11,820;"Oh yeah, the different people."
30:11,820;30:13,740;"You fuck you, man."
30:13,740;30:17,420;"Confidently incorrect."
30:17,420;30:18,380;"Obviously."
30:18,380;30:19,100;"Yeah."
30:19,100;30:20,620;"That's how we roll on this podcast."
30:20,620;30:22,780;"You're welcome."
30:22,780;30:27,420;"Speaking of Jim Nance and Phil Simms, Steve, did you have any comments on the commentators?"
30:27,420;30:28,300;"Yeah, they were great."
30:29,180;30:33,260;"Yeah. Did you like when they gave each other their own books for Christmas?"
30:33,260;30:38,780;"No, I did. Except Phil Sims wrote a book, but Jim Nance didn't. So he gave him Dick Emberg's book"
30:38,780;30:45,100;"instead. He said they were talking about Rebaal has said he's going to coach someday. That's what"
30:45,100;30:52,380;"he says. Yeah. Really foreshadowing. Yeah. Well, they've had that come up a few times this season."
30:52,380;30:56,620;"Yeah. Yeah. Well, he's a coach on the field and super smart. He's definitely going to coach this"
30:56,620;30:58,480;"season or what he's done."
30:58,480;30:59,940;"It's right after he'd able to"
30:59,940;31:02,160;"laid that left tackle."
31:02,160;31:03,320;"Yeah, for the sack."
31:03,320;31:04,520;"Back on the third down right at"
31:04,520;31:05,420;"the end of the two minute."
31:05,420;31:07,220;"At the end of the two and a half."
31:07,220;31:08,160;"Yeah."
31:08,160;31:10,320;"But we find that that highlight"
31:10,320;31:11,560;"on the website, it'll be there."
31:11,560;31:14,060;"Pastainacy.com, even the old"
31:14,060;31:14,960;"Pamplona."
31:14,960;31:15,560;"Oh, yeah."
31:15,560;31:16,860;"And they all he did."
31:16,860;31:18,700;"He was an elbow foreshadowing."
31:18,700;31:21,200;"It was beginning of the fourth"
31:21,200;31:23,200;"quarter, Jats the third and like"
31:23,200;31:24,200;"20 something."
31:24,640;31:30,080;"You know, it was still like 16, you know, still a thing sort of like two scores barely."
31:30,080;31:30,680;"Yeah."
31:30,680;31:32,840;"And then he's like, Oh, I'm third and long."
31:32,840;31:34,120;"And you just try not to turn it over."
31:34,120;31:35,720;"And kind of in 10 throws third pick."
31:35,720;31:39,800;"And then you turn the like the 15 yard line, couple of Corey down and runs later."
31:39,800;31:42,120;"It's now out of reach."
31:42,120;31:42,600;"Yeah."
31:42,600;31:43,920;"23 or whatever this."
31:43,920;31:44,200;"Yeah."
31:44,200;31:45,000;"Yeah."
31:45,000;31:50,000;"Cause he was a, but they were talking about going for two because the paths were up."
31:50,000;31:52,840;"23 nothing and the jets were to touchdown."
31:53,480;31:56,400;"He's like, no, it's a good thing not to go for two here unless you need it."
31:56,400;32:00,880;"And I thought you want to, it's three scores."
32:00,880;32:03,120;"You may as well go for two and all of them."
32:03,120;32:05,320;"Cause if you get it, you're up 24, 23."
32:05,320;32:09,360;"So why wouldn't you go for two, extend the game?"
32:09,360;32:11,160;"I don't know."
32:11,160;32:12,680;"Did all this go for you, not."
32:12,680;32:14,520;"It's no nerds."
32:14,520;32:17,360;"Let's ask the new dolphins coach."
32:17,360;32:20,560;"I'm sure there's something out there."
32:20,560;32:22,400;"So if anybody's listening, it can explain to us."
32:23,200;32:27,040;"I feel like you're supposed to go for it early now, the two-pointer version."
32:27,040;32:27,680;"Yeah."
32:27,680;32:29,200;"If you're down two scores or something."
32:29,200;32:31,400;"Yeah, if it's two score, you're supposed to."
32:31,400;32:34,040;"But if it's three, I would think you'd want to extend the game."
32:34,040;32:35,840;"I don't know."
32:35,840;32:42,200;"But either way, if you miss that, because you have to go for two at least twice, right?"
32:42,200;32:43,640;"It's better to know early."
32:43,640;32:44,280;"Right. Yeah."
32:44,280;32:48,000;"So you go for that first one to see if you get it or not, because even if you don't get,"
32:48,000;32:50,880;"you can still get the next two and tie the game."
32:50,880;32:52,320;"So why not go for the first one?"
32:52,520;32:53,360;"Yeah."
32:53,360;32:54,280;"And whatever."
32:54,280;32:54,680;"Fucking."
32:54,680;32:55,960;"It should never make sense."
32:55,960;32:59,800;"It's like the NHL now, they're pulling the goalies"
32:59,800;33:03,040;"with like four minutes left if they're like down two goals."
33:03,040;33:05,320;"And like the numbers say that's what you're supposed to do."
33:05,320;33:07,480;"But then they'll just immediately give up an open-etter game."
33:07,480;33:08,480;"Right."
33:08,480;33:10,000;"It's not a fucking--"
33:10,000;33:11,000;"It's not a fucking--"
33:11,000;33:12,000;"Whoops."
33:12,000;33:14,720;"Has it ever worked?"
33:14,720;33:15,560;"Yeah, it must have."
33:15,560;33:16,800;"We have to have worked."
33:16,800;33:18,160;"At least once otherwise, it would have stopped."
33:18,160;33:19,160;"Yeah."
33:19,160;33:20,160;"Yeah."
33:20,160;33:22,040;"All right, you want to be like best and worst on this game?"
33:22,040;33:26,480;"Well, can I have a special treat, but we can go to maybe one"
33:26,480;33:27,800;"we're done with no."
33:27,800;33:29,360;"It was not mean."
33:29,360;33:31,880;"You can do your special treat for the best of ours."
33:31,880;33:33,600;"Because you don't even have any best of worst because you didn't"
33:33,600;33:34,120;"watch the game."
33:34,120;33:37,880;"So this I didn't put I put a lot of effort in the bye week here."
33:37,880;33:39,400;"OK, so."
33:39,400;33:41,000;"So."
33:41,000;33:45,880;"Basically, instead of watching the game, what I did is I went back"
33:45,880;33:49,880;"and I listened to Andy's entire solo podcast."
33:49,880;33:50,240;"Yeah."
33:50,240;33:52,360;"I just listened to this as well, Greg."
33:52,360;33:53,360;"- Yes."
33:53,360;33:54,960;"- When I was driving in New York to see Ellie."
33:54,960;33:55,800;"- Yeah."
33:55,800;34:00,320;"So I figured I'd give my thoughts on, you know,"
34:00,320;34:02,160;"how the podcast went."
34:02,160;34:03,080;"- Oh, this should be good."
34:03,080;34:04,920;"- Yeah, so my initial thoughts are..."
34:04,920;34:07,280;"- First of all, first of all,"
34:07,280;34:11,080;"once you've done this, can you leave this"
34:11,080;34:13,600;"as a review of the podcast on iTunes?"
34:13,600;34:16,200;"- No, great idea, Greg."
34:16,200;34:17,520;"- We need more reviews."
34:17,520;34:18,360;"- Yeah."
34:18,360;34:37,360;"a bit of a snooze fest. That was my initial thoughts. Let's see here. I should never have told you about this app. Did you edit this together, Andy? No."
34:37,360;34:44,320;"I'm like, she's never watched a football game before, because even simple things surprise."
34:44,320;34:50,240;"Who could that be talking about? I wonder. Well, that's the end. I'm not going to get mad about the"
34:50,240;34:56,960;"commentators. This was about the commentators. This was months ago. This was before my epiphany"
34:56,960;35:02,480;"of I'm not going to get mad at the announcements. And the thing is, it was like, well, you know,"
35:02,480;35:06,240;"where was Steve too, you know, like why was Steve not on this podcast?"
35:06,240;35:07,440;"Just inactive."
35:07,440;35:11,680;"They didn't actually say why, which has happened before, where I think he just maybe doesn't"
35:11,680;35:14,480;"particularly practice well or something like that."
35:14,480;35:16,240;"Steve didn't practice well."
35:16,240;35:17,680;"We got that."
35:17,680;35:17,920;"That was right."
35:17,920;35:21,440;"We do do a dry run of this, as you can probably tell by how polished it is."
35:21,440;35:26,080;"And I think he just, he didn't show well in the dry run."
35:26,080;35:26,320;"Yeah."
35:26,320;35:30,640;"But also Greg wasn't there, but like, you know,"
35:31,600;35:32,800;"Where was Greg at?"
35:32,800;35:35,800;"Tough look, but this is what happens when you build off a"
35:35,800;35:39,800;"three-hour one guy, and he decides to retire to go smoke weed."
35:39,800;35:42,800;"[laughter]"
35:42,800;35:44,200;"Carefully blame him."
35:44,200;35:47,400;"And the words of Andy Brown, you can't really."
35:47,400;35:51,000;"[laughter]"
35:51,000;35:53,200;"You just did a lot of time thinking about this, Greg."
35:53,200;35:54,200;"Uh-huh."
35:54,200;35:55,200;"Mm-hmm."
35:55,200;35:58,800;"I love how he puts in this much effort into not watching the game,"
35:58,800;35:59,800;"too."
35:59,800;36:06,120;"every week. And it's like, but we know that Andy's not like a superstar. You know, he's"
36:06,120;36:08,120;"just like a role player. I'm a grinder."
36:08,120;36:13,800;"Kind of the epitome of a street free agent. What's out there? It's a bit of a warm body."
36:13,800;36:17,080;"Bit of a warm body."
36:17,080;36:22,440;"What's that word? You know, your body."
36:22,440;36:28,520;"So yeah, fuck that dude."
36:28,520;36:29,800;"Fuck that dude."
36:29,800;36:30,800;"That's right."
36:30,800;36:39,800;"Yeah, it sounded like you edited out a bunch in between."
36:39,800;36:43,320;"So it sounded like yes, but I thought you did."
36:43,320;36:44,320;"You didn't edit that at all."
36:44,320;36:45,320;"That was one take."
36:45,320;36:50,120;"It was a software that, yeah, it was one take, but it pulled out all the ums and ahs and"
36:50,120;36:51,120;"things like that."
36:51,120;36:53,680;"Because that made it way harder for me to pull the audio."
36:53,680;36:54,480;"Really?"
36:54,480;36:56,720;"Yeah, because it crunches it together."
36:56,720;36:57,680;"Oh, interesting."
36:57,680;36:58,320;"Yeah."
36:58,320;37:00,320;"Yeah, I've only ever used it on that episode."
37:00,320;37:01,680;"You have to time it perfectly."
37:01,680;37:04,640;"So I'm not catching like the front end of the next sentence"
37:04,640;37:06,160;"or the back end of the previous one."
37:06,160;37:07,760;"So this took a lot of takes to go."
37:07,760;37:10,880;"I was going to say how, because I've seen you use your computer."
37:10,880;37:15,440;"You don't do it particularly well."
37:15,440;37:16,880;"You can't even unplug your microphone"
37:16,880;37:18,560;"does that check a thing or something."
37:18,560;37:19,200;"Right."
37:19,200;37:21,200;"So that check in talk."
37:21,200;37:23,200;"I'm a little curious."
37:23,200;37:27,200;"How did you manage to put this together?"
37:27,200;37:33,200;"Well, you know, Andy, because you don't seem like somebody who has audio editing software in the computer."
37:33,200;37:34,200;"It's all I'm saying."
37:34,200;37:37,200;"You know what the highest part was though?"
37:37,200;37:39,200;"It was a bit of a snooze test."
37:39,200;37:42,200;"So, you know, it was really more boring than anything."
37:45,200;37:52,000;"It's only because you listen to it 45 times. Yeah, I'm addicted to this app now. Yeah, you're welcome"
37:52,000;37:54,240;"I knew I should not have told you about it. Yeah"
38:12,960;38:15,580;"It's that crazy preacher got a pat something or whatever."
38:15,580;38:17,160;"- Uh huh, yep."
38:17,160;38:19,360;"- You hear that one, he's trying to blow it away."
38:19,360;38:20,200;"- Yeah, he's blowing away,"
38:20,200;38:22,480;"well the wind of God is blowing away COVID-19."
38:22,480;38:23,320;"- Oh, I see."
38:23,320;38:24,160;"- Yes."
38:24,160;38:26,960;"- I feel like that's not how that works."
38:26,960;38:29,560;"And he's probably blowing COVID-19 on people now."
38:29,560;38:30,400;"- Yeah."
38:30,400;38:31,480;"- Yeah."
38:31,480;38:32,640;"- Ironic, isn't it?"
38:32,640;38:34,480;"All right."
38:34,480;38:37,240;"- So should we do best and worst after that?"
38:37,240;38:38,080;"- Yeah."
38:38,080;38:38,920;"- Great guy."
38:38,920;38:39,760;"I think you should go first"
38:39,760;38:40,600;"and you should do best and worst on that,"
38:40,600;38:42,280;"that last episode you'll listen to."
38:42,280;38:44,580;"Okay. Let's see here."
38:44,580;38:46,940;"I know what your worst is."
38:46,940;38:52,140;"I mean, it's almost like she's never watched a football game before."
38:52,140;38:55,420;"Because even simple things surprise me."
38:55,420;38:57,220;"Is that your best or worst?"
38:57,220;39:00,580;"Cause he's almost like he's never watched football before."
39:00,580;39:03,320;"Cause even the simple things confuse him."
39:03,320;39:05,620;"I'm a simple man."
39:05,620;39:06,100;"What can I say?"
39:06,100;39:06,620;"Yeah."
39:06,620;39:06,860;"Yeah."
39:06,860;39:08,540;"That's why you got the dear door Jersey."
39:08,540;39:09,580;"Told you best."
39:09,580;39:09,940;"I do."
39:09,940;39:10,480;"I have a dude."
39:10,480;39:20,400;"Yeah, playmakers like me and Steve, you know, like that's what we had to do with Andy there is just yeah"
39:20,400;39:26,460;"Slottament to eat up some late innings when in a blow-off. Yeah, you're gonna look me in the eye"
39:26,460;39:30,000;"Steve"
39:30,000;39:33,040;"Yeah, oh yeah, make all the plays Andy all the points. Oh"
39:33,040;39:36,040;"Good Lord"
39:36,480;39:43,760;"All right, Steve, give me your best and worst because you actually watch this game unlike unlike the playmaker apparently for sure. I"
39:43,760;39:49,440;"Don't know if it's the best or the worst but Chad Pennington and it's like Mac Jones to me"
39:49,440;39:53,000;"Yeah"
39:53,000;39:54,880;"With worse decision-making I feel"
39:54,880;40:00,600;"I mean it's totally if Mac is still one year and Pennington's hurt at this point"
40:00,600;40:05,520;"This is post the Jets putting him in the fourth preseason game when he breaks his wrist, right?"
40:05,520;40:08,760;"Right. Right. So that's all from that."
40:08,760;40:11,640;"He's having a big end channel and like, you know, Mac doesn't get hurt."
40:11,640;40:15,560;"He's going to be better than this, but why the style of placing very similar?"
40:15,560;40:20,760;"Yeah, there is something about the two of them that I found similar as well."
40:20,760;40:22,360;"But you're right."
40:22,360;40:23,880;"Oh, that's the best or worst."
40:23,880;40:26,080;"Well, he doesn't throw a pick like that when he did a Bruce"
40:26,080;40:27,920;"because that was a snag."
40:27,920;40:29,880;"Whoa. That was an awesome pick by Bruce."
40:29,880;40:31,080;"He might be his best ever."
40:31,080;40:35,000;"I think we should put that as a best is just Teddy Bruce in general."
40:35,000;40:36,000;"Yeah, I'm saying."
40:36,000;40:41,720;"Like Pete Teddy Bruce here, I think, is underrated just because of how good his hands"
40:41,720;40:46,720;"are as like a, because he's more of like a run stuffing, like blitzing linebacker, but"
40:46,720;40:51,800;"his hands and that lettuce system getting those lanes and actually bring those balls"
40:51,800;40:54,080;"down instead of just tipping them."
40:54,080;40:56,280;"You don't see that very often anymore."
40:56,280;40:58,600;"I'm sticking with that."
40:58,600;41:01,640;"My worst is stuff game for Matt Light."
41:01,640;41:04,840;"Yeah, both tackles, I think."
41:04,840;41:09,240;"I felt like those are free Russia coming off the end pretty much every third down."
41:09,240;41:11,920;"Jonathan Philmont beat him clean for a sack."
41:11,920;41:12,920;"Yeah, that wasn't good."
41:12,920;41:14,920;"That was the Jets first round pick this year."
41:14,920;41:15,920;"It was."
41:15,920;41:16,920;"It was."
41:16,920;41:21,720;"Like there was their whole like defensive line was first round picks except for one guy."
41:21,720;41:22,720;"Wait a minute."
41:22,720;41:23,720;"I was."
41:23,720;41:24,720;"I mentioned that."
41:24,720;41:25,720;"All right."
41:25,720;41:29,080;"Then my best and I got to ultimate best."
41:29,080;41:30,080;"Oh boy."
41:30,080;41:33,360;"Patrick Bass was actually running a game ball a little bit in this game."
41:33,360;41:34,600;"Yes, he was."
41:34,600;41:39,780;"called a fourth down stretch play to the full back. That was"
41:39,780;41:41,820;"ridiculous. And they're like the second quarter."
41:41,820;41:43,320;"Yeah. Yeah."
41:43,320;41:46,720;"converted because they had they did not see a comment at all"
41:46,720;41:50,980;"because they called that shit. Right. And that's another like"
41:50,980;41:53,980;"15 yard run to that. It didn't see common. And wasn't Robbie"
41:53,980;41:58,360;"Abdul the full back on that play to? It was like the backups"
41:58,360;42:01,260;"running the ball. Yeah. That's one of those ones where if it"
42:01,260;42:06,360;"doesn't work. Oh, everybody gets wicked mad. Yeah. Brandon"
42:06,360;42:08,160;"fucking Baldwin. Are you kidding me?"
42:08,160;42:12,660;"Yeah, I agree. On Fort down. But like they've been with Corey"
42:12,660;42:15,160;"Dylan has been such, you know, tough sledding out there. So"
42:15,160;42:17,120;"they take him out on the sound. Okay, definitely run it. It's"
42:17,120;42:18,860;"Pat Bass. Yeah."
42:18,860;42:24,880;"Doing Patrick, you know, past protection. Patrick passed four"
42:24,880;42:29,000;"for 17. Yeah, over four yards of carry. Good job, Patrick."
42:29,100;42:33,180;"Yeah. They did try to get later in the game and it did not work."
42:33,180;42:34,020;"Correct."
42:34,020;42:35,180;"The second thought."
42:35,180;42:36,900;"But that wasn't within those."
42:36,900;42:37,740;"That was with Cordilla."
42:37,740;42:38,940;"That was a metric basket."
42:38,940;42:39,540;"Was it?"
42:39,540;42:44,140;"And then my best was this is awesome."
42:44,140;42:49,980;"The Patriots score, I'm going to kick a field goal right at the very end of the"
42:49,980;42:50,700;"first half."
42:50,700;42:54,740;"And then they skip kick it off because there's like a couple of seconds left."
42:54,740;42:55,220;"Right."
42:55,220;42:58,220;"And the Jets fucked the skip, skip kicking."
42:58,700;43:07,920;"Well, Vinnitary doings it off like, you know, like the first guy that says like directly in front of the kicker who like as soon as he runs up to kick turns round, I started running backwards for some reason."
43:07,920;43:12,360;"Doings it off is like dome and then it starts like off your shoulder pass."
43:12,360;43:17,520;"I mean, it starts like going squarely and then the Jets can't handle it and the patients recover."
43:17,520;43:19,560;"With one second left."
43:19,560;43:19,960;"Yeah."
43:19,960;43:20,700;"And so like fuck."
43:20,700;43:22,840;"We'll try from the jury."
43:22,840;43:25,700;"So you can't even handle the end of the half."
43:25,800;43:31,800;"It bounced at least twice in front of that guy who had a chance to catch it that fucked it up and hit him right in the face and just"
43:31,800;43:37,960;"yeah, pass recovered it one second left and then film and the bluebirds are out"
43:37,960;43:46,680;"Get the shit out of him. Yeah, and that was after out of ministry. I actually missed the field goal too. Yeah"
43:46,680;43:50,520;"On the day after Christmas. No, yeah, right"
43:50,520;43:55,560;"Well, that was an awesome Christmas present from the deaths. Yeah, just a little late"
43:55,560;44:02,200;"But then we missed it just a little late a little left. I mean jets fucking up on holidays against the Patriots"
44:02,200;44:08,200;"It's a pretty on-brand thing. It's true, huh? There's foreshadowing that game. Yeah"
44:08,200;44:11,000;"So do you know there's only"
44:11,000;44:13,200;"been a"
44:13,200;44:15,200;"team has only scored"
44:15,200;44:17,800;"Three touchdowns in under a minute of game time"
44:17,800;44:20,560;"Twice in the history of the NFL"
44:22,600;44:23,600;"The old times."
44:23,600;44:24,600;"Titans."
44:24,600;44:26,440;"Both times it was a Patriots."
44:26,440;44:27,440;"Yeah."
44:27,440;44:28,440;"It was not against the Titans."
44:28,440;44:29,440;"Dolphins."
44:29,440;44:31,880;"It was not against the Dolphins."
44:31,880;44:32,880;"Cardinals?"
44:32,880;44:34,520;"Was it like that snow game?"
44:34,520;44:36,160;"No."
44:36,160;44:40,960;"Once was against the Bears in like 2012 or something at home randomly."
44:40,960;44:43,960;"It was like a touchdown and then a fumble."
44:43,960;44:47,080;"Return for touchdown and another touchdown."
44:47,080;44:49,240;"And then the other one was the but fumble game."
44:49,240;44:50,240;"Oh yeah."
44:50,240;44:52,320;"Because the but fumble was actually the middle of it."
44:52,320;44:56,880;"it was the super long Vereen catch where they just like didn't cover him out of the back"
44:56,880;44:58,920;"field. You ran for 80 yards for touchdown."
44:58,920;44:59,920;"See you later."
44:59,920;45:00,920;"Yep."
45:00,920;45:05,440;"And then the butt fumble and then the ensuing kickoff, the guy coughed it up and Edelman"
45:05,440;45:08,360;"caught it on the run and just ran it in for touchdown."
45:08,360;45:09,360;"Oh yeah."
45:09,360;45:10,360;"Yeah."
45:10,360;45:13,120;"So nobody's ever done except for the Patriots who have done it twice."
45:13,120;45:14,120;"Thanks."
45:14,120;45:15,880;"Give me a game this year, right?"
45:15,880;45:16,880;"Minnesota."
45:16,880;45:17,880;"Minnesota."
45:17,880;45:20,400;"Is it home or away?"
45:20,400;45:25,800;"Only your hot take at Minnesota also hot take they're both gonna be undefeated in that game"
45:25,800;45:29,400;"spicy"
45:29,400;45:32,000;"See Magarita"
45:32,000;45:38,640;"So great we're not gonna do it now because it's still too early, but are we gonna do another Jersey bet?"
45:38,640;45:44,760;"Yeah, what was our previous one outcome of this on the outcome of the season oh"
45:44,760;45:49,860;"Yeah, we pick over under amount of wins and I always pick the over and you always pick the under"
45:49,860;45:51,860;"You are home."
45:51,860;45:53,860;"Yeah, and I was right."
45:53,860;45:59,860;"So we'll run your on a how many sex cam McGrawing has this year."
45:59,860;46:03,860;"We'll see what Vegas has said it and I'll pick the over and you pick the other and"
46:03,860;46:04,860;"you'll only be a Jersey team."
46:04,860;46:07,860;"Well, no, you tell me how many it's going to be."
46:07,860;46:09,860;"Don't don't let Vegas Vegas."
46:09,860;46:10,860;"Yeah."
46:10,860;46:13,860;"That guy's hanging out with Kelly too long."
46:13,860;46:16,860;"She's like baggles and vagas."
46:16,860;46:27,980;"in Vegas. Fucking crazy sounds dirty. Five and a half. Over under. You're right. I'll"
46:27,980;46:35,260;"take under. I'll take that. I don't think it has a line for that. I don't know what"
46:35,260;46:43,140;"we do. They have a line for everything. All right. My best and worst. My best is the"
46:43,140;46:46,960;"The pages keep their streak of two streaks alive."
46:46,960;46:49,840;"The first one is this is their 30th straight game"
46:49,840;46:52,640;"without allowing an opening drive touchdown."
46:52,640;46:55,920;"This will, I looked it up, will eventually end week one"
46:55,920;46:59,440;"of next season at like 34 games."
46:59,440;47:01,240;"I don't know if that's a record I've been trying to Google"
47:01,240;47:04,080;"and I can't figure it out."
47:04,080;47:05,360;"Spoiler alert."
47:05,360;47:06,880;"Yeah."
47:06,880;47:10,240;"But 30 fucking 30 straight games without allowing"
47:10,240;47:12,320;"an opening drive touchdown."
47:12,320;47:14,080;"That's a solid-ass defense."
47:14,080;47:15,360;"It's good coaching."
47:15,360;47:16,360;"Yeah."
47:16,360;47:19,360;"And a genius coaching, I might say."
47:19,360;47:23,760;"And it's also their 23rd consecutive games going first, which helps if you don't allow."
47:23,760;47:25,600;"Don't put your touchdown, but still."
47:25,600;47:28,960;"Nobody's even scored a field goal before they've scored."
47:28,960;47:33,920;"So the patient playing from ahead in 23 consecutive games, which is bananas."
47:33,920;47:35,760;"They've 16 games in a season."
47:35,760;47:36,480;"Right."
47:36,480;47:39,280;"So even when they lose, they score first."
47:39,280;47:40,160;"That's awesome."
47:40,160;47:40,560;"Yeah."
47:40,560;47:46,480;"So that's my best. All right, any thoughts on Brovy Wade? My worst."
47:46,480;47:55,600;"I was probably Greg's performance in this. I don't think your immigration policy, Andy."
47:55,600;48:02,560;"You know, I just do a solo podcast for you. You know what? I would like to really hash those"
48:02,560;48:08,800;"thoughts. I would like to deport you at this point. I want to deport you from the podcast."
48:09,760;48:15,760;"I would have a borgrag. Is it too late? I don't think it's too late, right? Well, you can still"
48:15,760;48:21,520;"it was go murder, I'm going to sleep and call it abortion. I'm okay with that. Sure, dude."
48:21,520;48:28,880;"Sure, dude. All right. And I guess on that note, turn in next week to see how much of a blubbering"
48:28,880;48:34,880;"little bitch, Gregy on the page where it's dying. It's the podcast. I'm going to get you, Andy,"
48:34,880;48:39,720;"only these weeks. You know, the only man who's fucking sick one soundboard."
48:39,720;48:44,880;"Greg, do you realize how much stupid shit you said? Yeah. Yeah. And he's got a lot of"
48:44,880;48:48,360;"words. You really want me to go back and find it? Greg has got more time to go back into"
48:48,360;48:53,000;"finding it. You don't have that time right now. Bro, and it's true. Tell me with that."
48:53,000;48:59,800;"I am I am just here for all of this. I'll find shit on both of you just in case either"
48:59,800;49:04,200;"you start listening to my earlier podcast again. It's the problem. I'd have to listen"
49:04,200;49:10,280;"into it. The only have to do that. I can I can nerd it out. So to listen to a form and just pull out all"
49:10,280;49:16,840;"like quotes. And what do you mean? What do you mean? Can you keyword search it? Yeah."
49:16,840;49:22,040;"No, I'm not gonna do that functionality."
49:22,040;49:26,280;"Keyword search referee."
49:31,160;49:34,600;"Yeah, and you'll hear the truth about referees. All right, here's one for you. Mr."
49:34,600;49:40,600;"referees are in fact, I've heard I've heard a lot on Twitter because I don't follow basketball,"
49:40,600;49:44,200;"but I've heard a lot on Twitter about how bad the referees were in the Celtics box."
49:44,200;49:52,680;"Serious. Wait, Mr. referees are infallible. Yeah. I don't think it was a Greg saying."
49:52,680;49:57,240;"Oh, he definitely calls wrong all the time. He's saying, yeah, you get you get"
49:57,240;49:59,480;"really upset by the commentators as well."
49:59,480;50:02,400;"Oh, he was talking about referees."
50:02,400;50:07,800;"The referees were bad in that series, but that's because they have no idea"
50:07,800;50:12,600;"how to how to referee on us because he just the way he plays basketball"
50:12,600;50:15,120;"is he just sticks his head down and just runs into people."
50:15,120;50:17,640;"And it's got to be a foul on someone."
50:17,640;50:21,440;"And like they can't figure it out because they're like, we can't just call it"
50:21,440;50:26,720;"foul every single time, but they kind of have to based on how they referee the game"
50:26,720;50:32,480;"now. So it's just a fucking mess. Yep. And he's a superstar. So you can't keep"
50:32,480;50:36,120;"on fouls on him. And then he can't. He's gonna fall out and then the NBA doesn't want"
50:36,120;50:40,280;"that VP. He just went with finals last year. He's super good. Yeah. Lots of"
50:40,280;50:43,200;"difference between the NBA and this podcast. I don't mind fouling."
50:43,200;50:49,240;"Gregor. A little bitch. So you're just gonna eject me from the pod right"
50:49,240;50:52,040;"there. Yeah. I was like, I was a much as hit the new booted."
50:54,200;50:57,360;"NBA Rach though are the most thin skinned little bitches ever."
50:57,360;50:58,640;"Oh, fuck it."
50:58,640;50:59,640;"They are."
50:59,640;51:02,160;"They are the biggest egos ever."
51:02,160;51:03,160;"It's brutal."
51:03,160;51:04,600;"Do you want to rant about it?"
51:04,600;51:07,960;"Dude who was gambling with the mob, like there's a big old black stain on their whole"
51:07,960;51:08,800;"fucking profession."
51:08,800;51:09,800;"Uh huh."
51:09,800;51:11,680;"Do you want to rant about it, Greg?"
51:11,680;51:12,680;"No."
51:12,680;51:15,760;"No, I think it's fine."
51:15,760;51:16,760;"All right."
51:16,760;51:17,760;"Well, all right."
51:17,760;51:21,640;"Next week on the podcast, it's going to be staring at Stan Van Gundy though."
51:21,640;51:23,640;"The announcer, he's the worst."
51:23,640;51:25,560;"He's sitting a Dom everything."
51:25,560;51:26,280;"What's next week?"
51:26,280;51:26,840;"Dom, man."
51:26,840;51:27,800;"Greg, what's next week?"
51:27,800;51:29,340;"Uh-uh."
51:29,340;51:31,000;"What is the price?"
51:31,000;51:31,560;"Seventeen."
51:31,560;51:32,400;"I don't know."
51:32,400;51:33,880;"I'm asking you because you're not going to watch it anyway."
51:33,880;51:35,320;"The playoffs are coming."
51:35,320;51:38,880;"It's like the Patriots annual week 17 by words like, all right."
51:38,880;51:39,960;"We're all wrapped up."
51:39,960;51:41,520;"Let's just have nothing to play for, right?"
51:41,520;51:41,960;"Yeah."
51:41,960;51:42,800;"Correct."
51:42,800;51:45,320;"They have they've wrapped up the two seed by beating the Jets."
51:45,320;51:49,080;"The Jets could have made the playoffs if they had won this game, but they did not."
51:49,080;51:50,600;"They will eventually make the playoffs."
51:50,600;51:52,960;"Let's save all that talk for next week at the week."
51:53,000;51:59,920;"But next week, Patriots are home hosting the two and 13"
51:59,920;52:01,320;"San Francisco 49ers."
52:01,320;52:03,400;"How much do you think tickets were for that game?"
52:03,400;52:06,320;"12 bucks, 12 50."
52:06,320;52:11,200;"Those are those games where like"
52:11,200;52:14,720;"all season ticket holders are like, Hey,"
52:14,720;52:16,680;"you want to go to a game?"
52:16,680;52:18,760;"Hey, you want to go to a little pal that I haven't talked to?"
52:18,760;52:20,840;"Yeah."
52:20,840;52:27,040;"Go ahead. So yeah, this one features San Francisco legend quarterback,"
52:27,040;52:30,360;"Ken Dorsey. So that should tell you a bit about how this goes."
52:30,360;52:33,200;"But they will figure it out."
52:33,200;52:34,760;"Not slander, Ken Dorsey."
52:34,760;52:36,000;"Pretty next week."
52:36,000;52:39,160;"Let's wait till we get a look at them on the Patriots."
52:39,160;52:41,240;"Donacy podcast."
52:41,240;52:43,160;"We have a slander."
52:43,160;52:45,600;"Yeah. Bye."
52:48,080;52:51,200;"fucking Craig. He useless."

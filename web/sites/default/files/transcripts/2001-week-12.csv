00:00,000;00:06,720;"This is Christine Brown, and while I have to listen to this podcast as my motherly duty,"
00:06,720;00:08,160;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,160;00:12,600;"My sons, and of course Michael, sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying"
00:12,600;00:15,600;"to be funny, but really they're just being stupid."
00:15,600;00:17,160;"You still want to listen?"
00:17,160;00:18,160;"Go right ahead."
00:18,160;00:19,680;"I am not your mother."
00:19,680;00:27,520;"Alright, welcome back, quality who are still with us, after the bullshit we've said."
00:27,520;00:33,520;"For the first 11 weeks, this is week 12 of the 2001 New England Patriots season where"
00:33,520;00:39,160;"the Pats go to travel to the metal land stadium back then, I believe so."
00:39,160;00:46,400;"They face the New York Jets, the 7 and 3 AFC East co-leaders New York Jets."
00:46,400;00:51,080;"The Pats are 6 and 5 right behind them tied with the Dolphins for the first in the AFC East."
00:51,080;00:58,200;"We've already talked about the Jets back in week two."
00:58,200;01:05,200;"Not much to talk about really other than that, so let's give a bit of an update into"
01:05,200;01:09,000;"how they're doing so far."
01:09,000;01:16,880;"Curtis Martin, there was a lot of talk about him in this game."
01:16,880;01:20,520;"They talked about his success and how well he had played against Patriots, and he had"
01:20,520;01:23,880;"some quote about how he wished he could play them eight games a year."
01:23,880;01:28,200;"I think the Patriots would disagree because the quote was in seven"
01:28,200;01:29,800;"reunions against the Patriots."
01:29,800;01:34,040;"You gain more than 100 yards against them five times, including"
01:34,040;01:38,320;"106 yards in the 10 to three Jets victory earlier in the season."
01:38,320;01:43,200;"And at this point, he was right up."
01:43,200;01:46,840;"I think he was always saying it's like 17 yards away from a thousand"
01:46,840;01:47,360;"yards season."
01:49,080;01:50,680;"And that's correct."
01:50,680;01:55,000;"Yeah, I think the 17 and which you would get in this game, of course,"
01:55,000;01:56,540;"because it's current smart against Patriots."
01:56,540;01:58,080;"Back then."
01:58,080;02:05,280;"And then that gave him a row, right?"
02:05,280;02:08,800;"Yeah, for his first seven seasons in a row, you know,"
02:08,800;02:10,320;"he was one of only three guys to do it."
02:10,320;02:12,680;"It was Barry Sanders and someone else."
02:12,680;02:14,080;"Eric Dickerson."
02:14,080;02:15,160;"Yes, thank you."
02:15,160;02:17,560;"Hey, we'd even need to fact check that."
02:17,560;02:18,320;"Look at you guys."
02:18,680;02:23,680;"I mean, I'm hiring whispers because I need to tighten up our game."
02:23,680;02:27,040;"But we actually have to get these stats from right."
02:27,040;02:28,680;"I don't know. I don't think so."
02:28,680;02:31,480;"I bet it different, but it doesn't feel right, does it?"
02:31,480;02:37,840;"Also, I think we touched on it last time, but the Patriots have lost the last"
02:37,840;02:43,400;"four games against the Jets now and seven of the eight, seven of the last eight"
02:43,400;02:47,000;"meetings. So beating the Jets, not something that happens often."
02:48,080;02:52,880;"probably most of that was usually because Bill Belichick was on the other side line"
02:52,880;02:55,960;"in some of the other games, but not anymore."
02:55,960;02:58,320;"But he I don't believe."
02:58,320;03:02,960;"Yeah, if they lost the last four, he had a lot of speed in the jets"
03:02,960;03:05,520;"up until this game."
03:05,520;03:09,280;"So this is his first time of him beating the Jets as a Page of State coach."
03:09,280;03:12,920;"Historic way to give it away, Andy."
03:12,920;03:15,040;"I know you just."
03:15,040;03:16,680;"Well, man."
03:16,680;03:19,520;"Who did your boys not watch the game?"
03:19,520;03:21,600;"Do you not know how this is going to end?"
03:21,600;03:22,720;"Yeah, but they don't."
03:22,720;03:26,800;"We got to build up to it, my friend."
03:26,800;03:27,800;"No."
03:27,800;03:28,800;"Um, no."
03:28,800;03:34,440;"What a podcast I do and I want."
03:34,440;03:35,440;"Well, that's fair."
03:35,440;03:40,240;"I mean, I guess we can gloss over the fact that some personnel did change in this game."
03:40,240;03:42,600;"All right, talk to me."
03:42,600;03:46,280;"Santana Moss actually became a little bit more involved this time around"
03:46,280;03:50,680;"Correct because he had been injured up until the week before and"
03:50,680;03:53,760;"He caught his first catch in this game"
03:53,760;03:59,120;"He was first quarter's career like yeah, I was career and I went for like 33 yards"
03:59,120;04:01,680;"Yeah"
04:01,680;04:03,680;"He kept the ball"
04:10,480;04:17,380;"Yeah, he does. Let's see. All right, I guess we'll just jump into the game. Talk about"
04:17,380;04:23,160;"the game of two halves. The first half was the Jets half, second half was Patriots half."
04:23,160;04:27,840;"Steve, what do you think about this first half? Did you have anything jumped out at"
04:27,840;04:32,440;"you? Well, the state of the stage, it was 53 degrees in December. Sounds like global warming"
04:32,440;04:40,360;"started early. Oh, yeah. Hey, now, hot take. Literally a hot take."
04:40,360;04:43,400;"Yeah, so the Patriots dynasty started global warming."
04:43,400;04:47,960;"Oh boy, everyone's going to get on our case."
04:47,960;04:49,680;"You know, you've got it done it, Steve."
04:49,680;04:51,400;"So it's their fault."
04:51,400;04:52,320;"The Earth is flat too."
04:52,320;04:52,920;"I'm assuming."
04:52,920;04:54,840;"All right."
04:54,840;04:56,160;"I guess we're going to have to talk about this."
04:56,160;04:57,520;"What do you guys think about all this stuff?"
04:57,520;04:57,880;"Go."
04:57,880;04:59,320;"No."
04:59,320;05:06,200;"I mean, if you watch that first, like drive, the first, like 10 minutes of the"
05:06,200;05:09,440;"game where tie loss slips gave it a touchdown."
05:09,480;05:12,480;"Jess are coming up and won at home."
05:12,480;05:13,800;"Crowd was real into it."
05:13,800;05:15,800;"You know, you guys are down like 10."
05:15,800;05:16,760;"Nothing super early."
05:16,760;05:18,600;"But in a test of already had a hundred years passing."
05:18,600;05:19,480;"They couldn't stop them."
05:19,480;05:22,400;"Whoa, are you re-shapping the entire game right now?"
05:22,400;05:24,520;"Oh, we're in minutes."
05:24,520;05:27,800;"I know, but man, we're blowing through material here."
05:27,800;05:30,800;"What are we going to talk about for the next week?"
05:30,800;05:33,120;"They call it a leaf liquor on the second drive."
05:33,120;05:33,920;"First play."
05:33,920;05:34,880;"Yeah, it was awesome."
05:34,880;05:35,960;"First play of the game."
05:35,960;05:36,960;"The deep shot there."
05:36,960;05:38,360;"They're coming out flinging it."
05:38,680;05:40,120;"Yeah, because they weren't known."
05:40,120;05:41,760;"I mean, it's Vinny Tesla, very as a quarterback."
05:41,760;05:45,520;"So not exactly known for chucking the ball down the field, but I think at one point,"
05:45,520;05:48,720;"they had like eight passes to two runs or something like that."
05:48,720;05:53,720;"Like they were tilted heavily, at least in the first, like quarter, quarter and a half"
05:53,720;05:54,720;"towards the passing game."
05:54,720;05:56,240;"And they were slinging it all over the place."
05:56,240;05:57,000;"Yeah."
05:57,000;05:57,840;"They were bombs."
05:57,840;05:59,360;"Yeah."
05:59,360;06:01,840;"And the paths were doing"
06:01,840;06:02,640;"a whole shit."
06:02,640;06:04,960;"I'm not going to use like 38 doing this."
06:04,960;06:05,720;"I believe."
06:05,720;06:09,080;"Yeah, so we decided last time he was right around there."
06:09,080;06:10,160;"He's definitely 38."
06:10,160;06:10,720;"They said it."
06:10,720;06:13,240;"So pretty impressive."
06:13,240;06:14,040;"Yeah."
06:14,040;06:17,160;"I mean, I was a press of 38 year old Tom Brady."
06:17,160;06:20,800;"You know, I was looking up Testa Verdi stats."
06:20,800;06:25,200;"It is 1988 season."
06:25,200;06:28,560;"Well, it's ridiculous."
06:28,560;06:31,320;"Is it you got drafted by the box when they were shitty?"
06:31,320;06:32,480;"Oh, yeah. Yeah."
06:32,880;06:37,280;"So in 15 games, you had a 47% completion percentage."
06:37,280;06:44,480;"32 hundred yards, 15 touchdowns and 35 picks."
06:44,480;06:49,200;"I'm not a star at every game the next year."
06:49,200;06:53,560;"I mean, that kind of sounds like Jamie's Winston a little bit."
06:53,560;06:55,320;"My little touch downs."
06:55,320;06:58,320;"Don't believe."
06:58,320;07:00,280;"Yeah. When was he drafted, Craig?"
07:01,240;07:04,520;"'87, so that was the second."
07:04,520;07:06,480;"- What round was he drafted?"
07:06,480;07:07,920;"Like how high was he drafted?"
07:07,920;07:08,760;"- I don't know."
07:08,760;07:11,240;"- Remember he was a stud at Miami."
07:11,240;07:12,240;"- Right, yeah."
07:12,240;07:13,160;"- Well, the view."
07:13,160;07:17,280;"- Well, he was like really highly talented coming out of school."
07:17,280;07:18,720;"But then he got drafted by a shitty team."
07:18,720;07:20,840;"So I think they just gave him like four or five years"
07:20,840;07:24,280;"to just like, you can't lose your job type of deal."
07:24,280;07:25,480;"- Yeah, yeah, holy shit, he was."
07:25,480;07:28,120;"He just drafted first overall in the '87 draft."
07:28,120;07:30,080;"- And then he had like a ton of,"
07:30,080;07:33,740;"He never threw for more touchdowns and picks for the box."
07:33,740;07:38,560;"And he got slightly better when he went to the Browns"
07:38,560;07:40,360;"and he had like two Pro Bowl seasons"
07:40,360;07:43,300;"and like 21 seasons that he played."
07:43,300;07:46,660;"- One with Baltimore, which I don't even remember."
07:46,660;07:49,680;"- Yeah, his like career, like yardage numbers"
07:49,680;07:54,320;"are like top 20 ever just 'cause he played for so long."
07:54,320;07:56,920;"- Played for the bats too."
07:56,920;07:59,000;"- Yeah, but yeah, he always sucked."
07:59,000;08:03,360;"Yeah. He's such for a long time."
08:03,360;08:06,000;"I mean, I mean,"
08:06,000;08:06,480;"you know,"
08:06,480;08:10,480;"the first solidly mediocre in some of these seasons,"
08:10,480;08:11,480;"it looks like."
08:11,480;08:16,360;"Like 3,000, 3,500 yards, 20-ish touchdown."
08:16,360;08:17,400;"Well, all right."
08:17,400;08:19,520;"17-ish touchdowns."
08:19,520;08:21,920;"I mean, yeah, he just played forever."
08:21,920;08:24,360;"Is he a bust as a first overall?"
08:24,360;08:26,440;"If you played 21 years."
08:26,440;08:27,360;"No."
08:27,360;08:29,960;"Anybody that plays one year is can't be a bust."
08:29,960;08:33,600;"Yeah, but he's never, like, he's never been good."
08:33,600;08:35,400;"He's a two-time pro bowler."
08:35,400;08:36,240;"Thank you very much."
08:36,240;08:37,120;"Never been good."
08:37,120;08:39,840;"Yeah, I don't know."
08:39,840;08:42,400;"It's a bust."
08:42,400;08:43,560;"Like James Winston."
08:43,560;08:45,720;"Dude, that's what I'm saying."
08:45,720;08:47,640;"Mine is the crab stealing."
08:47,640;08:50,560;"I'd rather know that."
08:50,560;08:51,840;"I don't know."
08:51,840;08:53,040;"We didn't have social media back then."
08:53,040;08:56,800;"I'm a big test of already fan."
08:56,800;08:58,560;"That's my flat."
08:58,560;09:00,200;"- What's that?"
09:00,200;09:01,760;"- He's just the man."
09:01,760;09:02,880;"- So I had a question."
09:02,880;09:05,000;"- It's a hard take, like."
09:05,000;09:07,120;"(laughing)"
09:07,120;09:08,200;"- I don't know where else to go with it."
09:08,200;09:09,400;"Of course he sucks."
09:09,400;09:13,760;"- So can any of you spell his name without looking?"
09:13,760;09:18,600;"'Cause I try it every time and I get it wrong every time."
09:18,600;09:20,520;"- Does he answer? - Yes."
09:20,520;09:21,440;"Test a green."
09:21,440;09:25,400;"- Ooh, that's good way to remember that."
09:25,400;09:27,840;"So what does test is stand for?"
09:27,840;09:28,920;"- Oh, stat check."
09:28,920;09:32,480;"- I thought you were gonna make something up about testicles,"
09:32,480;09:34,320;"but all right, you had to check that step."
09:34,320;09:36,680;"- Oh boy, okay."
09:36,680;09:39,120;"- All right, so he's checking that."
09:39,120;09:40,480;"Talk about..."
09:40,480;09:41,320;"- Greenhead."
09:41,320;09:43,860;"- Greenhead?"
09:43,860;09:45,040;"- It's head."
09:45,040;09:47,240;"So test of their day is greenhead."
09:47,240;09:48,080;"Any place like..."
09:48,080;09:50,800;"- Oh, it's..."
09:50,800;09:51,640;"- Look at this."
09:51,640;09:53,240;"- It's serendipity."
09:53,240;09:54,480;"That's what that is, right, Mike?"
09:54,480;09:58,280;"a new ground. I'm just I'm baffled by all of this."
09:58,280;10:02,240;"But I'm so that that right there is is something nobody's ever said about. But he says to"
10:02,240;10:02,880;"Verde, I think."
10:02,880;10:05,880;"Now you're not."
10:05,880;10:17,800;"This is going on quickly. It's kind of like this first half did. It went downhill very"
10:17,800;10:25,800;"quickly because the Jets defensive ends were basically doing whatever the fuck they wanted."
10:25,800;10:29,080;"And there was a lot of talk about..."
10:29,080;10:31,400;"What are you going to say?"
10:31,400;10:32,440;"It's definitely a total yard."
10:32,440;10:34,360;"Yeah, in the half."
10:34,360;10:43,080;"And there was a lot of talk about how... Let's see how Brady does when he has the same sort of"
10:43,080;10:49,560;"issues that TrueBledso has talking about no offensive line, no time to throw it, no running game,"
10:49,560;10:57,080;"which was basically this game. I thought that was interesting too, because we've seen shades of it"
10:57,080;11:03,480;"this, you know, during this season that Brady kind of like had a shitty game or whatever because of"
11:03,480;11:08,040;"maybe a little bit of pressure. This one was definitely the first one, I think that every play"
11:08,040;11:13,240;"was just he was getting hammered. So obviously they changed it up. I mean, the"
11:13,240;11:18,120;"announcers were even talking about how Weiss was changing the game plan so that"
11:18,120;11:22,440;"they were kind of doing the dinking and dunking the slants, the like screens,"
11:22,440;11:27,960;"that sort of thing. Do you think, because I don't remember Bledsoe ever really doing"
11:27,960;11:32,200;"that and I know he's not a finesse passer anyway, but do you think that Bledsoe"
11:32,200;11:36,840;"would have been successful in that type of system? That's a good question. It"
11:36,840;11:42,480;"never really seemed to be the strength of Bloodsos game. I can still picture at least"
11:42,480;11:50,480;"a few plays that I may have made up in my mind or that actually happened where he would"
11:50,480;11:56,040;"overthrow a guy in the flat or overthrow a screen blagers because he didn't really"
11:56,040;12:03,520;"have touch. He's more of a gun it down the field sort of guy. So, but I don't know if"
12:03,520;12:07,480;"that was just, you know, the offense was was tailored to that."
12:07,480;12:13,760;"And so he was more, uh, you laugh in the background noise."
12:13,760;12:14,320;"Yeah."
12:14,320;12:20,200;"Again, living in LA, baby."
12:20,200;12:23,320;"That'll get cut."
12:23,320;12:27,000;"Um, yeah."
12:27,000;12:32,080;"So I don't know if like they tailored down the field offense because of true"
12:32,080;12:35,840;"blood so and his strength was chucked down the field or"
12:35,840;12:40,720;"if they that's just how they did it. So he played that game and"
12:40,720;12:45,920;"like didn't have the opportunity to do more short stuff. But I don't"
12:45,920;12:46,200;"know."
12:46,200;12:48,880;"I don't think he had the decision making either."
12:48,880;12:52,720;"Yeah, he didn't seem that quick. And that was always the the"
12:52,720;12:56,520;"knock on him was that he would pat the ball three times and get"
12:56,520;12:58,640;"sacked, right? Wasn't that his mo?"
12:59,320;13:02,200;"You'd be like in someone's arms and you just like throw the ball up."
13:02,200;13:03,040;"Right."
13:03,040;13:03,760;"Like not."
13:03,760;13:04,480;"That's true."
13:04,480;13:05,840;"Give up on a play."
13:05,840;13:06,760;"Like you can."
13:06,760;13:08,720;"You got to read the defense and like, what is it?"
13:08,720;13:09,640;"Like three steps."
13:09,640;13:10,360;"Yeah."
13:10,360;13:10,960;"Right."
13:10,960;13:13,200;"So yeah, I guess that makes sense."
13:13,200;13:17,280;"I mean, you see, he was like the starting quarterback for a long enough time"
13:17,280;13:21,720;"that he probably would have come across a couple of screens or some short stuff."
13:21,720;13:23,160;"It's true."
13:23,160;13:25,520;"And I feel like we kind of shit on blood."
13:25,520;13:26,120;"So a lot."
13:26,560;13:29,400;"So I will say that I think, well, you do too."
13:29,400;13:30,900;"You just you literally just did."
13:30,900;13:39,920;"But I think that I think that that part of it also made him"
13:39,920;13:46,360;"like successful to for a long time because he kind of was for a long time."
13:46,360;13:49,040;"The only thing that the Patriots had."
13:49,040;13:52,560;"And so we did have that drive to always try to."
13:52,560;13:56,160;"Finish a play, I guess."
13:56,160;13:58,160;"for lack of a better way of putting it."
13:58,160;14:02,480;"Which something happened. Yeah, and I think it always"
14:02,480;14:10,080;"Like that he would try that in every play because he was kind of so maybe overwhelmed because he had no protection"
14:10,080;14:13,040;"He had no weapons. He had no anything. It was like just him"
14:13,040;14:17,360;"Well, I gotta get"
14:17,360;14:24,160;"You're in Paris and Jared got you think yeah, give him weapons in a good coach. He'll play great"
14:24,680;14:27,760;"Hmm that team is gonna look out of his depth"
14:27,760;14:36,600;"Hmm. I don't know if it's that big of a swing. I think Drew Bledso had enough talent that he could still"
14:36,600;14:43,600;"Pull himself through some games, but I think he had that mentality of always having to try and make something happen that"
14:43,600;14:48,580;"It kind of led to a lot of bad decisions. I think it's"
14:50,000;14:55,480;"So you think gotha gun sliner, you know, I guess I mean"
14:55,480;15:01,080;"Bledso is a little like tougher than goth. I feel like bless the one at least standing there and take it"
15:01,080;15:08,900;"Yeah, I think yeah, and I don't think you ever really see Bledso get as confused as goth does like golf in that"
15:08,900;15:12,280;"Super Bowl against the Patriots. He had no idea what was going on"
15:12,280;15:15,680;"I don't know if that's just cuz like that's how he was coached in the coaching let him down or"
15:15,680;15:19,240;"if he's just not a good decision maker I"
15:19,240;15:28,240;"But Bledso, I mean, he would make stupid decisions, but he would also perform kind of on his own too, you know?"
15:28,240;15:36,240;"Well, I was just wondering, does he hold the ball long enough to come off as not knowing what's going on?"
15:36,240;15:39,240;"Because, I mean, he'd throw a pick before he analyzed it."
15:39,240;15:46,240;"So maybe, maybe Gough just looks at it because he might hold the ball a little longer."
15:46,240;15:53,160;"I'm not sure. I mean like you said he did he did the interception over his head toss once again"
15:53,160;15:56,240;"Yeah, I mean what did I call him but clenched blood so"
15:56,240;16:03,160;"Yeah, because every time he draws back on third down you just like tighten up just"
16:03,160;16:05,440;"flexibly"
16:05,440;16:10,040;"He was a nice man, okay, and I think he makes good wine"
16:10,040;16:14,800;"I haven't tried it yet, but the word on the street is he makes good winemies and nice man"
16:15,080;16:17,080;"Maybe we should do an episode"
16:17,080;16:25,080;"Where we all order a bottle of wine drink it before we do the episode and we'll do a review of oh"
16:25,080;16:29,760;"That's a wine. I got the perfect game. I'm doing the Cabernet"
16:29,760;16:36,600;"His first his first game when he plays for the bills. That's good idea. That's a hell of an idea. Oh"
16:36,600;16:42,920;"I mean, I think we yeah, I think that's a pretty good idea. All right, so we'll put that in the"
16:43,480;16:49,480;"You guys actually have to drink though because I'm gonna commit and I don't want to come off stupid on here. Got it. Got for a bit"
16:49,480;16:52,040;"Caught for a bit"
16:52,040;16:54,520;"You got a reputation uphold no comment"
16:54,520;17:03,480;"What's the bad news? It's like a hundred dollars a bottle"
17:03,480;17:07,400;"Andy boy"
17:07,400;17:09,640;"The ratings are gonna be"
17:11,560;17:17,280;"We may have to start a patreon to get some or maybe go fund me see people donate to us"
17:17,280;17:21,820;"$100 a bottle. I'm fine. I'm gonna see you with the cheapest one is I"
17:21,820;17:24,960;"Mean that's a problem for me"
17:24,960;17:29,780;"But I mean we are podcast is for not made money"
17:29,780;17:34,240;"Let's be real by the time we get to that bills game. We're all gonna be rich and famous. So whenever"
17:34,240;17:39,880;"Yeah, I do like this idea though. All right, all right here. We go here. We go"
17:39,880;17:42,880;"What we're going to do is we're going to crowd fund this"
17:42,880;17:45,920;"via the bills mafia"
17:45,920;17:51,600;"Because if anybody one likes to raise money and two likes to drink it's the bills mafia"
17:51,600;17:56,760;"That's true. So this does seem like a good cause so we'll have to see if we can reach out to them"
17:56,760;17:59,880;"Yeah, so listen to this"
17:59,880;18:02,080;"The morning's website here"
18:02,080;18:09,060;"The president and director of wine making it says is Josh McDaniel's"
18:09,060;18:12,060;"Is he Josh McDaniel's?"
18:12,060;18:15,340;"Well, no, that's a crazy coincidence."
18:15,340;18:17,740;"How many are there out there?"
18:17,740;18:20,420;"Because Josh McDaniel was part of the team here."
18:20,420;18:22,100;"What was he doing?"
18:22,100;18:24,500;"He's like offensive assistant."
18:24,500;18:25,900;"Yeah, wasn't he?"
18:25,900;18:28,740;"Didn't he start at the QB coach?"
18:28,740;18:30,700;"Do I have that wrong?"
18:30,700;18:33,220;"Oh boy, we got to stat check this."
18:33,220;18:38,740;"2001 is a personnel assistant and then a defensive coaching assistant working with"
18:38,740;18:42,940;"defensive backs. And then he was in 2004, became team's quarterback coach."
18:42,940;18:46,580;"That was off for a little bit. But yeah, he was on the team in 2000."
18:46,580;18:49,620;"This is first season. I mean, it was such a unique name like that."
18:49,620;18:53,580;"It can't be a different person. I mean, and they do have that overlap."
18:53,580;18:56,020;"You would think it's the same. It's a different person."
18:56,020;18:57,620;"Now,"
18:57,620;18:59,940;"I walk his bio."
18:59,940;19:05,900;"Foreign raised in wall wall and at an early age fell in love with the wine industry."
19:06,260;19:07,260;"Josh."
19:07,260;19:10,980;"It was Washington State with that."
19:10,980;19:12,980;"What are the odds of that?"
19:12,980;19:13,980;"That's hilarious."
19:13,980;19:15,780;"It's a beautiful story."
19:15,780;19:20,780;"Drew Bledso knows in his work with two separate Josh McDaniels."
19:20,780;19:21,780;"Yeah."
19:21,780;19:22,780;"Wow."
19:22,780;19:24,780;"And it worked out for him."
19:24,780;19:27,060;"I want to know 20 legs better."
19:27,060;19:28,060;"Two times."
19:28,060;19:30,260;"I know what my guess is."
19:30,260;19:31,780;"Come on, it's linked in."
19:31,780;19:34,660;"I'm going to drop my life."
19:34,660;19:40,040;"Yes, it's yes, see if we can get some bottles donated Greg. You know connecting with them. All right"
19:40,040;19:46,500;"Yeah, I mean the review will go a long way for them. So I think they should what is it four bottles?"
19:46,500;19:52,300;"It's not bad. We have tens of listeners, too. Yeah, I mean we have"
19:52,300;19:55,060;"20s of listeners"
19:55,060;20:00,180;"If by the time this one gets released we might have like all right all right all right. So here's the issue"
20:00,180;20:03,380;"I just went to how many of me calm"
20:04,060;20:07,560;"Which you can search for people with your first and last name"
20:07,560;20:12,280;"Quote I've done this. There are a lot of Andrew Browns. Just gonna you know spoiler alert"
20:12,280;20:15,520;"There are 38,000"
20:15,520;20:18,000;"75 people in United States with the first name Josh"
20:18,000;20:23,840;"There are 8,477 people last in McDaniel's there is one person"
20:23,840;20:28,520;"There is one person in the United States named Josh McDaniel's according to this website"
20:28,520;20:31,120;"This is bullshit because we just determined that there's tool"
20:31,620;20:33,620;"Yeah, oh"
20:33,620;20:41,000;"Holy shit wait a minute what if Josh Daniels from the Patriots is lying about his identity on the website"
20:41,000;20:43,180;"Maybe he changes name when he got married"
20:43,180;20:49,700;"He's embarrassed"
20:49,700;20:54,740;"Oh man, I'm confused. So I'm just gonna step away from this conversation"
20:54,740;20:56,740;"So are we thinking that there aren't"
20:56,740;20:59,620;"4,565"
20:59,620;21:01,460;"Andrew Browns in the United States"
21:01,460;21:04,700;"There's definitely way more, way more."
21:04,700;21:06,260;"One Josh."
21:06,260;21:10,340;"Didn't you say there's 3,000 McDaniels?"
21:10,340;21:12,620;"8,000 McDaniels, 84."
21:12,620;21:13,120;"8,000."
21:13,120;21:15,660;"Do you know how many people are in the United States?"
21:15,660;21:16,020;"Yeah."
21:16,020;21:17,100;"Lots."
21:17,100;21:18,580;"You're right now."
21:18,580;21:19,100;"Thank you."
21:19,100;21:19,600;"Yeah."
21:19,600;21:20,700;"Greg is right."
21:20,700;21:21,100;"How many?"
21:21,100;21:24,860;"So 300 plus million."
21:24,860;21:25,360;"Yeah."
21:25,360;21:26,180;"All right."
21:26,180;21:26,900;"So I don't know."
21:26,900;21:28,660;"I have my doubts about this website."
21:28,660;21:31,300;"I think the real question is, what is there more?"
21:31,300;21:33,280;"Andy, Greg or Steve Brown's?"
21:33,280;21:34,200;"- Are you wanna know something funny?"
21:34,200;21:37,320;"Is that, where went to college?"
21:37,320;21:41,960;"There's a kid the gray below me, Gregory D Brown."
21:41,960;21:43,280;"- Oh shit."
21:43,280;21:46,120;"- Yeah, Facebook friends, he's kind of a loser."
21:46,120;21:50,800;"- You wanna put it out there and like reach out to him?"
21:50,800;21:52,640;"Like do you have some beef or something"
21:52,640;21:55,360;"that you wanna squash and put it out there right now?"
21:55,360;21:56,440;"- No."
21:56,440;21:57,480;"- All right."
21:57,480;22:01,520;"So I set up a Google News alert for my name,"
22:01,520;22:03,840;"'cause you can just set up any search term."
22:03,840;22:07,840;"And so every week I get a list of all the Andrew Browns"
22:07,840;22:09,040;"in the news."
22:09,040;22:12,040;"There is a defensive lineman for the Bengals,"
22:12,040;22:14,520;"who's probably the most famous other than me."
22:14,520;22:16,200;"- How many do I have? - How many do I have?"
22:16,200;22:17,040;"- Have we?"
22:17,040;22:18,840;"- Yeah, and Steve's the yo-yo guy."
22:18,840;22:22,840;"- Oh, well, we were looking up, we were googling the NAMM,"
22:22,840;22:25,240;"and remember I found a lot of murderers"
22:25,240;22:27,240;"and a lot of other stuff."
22:27,240;22:28,840;"named Andy Brown."
22:28,840;22:31,480;"Yeah, there's not a lot of Andy Brown's."
22:31,480;22:34,160;"So we see a lot of that."
22:34,160;22:36,880;"I think there's a lot of southern Andy Brown's that--"
22:36,880;22:37,880;"Here's the bigger question."
22:37,880;22:39,600;"--the trouble with the law."
22:39,600;22:42,280;"What I'm fascinated by is why do you"
22:42,280;22:44,760;"have a Google alert on your name?"
22:44,760;22:47,480;"Because I want to see how Google alerts worked."
22:47,480;22:49,240;"And I thought it'd be funny because I've"
22:49,240;22:52,280;"heard of people with actual interesting names do it."
22:52,280;22:54,280;"I'm like, oh, what will show up on me?"
22:54,280;22:56,280;"And so there's a park named after me in Texas"
22:56,280;22:57,460;"that I want to go visit."
22:57,460;22:58,980;"I learned things from it."
22:58,980;23:01,060;"So I think it was a good investment."
23:01,060;23:01,900;"- Sounds amazing."
23:01,900;23:06,900;"- I have to say I haven't met a lot of Mike Mallows,"
23:06,900;23:08,620;"but I'll keep an eye out."
23:08,620;23:10,920;"- When I worked at movie scene,"
23:10,920;23:13,820;"I put a flag on every single Steve Brown's account"
23:13,820;23:16,340;"and said I lived on street call me if he comes in."
23:16,340;23:17,180;"(laughing)"
23:17,180;23:19,020;"And I'm working and Steve Brown came in to write a movie."
23:19,020;23:20,540;"He was like 45 years old."
23:20,540;23:24,120;"Strange, but we had a nice chat about nicknames."
23:25,380;23:26,380;"Oh boy."
23:26,380;23:28,900;"I miss all of these interactions."
23:28,900;23:32,420;"I've got to get a better name, I guess."
23:32,420;23:37,500;"Yeah the brown and the brown really gives you a head start of the last name."
23:37,500;23:41,980;"Alright so I just want to Josh a LinkedIn request."
23:41,980;23:46,620;"That's a big fan of the wine."
23:46,620;23:47,620;"Let's connect."
23:47,620;23:49,620;"Oh that's good."
23:49,620;23:51,620;"Yeah I don't want to, you know."
23:51,620;23:53,060;"No yeah, they're doing the slow play."
23:53,060;23:54,060;"I like that."
23:54,060;23:58,860;"spoke my own. So wait, do you have the podcast in your LinkedIn, though?"
23:58,860;24:05,660;"No. Okay, so we can't you can't track back. Of course not. By the time this episode comes"
24:05,660;24:09,700;"up, that's going to be the only thing on my LinkedIn. Probably because I've been fired"
24:09,700;24:15,940;"from my real job for spending so much time doing this. Oh, dude. Oh, don't admit that."
24:15,940;24:19,300;"Yo, I'm logged in under Kelly's."
24:19,300;24:24,340;"Oh, that'll be interesting."
24:24,340;24:25,340;"That might be better."
24:25,340;24:25,660;"I might."
24:25,660;24:26,620;"Yeah, that might work."
24:26,620;24:34,780;"See, really."
24:34,780;24:38,060;"Regularly on Kelly's LinkedIn."
24:38,060;24:42,180;"His mind won't vlog into zoom."
24:42,180;24:43,300;"Oh, that's right."
24:44,380;24:54,060;"Oh boy. It's a happy accident. I think that'll work out for the best for everybody involved,"
24:54,060;24:59,340;"including Kelly. We'll give her some of the wine if we get some. Yeah. All right. All"
24:59,340;25:06,220;"right. So speaking of the jet football game, the first, first half bad, second half good."
25:08,060;25:11,740;"So the paths go into the half down 13 nothing."
25:11,740;25:16,140;"And would you say Steve they had 60 something yards of total offense?"
25:16,140;25:17,260;"Until the yards."
25:17,260;25:17,940;"Yeah."
25:17,940;25:18,980;"So not a lot."
25:18,980;25:22,700;"But the, to be fair though, the defense."
25:22,700;25:25,900;"Did okay against the Jets."
25:25,900;25:29,980;"I mean, considering they were swinging it and momentum early on."
25:29,980;25:36,380;"Like, um, they, uh, you know, sometime before the half, I think it was in the first quarter."
25:36,380;25:37,700;"They had that goal line stand."
25:37,900;25:40,600;"So it could have been, they could have been down to touchdowns real quick."
25:40,600;25:45,380;"And they, they stuffed the offense at the one."
25:45,380;25:48,520;"So that made it what they were down by 10."
25:48,520;25:49,620;"So that was pretty impressive."
25:49,620;25:50,020;"Yeah."
25:50,020;25:50,900;"That was the first quarter."
25:50,900;25:51,100;"Yeah."
25:51,100;25:52,660;"And now Teddy Bruce."
25:52,660;25:54,460;"He came in with the stop and the final one."
25:54,460;25:55,780;"Oh, man."
25:55,780;25:57,100;"Yeah."
25:57,100;25:57,540;"Yeah."
25:57,540;26:02,940;"Him and Brian Cox, it was Curtis Martin tried to jump over the pile and just hit"
26:02,940;26:04,220;"a brick wall of the two of them."
26:04,220;26:06,100;"Beautiful."
26:06,380;26:07,740;"broken long as a huge bite."
26:07,740;26:08,180;"Yeah."
26:08,180;26:10,580;"And yeah, this was Brian Cox's first game back"
26:10,580;26:12,620;"from when he broke his leg in Denver."
26:12,620;26:16,140;"You know, because there was an article in the globe"
26:16,140;26:21,100;"about how he recovered from a broken leg quicker than Terry"
26:21,100;26:26,900;"Glenn recovered from his quote unquote hamstring injury."
26:26,900;26:29,180;"Hamstrings are tough, man."
26:29,180;26:30,500;"I guess."
26:30,500;26:34,380;"You don't buy a sneaky surprise at the season."
26:34,380;26:36,180;"What was your sneaky surprise at the season?"
26:36,180;26:39,220;"Brian Cox. Yeah. Awesome dude."
26:39,220;26:40,620;"Yeah."
26:40,620;26:43,460;"The way he plays, he's just a monster."
26:43,460;26:45,860;"Yeah. He was, uh,"
26:45,860;26:49,660;"he was screaming at the rest for something. I don't even know what it was."
26:49,660;26:52,740;"I haven't known it. It was like on the field goal attempt."
26:52,740;26:53,860;"Yeah."
26:53,860;26:57,420;"Hits ahead. They like the Jets were off size or fall."
26:57,420;26:58,020;"Yes."
26:58,020;27:00,740;"All right. And the rest called it and he was just"
27:00,740;27:02,020;"you live it."
27:02,020;27:03,460;"Yeah."
27:03,460;27:07,800;"Yeah, he had to get pulled away from the referee so he wouldn't get another 15 yard on sportsman like conduct."
27:07,800;27:08,320;"Oh yeah."
27:08,320;27:10,440;"Like literally dragged away."
27:10,440;27:12,800;"That's great."
27:12,800;27:13,460;"Yeah."
27:13,460;27:15,700;"We really imagined who she is miked up."
27:15,700;27:16,460;"That'd be amazing."
27:16,460;27:17,600;"Oh, man."
27:17,600;27:22,000;"Well, uh, I posted a link to the NFL prime time."
27:22,000;27:26,400;"Uh, highlight video mainly for Greg, because he never watches the game."
27:26,400;27:30,080;"Um, but at the end of it, they had an interview with him."
27:30,700;27:36,940;"And he was basically saying, yeah, we actually played like shit, but we still beat the Jets."
27:36,940;27:44,260;"So it'll be nice if, you know, it's nice that we can still like not play very good and beat a team like this."
27:44,260;27:47,020;"So I'm excited for when we actually play good."
27:47,020;27:49,020;"And that was the whole interview."
27:49,020;27:52,380;"Is that word for word?"
27:52,380;27:55,140;"I am pretty sure that was verbatim."
27:55,140;27:56,620;"Oh, boy."
27:56,620;27:57,660;"My wasn't."
27:57,660;28:02,340;"But my favorite quote of that was because it was Chris Berman"
28:02,340;28:09,740;"Obviously prime time. Oh, yeah, it was a point where the path receiver Coleman caught it and he got"
28:09,740;28:17,440;"And so so many I haven't seen this many Coleman since LLB put a sale on those little"
28:17,440;28:26,540;"Those little like girl things it wasn't as smooth as line, but he got there. Oh my god"
28:26,540;28:31,060;"I'm so fucking funny. I miss NFL prime time so badly."
28:31,060;28:37,860;"So that was a quick first ever catch he had to career."
28:37,860;28:40,060;"Are you a patriot?"
28:40,060;28:42,380;"Or in general?"
28:42,380;28:43,500;"His entire career?"
28:43,500;28:45,420;"Yeah, and it felt."
28:45,420;28:46,340;"Oh, crap."
28:46,340;28:47,180;"And now he's one of them."
28:47,180;28:47,980;"That was a big catch."
28:47,980;28:49,620;"Well, I didn't recognize him."
28:49,620;28:50,460;"Yeah."
28:50,460;28:51,460;"Nope."
28:51,460;28:53,340;"So it was like what to open the second half."
28:53,340;28:56,140;"They're kind of like a couple of first downs and then hit him"
28:56,140;28:57,740;"like 45 yard all the way down."
28:57,740;28:58,780;"So yeah, first."
28:58,780;28:59,900;"Yeah."
28:59,900;29:03,940;"So this is the beginning of the half, passed, got the ball"
29:03,940;29:06,340;"and went backwards immediately."
29:06,340;29:09,340;"I think it was like a run got stuffed and then Brady got sacked and they went"
29:09,340;29:11,500;"three and out and they punted."
29:11,500;29:14,660;"Uh, the pun thing in this game was horrendous."
29:14,660;29:18,580;"And so Ken Walter managed to punt it to his own 35."
29:18,580;29:23,420;"So Jessica the ball at the New England 35 and then, um,"
29:23,580;29:29,660;"Vable picks off the batter ball like a couple plays later. Oh, yeah, and then knows that big plate of Coleman his"
29:29,660;29:32,140;"one of two ever catches"
29:32,140;29:40,040;"Which goes like 35 yards the Pat I think like planted like six or seven straight times before they did anything. Oh"
29:40,040;29:42,620;"Yes, as a one two three"
29:42,620;29:46,220;"four five"
29:46,220;29:50,720;"I think there's six of these. Yeah. Yeah, so they punted on all five"
29:51,900;29:55,260;"One of them though went to the one-yard line. So that was helpful. I think"
29:55,260;30:01,540;"Can we talk about Tom to Mike that we we touched on that dude? No, but"
30:01,540;30:05,900;"We could do a whole like thing on him because the the year before"
30:05,900;30:12,580;"There's all kinds of stuff that ties into the dynasty, but that's for another day"
30:12,580;30:15,740;"We'll do a punter"
30:15,740;30:18,260;"episode just from Mike"
30:18,260;30:21,600;"All right, because I don't know if like Greg remembers anything about time to but"
30:21,600;30:27,340;"There was a game against the patch like before this season where he came in as a quarterback"
30:27,340;30:32,800;"He was lightening it up and there's a lot of things that are tied into that guy in that game the year prior"
30:32,800;30:35,780;"So yeah, they went with any got hurt right"
30:35,780;30:39,820;"Any throw a question on a quiche on Johnson. Yes"
30:39,820;30:42,340;"He is also"
30:42,340;30:45,780;"When he was a member of the Browns Bill Belichick's Browns"
30:45,780;30:48,580;"he was the first ever player to score two point conversion."
30:48,580;30:50,660;"Oh, no, shit. That's awesome."
30:50,660;30:54,100;"It was a lot of like a fake field goal attempt and he was the holder."
30:54,100;30:59,460;"For those that don't know, he's a quarterback punter combo."
30:59,460;31:05,380;"He was drafted by, I believe, the Cardinals as a quarterback and then they converted,"
31:05,380;31:08,980;"they converted, he punted in college. They eventually converted him to punter."
31:08,980;31:11,780;"Yeah, he was an all-American punter in college."
31:11,780;31:13,620;"Yeah, as well as a starting quarterback."
31:13,620;31:15,720;"And get this as a child."
31:15,720;31:19,260;"It was obviously the one pass kick."
31:19,260;31:21,380;"Seven finalists three times."
31:21,380;31:22,580;"No."
31:22,580;31:23,580;"Yeah."
31:23,580;31:24,780;"Oh, dude, I remember that."
31:24,780;31:25,460;"That was awesome."
31:25,460;31:26,740;"I mean, all right."
31:26,740;31:29,260;"Quarterback kick."
31:29,260;31:31,660;"He's going to be fucking winning fun, fast and kick."
31:31,660;31:32,940;"Fucking hope so."
31:32,940;31:35,180;"That's awesome."
31:35,180;31:36,540;"Yeah, it's him."
31:36,540;31:37,540;"Yeah."
31:37,540;31:39,420;"It's great."
31:39,420;31:40,820;"It's a roster spot, right?"
31:40,820;31:42,140;"Absolutely."
31:42,140;31:42,860;"Oh, hell yeah."
31:43,420;31:44,940;"Emergency quarterback."
31:44,940;31:49,220;"Well, before we go too far into the second half,"
31:49,220;31:54,340;"I just wanted to say that there were a couple of drives"
31:54,340;31:55,660;"that Brady struggled with."
31:55,660;31:59,140;"One, he got blasted by my moluist."
31:59,140;32:01,900;"And I thought, like, came across my mind where I'm like,"
32:01,900;32:04,980;"what if he just happened to go through what"
32:04,980;32:07,740;"Bledto went through, and then he just lost his job"
32:07,740;32:10,300;"and we never hear anything again?"
32:10,300;32:17,820;"I actually wrote down that my note from O'Lewis was that he was trying to kill both of the Patriots quarterbacks because he"
32:17,820;32:24,820;"Although on that play like it looked really bad in real time, but then you could see actually eased up at the end of that hit."
32:24,820;32:26,500;"Oh, really? I missed that part."
32:26,500;32:34,060;"Yeah, just just just barely, but I think he may have had to leave on his conscience about killing."
32:34,060;32:36,000;"Certainly wasn't like rocking the passer flags."
32:36,000;32:38,300;"I don't think I've seen a single one of those yet this year."
32:39,500;32:47,100;"No, we've seen a few that probably should have been where Brady will slide and still get lit up."
32:47,100;32:48,500;"Right."
32:48,500;32:50,540;"Like a helmet to the face mask sort of thing."
32:50,540;32:53,620;"But yeah, no, I don't think we've seen what you have that I can remember."
32:53,620;32:57,620;"Well, and then the other thing that like stuck out to me in the first half was."
32:57,620;33:03,860;"So Brady had a fumble that was actually incomplete, right?"
33:03,860;33:06,300;"So his arms moving forward."
33:06,300;33:09,180;"the announcers freaking out that it's called the open hand rule."
33:09,180;33:14,340;"And they were debating on if it was a, you know, an incomplete, if it was a fumble,"
33:14,340;33:17,940;"then literally the same drive Brady Fumbles"
33:17,940;33:19,660;"his hands moving backwards."
33:19,660;33:21,100;"I think it was the next play."
33:21,100;33:23,100;"It might have been the next play."
33:23,100;33:27,660;"And I thought it was pretty funny because it seemed like based on what the"
33:27,660;33:31,740;"announcers were talking about, it wasn't like a familiar thing already as it stood."
33:31,740;33:35,340;"So I thought it was like pretty good foreshadowing for later in the season."
33:35,820;33:42,820;"Yeah, no kidding. Yeah, but I actually had a note on that too, because it was right at the end of the half."
33:42,820;33:49,820;"So the Patriots hit the ball with like two minutes left and that it was an obvious forward pass."
33:49,820;33:57,820;"And like even in real time, you could tell it was a forward pass, but the Jets challenged it anyway and lost their last time out."
33:57,820;34:02,820;"And so then the Patriots ran the clock down like 30 seconds before they punted it."
34:03,820;34:08,340;"And so the Jets got the ball back with 29 seconds I have."
34:08,340;34:10,540;"And so instead of being able to take a couple of shots"
34:10,540;34:11,900;"to get within field goal range,"
34:11,900;34:13,020;"which at this point,"
34:13,020;34:15,380;"probably would have been the game winning field goal,"
34:15,380;34:18,260;"they have tried Hail Mary,"
34:18,260;34:19,900;"which they tried the Hail Mary,"
34:19,900;34:22,060;"and that was probably the most,"
34:22,060;34:25,460;"one of the most bizarre plays we've seen this season"
34:25,460;34:28,460;"because Vinnie Testa Verde gets strip sacked,"
34:28,460;34:32,100;"Curtis Martin recovers it and runs for like 20, 30 yards,"
34:32,100;34:35,460;"It's like inside the red zone before getting tackled."
34:35,460;34:37,980;"Did I can't believe that he didn't try to lateral that."
34:37,980;34:43,180;"Yeah, it did feel a little bit like the beginning of the Miami miracle to me."
34:43,180;34:45,220;"Oh, the announcer thought he's going all the way."
34:45,220;34:46,020;"They were so excited."
34:46,020;34:50,180;"Well, he broke a couple of tackles and you're like, uh, oh, dude, the"
34:50,180;34:53,180;"announcer's though, man, Brent Jones, we already have a history with that guy."
34:53,180;34:56,620;"But did you not see my use jacked up for this game?"
34:56,620;34:57,380;"Like something was wrong."
34:58,380;35:02,940;"Like every statement he had was like a hyperbole was like losing his mind."
35:02,940;35:07,780;"So I'm a little self conscious about talking about commentators, but since you've brought them up,"
35:07,780;35:10,500;"I have, I have some things here."
35:10,500;35:13,580;"Well, do they talk to the things that I have?"
35:13,580;35:16,060;"No, probably not."
35:16,060;35:18,340;"I don't listen to the game the way you listen to the game."
35:18,340;35:20,420;"Wow."
35:20,420;35:22,180;"Brent Jones is being in the game."
35:22,180;35:23,180;"It's just going stupid."
35:23,180;35:28,340;"And I quote the Jets are just as explosive as the Rams."
35:28,340;35:32,160;"on offense. I mean, for the for a drive and a half."
35:32,160;35:36,820;"Exactly. The first two drives when they actually decide to throw the ball,"
35:36,820;35:40,060;"it's like, well, they have speed on the outside with these little receivers and"
35:40,060;35:44,540;"they have Curtis Martin to keep you on. It's not like that. It's not quite the same"
35:44,540;35:51,620;"Brent, but okay. And then go into game break with. Oh, what's his name?"
35:51,620;35:55,500;"But they always go to the game break too. They go to New York."
35:55,820;36:06,140;"Kurt? No. I can't remember. But the the game break was a Colts game. And I guess"
36:06,140;36:11,740;"Peyton Manning must be throwing a lot of interceptions this year because they showed,"
36:11,740;36:15,100;"I guess it was against the Ravens and they showed the Ravens who are touched down. And then right"
36:15,100;36:18,620;"at the end, they slipped in the line of and Manning has not been picked off to this point."
36:18,620;36:22,940;"And it was like halfway through the first quarter."
36:24,140;36:28,140;"Well, I think he throws a bunch of like there's a game where he had thrown like four. Yeah."
36:28,140;36:33,020;"When you mentioned that, I thought that they meant all year, but they were talking about that game."
36:33,020;36:37,100;"Yeah. Oh, okay. Yeah. And it was early in the first quarter."
36:37,100;36:43,580;"Yeah, you got a stack check for you. All right. On that explosive offense comment."
36:43,580;36:50,300;"Yes. Jets finished the season with the 17th ranked offense in the half."
36:50,940;36:53,300;"Oh, wow, that's a good good call there."
36:53,300;36:54,780;"Pretty explosive."
36:54,780;36:56,300;"Rams play how many."
36:56,300;36:58,540;"Patriots were six."
36:58,540;37:01,820;"Oh, I'm just going by points scored."
37:01,820;37:04,460;"OK, what about by yards gained?"
37:04,460;37:07,380;"Yeah, yeah."
37:07,380;37:09,020;"Look at that guy here."
37:09,020;37:13,660;"That's where 24."
37:13,660;37:19,980;"Well, OK, so that didn't help."
37:20,300;37:21,700;"Brent's argument at all either."
37:21,700;37:26,380;"Um, I will say though, to Brent's defense, this is the first game that I've"
37:26,380;37:28,400;"actually been more annoyed with Gus Johnson."
37:28,400;37:29,700;"Really?"
37:29,700;37:30,180;"Yeah."
37:30,180;37:31,900;"I didn't really know the last thing."
37:31,900;37:33,660;"Was driving me nuts."
37:33,660;37:35,140;"It was like he's doing the."
37:35,140;37:41,020;"Like the whole game was that I don't know if it was because Brent is just insane"
37:41,020;37:45,420;"and he's just sick of him or because Gus has nothing else to add, but that."
37:45,420;37:48,380;"I mean, my guess is that irritating."
37:48,900;37:53,860;"Brent Jones is getting riled up and Gus Johnson didn't want to get smacked around up there."
37:53,860;37:55,340;"They're together in a booth."
37:55,340;37:59,660;"So you got to go like, did you hear the little like little thing that they got into where it"
37:59,660;38:04,980;"should like Santa Claus and like sit on his lap and then Brent goes, Gus, maybe if you"
38:04,980;38:08,420;"get married, you could have a son sitting on Santa's lap."
38:08,420;38:09,700;"And he's like, I hope so."
38:09,700;38:15,020;"And then Brent is like, I hope you get married or you hope you have a son."
38:15,020;38:16,700;"And then there's like silence."
38:18,540;38:21,940;"And then Gus goes, you're putting me on a tough spot here, buddy."
38:21,940;38:26,500;"He went back to the game, but that laughs is driving me nuts."
38:26,500;38:27,100;"Yeah."
38:27,100;38:29,060;"It was because he wanted to sit on Santa's lap."
38:29,060;38:30,180;"That's what he was hoping for."
38:30,180;38:32,140;"And ask for what?"
38:32,140;38:34,860;"A son, I don't know."
38:34,860;38:38,380;"There's something there's something deeper there."
38:38,380;38:39,700;"So I'm looking through."
38:39,700;38:41,660;"Yeah, I'm going to leave that one alone."
38:41,660;38:44,180;"He said enough dumb shit today."
38:44,900;38:50,180;"But did you notice how excited Brent Jones was about the height of the grass?"
38:50,180;38:53,940;"No, on and on about how"
38:53,940;38:58,940;"the the edges of the field had taller grass in the middle was much"
38:58,940;39:03,500;"softer and shorter and easier to run in but the outside was easier to cut on and"
39:03,500;39:07,740;"Every time the ball went to the outside or those run up the middle. He would comment about the grass"
39:07,740;39:11,260;"I I don't know why I don't feel like learn something new"
39:11,620;39:18,060;"And now is his step that he was gonna keep going on did you pick out last time that he was like obsessed with Canadian blue seats?"
39:18,060;39:20,060;"Was that the same guy?"
39:20,060;39:23,940;"Canadian blue steel wasn't it oh steel. Yeah, but yeah"
39:23,940;39:27,460;"Yeah, I think so"
39:27,460;39:30,020;"Maybe he's into details"
39:30,020;39:37,260;"Maybe you know his daughter played for the Boston breakers the women's professional soccer team"
39:38,980;39:43,980;"She won and CHA championships at UNC."
39:43,980;39:46,140;"- Oh, so she's big time."
39:46,140;39:47,320;"- Big time, hot shot."
39:47,320;39:49,620;"- That's pretty sweet."
39:49,620;39:50,780;"- Athletic families, dude."
39:50,780;39:55,260;"- I did have some questions though,"
39:55,260;39:58,020;"if you guys want to help me out again."
39:58,020;39:59,540;"- Oh yeah, let's do this."
39:59,540;40:02,180;"- It's a Brent Jones game, so we know this is gonna happen."
40:02,180;40:03,500;"- So football, not football."
40:03,500;40:04,340;"Give it to me."
40:04,340;40:05,580;"- Football or not football, yup."
40:05,580;40:08,580;"All right, here we go."
40:08,580;40:11,340;"I'll just start with the first one that I have."
40:11,340;40:14,020;"This one was about Lord of Maloy, apparently."
40:14,020;40:18,340;"And he was saying, that's exactly what they want to do."
40:18,340;40:20,260;"Get them out of the box."
40:20,260;40:22,980;"Like Curtis Martin start to pound it up in there."
40:22,980;40:27,980;"Now, based on past episodes, I think that the box is like,"
40:27,980;40:31,540;"kind of like where the running back is,"
40:31,540;40:32,380;"or kind of runs the--"
40:32,380;40:34,820;"- Yeah, I think we've talked about that before"
40:34,820;40:38,860;"in terms of the box is kind of the,"
40:38,860;40:41,940;"it's an imaginary box that surrounds the,"
40:41,940;40:44,460;"both the offensive and defensive line."
40:44,460;40:48,020;"And it's kind of how many people are in that little area."
40:48,020;40:48,860;"- Yeah, also no."
40:48,860;40:52,380;"- So it's also a euphemism for a vagina, Mike."
40:52,380;40:53,540;"- Well, the box."
40:53,540;40:55,540;"- Which is why it's confused, yeah, that makes sense."
40:55,540;40:58,300;"- Well, no, but it also seems a little like selfish too."
40:58,300;40:59,860;"That's exactly what they wanna do,"
40:59,860;41:01,380;"get the lawyer Maloy out of the box"
41:01,380;41:03,980;"and let Curtis Martin start to pound it up in there."
41:03,980;41:06,540;"I just thought that was a little selfish."
41:06,540;41:08,000;"- Yeah."
41:08,000;41:11,260;"They call it the, in the CFL, not the box."
41:11,260;41:12,380;"- They call it the what?"
41:12,380;41:13,220;"- Slam."
41:13,220;41:14,900;"- No shit."
41:14,900;41:17,220;"Are you serious?"
41:17,220;41:21,020;"- Well, that sounds pretty Canadian to me."
41:21,020;41:23,100;"I can, I would believe that."
41:23,100;41:24,300;"- Get an eight guy clam."
41:24,300;41:31,100;"- All right, so it's the getting him out of the box"
41:31,100;41:33,660;"means getting him out of that area."
41:33,660;41:38,260;"And then that would allow Curtis Martin to like pound it through there."
41:38,260;41:38,940;"Is that what they mean?"
41:38,940;41:40,620;"Yeah."
41:40,620;41:42,020;"To the plan."
41:42,020;41:42,340;"Come on."
41:42,340;41:42,860;"To clear."
41:42,860;41:45,380;"Well, now when you put it like that, that sounds horrible."
41:45,380;41:48,900;"He can hit the hall with juice."
41:48,900;41:52,700;"OK, but yeah, but that was about passing though."
41:52,700;41:55,140;"So I guess you could like say the same thing."
41:55,140;41:55,940;"I see what you're saying."
41:55,940;41:56,460;"Yeah."
41:56,460;41:56,780;"All right."
41:56,780;41:57,700;"Well, that's informative."
41:57,700;41:58,980;"OK."
41:58,980;42:00,020;"What else?"
42:00,020;42:07,460;"Next one was Tom Brady doesn't see Molliwitz coming who has a full head of steam and gets it off just in time."
42:07,460;42:10,260;"What is it?"
42:10,260;42:12,500;"I just wonder how your mind works."
42:12,500;42:13,020;"Yeah."
42:13,020;42:15,020;"I just I'm confused."
42:15,020;42:19,860;"Dude, Brad Jones throws out new top of new terms every time I'm just fascinated."
42:19,860;42:20,980;"I'm like, oh, shit."
42:20,980;42:24,820;"Sometimes I'm sort of fascinated with what he's saying that I miss a player too."
42:24,820;42:25,340;"Yeah."
42:25,340;42:25,620;"Yeah."
42:25,620;42:26,340;"So all right."
42:26,340;42:27,540;"Read that back to me again."
42:28,220;42:34,940;"All right, so Tom Brady doesn't see Mollu is coming who has a full head of steam and gets it off just in time."
42:34,940;42:41,780;"Okay, all right, so I think I know that so my guess I'm not able to see the play in real time, but I think"
42:41,780;42:45,060;"Tom Brady has probably dropped back to pass."
42:45,060;42:48,260;"And I think the Mollu is coming is he's running at him."
42:48,260;42:50,860;"Probably to try for a sack as you know."
42:51,700;42:57,560;"And so Tom Brady getting it off, I think, is, is throwing the ball before"
42:57,560;42:58,620;"MOLOUS gets there."
42:58,620;43:00,460;"Yeah."
43:00,460;43:04,120;"That's why I pulled it and MOLUS busting that on his face."
43:04,120;43:04,620;"One of the two."
43:04,620;43:06,380;"Jesus man."
43:06,380;43:08,460;"I can't believe he just said that."
43:08,460;43:08,940;"Right."
43:08,940;43:09,900;"That's dirty."
43:09,900;43:10,580;"Can we?"
43:10,580;43:11,420;"Yeah, what the hell?"
43:11,420;43:13,540;"We have something to do with."
43:13,540;43:14,300;"Oh my God."
43:14,300;43:15,180;"That's insane, dude."
43:15,180;43:18,860;"OK, I don't think it's that, Steve, but I appreciate the effort."
43:18,860;43:20,700;"You're going to say, Greg."
43:20,900;43:28,240;"This is a real talk like I after we first did the segment I tried to like listen for these and I couldn't do it"
43:28,240;43:34,280;"So this is like a unique skill like I this is what I'm saying. I his brain works differently than mine"
43:34,280;43:36,520;"He's not like for every game"
43:36,520;43:39,560;"For them"
43:39,560;43:43,560;"Everything"
43:43,560;43:48,560;"So"
43:48,560;43:50,600;"Next one so we"
43:50,600;43:56,080;"We mentioned the box so we get that and I think now this is a little silly bringing this up"
43:56,080;43:57,680;"But I would just say it anyway"
43:57,680;44:05,020;"The quote was we've talked about eight men in the box. How about eight men in the end zone? Oh my yeah"
44:05,020;44:11,560;"Okay, all right, so we know the boxes right we just discussed that correct phone"
44:11,560;44:15,160;"So I remember this plan right because this is right at the end"
44:15,160;44:19,360;"This is the Hail Mary we're talking about and the Patriots unveiled a new defensive scheme"
44:19,360;44:21,720;"Oh, yeah, that's what it was where they had"
44:21,720;44:28,980;"Eight of their players lined up basically in the end zone to knock down a hill Mary because they wanted to have more guys"
44:28,980;44:35,060;"Then on defense than the the offense sent down wide receivers because usually if the hill Mary was sending"
44:35,060;44:41,560;"At least four if not five wide receivers down into the end zone. So you want to have more than that to cover them"
44:41,560;44:48,280;"Situation that was the first time that was done because Brent Jones seemed to think that that was a new"
44:48,280;44:51,960;"It's the first time Brent Jones ever saw it. That's for sure. Okay"
44:51,960;44:55,500;"And if you meant to put eight in the box and they end up in the end zone"
44:55,500;44:58,240;"You're in big trouble"
44:58,240;45:07,320;"Wow see I've learned a lot of stuff and the last one"
45:07,320;45:16,980;"Those defensive ends of the Jets get wide so much that we're gonna use some draw action to come on"
45:16,980;45:22,780;"underneath that. I don't know what that means at all."
45:22,780;45:26,580;"All right. Okay. All right. No, I know this one too, because we talked about this a little bit"
45:26,580;45:31,700;"where the just defensive ends were getting a lot of quick pressure on Tom Brady, right?"
45:31,700;45:36,860;"Yeah, they're destroying them. Yeah. So, but if you think about the way they run, because they're"
45:36,860;45:42,180;"coming off the ends, they're going out wide around usually the guys that are trying to block them to"
45:42,180;45:46,940;"close in on Tom Brady. Because they're giving that space, there's a lot of space in the middle"
45:46,940;45:54,640;"so the pages were mitigating that by running draw plays where you drop back and it looks"
45:54,640;45:58,000;"like you're going to pass it, but then you hand it off to running back on a delay usually."
45:58,000;45:59,000;"Oh shit, okay."
45:59,000;46:03,220;"And then they run where those defensive linemen used to be."
46:03,220;46:04,220;"That makes sense."
46:04,220;46:05,220;"Right."
46:05,220;46:06,380;"I mean, I don't know."
46:06,380;46:07,580;"I think that makes sense."
46:07,580;46:10,300;"Do you guys agree?"
46:10,300;46:13,060;"I stopped listening after the third one."
46:13,060;46:18,160;"All right, well then I appreciate your help guys and a little bit smarter for that"
46:18,160;46:21,260;"All right, the real question is Mike. How did you not?"
46:21,260;46:27,300;"Get on the quarterback sneak where the tests have already touched the center's dick when they ran off straight ahead"
46:27,300;46:29,780;"Costa how are you what?"
46:29,780;46:33,440;"In gustum. Oh, is that what they were talking about? Yeah"
46:33,440;46:36,420;"This they there was literally sexual"
46:36,740;46:39,180;"Brent Jones talking about not enjoying being"
46:39,180;46:47,020;"Slap the crundle. I'm pretty sure yeah, that's what he was talking about for real. Yeah"
46:47,020;46:50,100;"That's what they do. They literally goose them"
46:50,100;46:56,060;"It's a physical tell for the center to snap the ball immediately and run like hell"
46:56,060;47:04,300;"No, it's like slapping a horse and running after it"
47:04,300;47:06,300;"This tug on his cocks."
47:06,300;47:09,500;"- See, he's trying to tell with this guy."
47:09,500;47:10,340;"I don't know."
47:10,340;47:12,020;"- It's Ben Jones with everybody."
47:12,020;47:13,920;"- It's a wonderful, wow."
47:13,920;47:19,480;"- So I think this is the perfect time to do best and worst."
47:19,480;47:23,220;"Steve, you go first."
47:23,220;47:25,100;"- Well, I'm definitely, I was gonna say that,"
47:25,100;47:26,540;"but we just covered that."
47:26,540;47:28,380;"- No, you can still use it if you want,"
47:28,380;47:29,380;"that's all yours."
47:29,380;47:33,020;"- I think best bit"
47:34,060;47:36,260;"was how stoked Bell check was at the end of the game."
47:36,260;47:38,260;"Yeah, I'm excited."
47:38,260;47:39,220;"Oh, reserve."
47:39,220;47:42,820;"But this is his first win against jets clearly hates the jets like I do."
47:42,820;47:45,980;"And at the end of the game, he's running around, he's yellowed, he's"
47:45,980;47:46,940;"grabbing all his players."
47:46,940;47:49,420;"He's like, it was pretty crazy."
47:49,420;47:51,660;"That's a good one."
47:51,660;47:52,900;"Do you have a worst?"
47:52,900;47:55,700;"Um, I'm a little confused."
47:55,700;47:56,380;"I'll be the Jets."
47:56,380;47:59,220;"I mean, the Jets are just absolutely whipping them up and that slip by"
47:59,220;48:01,620;"I'm going to tie law on that slant that just came walking."
48:01,620;48:02,620;"Yeah."
48:02,620;48:04,540;"Oh, terrible start."
48:04,540;48:05,540;"That was not great."
48:05,540;48:07,980;"All right, Greg, give me your best and worst."
48:07,980;48:08,980;"All right."
48:08,980;48:13,980;"My best was Antoine Smith on that reception."
48:13,980;48:14,980;"Oh, yeah."
48:14,980;48:15,980;"That was awesome."
48:15,980;48:16,980;"Yeah."
48:16,980;48:19,420;"His acceleration came out of nowhere."
48:19,420;48:20,420;"It didn't."
48:20,420;48:21,420;"It didn't."
48:21,420;48:22,420;"Yeah, it didn't."
48:22,420;48:24,620;"I have a cheat."
48:24,620;48:25,620;"Yeah, I agree."
48:25,620;48:27,620;"I didn't say that."
48:27,620;48:31,780;"And then my worst was just Curtis Martin in general because he's a cunt."
48:31,780;48:35,740;"And that is punt for everyone."
48:35,740;48:39,140;"He's a good guy."
48:39,140;48:40,500;"That is like punter."
48:40,500;48:44,420;"All right, Mike, give me your best or worst."
48:44,420;48:45,420;"I'm just kidding."
48:45,420;48:49,580;"Well, I mean, he's awesome, but we have a reason."
48:49,580;48:50,580;"It isn't."
48:50,580;48:51,580;"He got traded, man."
48:51,580;48:52,580;"Yeah."
48:52,580;49:07,440;"Best for me was, so it right after like one of the Patriots touchdowns, there was a kick"
49:07,440;49:13,220;"return that was gonna break it and I think that would have been the end of the game."
49:13,220;49:15,220;"And, ""Vinitary"" comes out of nowhere."
49:15,220;49:19,160;"So, to your credit man, you brought this up at the beginning of this podcast where you"
49:19,160;49:24,160;"like the tarry's beast and then I realized it but after seeing the flip that you showed"
49:24,160;49:27,160;"and then this has happened twice in this season alone."
49:27,160;49:28,160;"Yeah."
49:28,160;49:32,760;"And ran down the returner as the last guy and saved the touchdown and that drive they ended"
49:32,760;49:33,760;"up getting a field goal."
49:33,760;49:35,760;"But if that was a touchdown game over."
49:35,760;49:36,760;"Yeah."
49:36,760;49:42,280;"Cause that was, well, wasn't that um, a virtual walker, the one that the clip you're talking"
49:42,280;49:43,280;"about."
49:43,280;49:44,280;"Oh yeah."
49:44,280;49:45,280;"Yeah."
49:45,280;49:46,280;"You're right."
49:46,280;49:47,280;"I'm sure you're good."
49:47,280;49:48,280;"Well, somewhere."
49:48,280;49:50,040;"this kicker that I've ever seen."
49:50,040;49:50,840;"Yeah, it was the--"
49:50,840;49:52,480;"This is calling ass."
49:52,480;49:55,320;"Oh, it was right after the Patriots first touchdown."
49:55,320;49:58,200;"Is that ensuing kickoff?"
49:58,200;50:03,640;"Right, because it was 7 to 13 and after that it was 7 to 16."
50:03,640;50:05,240;"But game would have been over."
50:05,240;50:07,240;"Right, exactly."
50:07,240;50:08,600;"So that's pretty awesome."
50:08,600;50:10,520;"Yeah, yeah, because yeah, one of the commentators"
50:10,520;50:13,000;"is like, that's the fastest kicker I've ever seen."
50:13,000;50:13,560;"You're right, Greg."
50:13,560;50:15,560;"Yeah."
50:15,560;50:16,720;"That was pretty cool."
50:16,720;50:20,240;"So I don't know how many of those he has in his career, but I know of three."
50:20,240;50:22,320;"At the moment."
50:22,320;50:28,960;"And then worst moments, I would go pretty much what Steve said, but the"
50:28,960;50:33,440;"opposite end of it where Bill was so happy, his smile and his high five and"
50:33,440;50:34,000;"I'm hugging."
50:34,000;50:37,840;"And I just know that a few years later, we're never going to see that again."
50:37,840;50:38,520;"It made me sad."
50:38,520;50:44,760;"So my worst is that he was happy at one point now."
50:44,760;50:45,160;"He's not."
50:45,160;50:52,160;"All right, that's serious."
50:52,160;50:57,160;"Oh boy."
50:57,160;50:58,160;"Yep."
50:58,160;51:03,160;"And we established 2004 is when you sold this all and, you know, we'll get to that."
51:03,160;51:04,160;"Correct."
51:04,160;51:05,160;"All right."
51:05,160;51:11,160;"My best is the winning, the game winning play."
51:11,160;51:18,540;"play. Patriots. The Jets have used their last time out. They need a first down. It's"
51:18,540;51:26,020;"third and I think like three or four. And the pages run a bootleg with Tom Brady. But"
51:26,020;51:30,440;"the defensive end steps right in the way. And he basically just cuts it back up field"
51:30,440;51:35,360;"and runs for a first down all by himself to win the game. Dude, I forgot that. And he"
51:35,360;51:40,440;"spun as well. He did the spin and he dove. And yeah, he got the first and he picked"
51:40,440;51:47,160;"the first by like the nose of the football too. Like it was it was close. And that was the game"
51:47,160;51:55,800;"winner. So that's by far my best. That's just a good one. That's that's Tom Brady being Tom Brady"
51:55,800;52:05,720;"before everybody knew his Tom Brady. Um, so my worst was going to be the page two article that I found"
52:05,720;52:12,520;"about my Bob Halloran who has a hard on for Drew Bledsoe, but I think it's actually going to work"
52:12,520;52:17,400;"better later because he has a few of them, so we're going to actually get in depth into some"
52:17,400;52:28,120;"of the more egregious ones. So I'm going to say my worst is the Jets fans for two reasons."
52:28,120;52:30,120;"One was fireman Ed."
52:30,120;52:31,260;"Yeah."
52:31,260;52:34,440;"What a fucking hardo."
52:34,440;52:39,440;"And every time they cut to them, they were showing him try to pump up the"
52:39,440;52:42,040;"crowd, even though the Jets were an offense, every fucking two"
52:42,040;52:45,880;"that shot of him sitting on his boys shoulders, like a chick at a concert."
52:45,880;52:49,480;"Just waving his hat around like you."
52:49,480;52:49,840;"Yeah."
52:49,840;52:57,920;"Oh, and then they also kept talking about how they're the Jets fans, unofficial"
52:57,920;53:01,920;"mascot is Shrek because he's green and they win ugly."
53:01,920;53:02,880;"Yeah."
53:02,880;53:07,080;"I don't even remember that being a thing, but they did keep"
53:07,080;53:07,680;"showing."
53:07,680;53:09,080;"Yeah, I don't remember."
53:09,080;53:11,640;"Coming out that early, like a Shrek that old."
53:11,640;53:13,640;"I guess so."
53:13,640;53:16,000;"I mean, Mike went to school for that."
53:16,000;53:22,680;"Mike went, how old was I would be when I went to school a few years ago."
53:22,680;53:25,760;"It was already out because this is 2001."
53:26,040;53:31,560;"Right. So we were we had gone. Yeah, it had come out recently. And I will say this,"
53:31,560;53:40,600;"because I went to lovely school of RIT. And I went for computer animation. And when I was"
53:40,600;53:45,640;"taking the tour, because nobody knew what computer animation was really, the story had come out"
53:45,640;53:52,600;"and Shrek was recently out. We took a tour. They're like, Hey, man, these computers in this lab is"
53:52,600;53:55,240;"what they use to work on Shrek with."
53:55,240;53:58,040;"And we're all like, what dude, that is crazy."
53:58,040;53:59,360;"I gotta go here."
53:59,360;54:03,320;"And then I went there and I'll leave it at that."
54:03,320;54:08,280;"So. - A story for another day, apparently."
54:08,280;54:12,280;"- Yes, but you know, there's shades of your Penn State,"
54:12,280;54:14,040;"you know, experiences and whatever."
54:14,040;54:15,240;"We can go into that another time,"
54:15,240;54:20,240;"but to confirm, yes, Shrek was out and doing well."
54:20,920;54:23,400;"How many helicopters are there at RIT?"
54:23,400;54:26,080;"- I don't know what helicopter cocks."
54:26,080;54:27,400;"(laughs)"
54:27,400;54:28,480;"- Ooh, I didn't see any."
54:28,480;54:31,280;"It was a different type of environment out there."
54:31,280;54:34,600;"- A lot of deaf people at RIT, right?"
54:34,600;54:37,520;"- Yeah, National Technical Institute of the Deaf, yes."
54:37,520;54:38,720;"It was right near there."
54:38,720;54:43,320;"And I was in a room that was a deaf room."
54:43,320;54:45,260;"So people would walk by the hallway"
54:45,260;54:48,120;"and press the button so the strobe would go off."
54:48,120;54:49,280;"And that was pretty cool."
54:49,280;54:53,720;"Yeah, because yeah, that was the fire alarm for deaf people, right?"
54:53,720;54:54,320;"Was the strobe."
54:54,320;54:55,400;"Right."
54:55,400;54:55,760;"Yeah."
54:55,760;54:58,240;"Um, but you could press it in the hallway."
54:58,240;54:59,000;"Right."
54:59,000;55:00,560;"So it's everybody did."
55:00,560;55:01,280;"Right."
55:01,280;55:04,480;"Now there's a lot of, a lot of good things about RIT."
55:04,480;55:06,520;"So we'll, we'll figure them all out."
55:06,520;55:07,320;"All right."
55:07,320;55:08,760;"Yeah, we'll get into that."
55:08,760;55:09,920;"No, we'll get."
55:09,920;55:10,640;"Dicks though, man."
55:10,640;55:12,720;"Maybe we'll get into that next week."
55:12,720;55:15,320;"When the Patriots."
55:15,320;55:17,920;"Uh, travel back home."
55:18,800;55:23,800;"to host the 6 and 5 Cleveland Browns"
55:23,800;55:26,820;"coming into Foxboro."
55:26,820;55:27,660;"- Revenge game."
55:27,660;55:30,900;"- A revenge game? How so?"
55:30,900;55:32,700;"Oh, I guess it is, yeah."
55:32,700;55:33,880;"- It's our revenge tour."
55:33,880;55:36,740;"He's just stomping everybody."
55:36,740;55:38,900;"- This is true."
55:38,900;55:41,980;"So we'll learn more about that next week"
55:41,980;55:44,580;"on the Patriots Dansi Podcast."
55:44,580;55:45,680;"See you later, guys."
55:45,680;55:48,380;"- See you. - Bye."
55:48,380;55:51,660;"Bye. Bye."

00:06,780;00:08,220;"you have the choice not to."
00:08,220;00:12,500;"My sons sometimes say some naughty things when they're trying to be funny, but really,"
00:12,500;00:13,940;"they're just being stupid."
00:13,940;00:15,500;"You still want to listen?"
00:15,500;00:16,500;"Go right ahead."
00:16,500;00:18,500;"I am not your mother."
00:18,500;00:19,500;"Alright."
00:19,500;00:28,340;"I'll be a fucking sign, clap guy."
00:28,340;00:33,340;"action. Welcome back to the"
00:33,340;00:39,340;"Bagers of Diodity podcast. Still struggling through the 2002 season."
00:39,340;00:42,340;"We're at week 13 flourishing."
00:42,340;00:49,340;"Lourishing. That's right, Greg. I agree. This, I don't know. This is the most losses that we're ever going to have to deal with in a season."
00:49,340;00:53,340;"Oh, I meant our performance. Oh, I'm talking about watching these football games."
00:53,340;00:54,820;"Well, Greg doesn't watch."
00:54,820;00:58,740;"I meant showing up on time to these my cats according."
00:58,740;01:02,620;"You weren't here last week."
01:02,620;01:05,100;"I know. And I've been here a lot of other weeks."
01:05,100;01:05,980;"I only missed one."
01:05,980;01:07,660;"So that's pretty good."
01:07,660;01:09,740;"Yeah, that is flourishing for Greg, for sure."
01:09,740;01:16,340;"Speaking of not showing up, this week is the Detroit lions on Thanksgiving day."
01:16,340;01:19,740;"Happy Thanksgiving, guys. Happy Thanksgiving."
01:20,300;01:22,260;"So I will start off with the bad news."
01:22,260;01:24,180;"I've already shared this with my brothers."
01:24,180;01:28,200;"Um, I did go to my local Walgreens that"
01:28,200;01:29,580;"Stephen and I talked about last week."
01:29,580;01:32,260;"They did not have the turkey dinner candy corn."
01:32,260;01:36,380;"They had all the other flavors, but I mean, the autumn mix."
01:36,380;01:37,580;"It just didn't feel right."
01:37,580;01:39,700;"So they have autumn mix out already."
01:39,700;01:43,740;"Autumn mixes out pumpkins by themselves is out and regular candy corn."
01:43,740;01:44,580;"Right."
01:44,580;01:46,700;"Well, you are wearing a hoodie in August."
01:46,700;01:48,460;"So I mean, it's autumn."
01:48,940;01:53,180;"I am. It is currently 59 degrees."
01:53,180;02:00,700;"And Andy's going with the man that shows up to game after going to work with hoodie"
02:00,700;02:05,140;"underneath Jersey. Look, I got my work boots on too."
02:05,140;02:11,140;"Next thing he's going to do is just show up with like a collard shirt and a tie"
02:11,140;02:12,340;"with a jersey over it."
02:12,340;02:15,180;"Those dweeb that Celtics games."
02:16,780;02:20,740;"What's a bigger heart of move though that or just no undershirt basketball jersey?"
02:20,740;02:22,300;"Oh, yeah."
02:22,300;02:23,740;"That's a good question."
02:23,740;02:25,540;"Depends on how here your trust is."
02:25,540;02:26,940;"We should do an online poll."
02:26,940;02:27,780;"What's worse?"
02:27,780;02:32,340;"Like button down shirt under basketball jersey or absolutely"
02:32,340;02:33,780;"nothing under basketball jersey."
02:33,780;02:35,420;"I'm a big nothing guy."
02:35,420;02:37,900;"You got to go short sleeve."
02:37,900;02:39,420;"Yeah."
02:39,420;02:40,980;"Under basketball jersey."
02:40,980;02:41,820;"Yeah."
02:41,820;02:45,740;"Preferably, if you can get a zip up hoodie and just wrap it over."
02:45,740;02:50,060;"see you still see the jersey underneath. That's the move, but it's not always called enough."
02:50,060;02:54,140;"That's true. Cool. Thought a lot of big jersey guys."
02:54,140;02:55,340;"All right. Yeah, I see that."
02:55,340;03:02,300;"I see that today. Your honor. Yeah. The throwbacks for this Thanksgiving game."
03:02,300;03:06,220;"I have my Kevin Falk throwback bright red jersey on."
03:06,220;03:10,700;"But how about John Hannah one too, right? Mm hmm. And a tie law one."
03:13,180;03:14,940;"But I'm the asshole for wearing a sweatshirt."
03:14,940;03:17,380;"I like your jersey."
03:17,380;03:18,300;"It looks good."
03:18,300;03:25,020;"Yeah, I'm wearing the baby blue Troy Brown jersey with the the the red."
03:25,020;03:28,380;"Well, the like the the"
03:28,380;03:29,300;"fresh shadow shadow."
03:29,300;03:31,260;"She had a red shadow that they have on it."
03:31,260;03:33,060;"Pretty slick."
03:33,060;03:36,740;"That rank rank the fate your favorite jerseys out of the three."
03:36,740;03:39,860;"Three."
03:39,860;03:42,540;"I mean, the only three to've ever had, Steve."
03:42,900;03:44,760;"Well, there's four now like the color rush."
03:44,760;03:46,580;"Oh, color rush."
03:46,580;03:47,860;"I didn't consider color rush."
03:47,860;03:51,300;"The those ones, the ones you were in the throwback."
03:51,300;03:51,860;"So the best."
03:51,860;03:52,260;"Yeah."
03:52,260;03:52,860;"I'm hates them."
03:52,860;03:55,220;"The white helmets pop."
03:55,220;03:58,180;"They were in this game."
03:58,180;03:58,700;"No second."
03:58,700;04:01,140;"We're going to say this was a throwback game, dude."
04:01,140;04:02,340;"And I."
04:02,340;04:08,860;"I'm glad we're getting a Detroit line fed on today at some point"
04:09,780;04:14,780;"because I feel like it's a whole separate world of sports."
04:14,780;04:19,860;"And I'm fascinated by what it's like to be a Lions fan."
04:19,860;04:21,780;"'Cause even down to the throwback uniforms,"
04:21,780;04:24,860;"you look at them and the Patriots have this really cool one"
04:24,860;04:27,460;"that's super retro and everybody loves."
04:27,460;04:28,580;"You look at the Detroit Lions"
04:28,580;04:31,060;"and they were plain blue jerseys"
04:31,060;04:33,260;"and plain silver helmets."
04:33,260;04:34,420;"Fucking cool."
04:34,420;04:38,980;"Yeah, they weren't exciting in the least bit."
04:38,980;04:44,560;"No, and that was the best part about their whole game back in 2002"
04:44,560;04:53,660;"We're there looking you said the most exciting part of the lines was their throwback jerseys. Yeah, and they were playing Trevor just walked in"
04:53,660;05:07,060;"Oh throwback week off fuck"
05:07,060;05:11,060;"We gotta run the dicks on the way to the game."
05:11,060;05:12,060;"Hang on."
05:12,060;05:13,060;"[LAUGHTER]"
05:13,060;05:14,060;"[INAUDIBLE]"
05:14,060;05:16,060;"No, you've got to Joey Harrington jersey?"
05:16,060;05:18,060;"It was my first ever football jersey."
05:18,060;05:19,060;"No."
05:19,060;05:21,060;"I had to see him in the year 2002."
05:21,060;05:22,060;"Really?"
05:22,060;05:23,060;"Oh, nice."
05:23,060;05:25,060;"Our year of Fort Peele, yeah, first year."
05:25,060;05:26,060;"That's amazing."
05:26,060;05:27,060;"I don't know, right?"
05:27,060;05:28,060;"Still fits, yeah."
05:28,060;05:29,060;"Full circle."
05:29,060;05:30,060;"Full circle."
05:30,060;05:31,060;"Well, Joey's back then."
05:31,060;05:32,060;"We're so good."
05:32,060;05:33,060;"This is like a meeting."
05:33,060;05:34,060;"Mm-hmm."
05:34,060;05:44,380;"So joining us is Trevor, even my buddy, co-worker."
05:44,380;05:50,620;"Huge Lions fan and somehow agreed to come on."
05:50,620;05:55,100;"I think I bribed him with turkey and stuffing, thanksgiving sandwiches."
05:55,100;05:57,420;">> I like that, Steve."
05:57,420;06:01,420;">> I'm going to make you do that more often."
06:01,420;06:04,540;"Yeah, we should have more often on this podcast is really simple."
06:04,540;06:05,180;"The mood."
06:05,180;06:08,860;"No, set the mood with, you know, to put ourselves in the right"
06:08,860;06:10,780;"mind space to what we're discussing."
06:10,780;06:12,220;"I'm not a boat ride."
06:12,220;06:12,940;"Yeah."
06:12,940;06:16,660;"Like watching this game and falling asleep in the third quarter"
06:16,660;06:17,900;"because you've eaten too much turkey."
06:17,900;06:20,060;"Wouldn't that be great?"
06:20,060;06:21,300;"All the fans that the game did."
06:21,300;06:24,420;"It was quiet."
06:24,420;06:29,220;"Ford Field the first year."
06:29,220;06:31,060;"Can we get into this?"
06:31,100;06:34,140;"I want to talk because I did a lot of research on the on the Silver Dome."
06:34,140;06:37,700;"Yeah, yeah, give it to me while Steve's getting set up over there."
06:37,700;06:43,300;"Yeah. So this is the first season of the new Ford field."
06:43,300;06:46,340;"That is downtown Detroit."
06:46,340;06:53,540;"So Pontiac Silver Dome is the one before and it's got like a pretty interesting"
06:53,540;06:54,900;"history that goes with it."
06:55,900;07:04,540;"So built in 1975, it was like the biggest stadium in the NFL up until like the year 2000."
07:04,540;07:06,700;"80,000 plus Cedar."
07:06,700;07:08,540;"Yeah, it's a lot of seats."
07:08,540;07:09,020;"Yeah."
07:09,020;07:09,180;"Yeah."
07:09,180;07:09,180;"Yeah."
07:09,180;07:11,180;"And the middle is nowhere."
07:11,180;07:12,140;"Yeah."
07:12,140;07:16,460;"Essentially, just like the biggest parking lot you've ever seen."
07:16,460;07:20,860;"And in the middle of it is just this even bigger stadium."
07:20,860;07:25,260;"So bigger than like the Redskins parking lot?"
07:25,260;07:27,180;"- I feel like that's like-"
07:27,180;07:29,620;"- That's kind of like what it is, yeah."
07:29,620;07:31,140;"Like it's in the middle of nowhere,"
07:31,140;07:32,340;"a massive parking lot."
07:32,340;07:33,900;"Think of like the same thing."
07:33,900;07:34,740;"- All right."
07:34,740;07:40,340;"- And it's got a fiberglass roof."
07:40,340;07:42,740;"It's got this weird, like it was a weird design"
07:42,740;07:45,500;"that they did to it where it's an indoor stadium,"
07:45,500;07:47,420;"but it's not truly an indoor stadium."
07:47,420;07:50,460;"So it's like, it's got like a Teflon roof"
07:50,460;07:53,820;"with like fiberglass things going through it."
07:53,820;07:56,220;"So it's actually held up by the air pressure"
07:56,220;07:57,460;"from inside the stadium."
07:57,460;07:59,700;"So you can deflate the roof."
07:59,700;08:01,060;"- Yep."
08:01,060;08:02,700;"- Which you may have seen picture."
08:02,700;08:07,700;"So what happens is they once the lions move"
08:07,700;08:13,500;"to Ford Field, basically it's like unused for like eight years"
08:13,500;08:19,140;"and it's like just sitting there in the middle of fucking,"
08:19,140;08:21,260;"wherever, right?"
08:21,260;08:24,980;"And then so they go to try and sell it."
08:24,980;08:29,980;"They sell it at auction in 2009 for $550,000."
08:29,980;08:34,500;"- Isn't that nuts?"
08:34,500;08:35,900;"- How much did it got?"
08:35,900;08:36,980;"- Two minutes."
08:36,980;08:39,620;"- It's one percent of what it cost to build it"
08:39,620;08:42,900;"in the first place, like 20 years earlier."
08:42,900;08:45,220;"- It's like the worst ROI ever."
08:45,220;08:46,060;"- Yeah."
08:46,060;08:48,220;"- Any sports franchise."
08:48,220;08:51,700;"I saw something that did like an inflation assessment"
08:51,700;08:54,420;"of what the actual percentage cost was,"
08:54,420;08:58,300;"and it was like 0.001% of what they paid for it,"
08:58,300;08:59,700;"if you account for inflation."
08:59,700;09:00,900;"(laughs)"
09:00,900;09:01,740;"Just ridiculous."
09:01,740;09:02,820;"- Oh, it's so bad."
09:02,820;09:03,700;"- Yeah."
09:03,700;09:05,420;"So they pump a bunch of, the new owners"
09:05,420;09:07,940;"like pump like $6 million back into it,"
09:07,940;09:08,980;"get it back up and running,"
09:08,980;09:10,940;"they actually hold some events there."
09:10,940;09:14,740;"And then in 2013, there's like a big snowstorm,"
09:14,740;09:17,500;"and the ice collects on that roof."
09:17,500;09:19,380;"and basically collapses it"
09:19,380;09:21,180;"'cause it overcomes the air pressure."
09:21,180;09:22,620;"- I remember adding the pictures of that."
09:22,620;09:24,220;"- And then there was like, fuck it."
09:24,220;09:26,420;"(laughing)"
09:26,420;09:27,780;"- And it was, yeah."
09:27,780;09:28,860;"- It was like one of the coolest,"
09:28,860;09:30,700;"like Google Earth things to look at,"
09:30,700;09:33,100;"after it had collapsed."
09:33,100;09:34,820;"And there was like, there's probably still,"
09:34,820;09:38,980;"you can find a ton of cool photos of just like wildlife."
09:38,980;09:41,140;"Like it was like a jungle just growing"
09:41,140;09:43,180;"on the inside of the silver."
09:43,180;09:45,660;"- 'Cause there's a bunch of like sitting water in there."
09:45,660;09:50,500;"And yeah, the material, the roof was like like shedding to,"
09:50,500;09:53,180;"so it was like half the seats were like strewn"
09:53,180;09:55,580;"with this like Teflon fucking shit."
09:55,580;09:59,020;"You should Google like Silver Dome abandoned."
09:59,020;10:01,500;"It's some amazing pictures."
10:01,500;10:02,340;"- Yeah."
10:02,340;10:07,460;"Yeah, it is, how long were they in that stadium"
10:07,460;10:08,460;"when you looked it up?"
10:08,460;10:10,300;"Because they had it for."
10:10,300;10:13,980;"- Yeah, 75 to 2001."
10:13,980;10:14,820;"- Wow, done."
10:14,820;10:17,780;"And they said they had like the Pope went there."
10:17,780;10:20,820;"They had like 95,000 people there for a mass,"
10:20,820;10:22,420;"like Madonna, Rolling Stones."
10:22,420;10:24,140;"They held a World Cup soccer game."
10:24,140;10:28,260;"The first ever World Cup game indoors was at the Silver Dome."
10:28,260;10:31,180;"Back in '94 when the US had it."
10:31,180;10:35,420;"Yeah."
10:35,420;10:37,460;"So pretty cool history."
10:37,460;10:39,780;"I mean, the stadium looked pretty sweet too."
10:39,780;10:42,700;"I saw like old footage of when it was in its prime."
10:42,700;10:43,660;"Yeah."
10:43,660;10:44,540;"Yeah, it was cool."
10:44,540;10:47,900;"I mean, it was just this massive playhouse for sports, right?"
10:47,900;10:48,420;"Yeah."
10:48,420;10:49,820;"Even like back then, right?"
10:49,820;10:54,740;"75, I think a lot of the bigger stadiums none were that big."
10:54,740;10:59,140;"So just the size alone was kind of like a wow factor."
10:59,140;10:59,580;"Yeah."
10:59,580;11:03,860;"And then once the Silver Dome was no more moving to Ford Field,"
11:03,860;11:06,140;"they did like the exact opposite."
11:06,140;11:09,660;"Like it was like one of when they built it in 2002."
11:09,660;11:12,740;"I think it was like, if it wasn't the smallest stadium"
11:12,740;11:16,420;"in the NFL, it was top two or three,"
11:16,420;11:19,060;"and it's still like a top five small stadium."
11:19,060;11:23,780;"'Cause towards the end, the games kept getting blacked out."
11:23,780;11:26,300;"- Bro, they just couldn't fill it."
11:26,300;11:28,140;"Like it was such a massive stadium"
11:28,140;11:30,420;"and they suck for so long, they couldn't fill it."
11:30,420;11:32,100;"So games would be blacked out."
11:32,100;11:35,060;"That was like a major, major issue"
11:35,060;11:36,860;"for like three or four seasons leading up"
11:36,860;11:38,540;"to when they moved."
11:38,540;11:41,100;"- Yeah, same with the Patriots back in the day."
11:41,100;11:41,940;"Pretty bellish."
11:41,940;11:44,500;"You had to listen on the radio."
11:44,500;11:46,500;"Yep, that's true."
11:46,500;11:48,500;"I remember doing that."
11:48,500;11:50,500;"Those 80s, Patriots."
11:50,500;11:51,500;"Too many."
11:51,500;11:52,500;"Most of them."
11:52,500;11:58,940;"So do you like Fordfield Trevor?"
11:58,940;12:01,460;"Yeah, I, it's a cool."
12:01,460;12:07,760;"I mean, like I said, it was a cool stadium because it was the total opposite of the Silver"
12:07,760;12:08,760;"Dome."
12:08,760;12:11,840;"When they built it, they tried to center it"
12:11,840;12:14,600;"on a fan experience."
12:14,600;12:18,120;"And they thought they could do that with a smaller space."
12:18,120;12:20,800;"And the location alone was kind of enough"
12:20,800;12:24,240;"to get people excited because there's one street"
12:24,240;12:27,560;"called Bush Street or Brush Street, one of the two."
12:27,560;12:29,560;"And it separates where the Tigers play."
12:29,560;12:33,760;"So Comerico Park and then where Ford Field is."
12:33,760;12:35,600;"- I love that idea."
12:35,600;12:37,920;"- Yeah, so it's like if they were ever"
12:37,920;12:40,680;"to get rid of Ford Fields,"
12:40,680;12:43,480;"I think they would do what the Vikings did,"
12:43,480;12:45,960;"where they would demolish their stadium"
12:45,960;12:47,480;"and then build it back up,"
12:47,480;12:49,800;"or they didn't demolish it, like, you know, collapse,"
12:49,800;12:53,280;"but there's no better spot to put that stadium."
12:53,280;12:55,880;"Like if you had to recreate it, right?"
12:55,880;12:57,920;"I think they would just do it in that same spot."
12:57,920;13:02,000;"- Yeah, yeah, 'cause a lot of places are moving to that now."
13:02,000;13:04,720;"I mean, like Philly, I know they have like all four"
13:04,720;13:07,120;"major sports all within one complex."
13:07,120;13:09,760;"Ball. Similar kind of."
13:09,760;13:10,880;"Yeah."
13:10,880;13:12,080;"The big."
13:12,080;13:14,880;"Yeah. Down in Texas, right?"
13:14,880;13:16,080;"I think that that's similar."
13:16,080;13:17,840;"Cowboys games like that."
13:17,840;13:20,640;"Yeah. From from the Rangers Stadium,"
13:20,640;13:21,920;"we can see it across the parking lot."
13:21,920;13:26,240;"And LA, they just have every single sports team on the west coast"
13:26,240;13:27,200;"playing the same stadium."
13:27,200;13:29,040;"And that's the soccer stadium."
13:29,040;13:30,960;"Yeah. No one goes."
13:30,960;13:33,220;"(laughing)"
13:33,220;13:37,460;"- But yeah, it's cool."
13:37,460;13:41,220;"It's, I think it was cool."
13:41,220;13:43,220;"I think they've done like little improvements,"
13:43,220;13:45,700;"but eventually they sort of hit a wall"
13:45,700;13:48,460;"because there's again, it's like limited space"
13:48,460;13:49,820;"with such a small stadium,"
13:49,820;13:52,780;"but they've added like little quirks here and there"
13:52,780;13:55,860;"and like improved the box seats"
13:55,860;13:58,580;"and obviously with like the fords owning it."
13:58,580;14:01,900;"There's like some of the executive seats"
14:01,900;14:04,820;"are like these crazy nice leather,"
14:04,820;14:06,780;"whatever top of the line Ford car is,"
14:06,780;14:10,660;"they'll actually have the car seats in the boxes."
14:10,660;14:12,300;"- Oh, that's a good idea."
14:12,300;14:14,420;"Like a trunk and they gave a whole stadium"
14:14,420;14:18,980;"a ton of sides of it are cobblestone,"
14:18,980;14:23,980;"brick looking, big corridors or hallways,"
14:25,540;14:32,740;"give it kind of like a rustic like industrial like Henry Ford factory kind of look. So visually,"
14:32,740;14:37,540;"it's it's a pretty cool looking stadium. But yeah,"
14:37,540;14:48,420;"yeah, I almost went there. Are you a Michigan fan too? I'm a Michigan State fan. Okay,"
14:48,420;14:51,340;"All right, because I was last Thanksgiving."
14:51,340;14:55,740;"I was I went to Chicago with my wife for work."
14:55,740;14:59,520;"And we were like, should we go to the Thanksgiving day game?"
14:59,520;15:06,500;"At Ford Field or Michigan, Ohio State was also playing that weekend."
15:06,500;15:11,460;"So we ended up going to Michigan, Ohio State, which was, I mean, that stadium."
15:11,460;15:12,740;"Jesus fucking Christ."
15:12,740;15:13,340;"Yeah."
15:13,340;15:14,740;"I mean, that's literally seed."
15:14,740;15:23,740;"It's completely overwhelming because it's not like it's not like sectioned either really. It's just like a"
15:23,740;15:32,580;"People like it is a true ball. Yeah, Penn State was similar to where I think it was like 103,000"
15:32,580;15:36,900;"Seed state him so it became the third biggest"
15:36,900;15:42,700;"Third biggest city in the state on Saturdays during"
15:43,100;15:48,860;"Yeah, yeah, but all the people that that come in for sure. Yeah, it was crazy. Yeah, I love I love stadiums"
15:48,860;15:57,060;"I love what's your favorite and I don't care who knows it my favorite stadium. That's a good question Andy. Let me think"
15:57,060;16:04,540;"Do cowboy stadium that was pretty fucking sweet. All right. I mean, I'm a small stadium guy"
16:04,540;16:08,060;"I think like a good doesn't sell a stadium with a lot of atmosphere"
16:08,060;16:11,180;"So I picked the biggest one of that"
16:11,900;16:13,500;"- You're a gody stadium guy."
16:13,500;16:16,200;"- But that one was just like,"
16:16,200;16:17,620;"I don't know, that was beautifully done"
16:17,620;16:19,540;"with like the sunshine and enthrude."
16:19,540;16:21,440;"It's, that's a sight to see."
16:21,440;16:23,080;"You have to check that one out."
16:23,080;16:26,340;"Ralph Wilson sucks."
16:26,340;16:28,740;"- I really like Red's Constadium."
16:28,740;16:30,060;"- Yeah."
16:30,060;16:33,240;"Dude, you know what stadium blows is the Jets one."
16:33,240;16:35,820;"- We talked about this already."
16:35,820;16:38,260;"- Yeah, it's more than the rest one."
16:38,260;16:39,140;"- Just sucks."
16:39,140;16:39,980;"- Nothing."
16:40,980;16:42,980;"just in the middle of nowhere."
16:42,980;16:43,820;"- Dispair."
16:43,820;16:44,660;"- Yeah."
16:44,660;16:46,980;"- Garbage."
16:46,980;16:48,260;"- And the Jets play there, which doesn't--"
16:48,260;16:50,420;"- Yeah, it's got no personality."
16:50,420;16:52,220;"All right, let's really make Trevor cry"
16:52,220;16:53,780;"about how much it sucks to be a Lions fan."
16:53,780;16:54,660;"Let's go, come on."
16:54,660;16:55,580;"- Ooh, okay."
16:55,580;16:58,420;"- All right, so yeah, let's get into this game."
16:58,420;17:01,820;"'Cause 2002 is, it feels like peak."
17:01,820;17:02,780;"I know they've been worse,"
17:02,780;17:05,620;"but it just felt like peak Detroit Lions."
17:05,620;17:09,100;"- No, this is probably a year of hope and optimism."
17:09,100;17:12,100;"- Yeah, but what I think is like,"
17:12,100;17:16,540;"like prior to that, I think we drafted"
17:16,540;17:18,820;"a couple of wide receivers."
17:18,820;17:19,660;"- Chocking."
17:19,660;17:22,300;"- And then, or it might have been right after that."
17:22,300;17:23,540;"- It was right after."
17:23,540;17:25,080;"Like Charlie Rogers,"
17:25,080;17:28,220;"or Charles Rogers, right?"
17:28,220;17:29,060;"And then there was--"
17:29,060;17:31,140;"- So I wrote this down."
17:31,140;17:33,140;"Yeah, so this is 2002, so."
17:33,140;17:34,420;"- This was Harrington."
17:34,420;17:37,540;"- Yeah, so then, next year they started that."
17:37,540;17:39,460;"They went Charles Rogers at two,"
17:39,460;17:41,860;"Roy Williams at seven year after,"
17:41,860;17:44,220;"the year after Mike Williams at 10,"
17:44,220;17:45,540;"and then two years after that,"
17:45,540;17:47,220;"they finally hit with Calvin Johnson."
17:47,220;17:48,580;"So. - Yeah, that's how you build."
17:48,580;17:51,900;"- I taught 10 wide receiver for,"
17:51,900;17:52,900;"four out of five years."
17:52,900;17:54,460;"- Just start from the outside end."
17:54,460;17:56,540;"You work outside end is how you win."
17:56,540;18:00,340;"- Hey, then he revives early, just like Barry Sanders."
18:00,340;18:01,340;"- It was, I think,"
18:01,340;18:03,740;"(laughing)"
18:03,740;18:07,420;"and Calvin Johnson, like he hates the lines."
18:07,420;18:09,100;"He's like very, very open about it."
18:09,100;18:11,340;"He's not a lines guy."
18:11,340;18:13,420;"- Is it Barry Sanders similar?"
18:13,420;18:16,020;"- No, he's a big like, I love Detroit,"
18:16,020;18:18,980;"love the Forads, love like the organization."
18:18,980;18:22,260;"He's like big, big time lines Detroit guy."
18:22,260;18:24,540;"But no, you're right."
18:24,540;18:26,500;"Like this was, and watching a game,"
18:26,500;18:28,980;"like you just, you can feel it."
18:28,980;18:32,580;"And there's times when like,"
18:32,580;18:34,860;"Harrington's moving the ball down the field"
18:34,860;18:37,220;"and you're like, wow, like it's kind of rookie."
18:37,220;18:38,980;"- That's making a good throw."
18:38,980;18:40,140;"- Yeah, we hit a couple."
18:40,140;18:41,940;"- We're like moving the ball a little bit,"
18:41,940;18:44,300;"and then something dumb happens."
18:44,300;18:49,300;"And that, the build to just drop is like,"
18:49,300;18:52,660;"that's what it means to be Alliance Man."
18:52,660;18:56,940;"And in 2002, obviously, social media wasn't a thing,"
18:56,940;18:59,260;"so you didn't have the ins and outs of like,"
18:59,260;19:01,700;"what actually happened in the organization,"
19:01,700;19:04,580;"which I think helped the organization"
19:04,580;19:08,580;"from looking less like it was just a total fucking disaster."
19:08,580;19:09,580;"Right?"
19:09,580;19:12,940;"Like now you can only be so bad at your job"
19:12,940;19:15,980;"before like the rest of the world knows you're bad at your job."
19:15,980;19:16,820;"Right?"
19:16,820;19:18,700;"But then they had like a five year leech"
19:18,700;19:20,180;"to be shitty at your job."
19:20,180;19:23,380;"But then people were like, okay, the process really isn't."
19:23,380;19:25,540;"Maybe we shouldn't have drafted all those wider series."
19:25,540;19:26,380;"This didn't work."
19:26,380;19:27,220;"Right?"
19:27,220;19:32,100;"This was, I think the prior year in 2001 there were,"
19:32,100;19:33,580;"they won two games."
19:33,580;19:35,980;"Yeah, so this was an improvement where they won."
19:35,980;19:37,180;"Right. They won."
19:37,180;19:37,980;"They won. They won."
19:37,980;19:38,980;"They won. They won."
19:38,980;19:41,100;"And improved from the year before."
19:41,100;19:43,260;"I actually have some numbers on that."
19:43,260;19:44,300;"Yeah."
19:44,300;19:46,020;"That era."
19:46,020;19:53,180;"So Barry Sanders and that like Herman Moore, Scott Mitchell,"
19:53,180;19:55,740;"that era ends around 1999."
19:55,740;19:57,820;"Yeah, so the end of the--"
19:57,820;19:59,340;"The last time I went to the fight."
19:59,340;20:00,340;"Yeah."
20:00,340;20:04,260;"1996 is when they really started like they they had a win"
20:04,260;20:07,060;"This was their first like losing season after the Barry's dinner stuff"
20:07,060;20:13,020;"So 96 through 2010 so they had 15 straight seasons with single-digit wins"
20:13,020;20:22,980;"2000 through 2001 through 2009 they had a total of 33 wins in nine seasons"
20:22,980;20:27,300;"So there's less than four wins a year. I want I want to put that in perspective"
20:28,580;20:36,100;"In two years, I don't know which in two years the Patriots won 34 games"
20:36,100;20:43,220;"Yeah, so 30 yeah, and then 2008 of course they go actually oh three oh four"
20:43,220;20:50,280;"They won 34 games because they won 21 in a row if you can't play off games they won 34 games in two six"
20:50,280;20:56,860;"Yeah, and even if you like extend it to their franchise history, it's like kind of hilarious to like they have"
20:57,460;21:02,860;"17 playoff appearances in franchise history dating back to 1935"
21:02,860;21:08,640;"So this is before the merger and all that and the Patriots have had 17 since Tom Brady got drafted"
21:08,640;21:12,140;"So people often say like man"
21:12,140;21:16,020;"I would really hate to be a Browns fan like it's tough"
21:16,020;21:20,940;"But if you look at the numbers the Browns fan is actually a luxury"
21:20,940;21:24,260;"They have"
21:24,700;21:29,700;"- If you give the same time period of like 1995 to now,"
21:29,700;21:33,080;"they've made the playoffs more"
21:33,080;21:35,680;"and they have at least one playoff win."
21:35,680;21:38,380;"- Yeah, you know who's coaching the browse at that time?"
21:38,380;21:40,480;"- Bill Bell, right?"
21:40,480;21:41,320;"- Yeah."
21:41,320;21:42,480;"- The Bill Bell track."
21:42,480;21:43,680;"- That's a hot day."
21:43,680;21:46,160;"- I need to be the pitcher to be a Browns fan."
21:46,160;21:47,000;"- Right."
21:47,000;21:49,120;"- Which is like, there's only one class of people"
21:49,120;21:50,320;"that can say that though, right?"
21:50,320;21:51,160;"- Yeah."
21:51,160;21:52,160;"- One of one."
21:52,160;21:54,000;"- This one Detroit aren't even that far from you."
21:54,000;21:55,260;"It's like what three hours?"
21:55,260;21:57,240;"No, and like so."
21:57,240;22:00,140;"It's the hallway of sadness there."
22:00,140;22:02,880;"Yeah, it really is."
22:02,880;22:04,380;"The hallway of sadness."
22:04,380;22:06,480;"It's like a different kind of rust belt."
22:06,480;22:11,120;"There's a sense of like when the Browns do come into town"
22:11,120;22:17,460;"or when the Lions play in Cleveland,"
22:17,460;22:19,720;"there's like a sense of like, you know,"
22:19,720;22:21,800;"we really want to beat each other."
22:21,800;22:25,560;"But like at the end of the day, we all kind of look around and we're like,"
22:25,560;22:30,680;"""Fuck, man, this shit starts to suck for everybody."""
22:30,680;22:32,760;"I get a question. Along that way."
22:32,760;22:36,120;"You understand my pain and I understand your pain."
22:36,120;22:39,240;"Do you ever sneaky hope you lose those games?"
22:39,240;22:44,520;"Just to be like, at least we're like the best at something that like, even worse?"
22:44,520;22:47,560;"Uh, no."
22:47,560;22:48,760;"I don't like that."
22:48,760;22:49,960;"I don't like that."
22:49,960;22:52,160;"- Well, I think the loudest question."
22:52,160;22:53,520;"I wanna win."
22:53,520;22:56,040;"You, people, they don't understand how bad,"
22:56,040;22:59,080;"like I just, I don't wanna make the wild card."
22:59,080;23:02,400;"I wanna actually just win the division for once."
23:02,400;23:05,960;"One year I wanna be like, we're in the playoffs."
23:05,960;23:08,040;"And when I don't have to go to Dallas,"
23:08,040;23:11,680;"or like San Francisco, Dallas, or somebody like that,"
23:11,680;23:14,120;"like in order to watch just the hopes crumble"
23:14,120;23:17,000;"in a wild card, which was a good season."
23:17,000;23:17,840;"Nine wins."
23:17,840;23:19,720;"(laughing)"
23:19,720;23:27,920;"which this this 2002 season is the the Patriots least amount of wins for this"
23:27,920;23:31,640;"whole era that we're doing a podcast for you want to guess how many wins the"
23:31,640;23:37,480;"Patriots had nine wins"
23:37,480;23:42,760;"season did literally as bad as it gets they had a full game losing streak that"
23:42,760;23:46,920;"we suffered through before you came on and it's the longest losing streak of the"
23:46,920;23:48,720;"Yeah, we almost stopped watching."
23:48,720;23:49,520;"Yeah."
23:49,520;23:54,200;"We struggle through it because we knew you're coming on it."
23:54,200;23:56,440;"Have you ever had like maybe I should stop watching?"
23:56,440;24:02,680;"Yeah, there's definitely been those times when you, you kind of, you look at"
24:02,680;24:06,640;"yourself every Sunday and then like Sunday afternoon, because we always get"
24:06,640;24:08,920;"the, the noon games, because you know, so bad."
24:08,920;24:14,080;"Like four o'clock rolls around and you're just like, what the fuck am I doing here?"
24:14,080;24:15,880;"Like it's no, I'm from the first."
24:15,880;24:21,800;"And we got two wins last year. We have a win. Like what the fuck am I doing?"
24:21,800;24:28,640;"See that's that's what I always wonder is like what the Patriots have always been good"
24:28,640;24:32,620;"And like I'll watch any football but like when the red Sox suck"
24:32,620;24:38,920;"I like I won't I just it's not worth my time to invest in the red Sox when they're sucking yeah"
24:38,920;24:42,480;"But football is kind of different so I've always wondered like if the Patriots are really bad"
24:42,720;24:49,280;"Would I just start like stop watching games every now and then? I don't know. Yeah, so that's that's definitely like"
24:49,280;24:54,060;"Like football in general. It's just so like if you're a big sports guy"
24:54,060;24:59,120;"That's one thing but to be like you know football fan. I think it's it's another right and it's once a week"
24:59,120;25:03,560;"It's not like you're watching you said the red Sox the Tigers in there even if they're bad"
25:03,560;25:05,760;"You know like all right well"
25:05,760;25:08,400;"I'll put the alerts on my phone and check out the scores"
25:08,400;25:11,280;"But I don't want to sit down and watch it right as much of a commitment"
25:12,000;25:16,400;"The Lions it's like it's like there are any football team. It's an event, right? It's once week"
25:16,400;25:23,600;"Beers but yeah, it's just I it's it sucks"
25:23,600;25:28,360;"Like losing some of the car like I don't think anybody is like nobody gets excited about it"
25:28,360;25:34,440;"But the real the real shitty thing is and you only you only realize this after I think the age of like"
25:34,440;25:39,160;"maybe like 26 27 right like I'm 28 right now and"
25:40,160;25:44,000;"And I, I, the, something I have no control over,"
25:44,000;25:46,840;"like how the lines play on, on Sunday,"
25:46,840;25:49,360;"significantly affects my mood."
25:49,360;25:54,360;"I'm like Monday, like kind of going into Tuesday."
25:54,360;25:57,720;"And then like by Wednesday, like I read the practice report"
25:57,720;25:58,760;"and like I'm, I'm back."
25:58,760;25:59,600;"I'm all in."
25:59,600;26:00,440;"- Yeah."
26:00,440;26:03,560;"- I get sucked back in, but like as a grown man,"
26:03,560;26:08,560;"like I, still like the team significantly affects my mood"
26:08,680;26:11,480;"We're like 24, maybe 36 hours."
26:11,480;26:14,040;"- It's true."
26:14,040;26:15,040;"- Nothing you can do about it."
26:15,040;26:16,520;"- I'm kind of scared of that."
26:16,520;26:18,760;"- Yeah."
26:18,760;26:20,440;"- I've been the same way."
26:20,440;26:21,280;"- Yeah."
26:21,280;26:22,160;"And the pages haven't stopped."
26:22,160;26:23,680;"- But the voice has been good."
26:23,680;26:25,000;"So it's like, it's manageable"
26:25,000;26:27,880;"'cause 90% of the time you're in a good mood on Monday."
26:27,880;26:29,240;"- Yeah."
26:29,240;26:31,480;"- Actually, it's more like 80%, but still."
26:31,480;26:35,280;"- Oh, it's curious more actually."
26:35,280;26:36,280;"- No, still."
26:37,280;26:39,280;"And the thing is, it's funny, right?"
26:39,280;26:41,400;"'Cause if you were to go back in time in 2002"
26:41,400;26:44,040;"and be like, man, we really suck,"
26:44,040;26:45,400;"but sports are cyclical."
26:45,400;26:47,280;"That's what you always tell yourself,"
26:47,280;26:49,560;"that it's gonna come back around."
26:49,560;26:53,240;"And it's almost 20 years later,"
26:53,240;26:57,680;"and we're still in that same, maybe not that bottom three."
26:57,680;27:00,600;"We were last year, but Stafford got hurt, whatever."
27:00,600;27:03,440;"But it's like they haven't gotten better."
27:03,440;27:06,280;"We've had the revolving door of coaches"
27:06,280;27:09,580;"and like management has changed,"
27:09,580;27:11,280;"so like it hasn't gotten better."
27:11,280;27:13,700;"And like that alone is,"
27:13,700;27:17,400;"I think it's really hard to stink and like steer a ship"
27:17,400;27:20,920;"in the wrong direction for so long."
27:20,920;27:24,280;"Without one guy being like, it's not that hard."
27:24,280;27:26,560;"I think I can do this the right way."
27:26,560;27:30,160;"And that just hasn't happened, right?"
27:30,160;27:31,600;"Like that-- - Yeah, you haven't even like"
27:31,600;27:33,280;"fallen into it by accident, right?"
27:33,280;27:34,600;"- No."
27:34,600;27:35,760;"It's wild."
27:35,760;27:40,120;"I had a tweet like two years ago,"
27:40,120;27:42,520;"and I think I retweet it every year,"
27:42,520;27:44,120;"and it sums up,"
27:44,120;27:47,920;"if the tweet is, ""My lion's fanhood summed up."""
27:47,920;27:51,640;"In August, I say, ""Our year."""
27:51,640;27:55,160;"Like, ""Tranny camp, you hear all the positive stories,"
27:55,160;27:56,760;"you read into the beat writers,"
27:56,760;27:59,760;"you're thinking like, ""This is our year, we're due."""
27:59,760;28:00,600;"- I feel it."
28:00,600;28:03,440;"- October rolls, yeah, I feel it too."
28:03,440;28:05,320;"October rolls around,"
28:05,320;28:10,120;"And, you know, some things we've kind of fallen off a little bit, but it's October."
28:10,120;28:13,000;"So we still got a chance because of Stafford."
28:13,000;28:15,560;"As long as he's healthy, we got a chance."
28:15,560;28:16,320;"Thanksgiving."
28:16,320;28:24,120;"And then I usually tweet out that meme from the waterboy of that guy that says,"
28:24,120;28:25,600;"like, we suck again."
28:25,600;28:27,680;"And that way, we come here every year."
28:27,680;28:28,680;"And it's Thanksgiving."
28:28,680;28:30,240;"We always lose that game."
28:30,240;28:32,920;"And it's like the wheels fall off."
28:32,920;28:37,260;"January happens and recently I hate the Patriots"
28:37,260;28:46,700;"Was it Mitch Trabisky this year that smoke to you guys on Thanksgiving? Yeah"
28:46,700;28:50,760;"Like it was like people were talking about him losing his job"
28:50,760;28:59,400;"Like man this guy like he's really not the future and he walked in on Thanksgiving day and threw like for 250 and like three touchdowns"
28:59,400;29:02,200;"Yeah"
29:02,200;29:04,200;"Yeah, yeah"
29:04,200;29:09,680;"I'm gonna lift that up cuz I think it was even worse than that. Yeah, wait. I thought it was their backup. Wasn't it?"
29:09,680;29:14,360;"It was Detroit's back of the oh, that's right. That's a lot. Yeah, so"
29:14,360;29:19,040;"29 of 30 this is Mitch Trabisky. I'm Thanksgiving last year"
29:19,040;29:25,800;"Mitch Trabisky. Yeah, 29 of 38 for 338 yards and three touchdowns"
29:25,800;29:27,880;"- Oh my goodness, that's a slide."
29:27,880;29:28,720;"That guy's the one. - That guy's the one"
29:28,720;29:30,320;"you want to do, the football that day."
29:30,320;29:31,320;"- It's too messy."
29:31,320;29:33,400;"- I'm a full-time career."
29:33,400;29:35,200;"- How do you feel about Mapetricia?"
29:35,200;29:40,120;"- I was a big, I was on his side"
29:40,120;29:42,680;"for the first year, 100%."
29:42,680;29:47,680;"Last year, it's hard to win without your franchise quarterback"
29:47,680;29:52,800;"and not being a set team to win the Super Bowl."
29:52,800;29:55,200;"Like if you're set up to win the Super Bowl,"
29:55,200;29:57,920;"I think you have enough pieces to where you can get by"
29:57,920;29:59,880;"with a game manager,"
29:59,880;30:03,160;"but when your team really stinks, you can't, right?"
30:03,160;30:04,280;"The quarterback position,"
30:04,280;30:06,440;"it's been the story of Stafford's career."
30:06,440;30:08,520;"If you remove him from the situation,"
30:08,520;30:10,920;"we're fighting 0 and 16 every single year."
30:10,920;30:13,600;"I think he makes that big of a difference."
30:13,600;30:17,200;"So this year is the year for me"
30:17,200;30:21,280;"that's gonna tilt am I a Patricia Guy or not."
30:21,280;30:23,640;"Right now I still give him the benefit of the doubt."
30:23,640;30:25,400;"He's in the August face, guys."
30:25,400;30:26,240;"(laughing)"
30:26,240;30:28,600;"This is gonna be different."
30:28,600;30:30,680;"That's the number nine year veteran."
30:30,680;30:31,560;"- That's gonna be healthy."
30:31,560;30:33,640;"- This is gonna be the hit five."
30:33,640;30:35,040;"He can do it."
30:35,040;30:36,920;"- Yeah, I know."
30:36,920;30:38,640;"And like you get excited again,"
30:38,640;30:39,760;"'cause the draft rolls around"
30:39,760;30:42,600;"and you get excited 'cause you're always in like the top five"
30:42,600;30:43,600;"or even top 10."
30:43,600;30:46,080;"So you're getting like something new and shiny."
30:46,080;30:48,200;"So you're like, this is, this guys are,"
30:48,200;30:50,280;"we needed one more piece and he is it."
30:50,280;30:52,600;"This guy's gonna be the difference maker."
30:52,600;30:53,600;"one piece away."
30:53,600;30:56,400;"And we're not."
30:56,400;30:57,600;"I think we're having"
30:57,600;30:57,600;"good."
30:57,600;30:59,800;"They're not that bad this year."
30:59,800;31:03,400;"No, I'm on August mode."
31:03,400;31:06,600;"Yeah, on paper, they're not there."
31:06,600;31:07,400;"They aren't."
31:07,400;31:11,800;"It's just it's there's like you always have this like looming like"
31:11,800;31:14,800;"something like something's going to happen."
31:14,800;31:17,000;"And it's not good."
31:17,000;31:18,600;"Like you never get a break."
31:18,600;31:20,400;"It's always like"
31:22,000;31:26,920;"Stafford might roll his ankle running out of the tunnel or like something like that, right? Yeah"
31:26,920;31:36,440;"This is the year no this is the year man you should get yourself all worked up and lathered up above the 2020 Detroit"
31:36,440;31:37,440;"Lions"
31:37,440;31:41,640;"You know what it was it was the fans they were hurting the team. We just get rid of them"
31:41,640;31:44,800;"Yeah"
31:44,800;31:47,040;"Losing the wild card"
31:47,560;31:53,200;"Like I don't know what like you know like what the future is gonna be like with COVID and stuff like that"
31:53,200;32:00,680;"But all part of me will be very upset if like COVID still very much like around and the lines do in the Super Bowl"
32:00,680;32:02,680;"And when that happens, we can't have a parade"
32:02,680;32:10,240;"There's no group you kind of just look at each other and you're like hey we did it"
32:10,240;32:17,460;"You guys should root for the Patriots this year just because for us it'll be like well"
32:17,460;32:21,060;"So we, you know, celebrated those out of years, not going to lie."
32:21,060;32:24,420;"There's already been talk about what are they going to do with the duck boats this"
32:24,420;32:27,380;"year if one of the Boston wins another championship."
32:27,380;32:29,180;"Did I love that?"
32:29,180;32:30,900;"I love that confidence."
32:30,900;32:31,620;"Why not?"
32:31,620;32:33,500;"I agree."
32:33,500;32:37,540;"When statistically, yeah, there's a good chance one of the four will win."
32:37,540;32:38,300;"Yeah."
32:38,300;32:42,020;"Also, you know, the bros are in the second, they're, they're in the second round, right?"
32:42,020;32:42,820;"Like, yeah."
32:42,820;32:43,260;"Yep."
32:43,260;32:44,340;"Celtics swept."
32:44,340;32:44,740;"Yeah."
32:47,100;32:48,500;"Hi, let's get to this game."
32:48,500;32:49,100;"Yeah."
32:49,100;32:53,100;"So I just want one more thing about this, this, uh,"
32:53,100;32:55,200;"this lion's team."
32:55,200;33:00,100;"This we've been doing this for almost two full seasons and I do"
33:00,100;33:04,500;"a write up of like I do a deep dive and all the players and everything."
33:04,500;33:09,700;"This is the first time we've seen an opponent where they didn't have a"
33:09,700;33:11,300;"pro bowler on the team."
33:11,300;33:12,700;"Really?"
33:12,700;33:14,500;"That's nobody on this team."
33:14,500;33:15,800;"May the pet's interesting."
33:16,400;33:19,480;"I feel like everybody gets like a pity vote, no?"
33:19,480;33:22,720;"I'm trying to think of the closest guys."
33:22,720;33:29,600;"There was a-- I can't think of his name as he's escaping me."
33:29,600;33:30,800;"You guys probably know if you have the--"
33:30,800;33:32,360;"I don't have the roster pulled up, I should."
33:32,360;33:36,160;"But there's a dude on the D line that's pretty talented,"
33:36,160;33:37,160;"just in terms of overall--"
33:37,160;33:38,160;"Rob or Portche."
33:38,160;33:39,400;"Rob or Portche."
33:39,400;33:39,920;"Yeah."
33:39,920;33:43,800;"He's up there and just who is one of the better players"
33:43,800;33:44,720;"on our team?"
33:44,720;33:48,520;"Him and Chris. I think on that. I was Jersey for some reason."
33:48,520;33:49,840;"Hands really?"
33:49,840;33:51,000;"Hanson."
33:51,000;33:54,840;"I'm surprised. Don't go kicker."
33:54,840;33:58,200;"You want to do it?"
33:58,200;33:59,360;"Don't do it."
33:59,360;34:04,360;"Kicker kickers one step away from the punter."
34:04,360;34:05,320;"Dude, don't do it."
34:05,320;34:06,000;"That's what I'm saying."
34:06,000;34:09,680;"If you're three and 13, you think your punter would have the numbers to get in the pro ball."
34:09,680;34:11,280;"Yeah. Oh, God."
34:11,280;34:12,680;"Sean Rogers."
34:12,680;34:13,760;"He was. Yeah."
34:13,760;34:16,360;"- Yeah, Sean Rogers actually, that's the dude I was thinking of."
34:16,360;34:21,360;"But maybe he, I don't know what year he was in 2002."
34:21,360;34:26,560;"So maybe he made it later on in his career."
34:26,560;34:29,480;"- Yeah."
34:29,480;34:32,400;"- Skill position though, they were pretty bare."
34:32,400;34:33,320;"- Yeah."
34:33,320;34:35,080;"- Yeah, just touch on those."
34:35,080;34:40,080;"- They just signed Schrödinger and Hakim as of their team."
34:40,080;34:41,920;"- Yeah, those are."
34:41,920;34:42,760;"- Bad signings."
34:42,760;34:43,820;"- Yeah, I'd say here."
34:43,820;34:49,140;"Yeah, James Stewart, I thought was probably"
34:49,140;34:52,580;"the only bright spot on this offense."
34:52,580;34:55,220;"- Yeah. - Ran for over a thousand yards"
34:55,220;34:57,140;"and four whole touchdowns."
34:57,140;34:58,380;"So good for him."
34:58,380;34:59,220;"- Yeah."
34:59,220;35:03,060;"- Joey Harrington would be the starter"
35:03,060;35:04,660;"for I think most of the year."
35:04,660;35:06,420;"Even though they were talking about,"
35:06,420;35:08,500;"they had drafted some guy last year"
35:08,500;35:11,860;"first round some quarterback."
35:11,860;35:13,620;"- Yeah, McMan. - Do you remember why?"
35:13,620;35:15,180;"- McSumpener, other."
35:15,180;35:16,060;"- Mike McCann?"
35:16,060;35:17,980;"- Yeah, something like that."
35:17,980;35:18,820;"- He was the backup."
35:18,820;35:20,860;"- Yeah, I thought he was related to,"
35:20,860;35:22,260;"I thought he was related to that,"
35:22,260;35:23,580;"the guy from the Bears."
35:23,580;35:25,980;"- Jim McMahon, yeah, that's what I thought, but no."
35:25,980;35:28,580;"- Jim McMahon, 'cause he looks just like him too."
35:28,580;35:29,420;"- Yeah."
35:29,420;35:30,260;"- That kind of an old one."
35:30,260;35:32,500;"- Joey Harrington threw four,"
35:32,500;35:37,500;"not quite 2300 yards, 12 touchdowns, 16 interceptions."
35:37,500;35:41,540;"- And just a bit off that Pro Bowl."
35:41,540;35:48,820;"Yeah. And the crazy part is, yeah, the crazy part is their defense was worse than their offense."
35:48,820;35:55,220;"Yeah. Yeah. If you look at their league stand, where they stood in the league for so for yards,"
35:55,220;36:01,540;"there were 28th in offense and 31st in defense and for points 26 and 31st."
36:01,540;36:07,780;"So not where they were just bad across the board. Yeah. Yeah, but the kicker, dude."
36:07,780;36:16,100;"but oh yes, but he was he's in one of the all-time like point scores for Detroit"
36:16,100;36:20,900;"He said that he broke that right at this game. Yeah wasn't this game. Yeah, they broke that"
36:20,900;36:23,940;"that was like that was like front page news. I remember that that was a big stuff."
36:23,940;36:27,940;"Well, yeah, the primary talking about this game now"
36:27,940;36:32,500;"Well, right spot page two. Joey Harrington throws four interceptions"
36:33,780;36:39,060;"The thing about Harrington, this like followed him throughout his career too is I actually do think he"
36:39,060;36:46,900;"He was talented enough to to be successful in the NFL back then because I think he was a little bit ahead of his time in terms of"
36:46,900;36:49,540;"being like"
36:49,540;36:55,380;"Mobile but also like having like a pretty strong arm, right? If that's what made him like a top pick"
36:55,380;37:00,180;"The problem was just I think mismanaging. I think he had literally no leash"
37:00,660;37:05,380;"Like it was just, ""Alright Joey, go out there and just kind of do your thing."""
37:05,380;37:05,880;"Right?"
37:05,880;37:07,220;"And you can see it in this game."
37:07,220;37:08,820;"And he has no help around him either."
37:08,820;37:09,320;"Right."
37:09,320;37:13,060;"So he just got caught trying to do way too much."
37:13,060;37:13,560;"Yeah."
37:13,560;37:17,380;"And I think of when you're in the NFL, like psychologically,"
37:17,380;37:22,560;"like that takes a toll on you, like year after year after year."
37:22,560;37:27,000;"And then the fans just, they blame you for problems that aren't really yours."
37:27,000;37:28,420;"You're just trying to go out and win."
37:28,420;37:28,900;"Right?"
37:28,900;37:33,060;"And so it's a little bit of he got caught in a bad situation, I think."
37:33,060;37:37,220;"And I think you see it in this game, like he does make some really good throws."
37:37,220;37:41,820;"He just makes some really bad decisions that a rookie's going to make."
37:41,820;37:47,480;"Right. Yeah, because he threw a like what he showed like a busted screen"
37:47,480;37:50,500;"password. You always see Tom Brady just fucking throw it in the dirt right in front"
37:50,500;37:51,500;"of his feet."
37:51,500;37:54,060;"He threw an interception on one of those just trying to force it."
37:54,060;37:54,740;"Yeah."
37:54,740;37:55,740;"to a different line."
37:55,740;38:00,020;"And then throws the neck, the play comes up again in like a quarter later and he throws"
38:00,020;38:01,820;"in the dirt and the fans boom."
38:01,820;38:02,820;"Yeah."
38:02,820;38:04,580;"And we're talking like 12 starts maximum."
38:04,580;38:05,580;"Yeah."
38:05,580;38:07,260;"No, no, didn't they gave him like a standing."
38:07,260;38:09,060;"Oh, what he did it."
38:09,060;38:10,580;"But it was like a sarcastic one."
38:10,580;38:11,580;"Right."
38:11,580;38:14,780;"And it was like, so it's brutal, right?"
38:14,780;38:16,380;"Just just try being that dude."
38:16,380;38:22,220;"And he was always very vocal about I want to I'm going to be the guy who brings the team"
38:22,220;38:23,220;"back."
38:23,220;38:25,420;"to be that franchise star that's done."
38:25,420;38:27,520;"This is going to be my legacy."
38:27,520;38:31,820;"And it like people took that and they like made fun of them for it."
38:31,820;38:37,940;"It's like, kind of almost has a similar feel to like Drew"
38:37,940;38:39,140;"Bledso back in the day."
38:39,140;38:42,300;"Like he was supposed to be that face of the franchise."
38:42,300;38:46,340;"And I think he was a bit more successful maybe because he had more"
38:46,340;38:48,780;"weapons or whatever he had better coaching or better."
38:48,780;38:50,500;"Because he had Troy Brown stuff around him."
38:50,780;38:51,780;"But yeah, exactly."
38:51,780;38:55,780;"But he was always kind of criticized for trying to do too much."
38:55,780;38:59,460;"Like he's getting sack, he's throwing the ball over his shoulder backwards blind sort of thing."
38:59,460;39:04,060;"And it feels like Harrington is in his similar situation, but"
39:04,060;39:06,860;"dealt with it kind of the same way."
39:06,860;39:08,300;"Yeah."
39:08,300;39:09,980;"It was on definitely."
39:09,980;39:13,300;"I thought David Carr is a similar situation where"
39:13,300;39:18,220;"yeah, I think if a situation is different, they'd be a good quarterback."
39:18,220;39:23,660;"But just like with everything else working against you you have no chance in the NFL"
39:23,660;39:30,480;"And I honestly think there's a ton of quarterbacks that get stuck in shitty situations"
39:30,480;39:36,060;"Oh, yeah, and that's their defining career because you only get so much time to prove yourself in the NFL"
39:36,060;39:44,020;"That's true obviously look at literally any jets quarterback"
39:45,380;39:51,660;"Brown's like how many people are on that jersey that they have you need to tell me all those quarterbacks are terrible"
39:51,660;39:56,420;"Oh, or is it the fucking organization that sucks, you know, yeah, I mean I'm gonna say core"
39:56,420;39:58,940;"terrible, but yes"
39:58,940;40:05,020;"You always hear fans talk about like well like our quarterback sucks"
40:05,020;40:09,680;"It's fine just get them out of here and like we'll rotate a new one in and I'm always like whoa"
40:09,680;40:15,180;"Trust me that that quarterback carousel. It's not a fun ride to be on there, brother"
40:15,180;40:20,120;"Like you don't like you just want to like he's not the only reason you stink"
40:20,120;40:23,280;"You're just blaming you know you kind of point the gun at him"
40:23,280;40:28,320;"But like oh, I don't know maybe if you spent some money on your offensive line instead of paying a receiver"
40:28,320;40:31,480;"$80 million over the next six years might be a little better"
40:31,480;40:34,560;"You're Ryan Taney Hill"
40:34,560;40:39,600;"Fuck like six years and now he's a pro ball"
40:39,600;40:43,440;"So speaking of Joey Harrington though, there was a few things"
40:44,120;40:46,960;"That I found interesting at least in this game boy"
40:46,960;40:50,920;"The first was I don't know if this was"
40:50,920;40:55,600;"Who was it who was it this start reading your notes?"
40:55,600;41:04,240;"Yeah, all right, so nice bullet points Andy you're calling someone a nerd in your notes that you wrote up"
41:04,240;41:09,600;"He's calling someone a nerd"
41:13,080;41:14,080;"better show."
41:14,080;41:19,360;"I'm not a person with like links to the timestamp to YouTube in it."
41:19,360;41:21,360;"Are you done?"
41:21,360;41:23,360;"You want to hear why you got me?"
41:23,360;41:26,360;"I'm not going to go for it."
41:26,360;41:28,240;"I'm not a party morning."
41:28,240;41:29,240;"We've looked Sandy."
41:29,240;41:31,760;"Why do you lost his job at the end of this year?"
41:31,760;41:32,760;"Yeah."
41:32,760;41:33,760;"I'm a heart."
41:33,760;41:34,760;"Here's why."
41:34,760;41:48,760;"the biggest key for us on offense today is to convert third downs. If you look at the statistics, the team's chance of scoring goes up 6-2% if you convert 1/3 down during a drive. We need to be efficient and make plays on 3rd down today."
41:48,760;42:09,260;"His Spencer Bolck said…"
42:09,260;42:11,660;"that Joey Harrington of all people ran a more,"
42:11,660;42:14,160;"he said he ran a more complicated offensive college"
42:14,160;42:15,280;"than he does now, which,"
42:15,280;42:16,520;"- Oh yeah, I noticed that too."
42:16,520;42:19,520;"- Don't know if that says a lot about the Lions offense."
42:19,520;42:20,360;"- Where'd he go to school?"
42:20,360;42:21,200;"- Oregon."
42:21,200;42:22,040;"- Oregon, yeah."
42:22,040;42:24,560;"- I don't know if that says a lot about Joey Harrington."
42:24,560;42:27,640;"- And that was like before Oregon was like,"
42:27,640;42:28,480;"- Yeah."
42:28,480;42:30,160;"- Big popular university, right?"
42:30,160;42:31,600;"They were still just kind of like,"
42:31,600;42:36,440;"pack 12 sort of irrelevant, sort of good, but like no flash."
42:36,440;42:38,000;"- Yeah, what did you,"
42:38,000;42:40,240;"The guy that the charges drafted, did you hear that?"
42:40,240;42:42,200;"And they were asking him about it."
42:42,200;42:45,360;"Like he's a guy from the quarterback from Oregon, Herbert."
42:45,360;42:48,760;"And they were like, who do you like compare your game to?"
42:48,760;42:50,400;"He's like, Joey Harrington."
42:50,400;42:52,320;"And they were like, um, oops."
42:52,320;42:55,280;"Are you sure?"
42:55,280;42:56,360;"Very old."
42:56,360;42:57,640;"You're weird."
42:57,640;43:00,040;"Weird, weird, weird moves."
43:00,040;43:01,840;"Are you sure?"
43:01,840;43:05,600;"But he's like, they're both born and bred like Oregon guys."
43:05,600;43:06,080;"Yeah."
43:06,080;43:07,840;"like they're from that region."
43:07,840;43:11,640;"So I think he's still like a pretty well respected"
43:11,640;43:13,640;"in like the Oregon community, you know?"
43:13,640;43:15,120;"- I think so too."
43:15,120;43:20,120;"And again, like I think when a lot of people look back on it,"
43:20,120;43:23,520;"they blamed Joey less and less and less"
43:23,520;43:26,800;"and started again realizing that it was,"
43:26,800;43:29,280;"he was sort of set up to fail."
43:29,280;43:30,120;"- Yeah."
43:30,120;43:31,360;"And then especially if you've already got"
43:31,360;43:33,360;"super high hopes for him, you're from that area,"
43:33,360;43:35,600;"anyone, you know, Oregon coaching staff,"
43:35,600;43:37,640;"like big fan of Oregon, whatever."
43:37,640;43:40,440;"They obviously give them the benefit of the doubt."
43:40,440;43:42,920;"You know, I'm obviously on that train too."
43:42,920;43:43,760;"- Yeah."
43:43,760;43:46,240;"Well, I think that's a perfect segue into Marty Morninwig."
43:46,240;43:49,520;"Because you're right, I know you guys read my note,"
43:49,520;43:51,600;"but that haircut does make it look like"
43:51,600;43:53,480;"he has a comb over in the back of his head."
43:53,480;43:55,160;"I don't know how he did that."
43:55,160;43:58,400;"- But I didn't notice that Andy."
43:58,400;44:01,160;"- You guys know he replaced him next year?"
44:01,160;44:02,000;"- No."
44:02,000;44:02,840;"- Who was it?"
44:04,520;44:08,520;"Steve Maruyucci. Oh, the moosh. That's right. That's right."
44:08,520;44:13,760;"And so people, people really thought he was the savior. Like they, that was when"
44:13,760;44:18,600;"the hot, the hopes were through the roof on this track."
44:18,600;44:21,640;"Cause he was still pretty good back then. Host Niners, Mooji. Yeah."
44:21,640;44:24,920;"We're going to be the next, that's us. Yeah."
44:24,920;44:29,960;"Do you know why that's kind of like the, uh, the Panthers with George"
44:29,960;44:31,960;"Seifer too, same sort of thing. Oh, yeah."
44:32,520;44:35,440;"A lot of failed 49ers coaches similar to the Patriots"
44:35,440;44:36,440;"coaching staff lately."
44:36,440;44:43,520;"I looked like, um, uh, what's the guy that's, this?"
44:43,520;44:46,800;"Mangini, doesn't he look like Mangini?"
44:46,800;44:47,360;"Yeah."
44:47,360;44:47,880;"I mean, definitely."
44:47,880;44:48,240;"Yeah."
44:48,240;44:52,760;"Mangini with bad hair, which is tough to do, but not as fat."
44:52,760;44:53,960;"True."
44:53,960;44:54,200;"Yeah."
44:54,200;45:02,280;"Um, so I think that may, this, this to me is probably why he"
45:02,280;45:06,560;"got fired coach a lot of pressure on your quarterback 11 hurries how do you get Joey"
45:06,560;45:10,720;"calm down and turned around here in the second half well really we rushed a few of them"
45:10,720;45:15,360;"they're pressure defense you know we threw a bunch of interceptions without the interceptions"
45:15,360;45:20,000;"geez it's a close football game so I'll calm them down here at halftime he took took us"
45:20,000;45:26,600;"down there for a two minute drive for three points so alright coach thank you good luck"
45:26,600;45:28,840;"I got a belongs coach and kindergartners."
45:28,840;45:31,760;"He's shitting me right now."
45:31,760;45:33,840;"He's bagged to groceries."
45:33,840;45:37,120;"They were saying, ""Guilhakers, I tell you guys."""
45:37,120;45:38,120;"You know?"
45:38,120;45:42,320;"Can you imagine walking in on Thanksgiving for millions of people,"
45:42,320;45:45,440;"that dude walks in and half time, it's supposed to fire you up."
45:45,440;45:49,400;"It looks like the dude that's supposed to fix something because your helmet broke."
45:49,400;45:51,360;"Or like, ""Oh, shit, the plumbing's backed up."
45:51,360;45:52,560;"We got Carl Carl again."""
45:52,560;45:54,800;"And he comes in and he's like, ""Gosh, daughter, new guys."
45:54,800;45:55,600;"Let me go help you."""
45:55,600;45:57,600;"Red Gator in City Yellow?"
45:57,600;46:02,700;"That's nightmares. That's nightmare fuel"
46:02,700;46:09,460;"Like if there was a movie made about him it'll be played by Chevy Chase putting on a really really bad accent"
46:09,460;46:17,920;"Yeah, it's that character. Yeah, he's like a he's like a stereotypical like Midwestern like"
46:17,920;46:25,240;"Guys happy go lucky now here in the world. I think you guys are shucking corn wrong"
46:25,240;46:26,240;"What is wrong?"
46:26,240;46:31,840;"He goes, that dude goes home and his wife doesn't watch, she's not a football fan."
46:31,840;46:34,480;"So he goes home and she's like, how was work?"
46:34,480;46:36,280;"And he was like, was it a tough day?"
46:36,280;46:41,440;"We lost again, but we'll get better."
46:41,440;46:46,040;"And then she controls the remote because he's a pussy and a cock."
46:46,040;46:52,200;"He just watches how his lives are fucking."
46:52,200;46:57,120;"Ohio yeah, I don't know what he respects that dude"
46:57,120;47:04,400;"Practice it just it was run a muck like he'd have his clipboard out and people would walk by and they they they fuck"
47:04,400;47:06,100;"They just smacked it and talk about it"
47:06,100;47:11,600;"They look like they put his finger on the chest and kind of like your nose. They do that to them all the time"
47:11,600;47:13,840;"They don't let him have a whistle"
47:13,840;47:18,600;"It's just a dog whistle no can hear it"
47:18,600;47:25,600;"the"
47:25,600;47:27,000;"which i think all the uh..."
47:27,000;47:28,340;"were marty"
47:28,340;47:30,720;"all the penalties can make sense now right"
47:30,720;47:34,540;"after hearing that i know"
47:34,540;47:39,680;"that the detroit actually had uh... an off-sides penalty on the kickoff"
47:39,680;47:40,860;"in this game"
47:40,860;47:43,160;"which led to a huge return from"
47:43,160;47:45,800;"branch branch right yes from the on branch yet"
47:45,800;47:50,880;"That was after the first right at the end of the first quarter. Yeah. Yeah after their first field goal"
47:50,880;47:54,640;"Yeah, they settled for a lot of field goals in this game all four of them"
47:54,640;47:58,300;"Very consistent Hanson pro bowler"
47:58,300;48:03,360;"Did you see him break down to make the tackle on Dion branch?"
48:03,360;48:08,020;"Yeah, they had that highlight in the highlands that's generous"
48:08,020;48:12,480;"But he is loved it though. Yeah, I gotta get so"
48:14,440;48:18,140;"It looked like me out there trying to make a tackle."
48:18,140;48:20,720;"I think I figured it out."
48:20,720;48:23,420;"I was interned with the Lions before I actually started"
48:23,420;48:25,420;"working at Billy Caster Golf."
48:25,420;48:25,920;"Really?"
48:25,920;48:27,640;"Did a bunch of kids camps."
48:27,640;48:29,080;"That was like-- it was like the--"
48:29,080;48:31,920;"they called their football education department, which"
48:31,920;48:32,520;"is pretty cool."
48:32,520;48:36,080;"And basically, you go around and the Lions set up"
48:36,080;48:39,360;"camps for little kids around the state."
48:39,360;48:40,040;"And it's super cool."
48:40,040;48:42,840;"I think a lot of teams in the NFL,"
48:42,840;48:46,760;"they have that program or aspect of their business set up, right?"
48:46,760;48:51,760;"And so a lot of times they'd invite either current players,"
48:51,760;48:54,160;"like rookies that are just getting started,"
48:54,160;48:55,720;"or they'll do like alumni players."
48:55,720;48:59,400;"So they had like Herman Moore come out one week for camp,"
48:59,400;49:00,240;"which was cool."
49:00,240;49:03,280;"He's a super cool guy, super great with the kids."
49:03,280;49:04,520;"And then there was Jason Hanson,"
49:04,520;49:08,280;"who also came out to one of the bigger camps at Ford Field."
49:08,280;49:10,760;"And super cool guy,"
49:10,760;49:13,760;"He was like the epitome of like a kicker."
49:13,760;49:17,320;"Like he just was kind of like super goofy, joking around."
49:17,320;49:20,200;"He kept saying like everything was tight."
49:20,200;49:21,680;"Like he did that old guy thing"
49:21,680;49:24,520;"or he's like, he would move a drill and he'd be like,"
49:24,520;49:25,520;"""Tight."""
49:25,520;49:27,240;"And but then you see him on the sideline"
49:27,240;49:30,320;"like working on his golf swing like without a club."
49:30,320;49:34,520;"And I was like kind of nervous to talk to him"
49:34,520;49:36,880;"but I was at a station with him."
49:36,880;49:39,960;"And he was a cool guy."
49:39,960;49:44,200;"He, uh, he would kick out of the kids a little bit, but yeah."
49:44,200;49:47,160;"Do you want me Barry Sanders?"
49:47,160;49:53,280;"No, I've gone to like him, like speaking, you know, like, uh,"
49:53,280;49:55,200;"things that he's like spoken at."
49:55,200;50:00,360;"Um, and the guys within like my boss at the time and other dudes that I've"
50:00,360;50:03,960;"worked with, they've, they had a chance to meet him a bunch of times."
50:03,960;50:08,440;"And they said he's kind of as advertised, super cool dude down to earth."
50:08,440;50:09,360;"Super humble."
50:09,720;50:11,440;"Yeah, very, very humble."
50:11,440;50:15,320;"So I just want to say that, um, the Detroit lines putting on football"
50:15,320;50:21,000;"education, anything is like this podcast putting on anything educational."
50:21,000;50:23,840;"Yeah, there's just the wrong people to do it."
50:23,840;50:28,720;"You know, it's even funnier is they were like, they're like one of the first,"
50:28,720;50:34,640;"they like kind of are like pioneering this business structure of God or like"
50:34,640;50:38,680;"other NFL teams that are now reaching out to the lines to say like, how do we"
50:38,680;50:41,400;"something similar for our team."
50:41,400;50:43,200;"They like they kind of pioneered it."
50:43,200;50:48,520;"What's the quotes that those that can do and those that can't teach, right?"
50:48,520;50:49,720;"There it is."
50:49,720;50:53,720;"Marty, morning wigs in charge."
50:53,720;50:57,120;"It'd be good at it."
50:57,120;51:05,720;"Well, statistically, if you convert third downs, 92% better chance of win."
51:05,720;51:07,360;"All the kids are fucking right down."
51:07,360;51:11,500;"No, they're not. Shut up, Joey."
51:11,500;51:13,800;"Girl man, no, my Joey."
51:13,800;51:16,040;"I can't believe they allowed that at the beginning."
51:16,040;51:18,040;"Just him to rattle off some facts."
51:18,040;51:20,480;"Maybe he's been a little more time in the playbook."
51:20,480;51:25,200;"They crunch it. No, I would throw four interceptions there, Joe."
51:25,200;51:28,800;"I feel like I've never seen anybody throw."
51:28,800;51:29,760;"I wrote this down."
51:29,760;51:33,280;"I've never seen anybody throw so many almost interceptions."
51:33,280;51:36,440;"There's a bunch of tips in that game, too. Yeah."
51:36,440;51:39,720;"Yeah, like every single incompletion was tipped at least twice."
51:39,720;51:40,640;"Yeah."
51:40,640;51:47,240;"One the other way though, we had that one sick tip to, uh, I think it was Deon as well."
51:47,240;51:48,400;"That's true. Yeah."
51:48,400;51:51,440;"It was Patton. He like, yeah. Yeah."
51:51,440;51:51,960;"Yeah."
51:51,960;51:52,520;"Yeah."
51:52,520;51:55,960;"Like it's like, that was like on a big third down."
51:55,960;51:57,240;"Like really, yeah."
51:57,240;51:57,760;"Yeah."
51:57,760;52:02,920;"But that's that kind of dichotomy between the Patriots and the in the lines like right there."
52:03,240;52:10,100;"How many how many balls got tipped in this entire game and when a patrons ball gets tipped it gets caught by a patriot"
52:10,100;52:15,360;"It's like a big game line ball gets tipped. It's an incompletion or at best in the interception"
52:15,360;52:18,080;"Yeah, it's uh"
52:18,080;52:20,800;"It's that's that's that's the timing"
52:20,800;52:26,400;"Oh boy, so I was on morning wag"
52:26,400;52:29,360;"Wikipedia"
52:29,360;52:30,920;"Yeah"
52:30,920;52:35,840;"Seems like he got into a little bit of trouble back in college a little bit of a bad boy"
52:35,840;52:38,220;"Yeah, I was gonna bring this up if you didn't oh"
52:38,220;52:45,640;"Montana suspends to starters did you did you bring up the article Andy? No, I just saw that he got"
52:45,640;52:49,680;"He was academically suspended or something like that for a year"
52:49,680;52:53,280;"Looks like it wasn't he like the starting quarterback or something. Oh"
52:53,280;52:59,840;"He was he was a four-year starter at Montana the big grist well three"
52:59,840;53:03,840;"Did he like not say thank you one time or something?"
53:03,840;53:09,800;"No, he probably like, it was like finger painting something and he hung it up and it just, it"
53:09,800;53:10,800;"was like a big dick."
53:10,800;53:13,200;"So it just, it just can't count."
53:13,200;53:16,200;"But it was by accident."
53:16,200;53:17,200;"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
53:17,200;53:19,880;"He was like, ""Yes, you were, I swear, it was a rocket ship!"""
53:19,880;53:22,800;"I'm just that bad."
53:22,800;53:26,080;"Those are flames, not pew bears."
53:26,080;53:29,320;"He's probably finger bang in the coaches of life is what he's doing."
53:29,320;53:31,280;"The Troy lines like you on the other side."
53:31,280;53:33,600;"I think fucking more like tied in something."
53:33,600;53:34,960;"Yeah."
53:34,960;53:37,760;"Slow playing us."
53:37,760;53:39,720;"The Troy lines like, no, you know what?"
53:39,720;53:41,440;"You, you're in charge."
53:41,440;53:53,520;"So usually we actually haven't done this yet."
53:53,520;53:56,360;"Usually we give a watchability score."
53:56,360;53:56,880;"Oh, yeah."
53:56,880;54:01,320;"Trevor, did you watch the whole game?"
54:01,320;54:04,360;"I did the shortened version of it."
54:04,360;54:06,280;"So that, like, tween your name."
54:06,280;54:07,280;"Yeah."
54:07,280;54:08,280;"Yeah."
54:08,280;54:09,280;"Okay."
54:09,280;54:10,280;"What's the scale?"
54:10,280;54:15,680;"Oh, I'm so glad you asked."
54:15,680;54:19,680;"We do out of six Lombardis."
54:19,680;54:20,680;"How many do you give it?"
54:20,680;54:22,280;"So one to six Lombardis."
54:22,280;54:24,560;"You can do the HASS with AC Championships."
54:24,560;54:30,540;"So like I'm going to give it maybe four, three Lombardi's in AFC Championship for the"
54:30,540;54:31,540;"bar."
54:31,540;54:32,540;"Go for it."
54:32,540;54:33,540;"Right around there."
54:33,540;54:34,540;"Really?"
54:34,540;54:41,740;"I would go from, I would go to like two Lombardi's and like an NFC Championship."
54:41,740;54:44,300;"Yeah, you don't, I don't get you to win."
54:44,300;54:45,300;"I'm going to do that."
54:45,300;54:47,260;"Yeah, I don't think you have any questions."
54:47,260;54:50,020;"So just, well, we don't have any Lombardi's either."
54:50,020;54:51,180;"So if I go zero."
54:51,180;55:00,500;"zero two wins two and a half wins in a tie two all in 16 seasons."
55:00,500;55:02,780;"Yeah, I'm seeing it in a picture."
55:02,780;55:11,900;"I would I disagree with even I would give this like a two out of six."
55:11,900;55:13,540;"It's Thanksgiving."
55:13,540;55:17,620;"I think I even game has to have a fucking extra Lombardi on it."
55:17,620;55:20,140;"This this game I gave it an extra Lombardi."
55:20,660;55:23,260;"This game was probably the least exciting stars."
55:23,260;55:27,380;"This is the least exciting patrons when I've seen since we started doing this."
55:27,380;55:28,500;"That's I agree."
55:28,500;55:29,100;"That's the thing."
55:29,100;55:31,660;"It just it wasn't super exciting."
55:31,660;55:33,100;"Brady wasn't good."
55:33,100;55:39,140;"The defense was still giving up a shit on a rushing yards to a lines team who came in here."
55:39,140;55:41,500;"What like three and seven or something."
55:41,500;55:42,420;"Right."
55:42,420;55:45,740;"It didn't look like they wanted to be there."
55:45,740;55:48,740;"It just."
55:49,380;55:51,100;"Who gets your turducken award?"
55:51,100;55:52,260;"The John Madden."
55:52,260;55:55,240;"I don't know."
55:55,240;55:56,540;"Who's the biggest guy on the field?"
55:56,540;55:59,420;"No, Vince."
55:59,420;56:00,380;"Actually, here, right?"
56:00,380;56:00,980;"Oh, wow."
56:00,980;56:02,380;"What's the name Bobby Hamilton?"
56:02,380;56:04,940;"Now I'm going to give it to Jeff Gooch."
56:04,940;56:07,220;"Gooch."
56:07,220;56:07,700;"Jeff."
56:07,700;56:08,380;"Gooch."
56:08,380;56:10,020;"Dude, you know, gooch."
56:10,020;56:12,660;"Wait, which team was he on?"
56:12,660;56:16,380;"The lions, but his name is Jeff Gooch."
56:16,380;56:17,460;"So he."
56:17,460;56:18,180;"Jeff."
56:18,180;56:23,100;"I'm back. It's Lyndon Lyndon gooch. He's one of my favorite soccer players right now"
56:23,100;56:25,500;"What about Taylor gooch the golfer?"
56:25,500;56:29,060;"Tower tower, but Gucci man"
56:29,060;56:32,420;"Mmm the rapper"
56:32,420;56:38,060;"Right, it's all one weird family. Yeah. Oh, yeah, okay"
56:38,060;56:41,220;"Yeah, Jeff Gucci had four tackles"
56:41,220;56:44,220;"two solos"
56:44,220;56:46,220;"And that was all he did this game"
56:46,380;56:48,380;"But his name is Jeff Guch"
56:48,380;56:51,180;"And so his tower good guy looks like"
56:51,180;56:56,780;"Blakey Duncan McElroy. Yeah, well, he looks like Roy Roy McElroy and Blake Griffin"
56:56,780;57:04,300;"Yeah, Lyndon Guch is actually a pretty legit American soccer player who plays on England or in England on"
57:04,300;57:06,100;"Sunderland right now"
57:06,100;57:07,980;"He was like lightened up for a last year"
57:07,980;57:11,540;"They have a Lyndon Guch and they have max power remember the"
57:11,540;57:14,340;"Simpson yeah"
57:14,340;57:16,660;"The team is just stacked full of funny names."
57:16,660;57:18,660;"(laughing)"
57:18,660;57:23,000;"- So I'm looking at the roster and guys that I think"
57:23,000;57:26,740;"lasted the gauntlet for the Lions, like Slussinger,"
57:26,740;57:29,140;"I'm not including him 'cause he was like an older dude"
57:29,140;57:32,060;"at the time, but he's like a fan favorite."
57:32,060;57:36,620;"But rookies that year, so Joey Harrington obviously was one."
57:36,620;57:40,260;"Dominic Riola was the center and he ended up being"
57:40,260;57:42,140;"a starter for a pretty long time."
57:42,140;57:43,740;"spent his whole career in Detroit."
57:43,740;57:47,060;"Same with Jeff Backis."
57:47,060;57:51,220;"He was there for a pretty long time too,"
57:51,220;57:55,780;"which is like frustrating to read and think about"
57:55,780;57:56,900;"'cause you're like, so you had,"
57:56,900;57:59,860;"we had two anchors on the offensive line,"
57:59,860;58:02,820;"which is a decent amount for a shitty team."
58:02,820;58:04,460;"- Yeah, yeah, there should be a builder."
58:04,460;58:07,740;"- And one draft you had two anchors,"
58:07,740;58:09,260;"not in the first round."
58:09,260;58:12,940;"So they were really good fans."
58:12,940;58:17,780;"And we just couldn't convert with a good offensive line."
58:17,780;58:22,020;"Not winning with a decent offensive line in the NFL"
58:22,020;58:25,460;"is just like having a huge cock"
58:25,460;58:27,780;"and just not just being a virgin"
58:27,780;58:29,540;"because you're just not into sex."
58:29,540;58:31,300;"You're just like, man, you know what?"
58:31,300;58:32,380;"Not for me."
58:32,380;58:33,580;"I've seen a couple of pornos"
58:33,580;58:35,580;"and it just doesn't seem like I'm into it."
58:38,500;58:40,100;"So I'm like a true lion's man."
58:40,100;58:44,660;"I think my two duck and probably goes to Mike McMahon,"
58:44,660;58:45,860;"the backup quarterback,"
58:45,860;58:51,980;"because he was actually in on multiple plays in this game."
58:51,980;58:54,100;"- He caught a pass, didn't he?"
58:54,100;58:55,420;"- He caught a pass out of the backfield."
58:55,420;58:56,260;"Yeah."
58:56,260;58:58,460;"- The OG tasted well."
58:58,460;59:02,780;"- Yeah, the lions actually decided to run a two QB play."
59:02,780;59:04,860;"They did it twice."
59:04,860;59:07,380;"And the other time he ran like a wildcat,"
59:07,380;59:12,420;"like QB draw and you boy Joey Harrington actually went and tried to throw a"
59:12,420;59:19,420;"chop lock on Otis Smith. I think we did not appreciate it. Oh, Joey Harrington,"
59:19,420;59:25,180;"the OG Sam Donald too. Same like a bunch of mistakes trying to do too much on a"
59:25,180;59:27,420;"terrible, terribly run franchise."
59:27,420;59:28,020;"Yeah,"
59:28,020;59:32,180;"he was the quarterback. Who was the quarterback that lined up wide? I think it's"
59:32,180;59:42,820;"the dolphins maybe and just like oh no he was the jets who lined up wide on a"
59:42,820;59:47,740;"another one of these kind of plays and the defensive back like jumped him and"
59:47,740;59:54,040;"he like flinched really bad it made the sand. I think that was Sanchez for the"
59:54,040;01:00:01,540;"jets yeah so I feel like I just stood there with the most like disinterested"
01:00:01,540;01:00:06,260;"look on his face. I remember that. Or he just like stood there and was like, just like a fucking like,"
01:00:06,260;01:00:10,820;"just didn't even move. Yeah. Classic Cutler. I fucking love Cutler."
01:00:10,820;01:00:15,940;"I'm a color guy too. I mean, I'm not a I'm not bears are my least favorite,"
01:00:15,940;01:00:24,660;"favorite team in our division. But I love smoking Jay Cutler is a dude. He is so funny."
01:00:26,420;01:00:27,980;"Having a big dick and not using it."
01:00:27,980;01:00:28,620;"J comes."
01:00:28,620;01:00:32,060;"It was almost by design."
01:00:32,060;01:00:34,220;"And he liked he enjoyed it."
01:00:34,220;01:00:38,580;"Like that dude loved nothing more than just chilling on the bench."
01:00:38,580;01:00:41,020;"Yeah, just collecting a fat contract."
01:00:41,020;01:00:42,620;"Just never gonna change him."
01:00:42,620;01:00:43,700;"He'll never change him."
01:00:43,700;01:00:45,700;"No, I love that."
01:00:45,700;01:00:47,780;"The Bears are your least favorite team in the division."
01:00:47,780;01:00:49,060;"Who's your least favorite team ever?"
01:00:49,060;01:00:52,900;"The Patriots, least favorite team ever."
01:00:52,900;01:00:54,100;"The Detroit Lions."
01:00:54,100;01:00:55,100;"Yeah, the Lions."
01:00:55,820;01:00:59,540;"If I had to actually rank it, yeah, like they they fall into the category."
01:00:59,540;01:01:03,820;"It's weird where they're definitely like my top three least favorite, but also"
01:01:03,820;01:01:05,180;"like number one favorite."
01:01:05,180;01:01:09,700;"It's like I love to hate them, but like I can't I can't run away."
01:01:09,700;01:01:11,580;"It's a it's an abusive relationship."
01:01:11,580;01:01:12,100;"It is."
01:01:12,100;01:01:13,500;"What about the Packers?"
01:01:13,500;01:01:16,460;"Cause they dominated the lines for years, right?"
01:01:16,460;01:01:18,300;"With the the farm into Rogers."
01:01:18,300;01:01:19,580;"Yeah."
01:01:19,580;01:01:25,780;"Um, but the so the thing about and this goes back to a lot of fans."
01:01:25,780;01:01:35,460;"two is I can appreciate Packer fans because it's kind of all that area has. So they're all in and"
01:01:35,460;01:01:41,700;"they're as fans. I really don't think they're that bad and I think it's because of the area."
01:01:41,700;01:01:48,020;"Like they just, it's hard to be kind of swaggy about the Packers."
01:01:48,020;01:01:52,660;"Right? I think there's never really anything flashy about it. So it's nothing that you can"
01:01:52,660;01:01:55,100;"and really get too, too upset about."
01:01:55,100;01:01:56,740;"The bears are kind of the opposite"
01:01:56,740;01:02:00,420;"where even when, like they have the history,"
01:02:00,420;01:02:03,060;"so they're super in your face about that."
01:02:03,060;01:02:06,260;"And also like, they just, I mean,"
01:02:06,260;01:02:07,620;"they're huge cocks about it,"
01:02:07,620;01:02:09,060;"just everything in their city."
01:02:09,060;01:02:11,380;"It's like, it's great and it's incredible."
01:02:11,380;01:02:14,340;"And like, it's not because it's like negative 10"
01:02:14,340;01:02:16,940;"for like four months out of the years."
01:02:16,940;01:02:19,140;"And like, they love to tell you how great they are."
01:02:19,140;01:02:25,380;"And then like they're like the nicer version of like Detroit, right?"
01:02:25,380;01:02:29,020;"If you take away their history, they're like massive underachievers."
01:02:29,020;01:02:30,120;"That's true."
01:02:30,120;01:02:32,300;"But they won't tell you that."
01:02:32,300;01:02:35,100;"What do I agree with that?"
01:02:35,100;01:02:39,500;"Viking is on the little streets."
01:02:39,500;01:02:45,980;"I'm a little skewed because my mom's family and my mother, they're like huge,"
01:02:45,980;01:02:47,100;"huge Vikings fans."
01:02:47,780;01:02:50,380;"So I'm a little skewed in terms."
01:02:50,380;01:02:53,300;"So whenever I meet a Vikings fan, obviously I always,"
01:02:53,300;01:02:55,300;"you know, hey, like I'm a Lions fan,"
01:02:55,300;01:02:57,700;"but that's always like, you know,"
01:02:57,700;01:03:01,100;"no one rips on the Lions fan in the NFC,"
01:03:01,100;01:03:03,060;"but it also leads into the conversation of like,"
01:03:03,060;01:03:04,980;"well, like my family's from Minnesota,"
01:03:04,980;01:03:06,860;"like my mom's a huge Vikings fan,"
01:03:06,860;01:03:11,000;"so I've never had an issue with them or the team really."
01:03:11,000;01:03:13,660;"It's hard to have an issue with any team"
01:03:13,660;01:03:16,740;"when you're just, you know, you're so bad, right?"
01:03:16,740;01:03:20,020;"Did you have Ben Bitingston?"
01:03:20,020;01:03:20,860;"- I could have."
01:03:20,860;01:03:24,300;"And there was a point where I thought about jumping ship."
01:03:24,300;01:03:25,380;"- It's still time."
01:03:25,380;01:03:26,380;"Yeah."
01:03:26,380;01:03:27,220;"- Yeah."
01:03:27,220;01:03:28,300;"- I wouldn't blame you."
01:03:28,300;01:03:30,860;"- Well, it was like when they were really rolling,"
01:03:30,860;01:03:33,500;"I really did like call pepper."
01:03:33,500;01:03:37,380;"Like when I had Madden, I liked playing with call pepper"
01:03:37,380;01:03:38,900;"and boss. - Call pepper and boss, baby."
01:03:38,900;01:03:40,900;"- And I can't remember."
01:03:40,900;01:03:43,820;"- I can't remember the running back-name back."
01:03:43,820;01:03:45,660;"Robert Smith."
01:03:45,660;01:03:47,040;"- Yeah."
01:03:47,040;01:03:49,060;"- Yeah, they were like, they're just like a fun team"
01:03:49,060;01:03:51,340;"to play with and like mom would watch them on Sundays"
01:03:51,340;01:03:52,340;"and stuff."
01:03:52,340;01:03:53,660;"And I really thought about it."
01:03:53,660;01:03:56,540;"I was like, ""Man, this seems like a better life."
01:03:56,540;01:03:58,260;"""This seems happier."""
01:03:58,260;01:04:03,420;"And I don't know if it was like,"
01:04:03,420;01:04:05,580;"they also sort of like underachieve"
01:04:05,580;01:04:09,040;"and my mom's like, she gets really intense in the games."
01:04:09,040;01:04:12,580;"And I just didn't know if I wanted to be a part of that."
01:04:12,580;01:04:14,900;"Like I got my own thing and my own misery."
01:04:14,900;01:04:17,100;"And I feel like if I just don't ship to yours,"
01:04:17,100;01:04:18,820;"which doesn't seem that great,"
01:04:18,820;01:04:20,220;"I just wouldn't mind doing it."
01:04:20,220;01:04:21,780;"- It seems like a different kind of misery"
01:04:21,780;01:04:26,580;"because they're tantalized with almost success."
01:04:26,580;01:04:28,660;"What feels like a bit more of a regular basis."
01:04:28,660;01:04:30,820;"- Yeah, I would agree."
01:04:30,820;01:04:32,500;"- The heartbreak is probably"
01:04:32,500;01:04:35,540;"bare and strong. - They haven't won"
01:04:35,540;01:04:36,720;"a strong ball, right?"
01:04:36,720;01:04:40,060;"- No, I don't think so."
01:04:40,060;01:04:42,580;"They're one of the three,"
01:04:42,580;01:04:44,540;"but they've been to a couple."
01:04:44,540;01:04:47,500;"been to you. But no, I don't I"
01:04:47,500;01:04:48,420;"don't think they've ever won one."
01:04:48,420;01:04:50,600;"Yeah, so I think we're the only"
01:04:50,600;01:04:51,660;"you might you might have to look"
01:04:51,660;01:04:53,720;"this up where there might be one"
01:04:53,720;01:04:55,100;"other team other than the lines"
01:04:55,100;01:04:56,580;"that's never been to a Superbowl."
01:04:56,580;01:04:58,420;"The Browns. Probably someone like"
01:04:58,420;01:04:59,740;"no. Yeah, you're right. I think"
01:04:59,740;01:05:00,660;"it is the Texans."
01:05:00,660;01:05:04,500;"Uh, the Jaguars."
01:05:04,500;01:05:07,220;"No, they never does it."
01:05:07,220;01:05:11,540;"The Browns jags lines Texans."
01:05:11,540;01:05:12,220;"Okay."
01:05:12,780;01:05:13,780;"Brown's Jack's."
01:05:13,780;01:05:18,260;"Yeah, Brown's like, they were good though, when the NFL started, you know?"
01:05:18,260;01:05:20,900;"Yeah, the list of teams it's never won is pretty long."
01:05:20,900;01:05:25,580;"Bangles, bills, Browns, Cardinals, Chargers, Falcons, Jack's, Lions, Panthers, Texans,"
01:05:25,580;01:05:28,380;"Titans, Vikings."
01:05:28,380;01:05:32,660;"Vikings were the first team to make it to four Super Bowls."
01:05:32,660;01:05:35,020;"They're also the first team to lose four Super Bowls."
01:05:35,020;01:05:36,500;"Mmm."
01:05:36,500;01:05:37,420;"It's tough."
01:05:37,420;01:05:39,260;"The bills would like a word."
01:05:39,260;01:05:40,260;"Yeah."
01:05:40,260;01:05:43,540;"- Hold on a second. - Hold on a second."
01:05:43,540;01:05:45,060;"- Those did it more efficiently."
01:05:45,060;01:05:50,260;"- How do they even rate the games they watch?"
01:05:50,260;01:05:52,520;"(laughing)"
01:05:52,520;01:05:59,780;"- Today we're rating this from zero stars to one star."
01:05:59,780;01:06:04,780;"- How wide left?"
01:06:04,780;01:06:05,660;"(laughing)"
01:06:05,660;01:06:06,500;"- Yeah, God."
01:06:09,060;01:06:09,980;"All right."
01:06:09,980;01:06:12,660;"So do you want to do some best and worst?"
01:06:12,660;01:06:13,820;"Sure."
01:06:13,820;01:06:14,420;"All right."
01:06:14,420;01:06:15,700;"Greg, you want to go first?"
01:06:15,700;01:06:16,200;"No."
01:06:16,200;01:06:19,260;"[LAUGHTER]"
01:06:19,260;01:06:21,100;"I'm going to fucking slow play my hand here"
01:06:21,100;01:06:22,420;"and see what you guys come up with."
01:06:22,420;01:06:24,340;"I'm going to ask you that every week, though."
01:06:24,340;01:06:27,300;"Steve, you want to go first?"
01:06:27,300;01:06:28,180;"Sure."
01:06:28,180;01:06:29,940;"Sure."
01:06:29,940;01:06:31,340;"I don't really have any worse."
01:06:31,340;01:06:33,460;"That's why I thought this game was good."
01:06:33,460;01:06:35,340;"OK."
01:06:35,340;01:06:36,780;"I have a couple of best, though."
01:06:36,780;01:06:37,260;"Did you see--"
01:06:37,260;01:06:37,760;"OK."
01:06:37,760;01:06:40,340;"you're the only one who's gonna know this because you're the only one who watched it."
01:06:40,340;01:06:42,600;"But when they're coming in at a commercial,"
01:06:42,600;01:06:44,080;"doesn't see that guy dressed as a pilgrim."
01:06:44,080;01:06:47,240;"He's just bad."
01:06:47,240;01:06:52,280;"He's like pointing and you can see like three inches of his stomach sticking out."
01:06:52,280;01:06:53,640;"Oh, fuck yeah."
01:06:53,640;01:06:55,720;"It made America baby."
01:06:55,720;01:07:00,000;"Yeah, no, that definitely made Greg Gumbel and Phillips him speechless."
01:07:00,000;01:07:04,320;"Like they, they, they couldn't run with that at all."
01:07:04,320;01:07:07,560;"There was also, there was also another fan that had"
01:07:07,560;01:07:09,120;"a full size turkey costume."
01:07:09,120;01:07:14,860;"Yeah, we get that like an adult size turkey costume."
01:07:14,860;01:07:15,440;"You made it."
01:07:15,440;01:07:16,640;"The trial."
01:07:16,640;01:07:17,480;"It looked homemade."
01:07:17,480;01:07:19,140;"You might be right."
01:07:19,140;01:07:24,640;"These are lady in the lion print like jacket with a lion, like a real"
01:07:24,640;01:07:27,320;"lion on her head, not a real island, but like a stuffed lion on her head that had"
01:07:27,320;01:07:28,160;"a bow on its head."
01:07:28,160;01:07:29,720;"Which one?"
01:07:29,720;01:07:32,320;"I feel like there was multiple of those."
01:07:32,320;01:07:33,680;"The lion on her head."
01:07:35,400;01:07:37,320;"And she was wearing like a lion print."
01:07:37,320;01:07:38,840;"It was ridiculous."
01:07:38,840;01:07:41,200;"Yeah, there was a lot of lines for sure."
01:07:41,200;01:07:43,280;"No, for sure."
01:07:43,280;01:07:48,120;"But my best best is obviously, I tried to edit the Wikipedia"
01:07:48,120;01:07:48,480;"for this."
01:07:48,480;01:07:50,600;"I couldn't figure out how to do it."
01:07:50,600;01:07:53,680;"They probably like blocked me out, but under Troy Brown's"
01:07:53,680;01:07:57,000;"accomplishment section, it doesn't list the 2002 All Iron"
01:07:57,000;01:07:58,240;"Award winner."
01:07:58,240;01:08:01,680;"And I would like to correct that if we can."
01:08:01,680;01:08:06,960;"So yeah, so I guess Greg Gumbel and Phil Simms were giving away a trophy."
01:08:06,960;01:08:10,320;"And I got excited until they showed the trophy."
01:08:10,320;01:08:15,160;"And it was a block a block of wood with an old school iron on top of it."
01:08:15,160;01:08:17,080;"Yeah, like the monopoly piece iron."
01:08:17,080;01:08:17,640;"Yeah."
01:08:17,640;01:08:17,720;"Yeah."
01:08:17,720;01:08:18,200;"Fuck."
01:08:18,200;01:08:18,680;"Yeah, dude."
01:08:18,680;01:08:19,880;"No, just go."
01:08:19,880;01:08:22,600;"Oh, well, let me get a new car."
01:08:22,600;01:08:24,760;"Everybody needs a trophy, right?"
01:08:24,760;01:08:25,160;"What are you?"
01:08:25,160;01:08:27,040;"Oh, no, Jesus Christ."
01:08:27,040;01:08:28,880;"Oh, you're only here."
01:08:30,040;01:08:32,680;"The trophy's not fancy enough. That's what you're complaining about it."
01:08:32,680;01:08:36,980;"Hey, we're with Troy Brown. I guarantee Troy Brown did what Bell check does with AFC Championship"
01:08:36,980;01:08:38,600;"trophy. Just like the end of the day."
01:08:38,600;01:08:40,600;"Somebody take this. Well, here's my problem."
01:08:40,600;01:08:41,960;"This is going to garage."
01:08:41,960;01:08:46,520;"CBS has given out a goddamn monopoly piece and Fox is over here giving out six-legged"
01:08:46,520;01:08:48,520;"turkeys. That's what I'm saying."
01:08:48,520;01:08:52,000;"That's what it was. Six. Well, are those two duck ins though?"
01:08:52,000;01:08:53,000;"Yeah."
01:08:53,000;01:08:56,760;"I think they have six legs, Greg."
01:08:56,760;01:09:00,140;"- Nah, Steve over here is fucking cooking a chicken,"
01:09:00,140;01:09:01,760;"trying to call it a turkey."
01:09:01,760;01:09:03,300;"You're fraud."
01:09:03,300;01:09:05,140;"- You're just jealous, you didn't get one of those fucking"
01:09:05,140;01:09:07,580;"turkey meat and stopping sandwiches for our things."
01:09:07,580;01:09:12,580;"- Go get one right now for fucking 598 at Target."
01:09:12,580;01:09:14,420;"- Yeah, it wasn't made of--"
01:09:14,420;01:09:16,340;"- Target, wrote this for chickens,"
01:09:16,340;01:09:17,820;"they saw them sh*t's everywhere."
01:09:17,820;01:09:20,860;"- How are you talking about sandwiches?"
01:09:20,860;01:09:24,060;"You got a gas station, right?"
01:09:24,060;01:09:24,900;"- Target."
01:09:24,900;01:09:25,740;"- Okay."
01:09:25,740;01:09:30,840;"- All right, so that's your best is the award that you won?"
01:09:30,840;01:09:32,700;"- Yeah, how would that not be the best?"
01:09:32,700;01:09:33,540;"- That would be the best."
01:09:33,540;01:09:34,540;"- That is cool."
01:09:34,540;01:09:35,880;"- That was gonna be my worst."
01:09:35,880;01:09:37,380;"- Was that the most-- - Was it the worst?"
01:09:37,380;01:09:38,380;"- Controversy."
01:09:38,380;01:09:39,780;"- Was one of them, no."
01:09:39,780;01:09:40,820;"- Trevor, I had a great game."
01:09:40,820;01:09:41,660;"- All right, I'm ready for--"
01:09:41,660;01:09:43,380;"- I think I just said everyone was like nine."
01:09:43,380;01:09:44,500;"- I'm ready for my Andy."
01:09:44,500;01:09:46,740;"- He did, yeah, the rest of team had eight."
01:09:46,740;01:09:48,380;"All right, let's hear it, Greg."
01:09:48,380;01:09:52,460;"- Well, my best is just the holiday of Thanksgiving."
01:09:52,460;01:09:57,120;"Can we all agree? It's the best one. Yeah, you don't have to worry about gifts or anything."
01:09:57,120;01:10:01,460;"All you gotta worry about is overeating. Yeah. And this football on all day. And you"
01:10:01,460;01:10:07,260;"just fucking eat a fat meal. Take it. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How do the lions fans"
01:10:07,260;01:10:14,620;"feel about it though? Because they every year. So I think the general feeling is that we"
01:10:14,620;01:10:21,260;"love it because we're on every year. That's true. Because it's like, it's, it's cool to"
01:10:21,260;01:10:23,420;"just have games on in general, right?"
01:10:23,420;01:10:26,460;"Like if you're a sports fan, you're like, football day,"
01:10:26,460;01:10:27,540;"this is great."
01:10:27,540;01:10:31,500;"But knowing that at least good or bad, again, right?"
01:10:31,500;01:10:34,180;"'Cause you're like, by Wednesday, you bought back in."
01:10:34,180;01:10:36,540;"So by Sunday, you're really in."
01:10:36,540;01:10:39,620;"And by Thursday, you're like, yeah, I'm good on Thanksgiving."
01:10:39,620;01:10:44,620;"So you're all in, and it's your team, and it's a holiday."
01:10:44,620;01:10:46,780;"There's food, like all that good stuff"
01:10:46,780;01:10:48,340;"is just amplified by the fact that now--"
01:10:48,340;01:10:50,860;"- And the game's not blacked out, I imagine."
01:10:50,860;01:10:53,660;"Yeah, but then doesn't like Mitch Trubisky ruin it for you."
01:10:53,660;01:10:57,460;"There. I mean, yeah, but it's always like no, the lines were to"
01:10:57,460;01:11:01,740;"for if you're in a room for Lions fans and you and you lose like"
01:11:01,740;01:11:05,540;"misery loves company and it's like a good like the Lions have been"
01:11:05,540;01:11:06,940;"bringing families together."
01:11:06,940;01:11:11,220;"It's like the 20s or whatever they"
01:11:11,220;01:11:14,020;"doesn't matter how bad right?"
01:11:14,020;01:11:14,860;"The mirror."
01:11:14,860;01:11:19,900;"So interestingly enough,"
01:11:20,260;01:11:24,860;"They played on Thanksgiving. The paths lines played in 2000 as well."
01:11:24,860;01:11:26,380;"Do you know that?"
01:11:26,380;01:11:31,260;"Brady Brady's first ever throw in the NFL was on Thanksgiving."
01:11:31,260;01:11:33,340;"Two thousand for three. Yeah."
01:11:33,340;01:11:38,540;"And then again in 2010, they played both wear and throw by throwbacks."
01:11:38,540;01:11:40,340;"Yeah, because I got this game confused."
01:11:40,340;01:11:43,740;"I was like, this is going to be a ball because I had remembered the 2010 one."
01:11:43,740;01:11:47,140;"That was like 30 something to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah."
01:11:47,140;01:11:49,820;"And then 2012 was the bot fumble."
01:11:49,820;01:11:54,620;"Those are the four times the paths have played Thanksgiving 2010 wasn't that"
01:11:54,620;01:11:57,940;"Wasn't that the year?"
01:11:57,940;01:12:00,140;"The Patriots clinched the division"
01:12:00,140;01:12:03,500;"On Thanksgiving"
01:12:03,500;01:12:05,500;"And there was one Thanksgiving"
01:12:05,500;01:12:13,740;"Probably 2007 I'm mad at my minute, but I remember they clinched on Thanksgiving they clinched division Wow"
01:12:13,740;01:12:19,740;"Yeah, maybe it was 2010. I think they're pretty good that year. Yeah, that's something that may have been there 14 to"
01:12:19,740;01:12:26,900;"I just remember one Thanksgiving game where I feel like it was a later game because I remember the first bit of it"
01:12:26,900;01:12:31,620;"When dad got that electric wine cooler and we tried to like drink the bag wine to make it fit in there"
01:12:31,620;01:12:37,580;"And then someone got in a fight and I was I was all amped up and mom was mad at me"
01:12:37,580;01:12:44,460;"That's all I'm pretty sure that was Thanksgiving might have been Christmas probably not Christmas. I don't know some sort of big"
01:12:44,460;01:12:47,980;"No, I'm pretty sure I was Thanksgiving. Yeah, I remember those that was last year Steve"
01:12:47,980;01:12:50,740;"(laughing)"
01:12:50,740;01:12:52,100;"- And the year before."
01:12:52,100;01:12:54,340;"- Yeah, that was an every year before."
01:12:54,340;01:12:56,900;"- We gotta stop getting dad electric line coolers."
01:12:56,900;01:12:59,660;"- We gotta stop getting you bags of wine."
01:12:59,660;01:13:00,940;"- Who's is?"
01:13:00,940;01:13:02,340;"- It's all dad's fault."
01:13:02,340;01:13:04,380;"- That feels my right."
01:13:04,380;01:13:06,700;"- All right, so my worst,"
01:13:06,700;01:13:10,700;"I'm looking through this article of Marty Morningway"
01:13:10,700;01:13:12,540;"getting suspended at college."
01:13:12,540;01:13:14,060;"This is 1983."
01:13:14,060;01:13:16,420;"I'm gonna look at some of the advertisements."
01:13:16,420;01:13:21,420;"an RCA like block TV 25-inch or 600 bucks."
01:13:21,420;01:13:24,700;"- For how big a TV?"
01:13:24,700;01:13:26,420;"- 600 bucks dude for a TV."
01:13:26,420;01:13:27,620;"That's like a fucking--"
01:13:27,620;01:13:28,540;"- 25 inch."
01:13:28,540;01:13:29,700;"(laughing)"
01:13:29,700;01:13:31,540;"- That's a 25 inches dude."
01:13:31,540;01:13:34,820;"I was expecting to see prices be like super low,"
01:13:34,820;01:13:36,540;"but everything's wicked expensive."
01:13:36,540;01:13:39,700;"Do you know how technology works?"
01:13:39,700;01:13:40,700;"- Yeah, what a nerd."
01:13:40,700;01:13:42,340;"- That's exactly how it works."
01:13:43,380;01:13:50,700;"$839 for 25 inch. What that's not even true, Andy. Fucking iPhones are still going up."
01:13:50,700;01:13:52,300;"Yeah, but they're good."
01:13:52,300;01:13:58,380;"Us more every year. Okay, Andy, explain to me how technology works. Okay. It's the fucking"
01:13:58,380;01:14:03,980;"hot pants. Bro, I've seen you try to work technology. It's your beyond help. All right."
01:14:03,980;01:14:05,020;"Go fuck yourself."
01:14:05,020;01:14:09,820;"All right."
01:14:09,820;01:14:14,300;"My best was"
01:14:14,300;01:14:19,620;"the referee in this game who had a black guy in 12 stitches"
01:14:19,620;01:14:25,100;"from getting lit up the week before in pregame and you had to miss the game"
01:14:25,100;01:14:27,340;"because he was getting 12 stitches and a black guy."
01:14:27,340;01:14:31,580;"I thought that was a ridiculous way to get hurt or get 12 stitches."
01:14:31,580;01:14:33,260;"We got hit."
01:14:33,260;01:14:34,260;"in pre game."
01:14:34,260;01:14:35,580;">> I'm not going to run into it or something."
01:14:35,580;01:14:36,580;"Yeah, in pre game."
01:14:36,580;01:14:37,580;">> Before the game."
01:14:37,580;01:14:40,460;">> It's like the worst referee injury."
01:14:40,460;01:14:44,580;"I can't remember any like, yeah, referees really getting jacked up."
01:14:44,580;01:14:45,580;">> Yeah."
01:14:45,580;01:14:50,900;">> Since we actually haven't talked about this game, I'm going to throw out some other"
01:14:50,900;01:14:55,540;"best which were Teddy Bruce game is pick six."
01:14:55,540;01:14:57,580;"And I think I asked right."
01:14:57,580;01:15:02,860;"I want to put out the point that Teddy Bruce you probably has the best hands out of any"
01:15:02,860;01:15:04,520;"NFL player who wore neck roll."
01:15:04,520;01:15:07,760;"Hmm."
01:15:07,760;01:15:11,620;"Because he makes some quality catches across the middle."
01:15:11,620;01:15:14,220;"That was the second pick six of the year."
01:15:14,220;01:15:16,340;"It was Zach Thomas."
01:15:16,340;01:15:18,140;"Oh, Zach Thomas."
01:15:18,140;01:15:19,060;"Where are Nick?"
01:15:19,060;01:15:20,740;"Yeah. Oh, yeah."
01:15:20,740;01:15:21,980;"Actually, yeah, I did."
01:15:21,980;01:15:23,580;"But let's see."
01:15:23,580;01:15:24,940;"I'm going to career interceptions."
01:15:24,940;01:15:25,500;"Yeah."
01:15:25,500;01:15:27,180;"How many pick six does he have?"
01:15:27,180;01:15:30,740;"Because this was the very stereotypical Bruce G."
01:15:30,740;01:15:32,420;"How many Bruce do you have?"
01:15:32,420;01:15:33,780;"What about some full back risk?"
01:15:33,780;01:15:35,780;"You had like four in three years."
01:15:35,780;01:15:37,060;"I mean, we talk about this."
01:15:37,060;01:15:38,180;"Yeah, six."
01:15:38,180;01:15:39,700;"You want to do you want to guess?"
01:15:39,700;01:15:40,860;"Nick roles."
01:15:40,860;01:15:41,780;"Yeah, back to guess."
01:15:41,780;01:15:43,500;"Zach Thomas is career."
01:15:43,500;01:15:46,700;"Continue and I'm going to say like eight."
01:15:46,700;01:15:47,900;"Yeah."
01:15:47,900;01:15:48,420;"Pick six."
01:15:48,420;01:15:50,860;"Andy, no, just interceptions."
01:15:50,860;01:15:51,700;"Oh, interception."
01:15:51,700;01:15:51,980;"I don't know."
01:15:51,980;01:15:54,300;"Yeah, probably like eight or 10."
01:15:54,300;01:15:55,780;"17."
01:15:55,780;01:15:57,420;"Hey, how many interceptions does Teddy have?"
01:15:57,420;01:15:59,620;"Because we just talked to pick six and say that's true."
01:15:59,620;01:16:00,380;"Yeah."
01:16:00,380;01:16:00,580;"Yeah."
01:16:00,580;01:16:01,980;"How many of those are for touchdowns?"
01:16:01,980;01:16:04,700;"None because he's on the fucking I never know how to spell Bruce"
01:16:04,700;01:16:09,060;"BRE W. S. K. I like my new"
01:16:09,060;01:16:15,260;"I stack still can't look at what is it? B. R. U. No"
01:16:15,260;01:16:19,340;"Fuck fuck me dude"
01:16:19,340;01:16:24,860;"Oh, but that's spelly"
01:16:26,540;01:16:30,140;"Well, best stands in the neck roll."
01:16:30,140;01:16:31,740;"Fuckin' Zach Thomas."
01:16:31,740;01:16:33,100;"Are you happy now, Greg?"
01:16:33,100;01:16:34,700;"You should have gone teddy-brisky."
01:16:34,700;01:16:36,060;"Yeah, how dare you?"
01:16:36,060;01:16:38,060;"Man, it had a hole in his harness looking back and play football."
01:16:38,060;01:16:39,500;"You're going to shit on him for this?"
01:16:39,500;01:16:40,580;"Cool."
01:16:40,580;01:16:44,340;"Well, anyways, back to people getting hurt in pregame."
01:16:44,340;01:16:49,860;"I was watching Quentin Nelson, the guy for the Colts."
01:16:49,860;01:16:50,340;"Yeah."
01:16:50,340;01:16:50,700;"Oh, yeah."
01:16:50,700;01:16:52,620;"It's like Top 100 thing."
01:16:52,620;01:16:54,580;"There was like in pregame, there was the punter,"
01:16:54,580;01:16:56,620;"like just practicing and it like hit it."
01:16:56,620;01:17:01,300;"He hit a couple of neuro and then so Nelson like grabs the ball"
01:17:01,300;01:17:05,300;"and punts it like 60 rows deep and then goes up into the punters face"
01:17:05,300;01:17:06,500;"is like you fucking do that again."
01:17:06,500;01:17:08,140;"I'll kill you."
01:17:08,140;01:17:09,820;"Who is Nelson is?"
01:17:09,820;01:17:11,100;"Who is not?"
01:17:11,100;01:17:13,300;"Is a psychopath man."
01:17:13,300;01:17:14,500;"I love that guy."
01:17:14,500;01:17:15,500;"Yeah."
01:17:15,500;01:17:21,140;"I wanted to get that story in and you'd already moved on."
01:17:21,140;01:17:23,580;"So I just want to start interrupt."
01:17:23,580;01:17:29,160;"Um, my worst is probably the pages getting a pump blocked."
01:17:29,160;01:17:31,160;"That was ugly."
01:17:31,160;01:17:31,860;"Yeah."
01:17:31,860;01:17:36,300;"And that was the first punt block of the lion season."
01:17:36,300;01:17:40,240;"And also lines wasted it anyways though."
01:17:40,240;01:17:41,200;"They did."
01:17:41,200;01:17:42,300;"They wasted a lot of things."
01:17:42,300;01:17:43,840;"I don't even think they got a field goal in that one."
01:17:43,840;01:17:46,740;"Uh, don't believe they did."
01:17:46,740;01:17:47,040;"No."
01:17:47,040;01:17:52,020;"No, because Harrington threw a pick to a Willie McGinnis a couple of ways later."
01:17:52,020;01:18:04,140;"And then the other, this is in solidarity with Mama Brown, but Troy Brown out there, when"
01:18:04,140;01:18:06,900;"number 80 in the throwbacks, looked like Irving Fryer."
01:18:06,900;01:18:10,440;"And across my mind too."
01:18:10,440;01:18:15,660;"And the whole Patriots offense looked like an Irving Fryer led Patriots offense where"
01:18:15,660;01:18:18,460;"he was literally the only thing going for them."
01:18:18,460;01:18:20,460;"Because he had ten catches for"
01:18:20,460;01:18:27,180;"It was like a hundred something yards and the 111 I think yeah, and the rest of the eight catches combined"
01:18:27,180;01:18:33,440;"So it was one being a tip ball to patent right that was intended for"
01:18:33,440;01:18:36,460;"of course"
01:18:36,460;01:18:38,460;"so"
01:18:38,460;01:18:42,100;"That was probably my worst I would say that or"
01:18:42,100;01:18:46,120;"James Stewart getting knocked out by his own teammate. Oh, yeah"
01:18:46,940;01:18:48,940;"Jeez, he's just piling the worst song huh?"
01:18:48,940;01:18:54,660;"Port Trevor come on. I got plenty of them. Dude one and a half fucking Lombardi Steve and he's"
01:18:54,660;01:18:57,680;"That's true. Tough man to police"
01:18:57,680;01:19:02,260;"It was not a great game the throwbacks dude. Thanksgiving"
01:19:02,260;01:19:09,460;"I was looking forward to this game now. I am on the opposite chain of I think most people"
01:19:09,460;01:19:16,060;"Do like the Detroit throwbacks and I think I think they look stupid. I've never been a fan. Yeah, they're pretty bad"
01:19:16,060;01:19:21,180;"Yeah, there's nothing to them. Yeah, they're not as green Bay ones. They're not as bad as green Bay"
01:19:21,180;01:19:25,180;"Yeah, I agree. There are some worse, but it's right"
01:19:25,180;01:19:28,940;"So I guess like yeah, they haven't changed the color scheme and then they kind of just"
01:19:28,940;01:19:35,940;"Gradually upgraded, but I just if there's something bad like you just you don't have to bring it back to history like just"
01:19:35,940;01:19:38,540;"Kind of leave it there like where something else"
01:19:38,540;01:19:45,420;"Like it's it's okay because like I get it if you look like shit probably play like shit"
01:19:45,420;01:19:50,420;"it's pumped up putting on like that fucking blue t-shirt."
01:19:50,420;01:19:52,380;"- Just like that pilgrim in the stands."
01:19:52,380;01:19:53,380;"I don't care."
01:19:53,380;01:19:55,380;"- There you go, just like Turkey's fucking."
01:19:55,380;01:19:57,140;"(laughing)"
01:19:57,140;01:19:59,900;"- There's not even a lion on their throwbacks."
01:19:59,900;01:20:00,740;"- No, yeah."
01:20:00,740;01:20:03,300;"- And back, well back when they had,"
01:20:03,300;01:20:06,020;"so if you look at like the evolution of the lion,"
01:20:06,020;01:20:09,100;"like logo, it used to be, there was a version of it"
01:20:09,100;01:20:11,020;"that's like super, super cool,"
01:20:11,020;01:20:13,100;"but I think the early, early version,"
01:20:13,100;01:20:14,660;"it's like really complicated."
01:20:14,660;01:20:17,060;"It went look good on a jersey."
01:20:17,060;01:20:19,860;"It's kind of has to be blown up to look good."
01:20:19,860;01:20:24,420;"- Well, anything's better than those fucking practice"
01:20:24,420;01:20:26,180;"or five football jerseys."
01:20:26,180;01:20:29,580;"- Yeah, those are just like, hey, Reebok, no budget."
01:20:29,580;01:20:30,860;"Send us what you got."
01:20:30,860;01:20:33,260;"Okay, we got these blue ones."
01:20:33,260;01:20:35,860;"- Are the numbers extra?"
01:20:35,860;01:20:36,700;"- Yeah, no."
01:20:36,700;01:20:38,500;"(laughing)"
01:20:38,500;01:20:40,940;"- They ironed the numbers on before they went on."
01:20:40,940;01:20:42,580;"- Yeah, our coach was just the,"
01:20:42,580;01:20:45,180;"Our coach was just the worst negotiator of all time."
01:20:45,180;01:20:48,100;"Who do you think are the numbers on?"
01:20:48,100;01:20:50,760;"Matt Millen."
01:20:50,760;01:20:52,140;"Barbara."
01:20:52,140;01:20:53,460;"No way guys."
01:20:53,460;01:20:53,980;"We're ready."
01:20:53,980;01:20:54,740;"My kickoff."
01:20:54,740;01:21:00,660;"It the best jerseys ever are the creams of gold box jerseys."
01:21:00,660;01:21:02,180;"They're up."
01:21:02,180;01:21:04,900;"They need to wear those again."
01:21:04,900;01:21:07,780;"They're all that logo is sick too."
01:21:07,780;01:21:08,300;"Yeah."
01:21:08,300;01:21:09,220;"Have the cable."
01:21:09,220;01:21:10,820;"We're looking to fire it."
01:21:11,180;01:21:16,700;"the wind swept bucket in a knife. Yeah, that's cool. Sweet."
01:21:16,700;01:21:21,140;"All right, Trevor, you got you got best and worst for this game?"
01:21:21,140;01:21:25,540;"We were some worse. That's fine. Well, the best was the punt block,"
01:21:25,540;01:21:29,980;"because I think those are like few and far between. And that was"
01:21:29,980;01:21:32,740;"almost returned for a touchdown. So that was cool. The worst was"
01:21:32,740;01:21:37,660;"actually the Bruce key high and T for for a touchdown. Because as I"
01:21:37,660;01:21:42,620;"I was watching like the highlights, whatever, the short version of the game, but you could"
01:21:42,620;01:21:44,620;"the lines had just gone down and scored."
01:21:44,620;01:21:50,060;"I think it was literally the it was our first possession."
01:21:50,060;01:21:51,060;"No, it was."
01:21:51,060;01:21:52,060;"Yeah, it was."
01:21:52,060;01:21:55,780;"It was like it was the second play from scrimmage for the lines."
01:21:55,780;01:21:56,780;"Yeah."
01:21:56,780;01:21:57,780;"It was a different."
01:21:57,780;01:22:00,020;"It might have been a different interception."
01:22:00,020;01:22:01,020;"Maybe it was that one."
01:22:01,020;01:22:02,020;"I don't know."
01:22:02,020;01:22:03,020;"I just think it any time."
01:22:03,020;01:22:07,100;"Honestly, any time you throw pick six, it's just such a momentum killer."
01:22:07,100;01:22:13,700;"get sucks. It's just it's such a shitty like that's how you start like if that"
01:22:13,700;01:22:20,700;"was the second play again that's how you started off. Yeah man that sucks. Yeah that's fair."
01:22:20,700;01:22:26,740;"And that's the best of the game probably Jason Hanson 4 4 4 4 baby."
01:22:26,740;01:22:32,580;"Oh I'm a famed probably working on his golf game on the sideline. I don't need to worry about kicking."
01:22:32,580;01:22:33,580;"I'm good."
01:22:33,580;01:22:44,740;"Well, all right, this has been fascinating for me to find somebody on the other end of the spectrum."
01:22:44,740;01:22:48,660;"From life, someone's got to live it."
01:22:48,660;01:22:50,820;"I guess I don't think you have to."
01:22:50,820;01:22:51,220;"It does."
01:22:51,220;01:22:53,300;"Maybe it's a trend."
01:22:53,300;01:22:54,980;"Really don't, but I don't know."
01:22:54,980;01:23:01,060;"You'd be surprised at like guys that just they have jump ship like early early."
01:23:02,020;01:23:06,260;"And then like, you know, talking like maybe like 10 to 12 years old or whatever,"
01:23:06,260;01:23:08,340;"they're like, this is enough is enough."
01:23:08,340;01:23:09,380;"They shift teams."
01:23:09,380;01:23:13,780;"They go go to college and then they moved to a different city and like, it's okay."
01:23:13,780;01:23:18,180;"They, no one knows your lines, you could for all, you know, you grew up"
01:23:18,180;01:23:18,780;"a saint's hand."
01:23:18,780;01:23:19,460;"Like it doesn't matter."
01:23:19,460;01:23:21,380;"Like those guys are good."
01:23:21,380;01:23:23,700;"And I just never thought that that was a possibility."
01:23:23,700;01:23:26,620;"I was like, um, I am, I am in."
01:23:26,620;01:23:29,260;"And at this point now I really can't change."
01:23:29,260;01:23:29,500;"No."
01:23:29,500;01:23:30,900;"Now I'm really invested."
01:23:30,900;01:23:31,540;"Yeah."
01:23:31,540;01:23:32,540;"Yeah."
01:23:32,540;01:23:35,140;"It's so cost fallacy, right?"
01:23:35,140;01:23:37,860;"Last year, me and our the coworker,"
01:23:37,860;01:23:39,780;"we bet on the Lions over and wins,"
01:23:39,780;01:23:42,620;"just so we could feel it a little bit, you know?"
01:23:42,620;01:23:46,700;"We'd be like 20 bucks down a Lions to win six games."
01:23:46,700;01:23:48,620;"And Stafford went down."
01:23:48,620;01:23:49,220;"I told them."
01:23:49,220;01:23:52,700;"I was like, guys, it's over."
01:23:52,700;01:23:54,580;"We are not-- this is--"
01:23:54,580;01:23:56,780;"we are fighting for yards at this point."
01:23:56,780;01:23:58,620;"Little wins."
01:23:58,620;01:23:59,420;"Do it the wrong."
01:23:59,420;01:24:00,980;"They went no one eight."
01:24:00,980;01:24:04,500;"That's so good though. We're like three and five like we're definitely hitting me over."
01:24:04,500;01:24:10,420;"Yeah. Yeah, they didn't know me. That's that's rough."
01:24:10,420;01:24:14,340;"Well, all right."
01:24:14,340;01:24:23,300;"What do we have to look forward to next week, boys? We're playing. I don't know. We are home against"
01:24:23,300;01:24:28,020;"the Detroit lines of the AFC East."
01:24:28,020;01:24:31,460;"Buffalo. Hey, got in one."
01:24:31,460;01:24:33,060;"Oh, speaking of which."
01:24:33,060;01:24:36,820;"Oh, is this the hat?"
01:24:36,820;01:24:42,540;"Yeah, it arrived."
01:24:42,540;01:24:45,020;"We got a shick-a-wing hat."
01:24:45,020;01:24:47,780;"I came over my headphones, though, this fucking thing."
01:24:47,780;01:24:49,820;"Give me the side profile view."
01:24:49,820;01:24:51,500;"It doesn't even look like a chicken wing."
01:24:51,700;01:24:53,300;"No, it's just like a turdish."
01:24:53,300;01:24:54,300;"It's racks."
01:24:54,300;01:24:55,300;"You know what?"
01:24:55,300;01:24:56,300;"I like that."
01:24:56,300;01:24:57,300;"I like that."
01:24:57,300;01:24:58,300;"I like that."
01:24:58,300;01:24:59,300;"Yeah."
01:24:59,300;01:25:00,300;"No, it's like a rocket ship, Greg."
01:25:00,300;01:25:01,300;"It's a rocket ship, not a car."
01:25:01,300;01:25:02,300;"30 rockets."
01:25:02,300;01:25:08,340;"Yeah, I think you're painting of a fucking rocket ship."
01:25:08,340;01:25:14,340;"So I think all the listeners at home are all going to have the same question."
01:25:14,340;01:25:17,060;"What does it smell like?"
01:25:17,060;01:25:18,580;"Does it smell like chicken wings?"
01:25:18,580;01:25:20,340;"Dude, well, I'll tell you what."
01:25:20,340;01:25:24,340;"of all, it's very poorly made. Like, really? It's one of those things where I could just"
01:25:24,340;01:25:29,060;"like rip this off and it was like, you know, like the phone. Like a nerve football. Yeah."
01:25:29,060;01:25:33,420;"So, and that's essentially what it smells like too, if you compare it to like a foam"
01:25:33,420;01:25:37,780;"football you found in your basement. It's starting to like deteriorate here. It's brand"
01:25:37,780;01:25:43,940;"new. I mean, I guess you get what you pay for when you buy a fucking chicken wing hat"
01:25:43,940;01:25:47,700;"from a restaurant and get it shipped halfway across the country. You bought that."
01:25:47,700;01:25:49,180;"like 50 bucks though."
01:25:49,180;01:25:51,420;"Well, it's bad Steve."
01:25:51,420;01:25:57,380;"All right."
01:25:57,380;01:25:57,780;"So."
01:25:57,780;01:26:04,700;"Yeah, I mean, that gets us in the mood for for the Buffalo bills coming"
01:26:04,700;01:26:05,460;"to tell me that's right."
01:26:05,460;01:26:11,260;"We thought we circles the wagons like the Buffalo bills."
01:26:11,260;01:26:12,980;"I love that."
01:26:12,980;01:26:16,460;"Is that is that a preview of you?"
01:26:16,460;01:26:17,300;"We're going to have some more."
01:26:17,300;01:26:19,820;"It was burnism for us."
01:26:19,820;01:26:25,460;"Well, maybe next week I might just do just be a Bells fan for the week."
01:26:25,460;01:26:26,140;"How about that?"
01:26:26,140;01:26:28,340;"I don't spice to the podcast."
01:26:28,340;01:26:29,540;"I don't."
01:26:29,540;01:26:31,380;"Well, one, I don't know if you can drink enough."
01:26:31,380;01:26:37,740;"Dude, I'm just going to get a fucking 36 pack of lobot blue."
01:26:37,740;01:26:38,620;"That's what I was going to say."
01:26:38,620;01:26:38,900;"Yeah."
01:26:38,900;01:26:41,500;"I'll blow that blue because I don't know if they sell it."
01:26:41,500;01:26:42,300;"North Carolina."
01:26:42,300;01:26:43,900;"I like what that blue."
01:26:43,900;01:26:44,420;"That's pretty good."
01:26:44,420;01:26:45,700;"That blue is a great fear."
01:26:45,940;01:26:49,300;"Yeah, it's just tough to find anywhere south of New York."
01:26:49,300;01:26:51,580;"I like icy lights too."
01:26:51,580;01:26:53,740;"I see light."
01:26:53,740;01:26:54,020;"Yeah."
01:26:54,020;01:26:55,620;"Iron, iron, iron, city light."
01:26:55,620;01:26:55,860;"Yeah."
01:26:55,860;01:26:56,380;"Yeah."
01:26:56,380;01:26:56,980;"The Steelers."
01:26:56,980;01:26:57,820;"They're not bad."
01:26:57,820;01:26:58,820;"Yeah, it's not bad."
01:26:58,820;01:27:01,700;"It's not good."
01:27:01,700;01:27:02,340;"It's not bad."
01:27:02,340;01:27:05,260;"It's not good, but it's it's like it's better than Miller light."
01:27:05,260;01:27:06,100;"And no, it's good."
01:27:06,100;01:27:07,940;"It's good tailgate and beer."
01:27:07,940;01:27:08,340;"Yeah."
01:27:08,340;01:27:09,340;"Yeah."
01:27:09,340;01:27:10,340;"Yeah."
01:27:10,340;01:27:12,300;"Oh, that's I don't know."
01:27:12,300;01:27:14,260;"We're kind of into this, but let's do it."
01:27:14,260;01:27:17,060;"Being a Lions fan, the tailgates are fantastic."
01:27:17,060;01:27:20,940;"Because everybody knows it's typically, like statistically, it's downhill from there."
01:27:20,940;01:27:24,820;"So the tailgates are pretty electric."
01:27:24,820;01:27:27,340;"I'm assuming the Browns the same way."
01:27:27,340;01:27:28,900;"I keep an around."
01:27:28,900;01:27:30,100;"The worse your team is."
01:27:30,100;01:27:32,300;"Maybe the better the tailgate."
01:27:32,300;01:27:33,820;"There's got to be a correlation."
01:27:33,820;01:27:34,340;"Yeah."
01:27:34,340;01:27:36,100;"You just tailgates aren't that crazy."
01:27:36,100;01:27:36,980;"They're not that awesome."
01:27:36,980;01:27:37,820;"No."
01:27:37,820;01:27:40,220;"That's true. Yeah."
01:27:40,220;01:27:42,060;"It's too much entitlement happening."
01:27:42,060;01:27:42,980;"Yeah."
01:27:42,980;01:27:43,540;"The game is."
01:27:43,540;01:27:46,440;"It's also probably like a blue collars city thing."
01:27:46,440;01:27:49,280;"Like if you think of like one LA tailgate,"
01:27:49,280;01:27:50,760;"it looks like I bet it's horrendous."
01:27:50,760;01:27:55,280;"Well, I bet Detroit, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, all those."
01:27:55,280;01:28:02,120;"I think I think those Detroit Buffalo tickets are probably cheaper to get."
01:28:02,120;01:28:06,700;"So yeah, definitely a wider range of people going to them."
01:28:06,700;01:28:07,400;"Right."
01:28:07,400;01:28:08,560;"It's kind of like an open."
01:28:08,560;01:28:09,400;"That's right."
01:28:09,400;01:28:09,960;"Yeah."
01:28:11,900;01:28:17,060;"To get more of the true people coming to the games instead of the the luxury class switch"
01:28:17,060;01:28:23,860;"As we know not great fans. That's you I need you final fucking nerds. I wish fucking nerds"
01:28:23,860;01:28:26,620;"fucking Joey Harry"
01:28:26,620;01:28:29,700;"Third down percentage"
01:28:29,700;01:28:38,740;"Free enough mean averages from correlations if you graph it out on your or your TI 86 you'll see"
01:28:41,020;01:28:46,140;"Somebody in the locker room. I don't know who but one of the veterans just had to eventually be like hey"
01:28:46,140;01:28:48,380;"What's the percentage of you shut the fuck up?"
01:28:48,380;01:28:55,020;"Yeah, no way someone didn't say that"
01:28:55,020;01:28:57,660;"how long do you last on"
01:28:57,660;01:29:03,980;"On on the lines because we could probably put five cents that's how long was Harrington there?"
01:29:03,980;01:29:09,420;"five six six seven years I think really oh man that's"
01:29:10,220;01:29:13,580;"to do the one no, no, it could have been that maybe five years max."
01:29:13,580;01:29:16,220;"Then he went because he went to the dolphins."
01:29:16,220;01:29:18,060;"I don't remember that."
01:29:18,060;01:29:20,620;"So maybe it was only four. Maybe we didn't resign them."
01:29:20,620;01:29:22,940;"It was four years. Yeah."
01:29:22,940;01:29:25,660;"Dolphins in that Atlanta and then he retired. Yeah."
01:29:25,660;01:29:31,500;"He actually played Detroit on Thanksgiving as a dolphin for, you said,"
01:29:31,500;01:29:34,860;"there was a Miami for like what, like two, two years probably."
01:29:34,860;01:29:36,540;"Just one year. One year."
01:29:36,540;01:29:38,860;"It started 11 games though, which is surprising."
01:29:39,660;01:29:43,220;"Started 10 games for Atlanta, too, which I don't remember all don't remember that. Yeah"
01:29:43,220;01:29:46,100;"That must have been the"
01:29:46,100;01:29:53,580;"Year before they drafted Ryan had to be right. Yeah, post Vic. Yep. Yeah"
01:29:53,580;01:29:56,100;"I would say those were the dog days"
01:29:56,100;01:30:09,300;"They by the way, I just listened to the episode the other day I specifically told you to cut the rape joke Andy"
01:30:09,300;01:30:12,560;"Yeah, this is that one too."
01:30:12,560;01:30:13,560;"It did."
01:30:13,560;01:30:16,960;"Well, I'm actually really you did it because I heard it last night."
01:30:16,960;01:30:19,480;"Yeah, I heard it too."
01:30:19,480;01:30:21,480;"The off-color one, Greg, you mean?"
01:30:21,480;01:30:22,480;"Yes."
01:30:22,480;01:30:23,480;"He's like, ""He's had a backtrack."""
01:30:23,480;01:30:26,480;"I cut the joke."
01:30:26,480;01:30:27,480;"Nope."
01:30:27,480;01:30:29,480;"No, not your redo version."
01:30:29,480;01:30:30,480;"Whoops."
01:30:30,480;01:30:32,480;"There was still in there."
01:30:32,480;01:30:35,080;"Well, that's good."
01:30:35,080;01:30:40,080;"I hope no one for my work ever listens as fuck."
01:30:40,080;01:30:41,960;"- Well, Greg fired."
01:30:41,960;01:30:42,960;"- So fucked."
01:30:42,960;01:30:43,800;"- So fucked."
01:30:43,800;01:30:47,080;"(laughing)"
01:30:47,080;01:30:49,600;"Greg's running for office in a couple of years."
01:30:49,600;01:30:51,360;"(laughing)"
01:30:51,360;01:30:52,200;"- Yeah, don't."
01:30:52,200;01:30:57,480;"- Oh boy, at least we're having fun, right guys?"
01:30:57,480;01:30:58,320;"- Yeah."
01:30:58,320;01:30:59,560;"- That's right, as well as life's about."
01:30:59,560;01:31:01,640;"- Everybody except Trevor."
01:31:01,640;01:31:02,520;"- Yeah."
01:31:02,520;01:31:03,560;"- Now I'll tell you what though,"
01:31:03,560;01:31:07,440;"I told Steve, I was like, so what can I expect?"
01:31:07,440;01:31:09,120;"And he was like, well, you know,"
01:31:09,120;01:31:10,720;"we're gonna kind of watch the game"
01:31:10,720;01:31:13,880;"or you watch the game prior, drink some beers,"
01:31:13,880;01:31:16,040;"and just talk about what it means to be a lion's fan."
01:31:16,040;01:31:17,640;"This is kind of like free therapy."
01:31:17,640;01:31:18,760;"This was good for me."
01:31:18,760;01:31:22,320;"I think I needed this August to just kind of level my head."
01:31:22,320;01:31:24,440;"And now I'm ready to go."
01:31:24,440;01:31:25,520;"- You ready to work?"
01:31:25,520;01:31:26,360;"- Yeah."
01:31:26,360;01:31:27,440;"- I'm all in."
01:31:27,440;01:31:28,960;"- That's for us. - I think this is the year."
01:31:28,960;01:31:30,760;"I think so."
01:31:30,760;01:31:32,880;"- It was like, yeah, they got to be running back."
01:31:32,880;01:31:38,000;"Swift Swift. Oh, dude, that guy is like fail guy from my work."
01:31:38,000;01:31:42,480;"That's like his his like nephew. The killing Georgia. Yeah."
01:31:42,480;01:31:45,520;"Yeah, that's not good. That's not good."
01:31:45,520;01:31:48,920;"Right. Yeah. What are his feelings?"
01:31:48,920;01:31:52,480;"Dude, why is that not good, Andy?"
01:31:52,480;01:31:55,560;"He's sad that the guy went to Detroit, I think. Yeah."
01:31:55,560;01:32:01,120;"So I always that I always wondered that like when I was a kid or not,"
01:32:01,160;01:32:04,280;"Not like more so now because now it's like, well, you get a job."
01:32:04,280;01:32:06,200;"You're getting paid millions and millions of dollars."
01:32:06,200;01:32:07,520;"Yeah, I think that's right."
01:32:07,520;01:32:11,680;"But when I was a kid, like I was always like, man, like people probably really"
01:32:11,680;01:32:12,760;"hate coming here."
01:32:12,760;01:32:15,320;"Like they're probably sitting over there like not to try not to try."
01:32:15,320;01:32:15,920;"Not to try."
01:32:15,920;01:32:18,240;"Fingers crossed just praying."
01:32:18,240;01:32:19,800;"It was like the gauntlet."
01:32:19,800;01:32:20,800;"It was like, fuck."
01:32:20,800;01:32:29,320;"Especially the guys that went to like Miami or, you know, like they have to be like, yeah."
01:32:30,240;01:32:36,240;"Well, at least so I think with Miami, if you play bad, you have built in excuses."
01:32:36,240;01:32:37,740;"Maybe they went out partying."
01:32:37,740;01:32:38,780;"It's a cool city."
01:32:38,780;01:32:41,100;"There's lots to do warm weather."
01:32:41,100;01:32:45,900;"You have no excuse, especially in 2002 with like Detroit."
01:32:45,900;01:32:49,340;"If anything, you would think like because there was nothing to do."
01:32:49,340;01:32:52,140;"The city was not great back in 2002."
01:32:52,140;01:32:53,840;"Now much, much better."
01:32:53,840;01:32:57,660;"Oh, to and it was peak just it was just run down."
01:32:57,700;01:33:01,660;"Like there just, there wasn't like a thriving businesses and stuff like that."
01:33:01,660;01:33:05,260;"And then it only got worse and, you know, riding up until '08."
01:33:05,260;01:33:07,540;"Um, might as well study the playbook."
01:33:07,540;01:33:08,060;"Yeah."
01:33:08,060;01:33:12,220;"You would think football nerd Joey Harrington would have been studying the playbook instead."
01:33:12,220;01:33:13,780;"I don't know."
01:33:13,780;01:33:15,140;"It was kicking rocks in the street."
01:33:15,140;01:33:16,300;"I don't know what it was doing."
01:33:16,300;01:33:19,340;"Maybe he was just studying the wrong place."
01:33:19,340;01:33:20,820;"You're studying the interception place."
01:33:20,820;01:33:27,380;"Well, it doesn't help when your coach draws the playbook in crayons."
01:33:27,620;01:33:29,620;"It got a"
01:33:29,620;01:33:32,820;"Songs lost in translation"
01:33:32,820;01:33:44,180;"Marty poor Marty I feel bad for I better make a pretty I don't feel that man"
01:33:44,180;01:33:50,900;"I mean, what else is he doing? Yeah, you probably joined us right?"
01:33:50,900;01:33:53,860;"He's he's still in the NFL"
01:33:54,500;01:33:57,740;"Yeah, he's an offensive consultant for the Eagles."
01:33:57,740;01:34:00,380;"Oh, that's right. Yeah. Cause that was it last year,"
01:34:00,380;01:34:03,780;"year before he was on the Ravens."
01:34:03,780;01:34:07,060;"Ravens, yeah. Yeah. Two years ago."
01:34:07,060;01:34:09,580;"Still stick around."
01:34:09,580;01:34:12,820;"Some did. That's what happens. You know, he foot in the door."
01:34:12,820;01:34:16,420;"A huge accent goes on 16 and he's still fucking kicking around."
01:34:16,420;01:34:19,300;"That's true. Yeah."
01:34:19,300;01:34:22,500;"We're talking 2002 failure and he's still around like that's."
01:34:22,500;01:34:23,060;"Yeah."
01:34:23,060;01:34:24,380;"- That's a massive stain power."
01:34:24,380;01:34:25,220;"- That is."
01:34:25,220;01:34:26,580;"- That guy, you know what?"
01:34:26,580;01:34:28,820;"- I'm kind of with you, Craig."
01:34:28,820;01:34:31,540;"Like we may be down pointing this guy."
01:34:31,540;01:34:33,900;"Like we're not giving him enough credit."
01:34:33,900;01:34:34,820;"I don't like."
01:34:34,820;01:34:40,500;"- Now, Matt Millen, there's someone that,"
01:34:40,500;01:34:43,340;"he's out of the NFL, right?"
01:34:43,340;01:34:44,860;"- He is, he's out of the NFL."
01:34:44,860;01:34:47,100;"He actually had a health scare a little bit ago,"
01:34:47,100;01:34:49,180;"but Detroit, there's, I think,"
01:34:50,420;01:34:55,620;"Two people in Detroit history that I think people will always,"
01:34:55,620;01:34:57,780;"always, always have a bad taste in their mouth."
01:34:57,780;01:35:00,540;"One was a governor who was really like crooked."
01:35:00,540;01:35:04,100;"He ended up going to, and it was Kwame Kilpatrick."
01:35:04,100;01:35:06,260;"And that I think made national news,"
01:35:06,260;01:35:09,500;"just like stole a shitload of money, stuff like that."
01:35:09,500;01:35:11,420;"And then the other one is Matt Millen."
01:35:11,420;01:35:15,820;"And there was a parade for when he was, he was fired."
01:35:15,820;01:35:17,820;"There was a legit, there was a parade."
01:35:17,820;01:35:19,580;"(laughing)"
01:35:19,580;01:35:29,300;"to celebrate some like there was two like people made tombstones it was like yeah I mean people were through the roof when"
01:35:29,300;01:35:35,240;"this fire it was I mean it was ridiculous I mean there was like people would have"
01:35:35,240;01:35:41,260;"fire million signs and people would chant it what would they write it on the paper"
01:35:41,260;01:35:45,180;"bags if they were wherever they're heading yeah and it got so bad that if if you were"
01:35:45,180;01:35:48,980;"caught having it going into the stadium they would take it away from you like"
01:35:48,980;01:35:54,180;"He was just that that was part of the culture that was it was just toxic like the whole thing"
01:35:54,180;01:36:00,700;"Right. Oh my god. Did this a fucking Wikipedia section the fire millen movement"
01:36:00,700;01:36:07,540;"Saying that at like a fucking"
01:36:07,540;01:36:17,240;"In Los Angeles that an NBA game between Detroit and the Clippers there was a chant started in Los Angeles fire map millen"
01:36:17,240;01:36:19,240;"Well, I"
01:36:19,240;01:36:25,960;"Came like fun like it. Yeah, it became a thing"
01:36:25,960;01:36:33,160;"But also like it was like haha, but like no, but seriously this guy's okay. We draft another wide receiver"
01:36:33,160;01:36:38,480;"I'm gonna lose my shit. I'm gonna say this is like yeah, I know yeah"
01:36:38,480;01:36:43,320;"Like you hear fire day and snide or like sell the team chance for like"
01:36:45,560;01:36:50,960;"It says that even Rashid Wallace started chanting it during a time-out and"
01:36:50,960;01:36:54,320;"I love she that's amazing"
01:36:54,320;01:37:02,760;"Yeah that was that was those the 04-05 pistons and they were they were pretty"
01:37:02,760;01:37:09,800;"good through up until like 2010 ish yeah and the Tigers were also good right"
01:37:09,800;01:37:17,800;"around like oh 708 up and through like 2014 ish right that that is sort of what got you through"
01:37:17,800;01:37:24,360;"like the lions just atrociousness and then the wings obviously in the early 2000s were"
01:37:24,360;01:37:31,640;"were really good as well so there was a lot of like balance now it's kind of in a period where"
01:37:31,640;01:37:37,880;"everybody stinks and i'm a little far removed because i don't i don't live in michigan anymore"
01:37:37,880;01:37:42,160;"obviously, but I just with no big 10 football, right?"
01:37:42,160;01:37:46,480;"So you don't have Michigan to bounce back on or Michigan State."
01:37:46,480;01:37:49,360;"They probably would they would be bad in football this year too."
01:37:49,360;01:37:52,600;"So that just kind of adds to the suckiness for out the state, right?"
01:37:52,600;01:37:59,080;"But it's just a depressing time to be a Detroit sports fan right now."
01:37:59,080;01:38:01,560;"Every team is just in the bottom."
01:38:01,560;01:38:02,600;"That's tough."
01:38:02,600;01:38:04,520;"That's tough."
01:38:04,520;01:38:06,760;"There's just nothing to look forward to."
01:38:06,760;01:38:12,360;"Um, I'm like Boston."
01:38:12,360;01:38:18,080;"Yeah, exactly where the, where the trouble of Travis experience it at work as soon as my"
01:38:18,080;01:38:21,240;"team is out of the playoffs, everyone's like, Oh, shit, what do you think about that?"
01:38:21,240;01:38:24,660;"And I go, it's, it's what do you mean, hockey's over is basketball season."
01:38:24,660;01:38:26,760;"What do you mean basketball or it's football season?"
01:38:26,760;01:38:27,860;"What do you mean football's over."
01:38:27,860;01:38:28,860;"It's hockey season."
01:38:28,860;01:38:31,360;"What do you mean baseball's over basketball season."
01:38:31,360;01:38:33,360;"You know, I immediately just pivot."
01:38:33,360;01:38:34,760;"You just go to the next one."
01:38:34,760;01:38:39,240;"Yeah, that like month and a half between Brady and Cam Newton, those tough times."
01:38:39,240;01:38:45,680;"It was almost didn't make it through to our next NFL MVP quarterback."
01:38:45,680;01:38:49,600;"I almost gave up on football."
01:38:49,600;01:38:53,720;"I'm in a group chat with."
01:38:53,720;01:38:56,640;"Well, Steve is in one of them."
01:38:56,640;01:39:02,800;"Our buddy Scott Kravitz and Grant Johnson, and they're all pretty big Boston fans."
01:39:02,840;01:39:17,420;"And every, it's like usually every three months, I have to like send this massive message just reminding them of how, how good their life actually is in perspective of the sports world."
01:39:17,420;01:39:21,700;"Boston sports fans have to be some of the most spoiled sports fans."
01:39:21,700;01:39:25,720;"There's in probably all of sports, maybe in the world."
01:39:25,720;01:39:31,820;"I mean, you guys literally took the, the city of champions."
01:39:32,300;01:39:37,180;"And it's when my girlfriend's from Pittsburgh."
01:39:37,180;01:39:43,860;"So when Pittsburgh claims, we are the city of champions"
01:39:43,860;01:39:46,620;"for this reason, this reason, this reason."
01:39:46,620;01:39:49,820;"And then Boston comes and literally it's almost"
01:39:49,820;01:39:51,100;"like a checkbox."
01:39:51,100;01:39:52,100;"But it's double all--"
01:39:52,100;01:39:54,540;"Oh, you have all the Super Bowls, we got that."
01:39:54,540;01:39:56,380;"Hockey, we have a Stanley Cup."
01:39:56,380;01:39:58,020;"You want to talk about World Series?"
01:39:58,020;01:40:00,700;"Yep, we just now won two of those as well."
01:40:00,700;01:40:08,900;"When you literally just take that and mute a city from a title, I can't think of anything"
01:40:08,900;01:40:10,940;"more disrespectful."
01:40:10,940;01:40:14,820;"I mean, that's impressive, right?"
01:40:14,820;01:40:23,860;"Like my favorite stat was that we beat St. Louis in the championship of every major sport"
01:40:23,860;01:40:26,300;"in America."
01:40:26,300;01:40:28,500;"until they beat us in the."
01:40:28,500;01:40:30,540;"Oh, Stanley cut."
01:40:30,540;01:40:31,300;"Even last year."
01:40:31,300;01:40:31,640;"Yeah."
01:40:31,640;01:40:33,140;"Yeah, that would have been sweet."
01:40:33,140;01:40:34,140;"Right."
01:40:34,140;01:40:35,740;"Wait, have we beaten the blues before?"
01:40:35,740;01:40:36,640;"We wait."
01:40:36,640;01:40:38,840;"Well, basketball team."
01:40:38,840;01:40:44,240;"Well, every sport that they they had."
01:40:44,240;01:40:44,780;"Yeah."
01:40:44,780;01:40:45,280;"Yeah."
01:40:45,280;01:40:47,780;"Like every major sports team that they had."
01:40:47,780;01:40:48,780;"Right."
01:40:48,780;01:40:49,820;"That's my that's my thing."
01:40:49,820;01:40:52,280;"The Pittsburgh fans were like, yeah, we're just done everything."
01:40:52,280;01:40:55,760;"And then also we have 17 NBA championship banners."
01:40:55,760;01:40:57,400;"and you guys already have a fucking team."
01:40:57,400;01:40:58,240;"- Right."
01:40:58,240;01:40:59,320;"- I could be a city of champions,"
01:40:59,320;01:41:01,200;"you know, like a goddamn basketball team."
01:41:01,200;01:41:04,120;"- And it's one reason because I've talked about that"
01:41:04,120;01:41:08,720;"and like Pittsburgh seems like the concept of basketball"
01:41:08,720;01:41:10,080;"is totally oblivious."
01:41:10,080;01:41:11,840;"They just, they're like, we--"
01:41:11,840;01:41:12,680;"- Oh, it's not a real sport."
01:41:12,680;01:41:15,280;"- No, like it's seriously like, I think if you talk to like"
01:41:15,280;01:41:16,840;"real like die hard Pittsburgh fans,"
01:41:16,840;01:41:21,120;"like they'll tell you like basketball is so distant."
01:41:21,120;01:41:23,080;"Like even like, I don't think a lot of kids,"
01:41:23,080;01:41:25,000;"they might grow up playing basketball,"
01:41:25,000;01:41:30,000;"But I think the winner sport that they focus on is wrestling."
01:41:30,000;01:41:34,680;"And I think that takes away from any major basketball"
01:41:34,680;01:41:36,160;"enthusiasm."
01:41:36,160;01:41:38,840;"And I think that's pretty unique to like--"
01:41:38,840;01:41:41,400;"I think that's how they closely relate to like Ohio."
01:41:41,400;01:41:43,480;"Because I think in Ohio, it's similar."
01:41:43,480;01:41:46,120;"But I think a lot of other East Coast big cities,"
01:41:46,120;01:41:49,640;"basketball is that dominant kind of winner sport."
01:41:49,640;01:41:50,640;"Yeah."
01:41:50,640;01:41:54,440;"And also in the winters, they spend a lot of time"
01:41:54,440;01:41:59,720;"having sex with their siblings so I can't discount that time spent you know"
01:41:59,720;01:42:04,700;"what? Stop the South Greg come on"
01:42:04,700;01:42:12,600;"it sounds to me you are wearing a hoodie right now Andy it's fucking 91 degrees in Virginia"
01:42:12,600;01:42:18,560;"nope it's 50 something in New Hampshire bro all right let's finish this thing up"
01:42:18,560;01:42:25,900;"I want to say that I am on this Thanksgiving day. I'm thankful for you to my brothers. I"
01:42:25,900;01:42:29,000;"Love you both"
01:42:29,000;01:42:35,300;"It was great meeting you Trevor. I hope we all have another great year under our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ"
01:42:35,300;01:42:42,960;"Amen what thanks guy always take thanks good seriously, Steve. Yeah"
01:42:46,040;01:42:46,880;"- Yeah. - Yeah."
01:42:46,880;01:42:50,460;"- I'm thankful your chicken wing hat finally showed up"
01:42:50,460;01:42:52,820;"and you didn't get built out of 50 bucks."
01:42:52,820;01:42:53,820;"- Yeah, me too."
01:42:53,820;01:42:55,940;"- Spending it to some random bar and buffalo."
01:42:55,940;01:42:57,260;"- I can't wait to smell it myself."
01:42:57,260;01:42:59,020;"- It does look like I got a wrinkly ballsacked in,"
01:42:59,020;01:43:01,700;"an orange wrinkly, I think it's not looking really like chicken."
01:43:01,700;01:43:03,060;"- Like the Chester Cheetos,"
01:43:03,060;01:43:05,820;"that's like Chester Cheetos ballsacked right there."
01:43:05,820;01:43:07,740;"- Steve, what do your balls look like"
01:43:07,740;01:43:09,900;"if that reminds you of a ball sack, but."
01:43:09,900;01:43:13,180;"- Big wrinkly, what do you mean?"
01:43:13,180;01:43:15,420;"- What do yours look like?"
01:43:15,420;01:43:18,180;"Well, for one, they're both about the same size."
01:43:18,180;01:43:19,140;"Yeah."
01:43:19,140;01:43:20,500;"Grand Canyon."
01:43:20,500;01:43:21,820;"Great, kid."
01:43:21,820;01:43:22,820;"A lot of folds."
01:43:22,820;01:43:27,900;"Greg, stop, stop stroking."
01:43:27,900;01:43:32,580;"It's got one big lump here."
01:43:32,580;01:43:33,820;"See this thing?"
01:43:33,820;01:43:34,320;"Yeah."
01:43:34,320;01:43:36,420;"Probably had checked out."
01:43:36,420;01:43:38,380;"But you must take kids there."
01:43:38,380;01:43:41,540;"Yeah, I wish you guys had an ad for some prostate, dude."
01:43:41,540;01:43:43,100;"That'd be a great plug-in right now."
01:43:43,100;01:43:43,500;"Maybe you guys--"
01:43:43,500;01:43:44,700;"Greg, you want a plug?"
01:43:44,700;01:43:46,980;"- Yeah, you wanna plug a press eight?"
01:43:46,980;01:43:48,980;"- You wanna plug the main."
01:43:48,980;01:43:49,820;"- What do you mean?"
01:43:49,820;01:43:51,220;"- The Buffalo bar that sat that to you?"
01:43:51,220;01:43:52,620;"- Oh yeah, then."
01:43:52,620;01:43:54,620;"- Oh, that's a good question."
01:43:54,620;01:43:57,460;"I don't think I even know what it is, if I'm being honest."
01:43:57,460;01:43:59,020;"(laughs)"
01:43:59,020;01:44:01,660;"- It took me like 20 minutes to find it the first time."
01:44:01,660;01:44:02,820;"- Wings are us."
01:44:02,820;01:44:04,580;"- Yeah, but if you're looking,"
01:44:04,580;01:44:06,100;"weren't we saying we were gonna give it away"
01:44:06,100;01:44:08,060;"to like the best Buffalo fan?"
01:44:08,060;01:44:09,260;"- What? - Not about this."
01:44:09,260;01:44:12,900;"- Yeah, whoever leaves the best review"
01:44:14,420;01:44:18,740;"as a buffalo fan even if you're not a buffalo fan you can mock them with your"
